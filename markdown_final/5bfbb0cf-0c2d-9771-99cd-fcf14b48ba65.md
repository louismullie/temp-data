## Question

Mechanism of decreasing A1c besides the beta cell function?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mechanisms that lower A1c beyond direct improvements in beta-cell function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and whether A1c reductions can occur without beta-cell rescue. Then, I should verify insulin-independent mechanisms such as SGLT2 inhibition and alpha-glucosidase blockade. Next, I will examine insulin-sensitizing effects in liver and muscle, including metformin and thiazolidinediones. After that, I need to check glucagon suppression and the incretin axis. I will then consider weight loss and exercise effects, including the disposition index. Finally, I should review disease-modifying strategies like bariatric surgery and short-term intensive insulin, and synthesize which mechanisms are most impactful and evidence-based for A1c lowering independent of beta-cell function.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: type 2 diabetes reflects multiple defects beyond beta-cell failure, including insulin resistance in liver and muscle, increased hepatic glucose production, alpha-cell hyperglucagonemia, impaired incretin signaling, and kidney-mediated glucose reabsorption, so A1c can fall via correction of these non–beta-cell pathways even when beta-cell function remains limited or unchanged [^f6c56441] [^a2c6b9c1].

> I will now examine insulin-independent mechanisms, starting with SGLT2 inhibitors, because their mechanism is fundamentally independent of insulin secretion or action. By blocking SGLT2 in the proximal tubule, they increase urinary glucose excretion, reduce plasma glucose, and lower A1c by roughly 0.5–1.5% while also reducing glucose toxicity and indirectly improving insulin sensitivity, with additional natriuretic and weight-loss effects that may further aid glycemic control [^f5426ef1] [^4675402d] [^6a59c1d9].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability of SGLT2-mediated A1c lowering in real-world settings. Trials and meta-analyses consistently show sustained A1c reductions of about 0.5–1.0% as monotherapy or add-on, and importantly, cardiorenal benefits appear partly independent of A1c change, reinforcing that non–beta-cell mechanisms can be clinically meaningful even when glycemic effects are modest [^f5426ef1] [^2236b89d].

> Next, I should review alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which slow intestinal carbohydrate absorption and blunt postprandial spikes. They lower A1c by about 0.5–0.8% and reduce postprandial glucose excursions, thereby lessening glucose toxicity and potentially improving insulin sensitivity indirectly, again without directly enhancing beta-cell function [^41228ca3] [^3b3a9f69].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about insulin sensitizers. I need to check hepatic versus peripheral effects. Metformin primarily suppresses hepatic glucose production and improves hepatic insulin sensitivity, with modest effects on muscle, and typically lowers A1c by 0.5–1.5% independent of changes in insulin secretion, which is precisely why it remains first-line and can be combined with agents that target other defects [^dc925d15] [^f59065fc].

> Let me consider thiazolidinediones next. TZDs are potent insulin sensitizers in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, reduce intramyocellular and intrahepatic lipids, and can produce durable A1c reductions of about 1.0–1.5% while also improving beta-cell function metrics indirectly via reduced glucotoxicity; importantly, their durable glycemic effect is partly attributable to sustained insulin sensitization rather than direct beta-cell regeneration [^31a5a742] [^378390d3].

> I should confirm glucagon suppression as a distinct pathway. GLP-1 receptor agonists suppress alpha-cell glucagon in a glucose-dependent manner, reducing hepatic glucose output and postprandial excursions; this contributes to A1c reductions of roughly 1.0–1.5% even when beta-cell function is limited, and dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism with tirzepatide augments this effect and improves insulin sensitivity beyond weight loss alone [^30f237cb] [^5251844d] [^db4fb757].

> But wait, what if the incretin effect itself is impaired; can normalizing glycemia restore it. Intensified insulin therapy that lowers fasting glucose can partially restore the incretin effect and improve oral glucose–stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting that relieving glucotoxicity can unmask or recover incretin responsiveness even if beta-cell mass is unchanged, which helps explain A1c improvements with strategies that rapidly correct hyperglycemia [^361ae1b4] [^7c49b71f].

> Next, I should review weight loss and exercise, and I need to ensure I account for the disposition index. Weight loss and structured exercise improve insulin sensitivity, which reduces the secretory burden on beta cells; even when absolute insulin secretion does not rise, the disposition index (insulin secretion times insulin sensitivity) improves, yielding better glycemic control and A1c reductions of about 0.5–1.0% with exercise alone, with greater benefits when combined with dietary energy restriction [^e489dc43] [^30a463f7] [^574f2b81].

> Let me think about disease-modifying approaches that act beyond beta cells. Short-term intensive insulin therapy can reverse glucotoxicity and improve beta-cell glucose sensitivity, but importantly, it also acutely reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity, leading to substantial A1c drops; similarly, bariatric surgery improves insulin sensitivity in proportion to weight loss and alters gut signaling, with early diabetes remission often reflecting improved insulin sensitivity and beta-cell glucose sensitivity rather than restored beta-cell mass [^c40c46bf] [^9c6b9e61].

> I should double-check that I'm not overstating beta-cell independence where insulin is required. In advanced type 2 diabetes with profound insulin deficiency, insulin therapy is necessary, but even then, adding metformin, TZDs, GLP-1 RAs, or SGLT2 inhibitors can lower A1c via the non–beta-cell mechanisms above, reducing insulin dose requirements and improving metabolic profiles, which underscores that multiple parallel pathways contribute to A1c lowering beyond direct beta-cell enhancement [^a3f74b3f] [^f59065fc].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the hierarchy is clear: the most robust insulin-independent mechanisms are SGLT2 inhibition, hepatic insulin sensitization with metformin, systemic insulin sensitization with TZDs, glucagon suppression with incretin-based therapies, and weight loss or exercise that improve the disposition index; alpha-glucosidase inhibitors provide a smaller but clinically useful postprandial effect, and strategies that rapidly reverse glucotoxicity can amplify these benefits by improving the milieu in which these mechanisms operate [^f5426ef1] [^dc925d15] [^31a5a742] [^30f237cb] [^e489dc43] [^41228ca3] [^c40c46bf].

---

A1c can fall through **insulin-independent mechanisms** that target hepatic glucose production, insulin sensitivity, glucagon suppression, renal glucose reabsorption, and postprandial glucose excursions. Key drivers include **metformin's hepatic effects** [^dc925d15], **SGLT2 inhibitors' glycosuria** [^f5426ef1], **GLP-1–mediated glucagon suppression** [^30f237cb], and **weight loss or exercise** that improve insulin sensitivity [^574f2b81] [^30a463f7]. These pathways lower A1c even when beta-cell function is limited or declining [^4675402d] [^bd30be12].

---

## Hepatic glucose production (HGP) modulation

- **Metformin**: Reduces hepatic glucose production via AMPK activation, lowering fasting glucose and A1c by ~0.5–1.5% [^dc925d15] [^f59065fc].
- **Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)**: Improve hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduce HGP, contributing to durable A1c reductions of ~1.0–1.5% [^31a5a742] [^378390d3].

---

## Insulin sensitivity enhancement

- **Exercise**: Improves muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, lowering A1c by ~0.5–0.7% even without weight loss [^574f2b81] [^30a463f7].
- **Weight loss**: Reduces insulin resistance and improves glycemic control, with A1c reductions proportional to weight loss [^5bf98b4a] [^33b2e6fb].
- **TZDs**: Potent insulin sensitizers in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, yielding sustained A1c lowering [^31a5a742] [^378390d3].

---

## Glucagon suppression

GLP-1 receptor agonists suppress **alpha-cell glucagon**, reducing hepatic glucose output and improving A1c by ~1.0–1.5% [^30f237cb] [^22280987]. This effect is **glucose-dependent**, limiting hypoglycemia risk [^b9df23bf].

---

## Renal glucose reabsorption inhibition

SGLT2 inhibitors block proximal tubular glucose reabsorption, causing glycosuria and caloric loss, and lower A1c by ~0.5–1.0% [^f5426ef1] [^4675402d]. Their mechanism is **insulin-independent** and effective across beta-cell function strata [^9c4cd3c3].

---

## Postprandial glucose excursion reduction

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors delay carbohydrate absorption, reducing postprandial spikes and A1c by ~0.5–0.8% [^41228ca3] [^3b3a9f69]. GLP-1 receptor agonists slow gastric emptying and blunt postprandial glucose, contributing to A1c lowering [^30f237cb] [^22280987].

---

## Summary of insulin-independent mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Example agents/interventions** | **A1c reduction** |
|-|-|-|
| Hepatic glucose production | Metformin, TZDs | 0.5–1.5% |
| Insulin sensitivity | Exercise, weight loss, TZDs | 0.5–1.5% |
| Glucagon suppression | GLP-1 receptor agonists | 1.0–1.5% |
| Renal glucose reabsorption | SGLT2 inhibitors | 0.5–1.0% |
| Postprandial glucose | Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs | 0.5–1.0% |

---

These **insulin-independent pathways** provide clinically meaningful A1c reductions and are especially valuable as beta-cell function declines, enabling durable glycemic control through complementary mechanisms [^f6c56441] [^a2c6b9c1].

### Rationale and design of the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: a comparative effectiveness study (GRADE) [^b143f82d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Major specific aims

The relative effects of four commonly used glucose-lowering medications with different mechanisms of action when added to metformin will be compared for the following:
Maintenance of metabolic control, defined as time to primary failure with an A1C ≥ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), confirmed, while receiving maximally tolerated doses of both metformin up to 2,000 mg/day and the assigned medication;
The time to secondary metabolic failure with an A1C > 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), confirmed, requiring the addition of basal insulin for oral agent-treated subjects and intensification of insulin therapy for those assigned to basal insulin at baseline;
The time to tertiary metabolic failure with an A1C > 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), confirmed, requiring implementation of intensive insulin therapy with basal plus rapid-acting insulin, while treated with metformin, the assigned study medication, and basal insulin among those not originally assigned to basal insulin;
Cumulative incidence of diabetes complications, such as microalbuminuria; and
Other metabolic outcomes, adverse effects, and effects on CVD risk factors, quality of life, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness.

In addition, we will determine the phenotypic characteristics associated with response to and failure of the four different medication combinations and identify factors that determine the success and/or failure of specific regimens over time, including longitudinal mechanistic investigations of β-cell function.

### Targeting β-cell function early in the course of therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^998cd53e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

This report examines current perspectives regarding likely mechanisms of beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes and their clinical implications for protecting or sparing beta-cells early in the disease progression. In addition, it considers translation strategies to incorporate relevant scientific findings into educational initiatives targeting clinical practice behavior.

Participants

On January 10, 2009, a working group of basic researchers, clinical endocrinologists, and primary care physicians met to consider whether current knowledge regarding pancreatic beta-cell defects justifies retargeting and retiming treatment for clinical practice. Based on this meeting, a writing group comprised of four meeting participants subsequently prepared this consensus statement. The conference was convened by The Endocrine Society and funded by an unrestricted educational grant from Novo Nordisk.

Evidence

Participants reviewed and discussed published literature, plus their own unpublished data.

Consensus Process

The summary and recommendations were supported unanimously by the writing group as representing the consensus opinions of the working group.

Conclusions

Workshop participants strongly advocated developing new systems to address common barriers to glycemic control and recommended several initial steps toward this goal. These recommendations included further studies to establish the clinical value of pharmacological therapies, continuing basic research to elucidate the nature and mechanisms of beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and exploring new educational approaches to promote pathophysiology-based clinical practices. The Endocrine Society has launched a new website to continue the discussion between endocrinologists and primary care physicians on beta-cell pathophysiology in type 2 diabetes and its clinical implications.

### Β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes: postulated mechanisms and prospects for prevention and treatment [^199bf3a2]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

A variety of interventions including weight loss, insulin, thiazolidinediones, and anti-inflammatory drugs can improve β-cell function temporarily with improved glucose control, and these outcomes are certainly of value to patients. However, the limited number of clinical studies with appropriate protocols indicates that existing therapy does not arrest progression of β-cell dysfunction in T2D let alone reverse it, with the possible exception of gastric bypass surgery.

The group of experts identified areas for future research that would improve our understanding of β-cell failure in T2D, hopefully leading to more effective prevention and the development of treatment with more durable beneficial effects on β-cell function than is possible today. The goals of future research are presented in Table 1.

### Preservation of β-cell function in type 2 diabetes [^99b2e3f0]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available data on preservation and potential improvement of beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with use of currently available strategies and agents.

Methods

Using key words, we performed a MEDLINE search of the relevant literature published through 2009 regarding the effects of available agents on beta-cell function in humans with T2DM.

Results

On the basis of current clinical data, no uniformly effective treatment for beta-cell preservation has been found. Lifestyle intervention and early intensive insulin therapy appear to have some preservative properties on beta-cell function. Glucagonlike peptide-1 agonists, dipeptidyl- peptidase-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones result in maintenance and often improvement of beta-cell function during their active use; however, data on their ability to preserve beta-cell function when patients are not receiving active treatment are limited.

Conclusion

The continuous loss of beta-cell mass and beta-cell function is a critical mechanism underlying the progressive deterioration of glycemic control in T2DM. In light of the projected increase in individuals at risk for developing T2DM, strategies and agents aimed at delaying or preventing the progression and inducing a remission of the disease are needed. Future research on this topic should include comparative efficacy trials with washout periods incorporating currently available and novel medications and strategies for preservation of beta cells.

### Is the diminished incretin effect in type 2 diabetes just an epi-phenomenon of impaired β-cell function? [^7c49b71f]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Can the incretin effect be restored by normalizing hyperglycemia?

Assuming that the relative impairment of the incretin effect and the loss of GIP activity in patients with type 2 diabetes are secondary to the chronic hyperglycemia, the clinical implication would be that normalizing the hyperglycemia in these patients should also restore the insulinotropic effect of GIP. Højberg and colleagues set out to address this point by subjecting eight patients with type 2 diabetes in poor glycemic control (A1C levels 8.6 ± 1.3%) to a 4-week intensive insulin treatment with the aim of completely normalizing glycemia in these patients. The insulin responses to GIP and GLP-1 were determined before and after the intervention during a hyperglycemic clamp experiment. There was indeed a significant improvement in insulin secretion in response to both GIP and GLP-1 after glucose lowering, whereas no effects were found with regards to the secretion of both hormones after meal ingestion. However, a complete regain of GIP activity to the levels found in healthy subjects was not accomplished in this study. Furthermore, the observed improvements in insulin secretion were not specific to the actions of GIP but also affected the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 as well as the overall β-cell responses to meal ingestion. It is therefore difficult to fully ascribe these phenomena to the reversal of a specific defect in incretin signaling. In fact, a number of previous studies have demonstrated that lowering hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes can also lead to marked improvements of insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose and other secretagogues, probably mediated by the mechanism of β-cell rest. In addition, although glucose control was significantly improved by the insulin treatment in this study, complete normoglycaemia was not achieved in these patients at the end of the study (mean glucose concentrations 7.4 mmol/l [133 mg/dl]). Based on the analyses of our studies presented herein, both the incretin effect and the relative activity of GIP were still severely impaired in individuals with similar fasting glucose concentrations. Nevertheless, the studies by Madsbad and Højberg clearly demonstrate that reducing the hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes can also elicit significant improvements in the incretin effect.

### Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide improves beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes [^8ffe46f6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of these mechanistic biomarker analyses should be noted. Results were generated from exploratory, post hoc studies of Phase 2b clinical trial samples. Assessments of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity were limited by fasting sample collection. Additional prospective clinical studies are warranted to better assess mechanistic contributions of tirzepatide to improved glycemic control, including dynamic testing with glucose and lipid challenges to extend initial observations with HOMA2 indices. The potential range of insulin-sensitizing effects of tirzepatide may have been underestimated in this study, as more than 80% of subjects in the Phase 2b trial were on concomitant metformin therapy.

Overall, treatment of subjects with T2D with the novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, improved both markers of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity compared with the selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, dulaglutide. By decreasing insulin resistance, tirzepatide likely reduced metabolic demand for insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, diminishing ongoing beta-cell stress. Improvements in insulin resistance with tirzepatide 10-mg and 15-mg doses were only partially attributable to weight loss, suggestive of additional mechanisms by which tirzepatide improved insulin sensitivity to achieve substantial reductions in HbA1c. By both improving pancreatic beta-cell function and reducing insulin resistance through dual activation of GLP-1 and GIP receptors, tirzepatide has the potential to confer not only glucose control and weight loss but also to reduce disease severity to improve metabolic health.

### Effects of exenatide plus rosiglitazone on β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes on metformin [^923ed230]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

ROSI treatment for 20 weeks reduced A1C (−1.0%) similarly to EXE, but did so by different mechanisms. TZD caused a twofold increase in insulin sensitivity, measured as M/I during the euglycemic insulin clamp or the Matsuda index during the meal tolerance test. The improvement in insulin sensitivity was associated with the significant reduction in the insulin response during the meal tolerance test. Despite the reductions in insulin response, the disposition index during the meal tolerance test increased significantly (Table 2). Thus, in addition to its insulin sensitizing effect, ROSI also improved β-cell function despite modest weight gain, which was consistent with previously published results.

In metformin-treated patients, combination EXE-ROSI therapy reduced A1C (▵ = −1.3%) to a greater extent than either EXE alone (▵ = −0.9%) or ROSI alone (▵ = −1.0%). This greater reduction in A1C primarily was accounted for by a greater reduction in postprandial plasma glucose excursion after the meal (Table 2) with a similar decrement in fasting plasma glucose (Table 1). The beneficial effect of EXE+ROSI on A1C was due to two factors 1) a significantly greater improvement in insulin sensitivity (M/I during the insulin clamp) (Fig. 2) and 2) a significant improvement in β-cell function as measured by the disposition index. Although the amount of insulin secreted in response to glucose alone or with arginine during the hyperglycemic clamp was markedly reduced in the group receiving combination therapy compared with EXE alone, the disposition index of β-cell function was similar in the EXE and EXE+ROSI groups. This indicates that combination therapy improves insulin secretion as a function of insulin sensitivity. These improvements in glucose metabolism were accompanied by a decrease in weight in contrast to the weight gain observed with ROSI alone.

Although studies of longer duration and with a larger number of subjects will be necessary to examine the long-term effects of combination therapy with EXE plus a TZD in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled on metformin, the present results indicate that this combination improves both insulin resistance and the defect in insulin secretion.

### Β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes: postulated mechanisms and prospects for prevention and treatment [^65f3924c]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Two major pathophysiologic abnormalities underlie most cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D): 1) insulin resistance and 2) defects in pancreatic β-cell function. The current consensus is that both are essential components in disease pathogenesis even if their relative importance, the precise temporal sequence of events, and underlying mechanisms vary considerably in different populations and individual patients.

In October 2013, the Global Partnership to Accelerate Diabetes Research, cosponsored by the Endocrine Society and the American Diabetes Association, assembled international experts (see) to inform the global health research agenda by reviewing the state of the science and identifying pressing research needs related to β-cell dysfunction in T2D. The major issues addressed and outcomes of their discussion follow.

### Current issues in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. overview of newer agents: where treatment is going [^a2c6b9c1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Impaired insulin secretion (beta-cell), increased hepatic glucose production (liver), and decreased peripheral (muscle) glucose utilization constitute the traditional primary defects responsible for the development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus. beta-Cell failure, ultimately leading to decreased insulin secretion, is now known to occur much earlier in the natural history of type 2 diabetes than originally believed. Additionally, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes reveals other etiologic mechanisms beyond the classic triad, now referred to as the ominous octet. In addition to the beta-cell, liver, and muscle, other pathogenic mechanisms include adipocyte insulin resistance (increased lipolysis), reduced incretin secretion/sensitivity (gastrointestinal), increased glucagon secretion (alpha-cell), enhanced glucose reabsorption (kidney), and central nervous system insulin resistance resulting from neurotransmitter dysfunction (brain). Currently, the management of type 2 diabetes focuses on glucose control via lowering of blood glucose (fasting and postprandial) and hemoglobin A(1c). However, the goal of therapy should be to delay disease progression and eventual treatment failure. Treatment should target the known pathogenic disturbances of the disease (i.e., reducing the deterioration of beta-cell function and improving insulin sensitivity). In recent years, treatment strategies have focused on the development of novel therapeutic options that affect many of the defects contributing to type 2 diabetes and that provide durable glucose control through a blunting of disease progression. Optimal management of type 2 diabetes should include early initiation of therapy using multiple drugs, with different mechanisms of action, in combination.

### Improving glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes: stimulate insulin secretion or provide β-cell rest? [^96d96691]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by a gradual decline in pancreatic beta cell function that determines the progressive course of the disease. While beta-cell failure is an important contributor to hyperglycaemia, chronic hyperglycaemia itself is also detrimental for beta-cell function, probably by inducing prolonged secretory stress on the beta cell as well as through direct glucotoxic mechanisms that have not been fully defined. For years, research has been carried out in search of therapies targeting hyperglycaemia that preserve long-term beta-cell function in T2D, a quest that is still ongoing. Current strategies aim to improve glycaemic control, either by promoting endogenous insulin secretion, such as sulfonylureas, or by mechanisms that may impact the beta cell indirectly, for example, providing beta-cell rest through insulin treatment. Although overall long-term success is limited with currently available interventions, in this review we argue that strategies that induce beta-cell rest have considerable potential to preserve long-term beta-cell function. This is based on laboratory-based studies involving human islets as well as clinical studies employing intensive insulin therapy, thiazolidinediones, bariatric surgery, short-acting glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists and a promising new class of diabetes drugs, sodium-glucose-linked transporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors. Nevertheless, a lack of long-term clinical studies that focus on beta-cell function for the newer glucose-lowering agents, as well as commonly used combination therapies, preclude a straightforward conclusion; this gap in our knowledge should be a focus of future studies.

### Banting lecture. from the triumvirate to the ominous octet: a new paradigm for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^f6c56441]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance in muscle and liver and β-cell failure represent the core pathophysiologic defects in type 2 diabetes. It now is recognized that the β-cell failure occurs much earlier and is more severe than previously thought. Subjects in the upper tertile of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are maximally/near-maximally insulin resistant and have lost over 80% of their β-cell function. In addition to the muscle, liver, and β-cell (triumvirate), the fat cell (accelerated lipolysis), gastrointestinal tract (incretin deficiency/resistance), α-cell (hyperglucagonemia), kidney (increased glucose reabsorption), and brain (insulin resistance) all play important roles in the development of glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetic individuals. Collectively, these eight players comprise the ominous octet and dictate that: 1) multiple drugs used in combination will be required to correct the multiple pathophysiological defects, 2) treatment should be based upon reversal of known pathogenic abnormalities and not simply on reducing the A1C, and 3) therapy must be started early to prevent/slow the progressive β-cell failure that already is well established in IGT subjects. A treatment paradigm shift is recommended in which combination therapy is initiated with diet/exercise, metformin (which improves insulin sensitivity and has antiatherogenic effects), a thiazolidinedione (TZD) (which improves insulin sensitivity, preserves β-cell function, and exerts antiatherogenic effects), and exenatide (which preserves β-cell function and promotes weight loss). Sulfonylureas are not recommended because, after an initial improvement in glycemic control, they are associated with a progressive rise in A1C and progressive loss of β-cell function.

### A glycemic threshold above which the improvement of β-cell function and glycemia in response to insulin therapy is amplified in early type 2 diabetes: the reversal of glucotoxicity [^c40c46bf]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Alleviation of unrecognized glucotoxicity, with resultant recovery of β-cell function, could amplify the glucose-lowering effect of pharmacotherapy and contribute to the variable therapeutic response observed among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, clinical evidence supporting this concept is lacking. Short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) can ameliorate glucotoxicity and improve β-cell function in early T2D. Thus, for evidence of recovery of glucotoxicity-associated β-cell dysfunction, we sought to determine whether there exists a baseline fasting glucose threshold above which the post-IIT improvement in both β-cell function and glycemia is amplified.

Research Design and Methods

IIT (glargine, lispro) was administered for 3 weeks to 108 adults with T2D (mean duration 1.8 ± 1.4 years). Oral glucose tolerance tests before and after IIT enabled assessment of β-cell function by Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 and insulinogenic index/HOMA-insulin resistance. For each level of baseline fasting glycemia from 6.0 to 10.5 mmol/L, we modeled the difference in IIT-induced percentage change in β-cell function between those at/above the indicated glucose level and those below it.

Results

The relationship between baseline fasting glucose and the differential change in β-cell function was nonlinear. Instead, this relationship was best fit by a cubic regression model with inflection (amplification) at fasting glucose at 9.3 mmol/L. Moreover, baseline fasting glucose at 9.3 mmol/L also identified the inflection point at which nonlinear reductions in fasting glucose and 2-h glucose, respectively, were both amplified.

Conclusions

The respective improvements in β-cell function and glycemia in response to short-term IIT are amplified in those in whom baseline fasting glucose exceeds a defined threshold, consistent with reversal of glucotoxicity.

### Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide improves beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes [^db4fb757]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide demonstrated substantially greater glucose control and weight loss (WL) compared with selective GLP-1RA dulaglutide.

Objective

Explore mechanisms of glucose control by tirzepatide.

Design

Post hoc analyses of fasting biomarkers and multiple linear regression analysis.

Setting

Forty-seven sites in 4 countries.

Patients or other Participants

Three hundred and sixteen subjects with type 2 diabetes.

Interventions

Tirzepatide (1, 5, 10, 15 mg), dulaglutide (1.5 mg), placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

Analyze biomarkers of beta-cell function and insulin resistance (IR) and evaluate WL contributions to IR improvements at 26 weeks.

Results

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) 2-B significantly increased with dulaglutide and tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg compared with placebo (P ≤ .02). Proinsulin/insulin and proinsulin/C-peptide ratios significantly decreased with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg compared with placebo and dulaglutide (P ≤ .007). Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg significantly decreased fasting insulin (P ≤ .033) and tirzepatide 10 mg significantly decreased HOMA2-IR (P = 0.004) compared with placebo and dulaglutide. Markers of improved insulin sensitivity (IS) adiponectin, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-2 significantly increased by 1 or more doses of tirzepatide (P < .05). To determine whether improvements in IR were directly attributable to WL, multiple linear regression analysis with potential confounding variables age, sex, metformin, triglycerides, and glycated hemoglobin A1c was conducted. WL significantly (P ≤ .028) explained only 13% and 21% of improvement in HOMA2-IR with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide improved markers of IS and beta-cell function to a greater extent than dulaglutide. IS effects of tirzepatide were only partly attributable to WL, suggesting dual receptor agonism confers distinct mechanisms of glycemic control.

### Glycemic excursion minimization in the management of type 2 diabetes: a novel intervention tested in a randomized clinical trial [^abc8848d]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Figure 1
The different mechanisms of action for weight loss (WL) and glycemic excursion minimization (GEM). BG, blood glucose.

Further, reducing glycemic excursions may reduce glucose toxicity and insulin resistance. The term 'glucose toxicity' was originally described as a mixture of insulin resistance due to chronic hyperglycemia and hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction of normal beta cell insulin secretion. This may occur in a relatively short time (days) although most often it is discussed as a chronic dysfunction contributing to hyperglycemia through multiple mechanisms.

Therefore, we hypothesized that GEM would improve the primary outcome variable (HbA1c) and be equivalent or superior (non-inferiority) to an equivalent dose (6 hours of group contact) of conventional WL intervention, but superior to WL in regard to secondary variables (cardiovascular risk and psychological functioning). Since these interventions are based on different underlying mechanisms, we hypothesized that WL would reduce body mass index (BMI) and calorie ingestion more, while GEM would reduce carbohydrate ingestion and increase physical activity and BG monitoring more. Given the concerns that reducing carbohydrates might result in consuming more fats and worsening lipids, we hypothesized that GEM, compared with WL, would not increase hyperlipidemia.

BG feedback can educate individuals about the effects of their food and activity choices. It may also motivate them to repeat choices that lead to desirable BG levels. It can also serve as a negative feedback loop to activate choices that can correct out-of-control BG levels. Thus, we hypothesized that increasing the quality and quantity of BG feedback would improve GEM's effectiveness.

### Immunomodulatory interventions in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis revealing paradoxical dissociation between β-cell preservation and glycemic control [^bb6fb9c5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Treg expansion is transient, not sustained. Using deuterium labeling to track Treg persistence, Dong et al. provided precise kinetic data showing that Treg expansion peaks at day 7 after each 5-day IL-2 course, then declines substantially by 91 days post-treatment. The transient expansion lasted only 6–12 weeks after the last IL-2 course. This temporal profile directly explains lack of C-peptide preservation — beta-cell protection likely requires sustained Treg elevation over months to years, not the transient peaks (days to weeks) achieved with current protocols. The combination of high-quality mass spectrometry tracking, multiple patients, and long-term follow-up (104 weeks) demonstrated there was no evidence that combined Treg+IL-2 therapy led to preservation of insulin production, with C-peptide levels decreasing in all patients within the first 30 days despite successful Treg expansion. Short-duration immune modulation appears insufficient for disease requiring chronic suppression.

IL-2 may improve HbA1c through non-immunological metabolic pathways. The most mechanistically innovative explanation comes from Moon et al.'s groundbreaking 2024 discovery that low-dose systemic IL-2 significantly improved insulin sensitivity in obese mice through a novel neuro-immune axis completely independent of beta-cell function. IL-2 receptors are expressed on hypothalamic microglia (80–96% co-expression), and central IL-2 administration triggers hypothalamic microglial activation → POMC neuron activation → sympathetic nervous system stimulation → improved insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. The pathway enhances insulin-stimulated pAKT signaling in adipose tissue, increases Tregs while decreasing Th1 cells in fat depots, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8), and increases anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-10, TGFβ) — all via sympathetic signaling. Sympathetic denervation reversed these beneficial effects, confirming the mechanism. This provides a direct mechanistic explanation for improved HbA1c through enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity rather than beta-cell rescue. Supporting this framework, Shi et al.'s comprehensive review established that immune-regulatory cytokines directly regulate glucose homeostasis through effects on peripheral tissues — skeletal muscle glucose uptake, hepatic glucose production, adipose tissue metabolism — occurring completely independently of pancreatic beta-cell function. Clinical evidence showed TNF-α inhibition improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant subjects through direct metabolic effects rather than beta-cell preservation, establishing scientific precedent for cytokines acting as metabolic regulators with non-pancreatic mechanisms.

### Improvement of β-cell function in conjunction with glycemic control after medical nutrition therapy in newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus [^5bf98b4a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by both insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Insulin resistance is closely linked with overweight and obesity, and weight reduction through medical nutrition therapy (MNT) will ameliorate insulin resistance, improving glucose metabolism. On the other hand, the role of MNT in the amelioration of beta-cell dysfunction remains less clear. While beta-cell function is progressively impaired as a natural history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, sustained hyperglycemia will excessively deteriorate beta-cell function, and forced correction of hyperglycemia can ameliorate the deteriorated function. In this sense, beta-cell function will not follow monotonous decrease but rather be variable to some extent. Our previous pilot study of 14 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus suggested that beta-cell function could be improved together with glycemic control, weight control, and insulin sensitivity after MNT, even without any aid of antihyperglycemic medications including exogenous insulin administration. However, our previous study mainly focused on the change of beta-cell function after MNT in patients with considerably poor glycemic control; the study population was limited to patients with baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of 8% (64 mmol/mol) or higher, and the correlation was only assessed between beta-cell function and glycemic control after MNT. The correlation was not compared with that before MNT (i.e. at baseline). The correlations of insulin sensitivity and weight control also remained unrevealed. Furthermore, limiting the study population to those with high HbA1c levels would cause a statistical problem known as range restriction during the correlation analysis.

Our present study aimed to reveal the correlation of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity with glycemic control and weight control before and after MNT in patients with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus who started their treatment with MNT.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus: what is the optimal treatment regimen? [^d814d312]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus currently consist of insulin sensitizers, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, secretagogues, and insulin. However, the emphasis on initial therapy has been shifting from secretagogues and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors to insulin sensitizers such as metformin and the thiazolidinediones (TZDs). This article outlines the benefits of treatment with sensitizers vis à vis alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and secretagogues as part of a comprehensive treatment algorithm for type 2 diabetes. Secretagogues and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors effectively lower plasma glucose levels only, whereas insulin sensitizers reduce several important cardiac risk factors in addition to reducing plasma glucose levels. TZDs, in particular, are also beneficial for their ability to preserve or even rejuvenate pancreatic beta-cell function. The treatment algorithm has a layered approach, beginning with a combination of insulin-sensitizer therapy and incrementally progressing to triple oral therapy with the addition of secretagogues and, if necessary, the addition of subcutaneous insulin to maintain glycemic control.

### Improved glycemic control in subjects with atypical diabetes results from restored insulin secretion, but not improved insulin sensitivity [^ced1b266]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

African-American subjects often present with hyperglycemic crisis (diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hyperglycemia), yet subsequently are treated without insulin. The pathophysiology of this unique condition is unknown. We hypothesized that recovery from atypical diabetes with intensive insulin therapy resulted from a reversal of a defect in beta-cell function and improved insulin sensitivity. We studied eight newly diagnosed, antibody-negative African-American subjects (age, 34–56 yr) who presented with hyperglycemic crisis. Subjects were studied at baseline after overnight glycemic control and again after 3 wk and 3 months of intensive insulin therapy. Insulin sensitivity (SI) was determined from an insulin-modified, frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test, and insulin secretion was measured as the acute insulin response to glucose and to a glucagon stimulation test. Fructosamine and hemoglobin A1c declined significantly with intensive insulin therapy, and insulin requirements decreased over time. Both acute insulin response to glucose and the C peptide response to glucagon stimulation test improved by 3 wk (P = 0.02 vs. baseline), and improvements were maintained at 3 months (P = 0.02 vs. baseline). In contrast, the SI remained low throughout the study. We demonstrate that improved glycemic control correlates with a remarkable recovery of beta-cell function, but no change in SI.

### Treatment with the human once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 analog taspoglutide in combination with metformin improves glycemic control and lowers body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone: a double-blind placebo-controlled study [^5e1333c4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrates that taspoglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control in all treatment groups, compared with placebo. This magnitude of improvement in glycemic control observed with taspoglutide after 8 weeks (–1.1% decrease in A1C from a baseline of 7.9 ± 0.7%) compares favorably with that seen with other GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as exenatide and liraglutide. Both fasting and postprandial glucose levels were reduced by taspoglutide. Improvement in glucose control during postprandial as well as fasting periods is important for reaching goal A1C. Our data indicate that four of five patients treated with 10 and 20 mg taspoglutide once weekly achieved the treatment target A1C < 7% recommended by the American Diabetes Association.

In addition, in type 2 diabetic patients in whom metformin monotherapy had failed, taspoglutide treatment produced progressive, dose-dependent weight loss with no evidence of a plateau after four or eight injections at 8 weeks. The weight loss is consistent with published clinical trial data with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. It is notable that the observed weight loss occurred without any specific diet or weight management regimen.

The beneficial effects of taspoglutide on glycemic control and body weight loss were accompanied by a meaningful improvement of the proinsulin-to-insulin molar ratio. An elevation of this ratio is predictive of subsequent development of type 2 diabetes, and its decrease is considered a sign of improved β-cell function. In addition, the observed increase in postprandial insulin coupled with reduced postprandial glucose after taspoglutide treatment is suggestive of enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion. These results are consistent with the mechanism of action of the class of incretin-based treatments.

### Insulin sensitivity and beta cell function after duodenal mucosal resurfacing: an open-label, mechanistic, pilot study [^ef5a4f49]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The duodenum has been shown to play a key role in glucose homeostasis. Duodenal mucosal resurfacing (DMR) is an endoscopic procedure for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in which the duodenal mucosa is hydrothermally ablated. DMR improves glycemic control, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report changes in glucoregulatory hormones and indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function after DMR.

Methods

We included 28 patients on noninsulin glucose-lowering medications who underwent open-label DMR and a mixed meal test (MMT) in Revita-1 or Revita-2 studies. Inclusion criteria were a hemoglobin A1c from 7.6% to 10.4% and a body mass index of 24 to 40 kg/m 2. Baseline and 3-month MMT data included plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) concentrations. Glucoregulatory hormones, insulin sensitivity indices (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR], Matsuda index [MI], and hepatic insulin resistance) and beta cell function (insulinogenic index, disposition index [DI], and insulin secretion rate [ISR]) were assessed.

Results

Fasting insulin, glucagon, and C-peptide decreased significantly. Insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, MI, and hepatic insulin resistance) and beta cell function (DI and ISR) all improved significantly. Declines in postprandial glucose, mainly driven by a decrease in fasting levels, and in postprandial glucagon were observed, whereas GLP-1 and GIP did not change.

Conclusions

Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion improved 3 months after DMR. It is unlikely that incretin changes are responsible for improved glucose control after DMR. These data add to the growing evidence validating the duodenum as a therapeutic target for patients with T2D. (Clinical trial registration numbers: NCT02413567 and NCT03653091.).

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: the contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^2af25a57]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several clinical implications of the finding reported in this paper. Contribution of WL to the overall improvement of glycemia in T2D should be considered and discussed with patients who might benefit from understanding tirzepatide's mechanism of action and how WL associated with therapy might impact their overall metabolic control. They should also understand that improvement of glycaemia might not be driven entirely by WL, and losing weight is not a prerequisite for lowering HbA1c with tirzepatide. Other weight‐independent factors such as increased secretory response of beta cells and suppression of glucagon play an important role in lowering glycaemia. This analysis exhibits several strengths that enhance the robustness and generalizability of its findings. The study benefits from large and balanced sample sizes across groups and a broad spectrum of disease, including participants with both shorter and longer durations of the disease. Additionally, the inclusion of participants with insulin‐naive T2D, those on multiple oral anti‐diabetic medications, and those on insulin therapy further strengthens the study. Finally, the trials included participants with a range of BMI values which collectively contribute to the reliability and applicability of the study's findings.

### Β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes: postulated mechanisms and prospects for prevention and treatment [^a84609c9]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Looking to the Future

Marked variation in degree of β-cell loss in T2D could potentially be reconciled by adopting standardized approaches to quantification using area, volume, and/or mass in available pancreases. It would be enormously helpful to be able to measure β-cell mass in humans with noninvasive techniques. Many approaches have been and are being examined, as has recently been reviewed. One promising approach is to use fluorescent exendin-4 derivatives, which should bind preferentially to β-cells. However, a major issue concerns how much sensitivity and precision can be achieved by any noninvasive approach. A desirable goal might be the ability to measure changes in β-cell mass as small as 5% because such changes are expected to be important for β-cell function.

Given the difficulty of studying human β-cells, well-defined clinical phenotypes correlated with β-cell defects and/or noninvasive imaging or biomarkers defining proliferation and death in pancreatic samples could help elucidate the discordance between functional and morphometric assessments as well as help identify changes indicating early β-cell failure in high-risk individuals.

Standardizing methodologies measuring β-cell function and defining approaches for specific clinical questions may also facilitate cross-study comparisons. Currently, β-cell function is variably assessed using fasting indices derived from insulin and glucose values, dynamic testing with oral glucose or standardized meals, and responses following intravenous glucose infusions. Interpreting β-cell function in the context of glycemia and concurrent insulin resistance is critical in clinical studies evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Other features of potential interest include sustainability and durability of treatment effects during and after therapy.

### Effect of carnosine or β-alanine supplementation therapy for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0e19c987]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, we found that significant improvements favoring carnosine or β-alanine supplementation therapy were detected for FBG and HbA1c. However, no statistically significant effects were observed for HOMA-IR, BMI, fasting insulin, and lipid metabolism did not show statistical significance. Interestingly, HOMA-β values, a marker of β-cell function, were higher in the supplementation group, suggesting an enhancement in pancreatic β-cell responsiveness.

The improvement in FBG and HbA1c aligns with several proposed biochemical mechanisms by which carnosine and β-alanine may exert therapeutic effects. β-cell dysfunction is one of the key pathological features of T2DM and prediabetes, and β-cell damage is usually closely related to oxidative stress, inflammatory response and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulation. Carnosine is known for its antioxidant properties, which allow it to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce oxidative stress. This antioxidative capacity may protect pancreatic β-cells from damage, thereby supporting insulin secretion and responsiveness. Furthermore, by inhibiting the formation of AGEs, carnosine can not only prevent protein cross-linking and protect beta cells from direct glycation damage, but also reduce the inflammatory response triggered by AGEs, thereby enhancing the function of pancreatic beta cells which could contribute to improved glucose metabolism in T2DM and prediabetes populations. In addition to antioxidative effects, carnosine and β-alanine may enhance glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Carnosine has been shown to improve the functionality of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in muscle cells, facilitating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. This effect is particularly relevant to skeletal muscle, which is responsible for the majority of glucose clearance from the blood. β-alanine, as a precursor to carnosine, augments tissue carnosine levels and potentially amplifies these effects, thereby supporting enhanced glucose utilization and improved glycemic control. Although we observed an improvement in β-cell function in this study, this effect did not extend to lipid metabolism or other indices of insulin resistance. This suggests that the intervention studied may primarily target the improvement of β-cell function, with a relatively limited impact on broader metabolic processes. Considering these results, we propose that while carnosine and β-alanine may be beneficial in modulating specific mechanisms related to β-cell function and glucose metabolism regulation, achieving comprehensive metabolic improvements may require additional interventions that act synergistically across multiple metabolic pathways. Additionally, although Egger's tests identified possible publication bias for fasting insulin and HDL-c, the trim-and-fill analysis did not meaningfully alter the pooled effect sizes. This suggests that while selective reporting cannot be entirely excluded, its influence on our main conclusions is likely limited.

### Evidence-based consensus on positioning of SGLT2i in type 2 diabetes mellitus in Indians [^4675402d]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The SGLT2i selectively inhibit the SGLT2 receptors and reduce glucose reabsorption in the PCT, and thereby lower hyperglycaemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Furthermore, SGLT2i therapy results in persistent calorie loss that leads to weight loss, β-cell stress reduction and hyperinsulinaemia, increased insulin sensitivity and rate of insulin secretion. Consecutively, all these mechanisms continuously regulate blood glucose despite insulin resistance or β-cell dysfunction. In addition, SGLT2i may also be effective in the advanced stages of T2DM (when pancreatic β-cell reserves are permanently lost) due to their insulin-independent mechanism of action.

Place in Therapy

SGLT2i are the most recent addition to the T2DM management armamentarium. They have some adjunct advantages such as weight and BP reduction, low risk of hypoglycaemia, and reduction in macrovascular and microvascular events. Moreover, these drugs may also rectify some core defects like improvement in β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in T2DM patients. However, they also have several adverse effects, especially genital tract infections (GTIs), volume depletion, toe amputation and diabetic ketoacidosis. Pertaining to their potential advantages, several guidelines have placed SGLT2i in both monotherapy and combination therapy in the management of T2DM (Table 4).

### Β-cell function preservation after 3.5 years of intensive diabetes therapy [^8ac42081]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

We did observe more variability than anticipated for the primary outcome AUC C. This certainly limited our power to detect a between-group as well as an over-time difference in the primary outcome. Nevertheless AUC C seems to have slightly increased overtime, especially in the INS group (Fig. 2 C); therefore, our conclusions are conservative and well supported by the data.

The population in our trial is representative of minorities (43% African American and 38% Hispanic), mostly recruited from the county hospital system. This lends additional strength to these findings, as these therapeutic interventions were successfully administered and results attained in a patient population most challenging to treat.

Our study shows that it is possible to preserve β-cell function long after the initial diagnosis of type 2 diabetes if therapy is initiated in a timely and intensive manner. Instead of starting with diet and/or monotherapy followed by stepwise treatment escalation when failure is achieved, patients should be treated with an initial period of intensive insulin therapy to maximize β-cell recovery and then either continued on an insulin-based regimen or switched to multiple hypoglycemic medications with complementary mechanisms of action. Either of these strategies will stabilize β-cell function and maintain excellent long-term glucose control, a desirable disease-modifying effect. In addition, this can be achieved safely, and we have previously shown that both treatment strategies have high patient satisfaction ratings with improved quality of life.

In conclusion, intensive insulin therapy at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes followed by either an insulin-based regimen or multiple oral hypoglycemic agents preserves both glycemic control and β-cell function for at least 3.5 years with no significant difference in the adverse-effect profile.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) 2022 guideline — Nutritional supplements in diabetes mellitus (DM): We recommend that persons with DM use caution and discuss with their physician the use of unregulated nutritional supplements (Grade A; BEL 1). Nutritional supplements are a heterogeneous group marketed without prescription and generally are not regulated by governmental approval agencies and have inconsistent composition and quality. Probiotics are among the most studied supplements, with several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses noting positive effects on glucose, A1C, lipids, and blood pressure. A meta-analysis reported that psyllium taken before meals improved fasting blood glucose (-3.70 mg/dL; P < .001) and A1C (-0.97%; P = 0.048) among persons with type 2 diabetes, and in a randomized controlled trial in prediabetes, supplementation resulted in reduced blood glucose, decreased insulin resistance, improved β-cell function, and reduced progression to DM compared with controls.

### Glipizide (glucotrol) [^fb316d47]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Glipizide primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The insulinotropic response to a meal is enhanced with GLUCOTROL XL administration in diabetic patients. The postprandial insulin and C-peptide responses continue to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. In two randomized, double-blind, dose-response studies comprising a total of 347 patients, there was no significant increase in fasting insulin in all GLUCOTROL XL-treated patients combined compared to placebo, although minor elevations were observed at some doses.

In studies of GLUCOTROL XL in subjects with type 2 diabete mellitus, once daily administration produced reductions in hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose. The relationship between dose and reduction in hemoglobin A1c was not established, however subjects treated with 20 mg had a greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose compared to subjects treated with 5 mg.

### The effect of chronic twice daily exenatide treatment on β-cell function in new onset type 2 diabetes [^43d20f1e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of chronic daily exenatide treatment on β-cell function in type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Background

Glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists, such as exenatide, are commonly used to treat patients with T2DM. Drugs in this class are insulinotropic but lower blood glucose by multiple mechanisms such that effects on β-cell function can be difficult to discern by conventional measures.

Design

Seventy-nine subjects with previously untreated T2DM were studied before and after 24 weeks of treatment with one of the two doses of exenatide, 5- or 10-μg twice daily, or placebo. All subjects had oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) before and after randomization with measurement of plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Insulin secretion rates (ISR), peripheral insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and hepatic insulin resistance index (Hep-IR) were calculated.

Results

During the trial, all three groups lost similar, small but significant, amounts of weight. Compared to placebo, 24 weeks of daily high- or low-dose exenatide treatment reduced HbA1c and improved fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia. Exenatide was associated with improved OGIS and Hep-IR independent of changes in weight. Plasma insulin levels and ISR during the OGTT did not differ before or after treatment with exenatide or placebo. However, when considered as a function of plasma glucose and insulin sensitivity, both doses of exenatide improved ISR proportionately to the improvement in plasma glucose. The higher dose of exenatide was associated with a significant improvement in β-cell sensitivity to glucose.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that in persons with early T2DM, chronic treatment with exenatide enhanced ISR and increased β-cell sensitivity to glucose. These improvements in β-cell function were not clearly reflected in plasma insulin and C-peptide levels, but became apparent when glycemia and insulin sensitivity were accounted for.

### Counterpoint: postprandial glucose levels are not a clinically important treatment target [^d7f2256a]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

How do these data serve to influence our clinical approach to postprandial hyperglycemia? The most important determinant of the postprandial glucose concentration is the preprandial level. Furthermore, the increment over the preprandial level is similar regardless of the preprandial value. Therefore, postprandial hyperglycemia is best treated by lowering preprandial glycemia. Since randomized controlled intervention studies have clearly demonstrated that keeping A1C levels below 7.0% is beneficial for the microvascular complications of diabetes (although perhaps not for the macrovascular ones), that should be our primary goal. Once preprandial glucose targets are attained and if A1C levels are ≥ 7.0%, then and only then would specifically targeting postprandial glycemia be appropriate. If preprandial glucose values are reached and A1C levels are < 7.0%, current clinical evidence is not strong enough to expose these patients to the increased risk of hypoglycemia by aggressively targeting postprandial glycemia.

### A review of sotagliflozin for use in type 1 diabetes [^1358bbb8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sotagliflozin was among the first in the SGLT2 inhibitor class to apply for approval in the EU and the US for the treatment of T1D. It is unique in its dual inhibition of SGLT1 and SGLT2, having a stronger affinity for the SGLT1 receptors than any of the medications currently available for treating T2D in the US. Whether this higher SGLT1 affinity translates to additional benefits in the treatment of diabetes or unwanted side effects remains to be seen, but theoretical models and initial clinical trials suggest that additional PPG control could be achieved by this medication. In addition, it may help to set sotagliflozin apart from other medications in the SGLT2 inhibitor class, many of which are currently being evaluated for potential use in the T1D population.

The treatment of T1D with an SGLT2 inhibitor offers benefits and risks to this population. Increasing the excretion of glucose through the urine, independent of insulin action, offers a beneficial mechanism for reducing the overall glucose load in the body while potentially lowering insulin requirements. The data suggest that treatment with sotagliflozin successfully lowered A1C by approximately 0.3–0.4% compared with the placebo. This is a relatively modest reduction, which may not on its own outweigh the potential risks of SGLT2 therapy. There are a number of secondary benefits to consider, however, including improved glucose variability, improved PPG lowering, and positive effects on weight. Because insulin has been implicated in increasing weight, mitigating weight gain could be beneficial. Data from a small safety and efficacy study performed with 33 patients over 29 days in 2015 demonstrated that higher doses of sotagliflozin were associated with greater reductions in patient's insulin doses, and a 2–3 kg average weight reduction at 24 weeks. A1C reduction, in contrast, appeared to plateau at a dose of approximately 200 mg/day. While 400 mg/day dosing did demonstrate higher numbers of patients achieving an A1C of < 7%, this was balanced by a higher prevalence in adverse events with a higher dosage, including the risks for DKA. In general, it is felt that further evidence is required to justify doses exceeding 200 mg in this patient population. The lower rates of severe hypoglycemia seen in the sotagliflozin-treated groups compared with patients using insulin alone, in combination with overall lower hypoglycemic events in this population (approximately nine events per patient year) suggest another potential secondary benefit to the T1D patients.

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: the contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^068e0290]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tirzepatide is the first glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) to have demonstrated substantial improvement of glycaemia and weight reduction as well as other metabolic benefits both in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Phase 3 clinical trials (SURPASS‐1 (S1), −2 (S2), −3 (S3), −4 (S4), −5 (S5), −6 (S6)) with tirzepatide in participants with T2D showed significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (primary outcome) (−20.8 to −28.5 mmol/mol (−1.9 to −2.6%)), and body weight (−6.2 to −13.9%) over 40 to 52 weeks, enabling some participants (13% to 62%) to achieve good glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c < 39 mmol/mol (< 5.7%)).,

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, tirzepatide has shown greater efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels and body weight compared with other once‐weekly GLP‐1RAs, dulaglutide 1.5/0.75 mg or semaglutide 1 mg. There is interest in explaining potential mechanisms behind the superior efficacy of tirzepatide when compared with GLP‐1RAs. Tirzepatide shares glucoregulatory actions with GLP‐1RAs; however, improvements in beta cell secretory function, insulin sensitivity and inhibition of glucagon secretion are more pronounced with tirzepatide than with the GLP‐1 RA, semaglutide 1 mg. It also remains unclear as to what extent the greater weight loss (WL) seen with tirzepatide drives improved glycaemic control. The SURPASS trials showed that tirzepatide was associated with reductions in both HbA1c and body weight, with a statistically significant but modest association between HbA1c and body weight change observed with tirzepatide; the degree to which weight reduction contributes to HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide was still to be investigated. To elucidate the weight loss‐dependent (WL‐D) and ‐independent (WL‐IND) effects of tirzepatide on HbA1c reduction versus comparators, we performed mediation analysis of 3 global Phase‐3 SURPASS trials. Studies utilizing non‐insulin comparators (S1, S2 and S5) were chosen for the analysis to avoid the confounding effect of insulin therapy.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Effects of different doses of exercise and diet-induced weight loss on β-cell function in type 2 diabetes (DOSE-EX): a randomized clinical trial [^e489dc43]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Main

As the progressive deterioration of normal beta-cell function is regarded as a determining factor for the onset and subsequent progression of T2D, re-establishing beta-cell function is considered pivotal to improving the pathogenesis of T2D.

Although a substantial diet-induced weight loss is consistent with improved beta-cell function –, the effects of exercise on beta-cell function in T2D are not well understood –. Inconsistent findings may relate to differences in concomitant pharmacological therapy, the participants' pretrial insulin secretory capacity, or differences in exercise modality, intensity and/or volume –. The inconsistencies could also be related to a failure to correct for prevailing insulin sensitivity when assessing beta-cell function. As the normal physiological response to decreased insulin sensitivity is an increase in insulin secretion, the assessment of beta-cell function should incorporate both measures (that is, insulin sensitivity and secretion). A widely accepted measure of beta-cell function is the disposition index (DI), that is, the product of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Whereas there is evidence to suggest that exercise-induced improvements in DI are explained via improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal, the exercise-induced effects on insulin secretion in the context of prevailing insulin sensitivity remain to be clarified.

### Secondary failure of metformin monotherapy in clinical practice [^18414bb7]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this observational cohort study of 1,799 patients who lowered their A1C to below 7% using metformin monotherapy as their first-ever anti-hyperglycemic agent, we found that initiating metformin within 3 months of diabetes diagnosis was associated with a substantial reduction in the odds of secondary loss of glycemic control. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that early initiation of metformin preserves β-cell function and supports the current ADA/EASD hyperglycemia treatment algorithm, which recommends metformin therapy as soon as type 2 diabetes is diagnosed. We also found that lower A1C at treatment initiation was independently associated with a reduced risk of secondary failure. Importantly, only subjects with the shortest diabetes duration (0–3 months) and the lowest baseline A1C (< 7%) benefited; overlapping confidence intervals among the other categories of duration and A1C suggested no difference in the probability of failure.

Of metformin initiators, 42% experienced secondary failure within a mean follow-up period of 27.6 months (2 years and 2 months). This equates to an annual failure rate of 17%, substantially greater than the 4% per year reported in ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial). ADOPT defined failure as fasting plasma glucose > 180 mg/dl, a level that correlates to an A1C of ∼8%, whereas we used an A1C cut point of 7.5%. We also included the addition or substitution of other anti-hyperglycemic agents within our definition of failure. Metformin monotherapy might therefore be less durable than the experience of highly screened volunteers treated by research physicians would suggest. Discrepancies between real-world "effectiveness" studies and trials of clinical efficacy are not uncommon. In addition, our results are consistent with one prior observational study of untreated patients with A1C < 7.0% that similarly found that lower baseline A1C and younger age were the major independent predictors of progression (A1C ≥ 7% or initiation of therapy). We also note that sensitivity analyses examining the two definitions of failure independently, and alternative A1C thresholds of 7 and 8%, did not change our results.

### Triple oral therapy with metformin, DPP-4 inhibitor, and SGLT2 inhibitor for adults with type 2 diabetes: consensus recommendations of a Chinese expert panel (version 2025) [^13cb15a9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Recommendations on triple oral therapy with metformin,‐4i, and

Q1. Should triple therapy be initiated in patients with T2DM and HbA1c ≥ 7.0% after 3 months of dual therapy?

Recommendation 1: In patients with T2DM who have HbA1c ≥ 7.0% after 3 months of dual therapy with metformin + DPP‐4i or SGLT2i, triple therapy with metformin + DPP‐4i + SGLT2i should be initiated promptly (Grade A; strong recommendation [agreement: 100%]).

Explanation 1: When HbA1c goals are not achieved with 3 months of dual glycaemic‐lowering therapy, a new drug with complementary mechanisms of action should be added. Substantial literature reported that in T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin plus DPP‐4i, the addition of SGLT2i lowered HbA1c by 0.65%–1.4%, with glycaemic goal achievement rates of 35.5%–90%. Similarly, in those with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin plus SGLT2i, the addition of DPP‐4i lowered HbA1c by 0.36%–0.86%, with glycaemic goal achievement rates of 32.1%–66.7%. These glycaemic‐lowering effects were sustained through 52 weeks, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (0%–4.5%). Beyond glycaemic control, the triple regimen of metformin + DPP‐4i + SGLT2i also demonstrated metabolic benefits such as improvements in weight loss (1.8–2.8 kg), β‐cell function, and blood pressure.

A common feature of the two major forms of human diabetes is the partial or complete loss of insulin secretion from beta-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. In this article, we review the development of a set of tools for studying beta-cell biology and their application to understanding of fuel-mediated insulin secretion and enhancement of beta-cell survival.

Metformin

Insulin resistance is a central pathogenetic mechanism of type 2 diabetes, which not only contributes to development of hyperglycemia but also confers an independent risk for CV disease. Moreover, insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of many of the disturbances encompassing the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, insulin sensitization is an attractive form of treatment in the attempt to improve metabolic control and reduce CV risk.

Metformin has been the only sensitizer available for many years. It exerts a prevalent effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity, although some action is played on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well. Metformin can reduce A1C by 0.5–1.5% and exerts beneficial albeit modest effects on traditional CV risk factors reducing blood pressure, improving lipid profile, and maintaining, if not lowering, body weight due to a mild anorexiant effect. Many studies, although not all of them, have shown that metformin can reduce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, improve the pro-fibrinolytic state by reducing the circulating levels of PAI-1 and von Willebrand factor, hamper platelet aggregation, lower low-grade inflammation, and improve endothelial function. It is on the basis of these pleiotropic effects that the positive outcomes of the UKPDS have been accounted for. Secondary analysis of 342 overweight diabetic patients treated with metformin (Fig. 1) showed greater beneficial effect on all diabetes-related end points, including a 39% risk reduction for myocardial infarction (P = 0.01) compared with 951 patients treated with sulfonylureas or insulin. Based on these results and retrospective analysis, a cardioprotective effect of metformin has been claimed and metformin therapy has become a standard first-line treatment in almost all national and international guidelines.

Type 2 diabetes remission — complications and insulin resistance consensus states that preventing the long-term known microvascular and macrovascular complications related to diabetes are paramount in managing T2D, even in the absence of remission; insulin resistance can be measured using HOMA-beta (homeostatic model assessment for assessing beta-cell function) and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for assessing insulin resistance) to assess progress with therapy and to define expectations; and remission of T2D is accompanied by reversal or improvement of insulin resistance.

### Is there evidence that oral hypoglycemic agents reduce cardiovascular morbidity / mortality? Yes [^3b3a9f69]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

α-Glucosidase inhibitors

The α-glucosidase inhibitors act by blocking the action of intestinal α-glucosidase, which hydrolyzes diet-derived oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. As a consequence, they slow carbohydrate digestion and absorption and reduce postprandial glucose excursion. This glucose-lowering effect results in 0.5–0.8% A1C reduction. A recent meta-analysis by Hanefeld et al. confirms that along with improved glycemic control, acarbose also can lower triglyceride levels, body weight, and systolic blood pressure. When used in people with impaired glucose tolerance, acarbose slowed progression of carotid intima-media thickness with a 50% reduction in its annual increase compared with placebo. Moreover, in the STOP-NIDDM trial, a large multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled study performed to assess prevention of diabetes by acarbose in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, a significant reduction in risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–0.72; P = 0.02) and a 34% relative risk reduction in the incidence of new cases of hypertension (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49–0.89; P = 0.006) was observed. Although these results do require further confirmation, mechanisms that may account for this positive effect have been investigated. A major effect is attributed to prevention of a rapid raise in postprandial hyperglycemia, resulting in reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory response, fibrinogen concentration, macrophage adhesion to endothelium, and endothelial function. From this point of view, of interest are the similarities of the results obtained with metiglinides, i.e. another therapeutic approach associated with more effective postprandial glycemic control. Both treatments have been shown to improve regression of carotid intima-media thickness.

### Exenatide sensitizes insulin-mediated whole-body glucose disposal and promotes uptake of exogenous glucose by the liver [^22280987]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Exenatide is the synthetic form of exendin-4 and a long-acting mimetic of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Originally isolated from salivary secretions of the lizard Gila monster, exendin-4 shows a 53% amino acid sequence identity to GLP-1 and shares many actions with GLP-1 via pancreatic GLP-1 receptor. Exenatide stimulates glucose-dependent insulin response, suppresses glucagon secretion, and inhibits gastrointestinal motility. Exenatide has also been implicated in regulating food intake and β-cell proliferation. Exenatide is resistant to digestion by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV and thus has a longer plasma half-life than GLP-1.

Exenatide is currently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes because of its effect to lower glycemia and improve glycemic control through multiple mechanisms as mentioned above. Exenatide (13 weeks) in diabetic db/db mice led to 50% lower glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) than in nontreated animals. Type 2 diabetic patients who had not attained A1C goals ≤ 8% with sulfonylureas and/or metformin achieved a ∼0.9% reduction with exenatide (4 weeks).

This interaction leads to a closure of voltage-dependent potassium adenosinetriphosphate channels, facilitating cell membrane depolarization, calcium entry into the cell, and insulin secretion. 25 Thus, SUs allow for insulin release at lower glucose thresholds than normal. They partially reverse the attenuated insulin secretion. SUs are most likely secondary to a reduction in glucotoxicity.

### Mechanisms for the antihyperglycemic effect of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^d2aec17a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The underlying mechanisms (incretin effect, β-cell function, endogenous glucose production) are not well known.

Objective

The aim of the study was to examine mechanisms of the antihyperglycemic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We administered a mixed meal with glucose tracers ([6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose infused, [1-(2)H]-glucose ingested), and on a separate day, a glucose infusion matched the glucose responses to the meal (isoglycemic test) in 50 type 2 diabetes patients (hemoglobin A(1c) = 7.4 ± 0.8%) and seven controls; 47 diabetic completers were restudied after 6 wk. Glucose fluxes were calculated, and β-cell function was assessed by mathematical modeling. The incretin effect was calculated as the ratio of oral to iv insulin secretion.

Intervention

We conducted a 6-wk, double-blind, randomized treatment with sitagliptin (100 mg/d; n = 25) or placebo (n = 22).

Results

Relative to placebo, meal-induced changes in fasting glucose and glucose area under the curve (AUC) were greater with sitagliptin, in parallel with a lower appearance of oral glucose [difference (post-pre) AUC = -353 ± 915 vs. +146 ± 601 μmol · kg(-1) · 5 h] and greater suppression of endogenous glucose production. Insulin sensitivity improved 10%, whereas total insulin secretion was unchanged. During the meal, β-cell glucose sensitivity improved (+19[29] vs. 5[21] pmol · min(-1) · m(-2) · mm(-1); median [interquartile range]) and glucagon AUC decreased (19.6 ± 7.5 to 17.3 ± 7.1 ng · ml(-1) · 5 h), whereas intact glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 AUC increased with sitagliptin vs. placebo. The incretin effect was unchanged because sitagliptin increased β-cell glucose sensitivity also during the isoglycemic test.

Conclusions

Chronic sitagliptin treatment improves glycemic control by lowering the appearance of oral glucose, postprandial endogenous glucose release, and glucagon response, and by improving insulin sensitivity and β-cell glucose sensing in response to both oral and iv glucose.

### Β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes: postulated mechanisms and prospects for prevention and treatment [^b9013cbe]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Natural History of β-Cell Failure

Impaired insulin secretion assessed by oral or intravenous glucose tolerance testing and hyperglycemic clamp studies is seen in prediabetes as well as early in the disease, with reduced secretion negatively correlated with glycemia. Although declines in β-cell mass and function are not well correlated, presumably because function depends greatly on diabetes milieu, climbing glucose levels and deteriorating β-cell function are tightly correlated. While β-cell function appears to decline progressively, insulin secretion defects seem at least partially reversible, especially early in the disease.

Family history and obesity are major risk factors for both youth and adults. In youth, a family history of T2D is also associated with a high risk for decreased insulin sensitivity and response, and increased proinsulin-to-insulin ratio. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in youth is characterized by β-cell dysfunction manifested in impaired first-phase, but preserved second-phase, insulin secretion relative to sensitivity. However, youth with IGT are no more insulin resistant than peers with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) if matched for body composition and fat topography. Once treated with metformin after progressing to T2D, youth show a greater rate of treatment failure than adults.

β-Cell mass increases during the first decade of life due to proliferation during the first 5 years, stabilizing during adolescence with considerable variation (three- to fivefold) unrelated to age or BMI. β-Cell mass in T2D likewise varies, overlapping with that of normal individuals, although current data suggest a 20–60% reduction. Currently, measurements of human β-cell mass rely entirely on postmortem, cross-sectional assessments; inability to assess mass noninvasively via imaging or biomarkers impedes determining temporal changes. Furthermore, histomorphometric measurement of β-cell area, volume, and mass is often imprecisely defined and complicated by technical inconsistencies. Importantly, too, because insulin sensitivity may vary as much as 10-fold in humans, variations in β-cell mass may be linked to individual insulin sensitivity. Thus, an individual with low insulin sensitivity and T2D may have a higher than "normal" β-cell mass that is functionally reduced, suggesting that de facto variation might be considerably reduced if corrected for insulin sensitivity.

### Rationale for and role of thiazolidinediones in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^472186f1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Several classes of antihyperglycemic agents are available for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. These agents, including thiazolidinediones, biguanides, insulin secretagogues, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin, offer differing mechanisms of actions and can be used either alone or in combination. The thiazolidinediones are a newer class of oral antidiabetic agents that improve glycemic control and may preserve beta-cell function. Clinical trial data suggest that patients with type 2 diabetes experience progressive deterioration of beta-cell function. By decreasing insulin resistance, thiazolidinediones may preserve beta-cell function, and patients may experience prolonged glycemic control. The thiazolidinediones also exert beneficial effects on dyslipidemia, endothelial function, coagulation, and blood pressure. By improving these components of the metabolic syndrome, thiazolidinediones may reduce the incidence of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. This article provides an overview of the role of thiazolidinediones in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

### SGLT2 inhibition in diabetes mellitus: rationale and clinical prospects [^f5426ef1]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

This Review covers the rationale, physiological consequences and clinical application of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in whom renal glucose reabsorption might be upregulated, orally active, selective SGLT2 inhibitors improve glycaemic control to a therapeutically useful extent. Chronic administration of several SGLT2 inhibitors dose-dependently lowers HbA(1c) levels by 0.5–1.5% without causing hypoglycaemia. The unique mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors-which does not hinge upon β-cell function or tissue insulin sensitivity-means that they can exert their antihyperglycaemic effects in combination with any other oral antidiabetic drug as well as insulin. Available phase III studies confirm a good tolerability profile. Weight loss owing to urinary calorie leakage may be less than expected, but the negative energy balance offers a valuable clinical benefit. Offloading of sodium can assist blood pressure control. The progressive loss of efficacy in patients with reduced glomerular function will have to be balanced against the possibility of renal protection. The safety issues of genitourinary infections and cancer risk requires careful, proactive monitoring and analysis of robust exposure data, particularly in elderly, frail patients and in patients with impaired kidney function and/or high cardiovascular/cancer risk, who represent an increasing fraction of the population with diabetes mellitus.

### Clinical use of thiazolidinediones: recommendations [^57d1a1cb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by progressive beta-cell secretory dysfunction against a background of insulin resistance, which is present many years before the onset of hyperglycemia in most patients. Intensive treatment of diabetes reduces the risk of the onset and progression of microvascular complications and may impact the risk of development of macrovascular complications, notably coronary artery disease. Therefore, aggressive treatment with the goal of achieving serum glucose concentrations as close to normal as possible is warranted. Although medical nutritional therapy and exercise remain the cornerstones of therapy for type 2 diabetes, > 90% of patients ultimately require pharmacologic therapy, and most need > 1 agent to achieve therapeutic objectives. When considering which agent or agents to use to treat type 2 diabetes, one must consider the mechanism of action of the drug, its ability to lower serum glucose concentrations, the durability of effect, and potential adverse effects. In addition, some medications have potential benefits that extend beyond glucose lowering. These include beneficial effects on the adverse metabolic consequences of insulin resistance and possibly beta-cell preservation. Thiazolidinediones should be considered as early as possible in the natural history of type 2 diabetes because of their persistent glucose-lowering effect and their ability to reduce insulin resistance as well as because these agents may preserve beta-cell function and reverse some of the adverse metabolic consequences of insulin resistance.

Positioning the SGLT2 Inhibitors

The question arises as to where SGLT2 inhibitors might fit in the current cascade of treatments for the management of T2DM. While treatment of T2DM follows prescribed guidelines, there are many approaches and permutations to their application in clinical practice. Initial treatment strategies involve lifestyle interventions to promote weight loss and improve glycemic control. Although the SGLT2 inhibitors' mechanism of action would make them suitable for initial monotherapy in patients with early stage T2DM, it is unlikely they would be considered at this stage. Most treatments are currently initiated with metformin, which is relatively inexpensive, has a good historical safety profile, and is efficacious. Clearly, when they are first launched, the SGLT2 inhibitors will not be able to compete with metformin, purely on the issue of cost. If considered as second line treatment, SGLT2 inhibitors may offer a synergistic effect. However, as explained earlier, the advantage of this may be minimal in patients achieving a degree of glycemic control.

By promoting an 'escape' mechanism for glucose, SGLT2 inhibitors introduce a new mode to the control of T2DM. With the exception of α-glucosidase inhibitors, which block glucose uptake from the gut, all currently available antidiabetic therapies directly or indirectly modulate insulin to manipulate endogenous glucose utilization. Despite the modest effect on HbA 1c predicted for SGLT2 inhibitors, the introduction of a novel means of reducing hyperglycemia increases the treatment options available to physicians for a disease that frequently requires the use of multiple agents to achieve control targets. The expected favorable safety profile and insulin-independent mechanism of action appear to support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. Insulin-dependent therapies become less effective with the development of insulin resistance and/or deterioration of β-cell function; particularly in patients with low insulin resistance (high glucose) or poorly controlled disease. The insulin-independent action of SGLT2 inhibitors suggests potential for a synergistic effect in such scenarios. The insulin-independent action of SGLT2 inhibitors also means that they may be of use in type 1 diabetes, perhaps as a means of moderating post-prandial glucose excursions.

### Cardiorenal protective effects of canagliflozin in CREDENCE according to glucose lowering [^2236b89d]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Glycemia-independent effects of SGLT2 inhibition have been previously inferred from the study of cardiovascular and kidney benefits of canagliflozin that are observed despite a modest lowering of HbA1c when kidney function is impaired. Indeed, the mean decrease of 0.16% in HbA1c that we observed with canagliflozin compared with placebo in this analysis is considerably smaller than that seen in either short-term (approximately 0.7%–1.0%) or longer outcome trials (0.4%–0.6%). We have already reported that baseline HbA1c level did not predict the impact of canagliflozin on study outcomes in the CREDENCE trial. The current, analyses extend these findings by demonstrating that neither the initial HbA1c, the extent of initial reduction in HbA1c at 13 weeks, nor the time-averaged HbA1c during the whole study period, influenced the clinical benefits associated with randomization to canagliflozin as compared with placebo. Furthermore, reduction in cardiovascular and kidney risks were robust regardless of background diabetes therapies. These results therefore support the hypothesis that the cardiovascular and renoprotective effects of canagliflozin in this population of patients with both type 2 diabetes and CKD are largely independent of changes in glycemic status and suggest that non-glycemic mechanisms are operative. This analysis is consistent with findings from the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study in which markers of glycemic control did not explain kidney outcomes in a mediation analysis, while albuminuria, hemoglobin, and hematocrit did, suggesting that anti-inflammatory effects, antifibrotic effects, effect on volume status, improvements in renal hypoxia, or other mechanisms of action are more important in explaining clinical benefits. This conclusion is supported by a recent prespecified analysis of the DAPA-CKD study, which recruited 4304 participants with CKD of whom 738 had normoglycemia, 660 had prediabetes, and 2906 had type 2 diabetes at baseline. The effects of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome (a composite of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease, or death due to a renal or cardiovascular cause) were consistent in those with normoglycemia (HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.01)), prediabetes (HR 0.37 (0.21 to 0.66)), and type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64 (0.52 to 0.79)) with no effect modification on other outcomes (including all-cause mortality) when adjusted for baseline glycemic status. This analysis, however, did not examine the impact of the level of glycemic control during the study on these clinical outcomes, although there were no differences in HbA1c between treatments arms in participants with normoglycemia or prediabetes at baseline. Trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure have also indicated that the cardiovascular benefits of these drugs, particularly on hospitalization for worsening heart failure, are also observed in participants with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who do not have type 2 diabetes at the time of randomization.

### Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans? [^f6e8c02c]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a serious global health issue that has reached epidemic proportions in both developed and developing countries over the last two decades. With currently available medicines, many diabetic patients fail to achieve optimal glycemic control (HbA 1c < 6.5–7.0%). With the exception of the glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and the thiazolidinediones, other antidiabetic medications lose their effectiveness to control hyperglycemia over time, partially due to the progressive decline of β-cell function. As a consequence, many patients receive multiple antidiabetic medicines and eventually require insulin therapy, which often fails to achieve the desired glycemic goal and is associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia. Failure to achieve glycemic targets is the primary factor responsible for the microvascular complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular complications. In addition, the majority of diabetic patients are overweight or obese, and many of the current therapies are associated with weight gain, which causes insulin resistance and deterioration in glycemic control.

### Antidiabetic actions of endogenous and exogenous GLP-1 in type 1 diabetic patients with and without residual β-cell function [^b9df23bf]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

At time of diagnosis and during the first year, prevalence of residual β-cell function in patients with type 1 diabetes is nearly 100%. After alleviation of initial hyperglycemia with exogenous insulin, patients enter a remission period with improved β-cell function, where insulin treatment can be paused in up to 20–30% of the patients without loss of target glycemic control. Persistence of residual insulin secretion is associated with reduced risk of ketosis, lower HbA 1c levels, lower insulin doses, less risk of hypoglycemia, and reduced long-term complications. However, after disease duration of 5–10 years, the prevalence of residual β-cell function has declined to about 15%. Even though lack of insulin is considered to be the most important factor for the hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetic patients, other metabolic disturbances may also play a role: the glucagon response to carbohydrate and protein ingestion has been shown to be abnormal and there is evidence that postprandial hyperglycemia is because of lack of insulin as well as inappropriately elevated glucagon levels. The gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), reduces glucagon levels, increases insulin secretion, and inhibits gastric emptying rate (GE), thereby reducing postprandial glucose excursions. The insulinotropic and the glucagonostatic properties of GLP-1 are glucose dependent, and exogenous GLP-1, therefore, does not produce hypoglycemia. Several studies have found lowering of fasting and postprandial glucose by GLP-1 or GLP-1 agonists in type 1 diabetic patients with as well as without residual β-cell function. Some studies suggested that the glucose lowering effect was because of the enhancement of insulin sensitivity, whereas others concluded that delay of gastric emptying or reduction of glucagon levels was the most important mechanism. In animal studies, treatment with GLP-1 or GLP-1 agonists has been shown to delay diabetes development or reverse recent onset diabetes in NOD mice, ascribed to an improved function of existing β-cells rather than through increments in β-cell mass. However, there is also evidence that GLP-1, in combination with gastrin, increases β-cell mass and restores normoglycemia in recent onset diabetic NOD mice and that GLP-1 combined with gastrin is able to expand β-cell mass of human islets implanted under the renal capsule of immunodeficient diabetic NOD mice. In freshly isolated human islets, GLP-1 has been reported to inhibit β-cell apoptosis. However, in C-peptide–positive subjects with longstanding type 1 diabetes treated with exenatide for 6 to 9 months with or without daclizumab, insulin dose was significantly reduced, primarily because of the reduction of prandial insulin, but β-cell function was not improved. Four weeks of treatment with vildagliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor that increases endogenous GLP-1 levels) in 11 well-controlled type 1 diabetic patients with longstanding disease decreased postmeal glucagon and glucose levels, and in adolescents with minimal or no endogenous insulin secretion treated with exenatide, postprandial glucose excursions were reduced despite 20% reduction of insulin dose. Therefore, GLP-1–based therapies have potential for treatment of type 1 diabetes alone or — more likely — in combination with insulin.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^df73baec]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Aging-related hyperglycemia — pathophysiology in older adults: Consistent declines in β cell function and insulin secretion are hallmarks of aging, which limit the response to lifestyle-induced insulin resistance and result in progression to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D); chronic hyperglycemia can cause glucose toxicity that worsens insulin resistance and further impairs pancreatic β cell function, while lipotoxicity, visceral obesity, and intramyocellular fat may also contribute. The heterogeneity of T2D reflects multiple contributing factors, and understanding patient-specific factors may provide a basis for selecting glucose-lowering interventions.

### Novel hypothesis to explain why SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of filtered glucose load in humans [^9c4cd3c3]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the irrefutable evidence for the important role of hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular complications and the large number of antidiabetes agents available for the management of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the majority of subjects with T2DM still manifest suboptimal glycemic control. Over half of all patients with T2DM in the U.S. fail to meet the American Diabetes Association treatment goal of HbA 1c < 7%, and a smaller number of subjects achieve the American College of Clinical Endocrinologists goal of HbA 1c < 6.5% with existing therapies. Progressive β-cell failure, weight gain, and hypoglycemia are some of the obstacles for the achievement of optimal glycemic control (HbA 1c ≤ 6.5) in patients with T2DM. Therefore, additional antidiabetes agents that are effective in lowering the plasma glucose concentration without weight gain and hypoglycemia are required for the treatment of T2DM individuals. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represent a novel class of antihyperglycemic drugs that inhibit glucose reuptake in the kidney and are under clinical development for the treatment of T2DM. Dapagliflozin is approved in Europe, and canagliflozin recently was approved in the U.S. This class of drugs lowers the plasma glucose concentration by inhibiting SGLT2, leading to glucosuria. Because SGLT2 inhibitors produce urinary glucose loss, they also promote weight loss. Since the mechanism of action of the SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of insulin action and insulin secretion, they lower the plasma glucose concentration without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Moreover, because of this unique mechanism of action, SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in lowering the HbA 1c at all stages of diabetes, and they can be used in combination with all other antihyperglycemic agents including insulin.

The efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the HbA 1c and promote weight loss is highly dependent upon the amount of glucosuria produced by these agents. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the glucosuria produced by these agents is less than would be expected from the inhibition of SGLT2. In this Perspective, we suggest an explanation for this paradox, discuss some of the clinical implications of this explanation, and suggest mechanisms to improve the clinical efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Improved pancreatic β-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients after lifestyle-induced weight loss is related to glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [^94470293]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The dichotomy of "improved insulin secretion" in diabetic versus nondiabetic individuals is highlighted by this current study: reversal of inadequate postprandial insulinemia in diabetic individuals versus reversal of compensatory hyperinsulinemia in nondiabetic individuals. Exposure of the β-cell to chronic hyperglycemia leads to functional impairment or glucotoxicity. Thus, relief of extreme hyperglycemia and therefore toxicity in our diabetic population may explain the augmentation of postprandial insulin secretion. However, our diabetic subjects also demonstrate an increase in GIP secretion after the intervention. The mechanisms behind these changes are not understood, but our correlation analyses negate the effects of changes in body composition; however, it has been demonstrated that chronic hyperglycemia can downregulate pancreatic GIP receptor expression and also increase GIP glycation, thus rendering the peptide dysfunctional with respect to insulinogenic capacity. This process may translate to the chronic hyperglycemic state in diabetes, where glucotoxicity is systemic and may therefore have the potential to impair GIP functional capacity or indeed intestinal K-cell secretion. Although caution must be used when correlative interpretations are made with low numbers of subjects, our finding that weight loss–induced changes in GIP are related to changes in insulin secretion warrants further attention. Future researchers should also examine more thoroughly the incretin axis to include the insulinogenic protein, GLP-1.

It is also interesting to note that after 3 months of lifestyle intervention neither hyperglycemia nor insulin secretion is normalized. Perhaps alternative treatment modalities are sensible. In recent years, surgical techniques and exenatide compounds have emerged and received attention for their potential to initiate insulin secretion in severely obese diabetic patients. Recent data show that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can increase pancreatic β-cell insulin secretory capacity via alteration of incretin signaling and can normalize hyperglycemia in up to 83% of diabetic patients. Thus, the relative impact of lifestyle intervention on β-cell function may seem small. However, more prolonged interventions demonstrate even more dramatic improvements, and indeed the goal of clinical care is on-going dietary monitoring and physical activity. In the U.S. health care system, pharmaceutical and surgical options are a financial burden and not accessible to all, leaving low-cost lifestyle programs as a universal and valuable option.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d893d63d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — noninsulin pharmacologic adjuncts to insulin show limited glycemic and weight effects with safety considerations. Clinical trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in A1C (0.3–0.4%) and modest weight loss (~1 kg) with pramlintide. The largest clinical trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes have been conducted with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest A1C reductions (~0.4%), decreases in weight (~5 kg), and reductions in insulin doses; during treatment there was no impact on C-peptide, and after liraglutide discontinuation there was worsening of C-peptide loss versus placebo. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improved A1C, reduced body weight, and improved blood pressure in trials but were associated with an increased rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin improved A1C and body weight but was associated with an eightfold increase in DKA compared with placebo. The studies that led to the approved indication for heart failure excluded individuals with type 1 diabetes or a history of DKA, and there are currently no approved therapies for preservation of C-peptide or delaying the progression of symptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^d8d1be56]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with ASCVD/high-risk — A1C targets and treatment thresholds: A target A1C of < 6.5% in most nonpregnant adults can be used if safely achieved, whereas less stringent A1C goals (> 7%) should be adopted in specified situations. If further lowering is needed and renal function is eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2, metformin should be considered. If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

### Improved glycemic control enhances the incretin effect in patients with type 2 diabetes [^361ae1b4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Impairment of the incretin effect is one of the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is unknown whether this abnormality is specific to incretin-stimulated insulin secretion or a manifestation of generalized β-cell dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine whether improved glycemic control restores the incretin effect.

Methods

Fifteen T2DM subjects were studied before and after 8 weeks of intensified treatment with insulin. The incretin effect was determined by comparing plasma insulin and C-peptide levels at clamped hyperglycemia from iv glucose, and iv glucose plus glucose ingestion.

Results

Long-acting insulin, titrated to reduce fasting glucose to 7 mM, lowered hemoglobin A1c from 8.6% ± 0.2% to 7.1% ± 0.2% over 8 weeks. The incremental C-peptide responses and insulin secretion rates to iv glucose did not differ before and after insulin treatment (5.6 ± 1.0 and 6.0 ± 0.9 nmol/L·min and 0.75 ± 0.10 and 0.76 ± 0.11 pmol/min), but the C-peptide response to glucose ingestion was greater after treatment than before (10.9 ± 2.2 and 7.1 ± 0.9 nmol/L·min; P = 0.03) as were the insulin secretion rates (1.11 ± 0.22 and 0.67 ± 0.07 pmol/min; P = 0.04). The incretin effect computed from plasma C-peptide was 21.8% ± 6.5% before insulin treatment and increased 40.9% ± 3.9% after insulin treatment (P < .02).

Conclusion

Intensified insulin treatment to improve glycemic control led to a disproportionate improvement of insulin secretion in response to oral compared with iv glucose stimulation in patients with type 2 diabetes. This suggests that in T2DM the impaired incretin effect is independent of abnormal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

### Capturing the real-world benefit of residual β-cell function during clinically important time-periods in established type 1 diabetes [^70fc2a4e]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Through analysis of clinically meaningful time periods during free‐living, we have demonstrated for the first time that increasing β‐cell function in type 1 diabetes is associated with improved glycaemia overnight and postprandially. This builds upon previous work demonstrating that individuals with residual β‐cell function spend less overall free‐living time in hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia compared with those with undetectable β‐cell function. Specifically, we show that Cpep high spent the most time in normoglycaemia overnight and had the lowest nocturnal variability. We also demonstrated Cpep und spent less time in normoglycaemia in postprandial periods (0–300 min). In a mixed‐effect model, accounting for covariates, higher C‐peptide was still associated with improved glycaemic outcomes. Additionally, a very low level of C‐peptide was also significantly associated with meaningful reductions in overnight hyperglycaemia, whereas a high C‐peptide was associated with less postprandial hypoglycaemic events, in comparison with individuals with no β‐cell function.

Increased β‐cell function likely improves nocturnal glycaemia due to endogenous responsivity to changing blood glucose. Rickels et al.found that those with superior β‐cell function have greater C‐peptide response to hyperglycaemic clamps, and greater glucagon response to hyperinsulinemic‐hypoglycaemic clamps. Continued secretion of insulin into the portal vein, even the small amount seen in type 1 diabetes, likely attenuates highs through reduction of hepatic glucose production, with increased glucagon response lessening hypoglycaemia. The mechanisms explaining the enhanced glucagon response observed in those with high C‐peptide is unclear, with theories including the suppression of functional β‐cells activating neighbouring α‐cells within intact isletsor the presence of C‐peptide itself enhancing the counter regularity responses to hypoglycaemia. This may lower GV and protect against nocturnal dysglycaemia, potentially giving individuals confidence to adhere to more intensive insulin regimens, lowering nocturnal mean glucose.

Figure 4
Thiazolidinediones enhance β-cell function (insulin secretion/IR index) in new-onset, drug-naïve T2DM patients and in long-standing, sulfonylurea-treated T2DM individuals. ✱ p < 0.01.

Improved β-cell function with thiazolidinediones results from 1) stimulatory effect of PPARγ to increase GLUT2, glucokinase, and Pdx in β-cells; 2) reduced intracellular levels of toxic lipid metabolites; 3) muscle/liver insulin-sensitizing effect of thiazolidinediones, which reduce insulin and, therefore, amylin secretion (amylin degradation products are toxic to β-cells; the ability of thiazolidinediones to protect human islets from amylin toxicity is mediated via PI3 kinase–dependent pathway); and 4) studies in β-cell insulin receptor knockout (BIRKO) mice suggest that defective insulin signaling through IRS-1/PI3 kinase impairs insulin secretion and that thiazolidinediones correct this insulin signaling defect, resulting in enhanced insulin secretion.

Summary

Thiazolidinediones improve multiple defects (IR in liver/muscle/adipocytes and β-cell dysfunction) that comprise the Ominous Octet (Fig. 5), cause durable HbA 1c reduction, and can be used as monotherapy or in combination with any other antidiabetes agent. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone similarly reduce HbA 1c, improve insulin sensitivity in muscle/liver/adipocytes, and enhance β-cell function.

Type 2 diabetes — injectable therapy selection and reassessment: If injectable therapy is needed to reduce A1C, consider GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in most individuals prior to insulin, and to avoid therapeutic inertia, reassess and modify treatment regularly (e.g., every 3–6 months). Insulin can be used as the first injectable if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]).

### Beta cells in type 2 diabetes-a crucial contribution to pathogenesis [^545bf63a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The healthy beta-cell has an enormous capacity to adapt to conditions of higher insulin demand (e.g. in obesity, pregnancy, cortisol excess) to maintain normoglycaemia with an increase in its functional beta-cell mass. This compensates in 80–90% of individuals for insulin resistance. However, in 10–20% of individuals, the beta-cells are unable to match the demands of insulin resistance and insulin levels are relatively insufficient to maintain normal glycaemic control. This eventually leads to glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Accordingly, preservation of functional beta-cell mass has become central in the treatment of type 1 diabetes as well as T2DM. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recently described mechanisms of beta-cell death in T2DM and to postulate possible new targets for treatment.

### The required beta cell research for improving treatment of type 2 diabetes [^0627b666]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In healthy individuals, insulin resistance is associated with physiological conditions such as pregnancy or body weight gain and triggers an increase in beta cell number and insulin secretion capacity to preserve normoglycaemia. Failure of this beta cell compensation capacity is a fundamental cause of diabetic hyperglycaemia. Incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the plasticity of adult beta cells mechanisms and how these cells fail during the pathogenesis of diabetes strongly limits the ability to develop new beta cell-specific therapies. Here, current knowledge of the signalling pathways controlling beta cell plasticity is reviewed, and possible directions for future research are discussed.

### Insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes: rescue, augmentation… [^8cb5bed1]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Figure 3. The most common indication for insulin therapy is failure to achieve glycemic control with diet, exercise, and oral medications. Within three years of diagnosis, only 33 percent of patients treated with metformin and sulfonylurea have an A1C level that is less than 7 percent. 12 In the UKPDS, 13 an A1C level of 7 percent or less was found to decrease the risk of microvascular outcomes — mainly retinal photocoagulation — but not cardiovascular disease. However, in the Steno-2 study, 14 a combination of glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control reduced mortality by 50 percent compared with usual therapy. Insulin therapy also is indicated in patients with contraindications to antidiabetic medications.
15. Augmentation therapy is effective in patients with residual but insufficient beta-cell function, which is exhibited as failure to maintain the A1C goal while taking oral medications.

Basal coverage with glargine provides A1C levels similar to those of NPH, but with less nocturnal hypoglycemia and less frequent severe hypoglycemia. Dosing The starting insulin dose for augmentation is calculated as 0. 15 units per kg per day. discussion This scenario is a classic example of glucose toxicity; the beta cell has become desensitized to the high levels of glucose and has decreased insulin production. Case 2. Beta-Cell Augmentation. This male patient had well-controlled type 2 diabetes for 12 years, but last week his A1C level was 8. 2 percent. He has been taking metformin, pioglitazone, and glyburide. discussion This patient has two problems: a mismatch between his caloric intake and medications, and increased gluconeogenesis in the evening caused by waning beta-cell function.

Beta-cell loss is progressive in type 2 diabetes. Initially, oral medications, diet, and exercise can decrease insulin requirements and increase insulin secretion but, eventually, the beta cell can no longer match the demand. Augmentation of the basal insulin needs at night shuts off gluconeogenesis. The combination of sulfonylurea and bedtime insulin provides better postprandial control than basal insulin alone in patients who retain some beta-cell function.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^5c7c17f9]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus focus on three areas: intensive lifestyle intervention that includes at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity, weight loss with an initial goal of 7 percent of baseline weight, and a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet; aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria) with the use of aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; and normalization of blood glucose levels (hemoglobin A1C level less than 7 percent). Insulin resistance, decreased insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose output are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and each class of medication targets one or more of these defects. Metformin, which decreases hepatic glucose output and sensitizes peripheral tissues to insulin, has been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes and is considered a first-line agent. Other medications include sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. Insulin can be used acutely in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to normalize blood glucose, or it can be added to a regimen of oral medication to improve glycemic control. Except in patients taking multiple insulin injections, home monitoring of blood glucose levels has questionable utility, especially in relatively well-controlled patients. Its use should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^30f237cb]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut hormone that is secreted by the intestine in response to meal ingestion and potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells. In addition, GLP-1 suppresses glucagon secretion by alpha-cells, leading to a glucose-dependent reduction in hepatic glucose production. Glucagon may be regulated in a paracrine manner, by the secretion of somatostatin from the neighboring delta-cells.

GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the pancreatic actions of native GLP-1, leading to glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) reductions within the range of 1.0–1.5%, as well as decreased postprandial plasma glucose levels. Several GLP-1 receptor agonists are now approved for use as second-line therapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Table 1).

TABLE 1
GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes

In addition to improving glycemic control, studies in patients with diabetes show that GLP-1 receptor agonists produce weight loss. This is an advantage, given that most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese and many also find it difficult to lose weight. Furthermore, there is evidence that weight loss improves glycemic control and has a positive impact on various comorbidities associated with the disease, including cardiovascular risk factors.

Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists go beyond glycemic control and weight reduction alone.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^dc925d15]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Effect of tight glycemic control on pancreatic beta cell function in newly diagnosed pediatric type 1 diabetes… [^5bdcf7d3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Intensive diabetes management with automated insulin delivery did not affect the decline in pancreatic C-peptide secretion at 52 weeks in youths with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Importance Near normalization of glucose levels instituted immediately after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes has been postulated to preserve pancreatic beta cell function by reducing glucotoxicity. Previous studies have been hampered by an inability to achieve tight glycemic goals. Despite advances in technology, youths with type 1 diabetes continue to struggle to meet glycemic targets, with less than 30% achieving the American Diabetes Association goal of a hemoglobin A1c level less than 7%, and consequently most are at risk for vascular complications. 1 Residual pancreatic beta cell function, measured as stimulated C-peptide secretion, is associated with a reduced risk of long-term complications.

2 Methods to preserve beta cell function in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes have been sought due to their potential long-term clinical benefit.
2. It has been postulated that near normalization of glucose levels beginning shortly after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes could help preserve beta cell function by reducing glucotoxicity, which has been shown in rodent models to adversely affect beta cells. 3, 4 One human trial has provided support for the glucotoxicity theory. 5 Recent advances in automated insulin delivery systems enabling improved glycemia6-8 provide the opportunity to test the hypothesis. The mean C-peptide AUC decreased from 0. 57 pmol/mL at baseline to
0. 45 pmol/mL at 52 weeks from diagnosis in the intensive management group and from 0. 60 pmol/mL to
0. 50 pmol/mL at 52 weeks in the standard care group.

The theory that glucose toxicity contributes to beta cell damage gained interest after the publication of a study by Shah et al5 in 1989. In that study, preservation of beta cell function 1 year after diagnosis was achieved in 12 adolescents compared with 14 control participants. This occurred after complete normalization of glucose levels for 2 weeks shortly after diagnosis using a Biostator in an inpatient setting with a target glucose of 60 to 80 mg/dL to achieve beta cell rest.

### The role of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in the remission of type 2 diabetes after gastric bypass surgery [^9c6b9e61]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Bariatric surgery can induce remission in a high proportion of severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Objective

Our objective was to investigate predictors and mechanisms of surgery-induced diabetes remission.

Patients and Setting

Forty-three morbidly obese subjects (body mass index = 45.6 ± 5.0 kg/m(2)), 32 with T2DM and 11 nondiabetic [normal glucose tolerance (NGT)], participated at a clinical research center.

Intervention

Patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

Main Outcome Measures

Diabetes remission and β-cell function were evaluated.

Results

Subjects were tested before and 45 d and 1 yr after surgery. Weight decreased similarly in T2DM and NGT (-39 kg at 1 yr, P < 0.0001). Insulin sensitivity improved in both groups in proportion to the changes in body mass index but remained lower in T2DM than NGT (386 ± 91 vs. 479 ± 89 ml/min · m(2), P < 0.01). Based on glycosylated hemoglobin and oral glucose testing, diabetes had remitted in nine patients at 45 d and in an additional 16 at 1 yr. In T2DM, β-cell glucose sensitivity increased early after surgery but was no further improved and still abnormal at 1 yr [median, 48 (coefficient interval, 53) pmol/min · m(2) · mm vs. median, 100 (coefficient interval, 68) of NGT, P < 0.001]. Baseline β-cell glucose sensitivity was progressively worse in early remitters, late remitters, and nonremitters (median, 54[coefficient interval, 50] vs. median, 22[coefficient interval, 26] vs. median, 4[coefficient interval, 10] pmol/min · m(2) · mm) and, by logistic regression, was the only predictor of failure [odds ratio for bottom tertile = 7.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.2–51.9); P = 0.03].

Conclusions

In morbid obesity, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass causes rapid and profound metabolic adaptations; insulin sensitivity improves in proportion to the weight loss, and β-cell glucose sensitivity increases independently of weight loss. Over a period of 1 yr after surgery, diabetes remission depends on the starting degree of β-cell dysfunction.

### Relationship between A1c and fasting plasma glucose in dysglycemia or type 2 diabetes: an analysis of baseline data from the ORIGIN trial [^ab9a313e]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The relationship between FPG and A1C is particularly relevant for FPG levels between 5.6 and 9.0 mmol/L, as patients with diabetes typically have FPG in this range. For persons not taking any OAD, the slope of the relationship indicated a 0.43% higher A1C for each 1 mmol/L of FPG concentration. For individuals taking an OAD, this relationship was significantly blunted, with a 0.25% higher A1C for every 1 mmol/L higher FPG within this range. The linear relationship between FPG and A1C in both these subgroups (albeit with different slopes) and the fact that the A1C measurement is known to reflect both fasting and nonfasting hyperglycemia suggest that fasting and nonfasting glucose levels generally change in parallel within this range.

Why the FPG-A1C relationship was altered when OADs were used is unknown. One possible explanation is that both metformin and sulfonylureas (the most commonly used OADs) lower FPG more than nonfasting glucose levels. Another is that drug-naïve individuals are less inclined to attempt lifestyle interventions or less likely to be checking their glucose levels because they either do not have a diagnosis of diabetes or are not taking a drug that can affect glycemic patterns. Whatever the mechanisms for the effect of OAD therapy, both clinical management and interpretation of epidemiologic data may be illuminated by this alteration of the FPG-A1C relationship. In contrast, the absence of differences in the FPG-A1C relationship across different populations suggests that FPG levels are much more strongly related to A1C levels than to any variables associated with either geography or ethnicity, whether genetic or behavioral in origin.

Remission aims and monitoring — Consensus was reached that remission is the optimal outcome for adults with T2D, that remission is a realistic and achievable goal for some, but not all, adults with T2D, and that preventing the long-term known microvascular and macrovascular complications related to diabetes is paramount even in the absence of remission; there was consensus that insulin resistance can be measured using homeostatic model assessment for assessing insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and/or homeostatic model assessment for assessing beta-cell function (HOMA-beta).

Bromocriptine-QR

Bromocriptine-QR is a quick-release formulation of bromocriptine mesylate. When added to antihyperglycemic therapy, bromocriptine-QR can provide significant improvement in glycemic control relative to placebo (0.5–0.8% lowering of A1C). Bromocriptine-QR simultaneously and significantly reduces fasting and postprandial free fatty acids by 19% and TG levels by 29%, with no changes in LDL-C or HDL-C levels. In a 52-week safety trial of bromocriptine-QR versus placebo, bromocriptine-QR treatment resulted in a 39% relative risk reduction in a prespecified composite CV endpoint (P = 0.0346) and a 52% relative risk reduction in the MACE endpoint (P < 0.05).

α-Glucosidase inhibitors

α-Glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) slow the rate of polysaccharide digestion in the proximal small intestine by inhibiting the gut enzyme that breaks down complex carbohydrates (α-glucosidase), thus delaying polysaccharide absorption. This inhibition dramatically reduces the postprandial glycemic peaks and overall postprandial blood glucose levels, resulting in a moderate (0.5–0.8%) reduction in A1C post-load insulin levels, but not plasma lipids. In a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials, acarbose did not significantly alter total cholesterol levels, but was associated with reductions in TG and increases in HDL-C levels. In a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial of acarbose compared with nateglinide in Chinese patients with T2DM, neither drug had significant effects on total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, or non-HDL-C levels; however, acarbose was associated with significantly greater reductions in fasting and postprandial TG levels compared with nateglinide. In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, patients with impaired glucose tolerance (a key component of prediabetes) who received acarbose had a 49% relative risk reduction in the development of CV events, and a 91% relative risk reduction in MI compared to controls. Studies suggest that such reductions in CV risk are related to improvements in postprandial endothelial function.

### Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among individuals on basal insulin requiring treatment intensification [^bd30be12]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to impaired insulin response, individuals with Type 2 diabetes have defects in the regulation of glucagon secretion 13. In individuals with Type 2 diabetes, plasma glucagon concentrations are inappropriately elevated in the fasting state and do not decrease after carbohydrate ingestion as they do in those without Type 2 diabetes, thus contributing to both elevated fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions 13.

Because there are multiple pathophysiological defects in Type 2 diabetes, the use of treatments with different, complementary mechanisms of action is likely to be more effective in achieving glycaemic control 16. While both basal insulin and incretin therapies effectively reduce fasting glucose levels, incretin therapies also reduce PPG 17 and glucagon 18. Studies in patients with Type 1 diabetes have shown that GLP‐1RAs can improve glycaemic control even among those with little to no β‐cell function, suggesting that glucagon control may be particularly influential in those with long‐term Type 2 diabetes 19. Indeed, subgroup analyses of GLP‐1RA clinical trial data indicate that GLP‐1RAs are also effective in individuals with longer Type 2 diabetes duration, which is associated with greater deterioration of β‐cell function 20, 21, 22, 23. Moreover, data from clinical trials, reviewed by Grandy et al. 24, indicate that β‐cell function improves during treatment with GLP‐1RAs.

Type 1 diabetes adjunctive therapy — glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium–glucose cotransporter inhibitors — shows mixed benefits and safety/approval considerations. In T1D, liraglutide produced "a reduction of A1C of 0.4% with the highest 1.8 mg dose in addition to a 5 kg weight loss", yet "the added hypoglycemia and ketosis noted has resulted in no attempt for FDA approval in T1D". For SGLT2i/SGLT1/2i, "In one meta-analysis of 14 studies and with 4591 participants, A1C was reduced by 0.4% with a 2.7 kg weight loss", but "A 3.38-fold increased risk of DKA (often euglycemic, now generally defined as a BG less than 250 mg/dL) has resulted in no approval in T1D in the United States", although "the European Medicine Agency has approved dapagliflozin (5 mg) and sotagliflozin (200 mg) for those with T1D and a BMI above 27 kg/m2".

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in diabetes mellitus [^ab66a70c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

Although antidiabetic agents have been developed to target one or more of the core defects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), many patients do not achieve glycemic goals. Inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) induces glycosuria, reduces glucose toxicity and improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. As the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is different from other agents and completely insulin-independent, the use of these drugs might potentially be efficacious alone or in combination with any other antidiabetic drug, including insulin. Dapagliflozin is a highly selective and reversible SGLT2 inhibitor approved for use in adult patients with T2DM as monotherapy in patients intolerant of metformin or as adjunctive therapy in patients inadequately controlled on existing antidiabetic medications, including insulin. A literature search conducted using PubMed identified key publications related to the use of dapagliflozin in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus. No date limits were applied. This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of this SGLT2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin produces dose-related reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as monotherapy and as add-on to other antidiabetic agents, with significant reductions in body weight. Hypoglycemia is uncommon. Preliminary data from a phase 2 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study suggest that dapagliflozin may also improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Clinical trials published to date show that dapagliflozin is safe and effective as monotherapy or as an add-on to insulin or oral antidiabetic agents in patients with T2DM.

Adults and older adults with T2D — All adults with T2D should follow the same recommendations, with no more than 2 consecutive days between bouts due to the transient nature of exercise-induced improvements in insulin action; in older adults, resistance exercise training results in 10%–15% improvement in strength, bone mineral density, lean mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, and insulin sensitivity along with threefold greater reductions in A1C, and interventions that combine aerobic and resistance training may be superior to either one alone; adults unable to meet current recommendations should focus on improving on functional fitness and balance, and limitations to joint mobility may be accelerated by hyperglycemia.

### Exercise / physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine [^30a463f7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). High credibility.

Impact of aerobic, resistance, and combined exercise on glycemic management in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D): Vigorous aerobic exercise training for 7 d may improve glycemia without lowering body weight; meta-analyses report 0.5%–0.7% reductions in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) with regular aerobic training, and regular training improves insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood pressure, other metabolic parameters, and fitness levels, even without weight loss; resistance exercise training typically results in 10%–15% improvements in strength, bone mineral density, blood pressure, lipid profiles, skeletal muscle mass, and insulin sensitivity, and a meta-analysis suggests high-intensity resistance training is more beneficial than low-to-moderate-intensity training for overall glucose management and attenuation of insulin levels; combined aerobic and resistance training may be superior to either alone, with trials noting greater A1C reduction compared with either type alone and significant A1C improvements versus nonexercising controls when neither single modality changed A1C.

### Can glycemic targets be achieved – in particular with two daily injections of a mix of intermediate-and short-acting insulin? [^2ddab853]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To present data that demonstrate the feasibility of using twice-daily insulin injections, in combination with selected orally administered agents, to achieve glycemic targets in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Recent studies of the effects of various therapeutic strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes are reviewed, and the rationale for and recommended approaches in the use of combination treatment to achieve glycemic goals are discussed.

Results

The combination of insulin and insulin sensitizers is an effective option for achieving glycemic goals (hemoglobin A1c pound 6.5%). Although thiazolidinediones are better sensitizers than metformin, they are associated with significant weight gain. In contradistinction, metformin, an effective insulin sensitizer, causes less weight gain. The sequence in which these two sensitizers are added to insulin therapy is important; if metformin is added before a thiazolidinedione, weight gain may be avoided.

Conclusion

Glycemic targets can be achieved with use of twice-daily mixtures of intermediate- and short-acting insulin in a high percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes.

α-Glucosidase inhibitors.

α-Glucosidase inhibitors reduce the rate of digestion of polysaccharides in the proximal small intestine, primarily lowering postprandial glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia. They are less effective in lowering glycemia than metformin or the sulfonylureas, reducing A1C levels by 0.5–0.8 percentage points. Since carbohydrate is absorbed more distally, malabsorption and weight loss do not occur; however, increased delivery of carbohydrate to the colon commonly results in increased gas production and gastrointestinal symptoms. In clinical trials, 25–45% of participants have discontinued α-glucosidase inhibitor use as a result of this side effect.

One clinical trial examining acarbose as a means of preventing the development of diabetes in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance showed an unexpected reduction in severe CVD outcomes. This potential benefit of α-glucosidase inhibitors needs to be confirmed.

Glycemic control.

Thiazolidinediones are potent insulin sensitizers in liver/muscle/adipocytes (,–), augment/preserve β-cell function, and produce durable HbA 1c reduction in T2DM. In eight of eight long-term (> 1.5 years), double-blind, or active comparator studies (Fig. 1), thiazolidinediones caused durable HbA 1c reduction (rev. in) lasting up to 5–6 years. Their durable effect on glycemic control results from combined action to both augment β-cell function and enhance insulin sensitivity. In T2DM patients with starting HbA 1c 8.0–8.5%, one can expect a 1.0–1.5% decrease in HbA 1c. Thiazolidinediones are approved for monotherapy and add-on therapy to all oral hypoglycemic agents, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs, and insulin.

Figure 1
Thiazolidinediones produce a sustained long-term reduction in HbA 1c in eight of eight double-blind or placebo- or active-comparator controlled studies. (See text for a more detailed discussion.) Reprinted with permission from DeFronzo.

Insulin sensitivity in liver and muscle.

In liver, thiazolidinediones augment insulin sensitivity and inhibit gluconeogenesis, leading to reduction in fasting plasma glucose concentration. In muscle, thiazolidinediones are the only true insulin sensitizers, producing a decline in postprandial glucose levels. Metformin is a weak insulin sensitizer in muscle, and it has been difficult to demonstrate a muscle insulin-sensitizing effect in absence of weight loss. Thiazolidinedione-mediated improvement in insulin sensitivity in T2DM is mediated via multiple mechanisms: PPARγ activation, enhanced insulin signaling, increased glucose transport, enhanced glycogen synthesis, improved mitochondrial function, and fat mobilization out of muscle/liver, i.e. reversal of lipotoxicity (,–). Recent studies suggest that metabolic effects of thiazolidinediones are mediated by mitochondrial target of thiazolidinediones, mtot1 and mtot2, which represent the pyruvate transporter.

Evidence base 2.1 — Outpatient glucose targets for nongeriatric adults — It has been accepted that strategies aimed at lowering glucose concentrations can lead to lower rates of microvascular and perhaps macrovascular complications. The ADVANCE trial intensive therapy group targeted an A1C < 6.5%. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, mortality increased with increasing A1C among intensively treated persons, whereas mortality only affected persons whose A1C remained > 7%. Epidemiologic evidence shows a continuous relationship between A1C and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all‑cause mortality, yet no RCTs have yet established optimal glycemic targets in persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Some newer therapies carry a lower risk of hypoglycemia, which may enable more persons to safely achieve individualized lower A1C levels; for persons with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple ASCVD risk factors, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), a GLP‑1 RA or an SGLT2i with demonstrated CVD benefit is recommended as part of a glucose‑lowering regimen independent of A1C.

### Type 2 diabetes remission and lifestyle medicine: a position statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^33b2e6fb]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission — lifestyle intervention evidence indicates that interventions used a variety of lifestyle modifications, typically involving diet and exercise, with definitions of remission varying across studies and including serum glucose measures alone or combined with other measures and being medication-free. The evidence base comprised The 5 therapeutic studies (Table 2) and The 4 subtherapeutic studies (Table 3); in the subtherapeutic group, Two studies were randomized, and 2 studies used a single-arm pre-post design. The literature review supports the feasibility of T2D remission in diabetic patient populations using lifestyle as a primary means of treatment. Although physical activity appeared to have a minor role compared to diet, most studies increased physical activity and some achieved remission without an increased exercise protocol; nevertheless, physical activity has been shown to improve insulin resistance and beta-cell function. In subtherapeutic studies, weight loss had a weighted mean of 7.7 lbs.

### Putative protective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on atrial fibrillation through risk factor modulation and off-target actions: potential mechanisms and future directions [^c42ccf6d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The post hoc analysis of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial demonstrated a reduction in AF incidence in diabetes mellitus patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. The mechanism for this reduction in AF is unknown. Possible mechanisms for the SGLT2 inhibitor-induced reduction in incident AF include reduction in epicardial fat inhibiting pathological atrial remodeling and rapid improvement in left ventricular diastolic function ameliorating hemodynamic stress on the atrium and pulmonary veins. Off-target interactions by the drugs potentially mitigating cardiomyocyte ionic imbalance and ameliorating oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction are ancillary mechanisms worth exploring as well. Given the modest reductions in hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, these are unlikely to be predominant mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce AF. Biochemical, functional, and structural studies as highlighted in this review will further help elucidate the mechanistic bases for the observed beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on incident AF.

### Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone add-on in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin and dapagliflozin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^ab54b181]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The primary findings demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c with pioglitazone add‐on therapy, accompanied by substantially higher achievement rates of both HbA1c < 7% and < 6.5% targets. These improvements in glycaemic control were consistent across studies, as evidenced by the negligible heterogeneity in our analyses. The magnitude of HbA1c reduction likely reflects pioglitazone's complementary mechanism of action, enhancing insulin sensitivity through PPAR‐γ activation, while working synergistically with the glucose excretion effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin's reduction of hepatic glucose production.

Secondary outcomes revealed meaningful improvements in several metabolic parameters, including fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), supporting pioglitazone's insulin‐sensitising effects. As measured by HOMA‐β, beta‐cell function remained unchanged, suggesting that pioglitazone's primary mechanism operates through insulin sensitisation rather than beta‐cell preservation.

The lipid profile remained largely stable, with no significant alterations in total cholesterol, LDL‐C, or triglycerides. The observed increase in HDL‐C aligns with pioglitazone's known beneficial effects on lipid metabolism. Notably, adding pioglitazone did not significantly impact most cardiovascular parameters, except for a modest reduction in diastolic blood pressure. The neutral effect on these parameters is particularly noteworthy as it suggests that pioglitazone addition does not adversely affect the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. However, the anticipated side effect of weight gain (MD: 2.03 kg) was confirmed, though this may have been partially attenuated by the concurrent use of SGLT2 inhibitors. The complementary cardiovascular mechanisms of these agents merit consideration. SGLT2 inhibitors primarily reduce heart failure hospitalisation through hemodynamic effects, while pioglitazone's cardiovascular benefits appear mediated through impacts on coronary atherosclerosis progression as demonstrated in the PERISCOPE trial and suggested in the PROactive study. This mechanistic complementarity provides a theoretical basis for additive cardiovascular protection, though longer‐duration studies are needed to confirm combined effects.

### Role of reduced β-cell mass versus impaired β-cell function in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes [^5f95d562]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Working model for the impact of reduced β-cell mass on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, β-cell mass is reduced by ∼20–65%, leading to impaired and delayed insulin secretion and a specific reduction in the amplitude of pulsatile insulin secretion. The reduction of insulin secretion and insulin pulsatility leads to disruption of the intraislet insulin-glucagon cross-talk, causing insufficient suppression of glucagon release. Reduced pulsatile insulin secretion impairs hepatic insulin signaling and perturbs peripheral insulin action. Increased hepatic glucose release is further augmented by the exaggerated glucagon concentrations. Together, these defects cause hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^a3f74b3f]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

Results

Study design and participants

Six months after surgery and weight loss, the patients had a significantly lower waist circumference (n = 15; p < 0.0001), BMI (p < 0.0001), and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0025) (Table 1).

Post-operatively, there was a significant reduction in insulin (p = 0.0042), fasting glucose (p = 0.0312), and hemoglobin A1c (p < 0.0071) and an improvement in pancreatic beta-cell function (homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function; p < 0.01) and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; p = 0.0023). After surgery serum levels of adiponectin increased significantly (p = 0.0197), and leptin decreased (p = 0.0014), but resistin levels did not change significantly (p = 0.0796).

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^6a59c1d9]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and > 30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

### Canagliflozin compared with sitagliptin for patients with type 2 diabetes who do not have adequate glycemic control with metformin plus sulfonylurea: a 52-week randomized trial [^d4ba3b91]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

For patients with type 2 diabetes to achieve and maintain glycemic control, combination therapies with AHAs are often needed. However, currently available AHAs have decreased efficacy over time and some have side effects, including weight gain or increased risk of hypoglycemia. Inhibition of SGLT2 and increasing UGE is a novel insulin-independent approach to lowering plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes that is associated with caloric loss and low risk of hypoglycemia. SGLT2 inhibitors therefore may present a new therapeutic option that provides a mechanism of action that is complementary to those of other AHAs.

In this phase 3 study of subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin plus sulfonylurea, the addition of canagliflozin 300 mg provided a significantly greater reduction in A1C compared with sitagliptin 100 mg at 52 weeks. Significantly greater reductions in FPG also were observed with canagliflozin compared with sitagliptin. Both medications lowered postmeal glucose levels, with numerically greater reductions seen with canagliflozin, as shown by similar decreases in incremental glucose after the meal with both agents; however, canagliflozin provided substantially greater premeal reductions in glucose. The effects of canagliflozin in lowering A1C and FPG were sustained over 52 weeks of treatment, whereas increases from the achieved nadirs in A1C and FPG were observed with sitagliptin. The results with sitagliptin in the current study, both with regard to the pattern of change over time and the extent of A1C-lowering efficacy, are consistent with the 52-week results seen in a previous sitagliptin study (in particular, comparing the primary per-protocol analysis reported in the previous study with the per-protocol analysis results from the current study) considering baseline differences in glycemic control.

### Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide improves beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes [^46a2e300]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This post hoc exploratory biomarker study investigated the effects of the once-weekly novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, on markers of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in adult subjects with T2D. Beta-cell function was enhanced and fasting glucagon levels were reduced to a greater extent by tirzepatide than by the selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, dulaglutide. Tirzepatide improved multiple markers of pancreatic beta-cell function as shown by dose-dependently increasing HOMA2-B indices and decreasing proinsulin levels, proinsulin/C-peptide ratios, and proinsulin/insulin ratios. Proinsulin, the most abundant secretory protein in the beta cell, is a major driver of protein load to the endoplasmic reticulum under conditions of increased metabolic demand for insulin production. Proinsulin is prone to misfolding, and the ability for pancreatic beta cells to compensate for increased metabolic demand for insulin production in T2D may depend on their response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Impaired conversion of proinsulin to insulin is a central component of beta-cell dysfunction in T2D. Elevated proinsulin levels predict both worsening of hyperglycemia and progression of nondiabetic subjects to T2D in longitudinal cohorts. Accordingly, tirzepatide-mediated decreases in proinsulin levels may be indicative of improvements in pancreatic beta-cell health.
