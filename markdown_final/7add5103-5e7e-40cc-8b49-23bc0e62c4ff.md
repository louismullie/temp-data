## Question

Can binocular diplopia cause extraocular muscle fatigue and weakness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether binocular diplopia can cause extraocular muscle fatigue and weakness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causal relationship between binocular diplopia and extraocular muscle function. Then, I should verify whether diplopia is a symptom of muscle weakness versus a cause of it. Next, I will examine whether sustained diplopia could secondarily fatigue muscles through compensatory mechanisms. After that, I should review disease-specific contexts like myasthenia gravis and thyroid eye disease to see how the symptom–mechanism relationship plays out. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and ensure it aligns with authoritative guidance and pathophysiology.

> Let me first confirm the basic premise: binocular diplopia arises when the visual axes are misaligned, forcing the brain to perceive two images. Clinically, diplopia is a symptom of ocular misalignment, not a primary disease mechanism, so I need to be careful not to invert cause and effect here.

> Wait, let me verify the directionality of causation. Diplopia is typically a downstream manifestation of extraocular muscle weakness, restriction, or cranial nerve palsy. For example, in myasthenia gravis, fatigable weakness of the extraocular muscles produces ptosis and diplopia, and in thyroid eye disease, restrictive myopathy and orbital mechanics cause misalignment and diplopia, so diplopia signals underlying muscle dysfunction rather than causing it [^1166zDEp] [^113DuAGJ] [^112rSCiv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could persistent diplopia itself fatigue the extraocular muscles through compensatory effort? I need to check whether sustained fusional vergence demand could overwork muscles. Enhanced vertical fusional vergence can transiently compensate for misalignment, but this represents increased muscular effort to maintain single vision; while this could theoretically contribute to asthenopia, the primary driver of weakness remains the underlying neuromuscular or mechanical pathology, not the diplopia per se [^1135ryuB] [^115S169t].

> I will now examine disease-specific contexts to ensure I'm not missing an exception. In myasthenia gravis, extraocular muscles are uniquely vulnerable to fatigability due to impaired neuromuscular transmission. Diplopia and ptosis fluctuate with sustained gaze and worsen with fatigue, but the weakness precedes and explains the diplopia, not vice versa — this is reinforced by diagnostic tests that probe ocular fatigability and by the clinical course of ocular MG [^1166zDEp] [^116La4ah] [^116FwgVz]. In thyroid eye disease, diplopia reflects restrictive myopathy and orbital tissue changes. Again, the muscle/restriction problem causes diplopia, not the other way around [^112rSCiv].

> But wait, what if the patient reports that diplopia gets worse when they're tired — doesn't that imply diplopia causes fatigue? Hmm, wait a minute, that's a common misinterpretation. In MG and related disorders, fatigue worsens the underlying muscle weakness, which then increases ocular misalignment and makes diplopia more apparent, so the causal arrow still points from weakness to diplopia, even if the symptom fluctuates with energy state [^1166zDEp] [^11439f32].

> Next, I should review whether any authoritative sources describe diplopia as a primary cause of extraocular muscle fatigue. I need to ensure I'm aligned with guidelines and reviews: the AAO Preferred Practice Patterns frame diplopia as a target symptom for treatment and recognize that extraocular muscle weakness or restriction produces diplopia; they do not describe diplopia as an etiologic cause of muscle fatigue, which supports the conclusion that diplopia is a consequence, not a cause, of muscle dysfunction [^112a2398] [^112dgxrD].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the logic before concluding. Binocular diplopia reflects misalignment due to weakness, restriction, or cranial nerve palsy; while patients may exert extra fusional effort that can lead to asthenopia, the fundamental muscle weakness or restriction is generated by the underlying disease process, not by the diplopia itself, so diplopia does not cause extraocular muscle fatigue or weakness in a primary pathophysiologic sense [^112oyBGg] [^1135ryuB] [^1166zDEp].

> Final answer: No, binocular diplopia does not cause extraocular muscle fatigue or weakness. Rather, extraocular muscle fatigue and weakness cause binocular diplopia, and persistent diplopia may prompt compensatory efforts that contribute to asthenopia without reversing the causal relationship [^1166zDEp] [^112oyBGg] [^1135ryuB].

Binocular diplopia does not directly cause extraocular muscle fatigue or weakness; instead, it is a symptom of underlying EOM weakness or dysfunction [^112oyBGg] [^114KbH1x]. However, persistent diplopia can lead to **compensatory overuse** of EOMs and sensory fusion mechanisms, causing asthenopia and fatigue-like symptoms [^115S169t] [^112Xzmpq]. True EOM weakness or fatigue is typically due to neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g. myasthenia gravis) [^111nzZ2f], cranial nerve palsies [^112zy1HP], or restrictive/myopathic processes [^112rSCiv], not the diplopia itself [^112oyBGg]. Management targets the underlying cause to reduce diplopia and relieve fatigue [^112dgxrD].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking binocular diplopia to extraocular muscle fatigue

Binocular diplopia arises when the visual axes are misaligned, forcing the brain to process two disparate images [^112oyBGg]. This misalignment can result from:

- **Neuromuscular junction disorders**: Myasthenia gravis (MG) causes fluctuating, fatigable weakness of EOMs, leading to diplopia and ptosis [^111nzZ2f] [^1166zDEp].

- **Cranial nerve palsies**: Third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsies cause specific patterns of EOM weakness and diplopia [^114iptvo].

- **Restrictive or myopathic processes**: Thyroid eye disease, orbital myositis, or chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) restrict EOM movement, causing diplopia [^112rSCiv] [^111MS1er] [^117P9dXH].

In these conditions, **EOM weakness or restriction is the primary cause** of diplopia, not vice versa [^112oyBGg].

---

## Compensatory mechanisms and fatigue

Although diplopia does not directly cause EOM weakness, it can trigger compensatory mechanisms that lead to fatigue-like symptoms:

- **Compensatory overuse**: Patients may involuntarily increase EOM activity and engage sensory fusion mechanisms to maintain alignment, causing asthenopia and fatigue [^115S169t] [^112Xzmpq].

- **Sensory fusion fatigue**: Prolonged effort to fuse disparate images can cause sensory fatigue, manifesting as eye strain and discomfort [^notfound].

- **Head posture compensation**: Patients adopt compensatory head positions (e.g. chin elevation, head tilt) to reduce diplopia, leading to neck and shoulder fatigue [^113ZsksS].

These compensatory behaviors can produce significant discomfort and fatigue, but they **do not constitute true EOM weakness** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

Several studies have investigated the relationship between diplopia and EOM fatigue:

- **Myasthenia gravis**: MG patients experience fatigable EOM weakness, causing diplopia. Eye-tracking studies show fixation instability and fatigue during sustained upward gaze, reflecting EOM fatigability rather than diplopia-induced weakness [^112u4eGj] [^116FwgVz].

- **Convergence insufficiency**: Patients with convergence insufficiency report eye fatigue and diplopia during near work, reflecting fatigue of convergence mechanisms rather than primary EOM weakness [^112Xzmpq] [^1168NeE6].

- **Thyroid eye disease**: Restrictive myopathy in thyroid eye disease causes diplopia and fatigue-like symptoms due to mechanical restriction, not primary EOM weakness [^114iptvo] [^112rSCiv].

These findings indicate that **fatigue-like symptoms** associated with diplopia are typically secondary to compensatory mechanisms or underlying neuromuscular or restrictive conditions, rather than direct fatigue of the EOMs themselves [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Understanding the relationship between diplopia and EOM fatigue has important clinical implications:

- **Accurate diagnosis**: Differentiating true EOM weakness from compensatory fatigue is essential for targeted treatment [^notfound].

- **Treatment of underlying causes**: Addressing the root cause (e.g. MG, cranial nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease) effectively reduces diplopia and associated fatigue [^11439f32] [^113U2RTh].

- **Symptomatic relief**: Prisms, vision therapy, and surgical interventions can reduce diplopia and alleviate compensatory fatigue [^113U2RTh] [^111ns3qP].

---

Binocular diplopia does not directly cause extraocular muscle fatigue or weakness; rather, it is a symptom of underlying EOM dysfunction [^112oyBGg]. Persistent diplopia can lead to **compensatory overuse** and sensory fusion fatigue, causing asthenopia and discomfort [^115S169t]. Effective management requires identifying and treating the underlying cause of diplopia to reduce fatigue and improve quality of life [^113tAikh].

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^117T4cyw]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Esotropia & Exotropia PPP — pharmacological injection describes chemodenervation by injection of botulinum toxin into one or more extraocular muscles, which induces a temporary weakness by pharmacologically blockading the neuromuscular junction; favorable prognostic indicators include good vision in each eye, absence of restricted eye movement, a small to moderate angle of esotropia, and the potential for binocular vision. Such treatment may be an alternative to conventional extraocular muscle surgery in selected patients, but its value in managing infantile esotropia has not been definitively established and is rated (++, Moderate, Discretionary). Documented drawbacks and safety issues include that a disadvantage is that repeat injections are frequently needed, risks of treatment include ptosis, vertical deviations, globe perforation, and tonic pupil, and because treatment is administered by injection, complications relate principally to trauma from the needle or toxin leakage, for which careful injection technique and preinjection counseling are essential. The text also cautions that delayed binocular realignment may be disadvantageous in an infant with a rapidly developing visual system and notes that bupivacaine can also be injected into extraocular muscles to strengthen muscles either in combination with chemodenervation of an antagonistic muscle with botulinum toxin or in combination with extraocular muscle surgery.

Background

Description of the condition

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease whereby the person's immune system produces antibodies against components of the neuromuscular junction, where the nerves controlling muscle movement meet the muscles. Myasthenia gravis is the most commonly acquired disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction, with an incidence of around 15.7 cases per million person‐years and a prevalence of 20 to 475 cases per million person‐years. The incidence and prevalence of myasthenia gravis are increasing, particularly in older people. People with myasthenia gravis present with weakness that gets progressively worse the more the muscle is used (known as fatigability), and it commonly affects the ocular (eye), bulbar (swallowing and speech), respiratory (breathing), and proximal limb muscles (those closest to the centre of the body, specifically in the shoulders, upper arms, hips, and thighs). The clinical severity of myasthenia gravis can vary greatly; ranging from mild ocular symptoms, such as double vision (diplopia) and drooping of the eyelids (ptosis), to frequent and severe bulbar and respiratory crises requiring hospital admission.

Diplopia

Ongoing postoperative diplopia should be closely evaluated since treatment options differ widely based on its physiologic cause. In hemifield slide, diplopia arises because of insufficient overlapping visual field data points to create a unified visual perception. Diplopia caused by hemifield slide from bitemporal hemianopsia can be improved with prism glasses if there are sufficient unimpaired corresponding bilateral nasal visual field regions. Urgent referrals to neuro-ophthalmologists and optometrists should be considered if hemifield slide remains on the first postoperative visit.

Steroids can improve diplopia from cranial nerve palsies by reducing inflammatory edema, but do not address underlying compression by the underlying pituitary lesion and have debilitating side effects when used chronically. A short course of steroids may be appropriate postoperatively if cranial nerve palsies result from preoperative apoplexy or intraoperative manipulation and irritation. However, the benefit of steroids should be weighed against their impact on confounding the evaluation of the adrenocortical axis.

When diplopia from cranial nerve palsies persists, there is a similar stepwise progression of treatment that often includes attempts at correction with visual therapy, correctional lenses, botulinum toxin, and surgery in severe cases. All patients with postoperative binocular diplopia should be considered for a referral for orthotopic visual therapy. This therapy was developed to treat orbital trauma that causes extraocular muscle damage or palsies and may be helpful for diplopia acquired from tumor compression or iatrogenic damage during surgery. There are several online resources that patients can use to self-administer orthotopic visual therapy that are relatively cost-effective. Correctional lenses can be used concurrently as diplopia improves or as a treatment for fixed diplopia. Prism lenses refract light at specific angles to correct ocular misalignment. They allow the neuro-ophthalmologist to correct diplopia by adjusting hemifields up to 30°C to create overlap between divergent visual fields.

### Medical and surgical treatment for ocular myasthenia [^1121ntLa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis present initially with purely ocular symptoms, so called ocular myasthenia and between 50 to 60% of these people will progress to develop generalized disease. The vast majority will do so within the first one to two years. There is controversy surrounding the appropriate management of patients with ocular myasthenia.

Objectives

To perform a systematic review of the literature relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any medical or surgical treatments that have an impact on the risk of progression from ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis? Are there any medical or surgical treatments that improve symptoms of diplopia or ptosis in ocular myasthenia? What is the frequency of side effects associated with treatments used in people with ocular myasthenia?

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched December 2004), MEDLINE (1996 to 2004) and EMBASE (1980 to 2004) for randomized controlled trials as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full text of all articles that were of possible relevance was reviewed in full. The references of all manuscripts included in the review were scanned to identify additional articles of relevance and experts in the field were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary and possible, we contacted authors for further information.

Selection Criteria

To be included in the review, studies had to meet three criteria: (a) randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled study design; (b) active treatment compared to placebo, no treatment or some other treatment; and (c) results reported separately for patients with ocular myasthenia (grade 1) as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data regarding the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, improvement in ocular symptoms, and the frequency of treatment-related side effects.

Main Results

We identified two randomized controlled trials relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia, only one of which reported results in terms of the pre-specified outcome measures used in this review. This study included only three participants and was of limited methodological quality. In the absence of data from randomized controlled trials, we present a review of the available observational data.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no data from randomized controlled trials on the impact of any form of treatment on the risk of progression from ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis. The available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. Data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.

### Myasthenia gravis – a rare presentation with tongue atrophy and fasciculation [^117HPGkt]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

We report the case of an unusual presentation of myasthenia gravis with tongue atrophy and fasciculation. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition associated with weakness and fatigability of voluntary muscles. In > 50%, the initial symptoms and signs are related to extraocular muscle weakness, such as diplopia or ptosis [Tsung K, Seggev JS. An unusual cause of dysphagia. West J Med 1995; 163: 159–60]. Rarely, it is known to affect bulbar muscles and can lead to dysphagia and respiratory compromise.

Background

Approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis present with purely ocular symptoms, so called ocular myasthenia. Of these between 50% to 60% develop generalized disease, most within two years. Their management is controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2008 and 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any treatments that impact the progression from ocular to generalized disease? Are there any treatments that improve symptoms of diplopia or ptosis? What is the frequency of adverse effects associated with treatments used?

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (3 August 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1996 to July 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2012) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full texts of possibly relevant articles were reviewed. The references of all manuscripts included in the review were scanned to identify additional articles of relevance and experts in the field were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary, we contacted authors for further information.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion required meeting three criteria: (a) randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled study design; (b) active treatment compared to placebo, no treatment or some other treatment; and (c) results reported separately for patients with ocular myasthenia (grade 1) as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data regarding the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, improvement in ocular symptoms, and the frequency of treatment-related side effects.

Main Results

In the original review, we identified two RCTs relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia, only one of which reported results in terms of the pre-specified outcome measures used in this review. This study included only three participants and was of limited methodological quality. There were no new RCTs in searches conducted for this or previous updates. In the absence of data from RCTs, we present a review of the available observational data.

Authors' Conclusions

The available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. Data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.

### Botulinum toxin type a (Dysport) [^1142yqgD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Common Adverse Reactions

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in 5% or more of patients who received 500 Units of DYSPORT in the placebo-controlled clinical trials) in cervical dystonia patients were: muscular weakness, dysphagia, dry mouth, injection site discomfort, fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, dysphonia, injection site pain and eye disorders (consisting of blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity and accommodation). Other than injection site reactions, most adverse reactions became noticeable about one week after treatment and lasted several weeks.

The rates of adverse reactions were higher in the combined controlled and open-label experience than in the placebo-controlled trials.

During the clinical studies, two patients (< 1%) experienced adverse reactions leading to withdrawal. One patient experienced disturbance in attention, eyelid disorder, feeling abnormal and headache, and one patient experienced dysphagia.

Table 7 compares the incidence of the most frequent adverse reactions from a single treatment cycle of 500 Units of DYSPORT compared to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Dose-response relationships for common adverse reactions in a randomized multiple fixed-dose study in which the total dose was divided between two muscles (the sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis) are shown in Table 8.

Injection Site Reactions

Injection site discomfort and injection site pain were common adverse reactions following DYSPORT administration.

Less Common Adverse Reactions

The following adverse reactions were reported less frequently (< 5%).

Breathing Difficulty

Breathing difficulties were reported by approximately 3% of patients following DYSPORTadministration and in 1% of placebo patients in clinical trials during the double-blind phase. These consisted mainly of dyspnea. The median time to onset from last dose of DYSPORT was approximately one week, and the median duration was approximately three weeks.

Other adverse reactions with incidences of less than 5% in the DYSPORT 500 Units group in the double-blind phase of clinical trials included dizziness in 3.5% of DYSPORT-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients, and muscle atrophy in 1% of DYSPORT-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients.

Laboratory Findings

Patients treated with DYSPORTexhibited a small increase from baseline (0.23 mol/L) in mean blood glucose relative to placebo-treated patients. This was not clinically significant among patients in the development program but could be a factor in patients whose diabetes is difficult to control.

### Prevalence of non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies and age-related changes in binocular vision among middle-aged and older adults: a systematic review [^113YJDRs]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Prevalence of NSBVAs in middle-aged and older adults

Strabismic binocular vision disorders are also significant and should not be overlooked. Examples include 6th nerve palsy, which impairs eye movement due to dysfunction in the cranial nerve controlling the lateral rectus muscle, and decompensated 4th nerve palsy, often causing vertical diplopia and head tilt due to superior oblique muscle weakness. Sagging eye syndrome has been identified as an age-related disorder where weakened extraocular muscles lead to ocular misalignment and binocular diplopia. While these conditions have clinical importance, this review focused on non-strabismic binocular vision disorders. Limiting the scope allowed for a more focused analysis of their mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated significant variations in the prevalence of NSBVAs. This variability can likely be attributed to multiple confounding factors such as age, diagnostic criteria, examination methods, study design, population characteristics, and medication use.

### Fixation stability of the upward gaze in patients with myasthenia gravis: an eye-tracker study [^115Xyeg1]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

The present study showed no significant changes in BCEA and SD of Y over time (determined by comparing three consecutive 20 s periods) in normal subjects, in MG subjects without diplopia and in SO palsy subjects. In contrast, patients with MG with diplopia had a tendency to show increased BCEA and SD of Y during the first 20 s period in MG subjects with diplopia. This result was surprising because in the present study it was initially expected that easily fatigued muscles in MG subjects would cause fixation to become more unstable over time. Not yet fully understood, but it may be that extraocular muscles, which at least partially functioned during the first 20 s period, attempted to correct eye position drift towards the upward gaze. However, as muscles became fatigued, ocular position corrections would have become smaller and less frequent, resulting in a smaller fluctuation of eye positions during the second and third 20 s periods compared with those during the first 20 s period. That is, the unexpected result may have been caused by the decrease in eye position correction ability of the patients with MG with diplopia along with the lapse of time. In support of this theory, Feldon et al have reported that patients with MG exhibit commonly substantial instability of eye positions immediately after saccadic movements (they called this 'wavering fixation'). They commented that wavering fixation was the expression of varying levels of tonic innervation to agonist and antagonist resulting from fatigue that caused the eye to drift. Also, in the present study, the vertical eye position in some of the participants of MG group drifted from the target position (data not shown). Furthermore, the vertical SD value of this group further decreased from the second 20 s period (2.41) to the third 20 s period (1.65), although this did not reach the level of the statistical significance. To confirm the present finding, it was necessary to further investigate by increasing the number of cases of MG.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^113DqQxj]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — patient outcome criteria (care process) state that treatment is goal directed, and targeted outcomes may include recognition of the disease and prevention of morbidity and mortality from generalized myasthenia gravis; reduction of diplopia (if present); restoration of normal ocular alignment, appearance, and improved self-image; restoration of binocular function; and reduction of compensatory head position (if present).

### Penicillamine (Aagylur) [^111Gbh6J]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Up to one year or more may be required for any urinary abnormalities to disappear after penicillamine has been discontinued.

Because of rare reports of intrahepatic cholestasis and toxic hepatitis, liver function tests are recommended every six months for the duration of therapy. In Wilson's disease, these are recommended every three months, at least during the first year of treatment.

Goodpasture's syndrome has occurred rarely. The development of abnormal urinary findings associated with hemoptysis and pulmonary infiltrates on x-ray requires immediate cessation of penicillamine.

Obliterative bronchiolitis has been reported rarely. The patient should be cautioned to report immediately pulmonary symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, unexplained cough or wheezing. Pulmonary function studies should be considered at that time.

Onset of new neurological symptoms has been reported with AAGYLUR (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Occasionally, neurological symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with AAGYLUR (see INDICATIONS). Myasthenic syndrome sometimes progressing to myasthenia gravis has been reported. Ptosis and diplopia, with weakness of the extraocular muscles, are often early signs of myasthenia. In the majority of cases, symptoms of myasthenia have receded after withdrawal of penicillamine.

Most of the various forms of pemphigus have occurred during treatment with penicillamine. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are reported most frequently, usually as a late complication of therapy. The seborrhea-like characteristics of pemphigus foliaceus may obscure an early diagnosis. When pemphigus is suspected, AAGYLUR should be discontinued. Treatment has consisted of high doses of corticosteroids alone or, in some cases, concomitantly with an immunosuppressant. Treatment may be required for only a few weeks or months, but may need to be continued for more than a year.

### Clinical reasoning: an unusual cause of diplopia and ptosis in a 67-year-old woman [^111VKPa5]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diplopia is a relatively common chief complaint encountered in an outpatient neurology clinic and carries a broad differential diagnosis. In this case, a 67-year-old woman presented with new horizontal, binocular diplopia and ptosis of 8-month duration, which persisted without significant progression. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses for patients with acquired ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Key learning points include an illustration of the stepwise diagnostic approach to evaluate for common etiologies, the importance of interpreting test results in the appropriate clinical setting, and the significance of recognizing specific signs and symptoms in achieving the correct diagnosis.

### Epidemiology and patient characteristics of the US myasthenia gravis population: real-world evidence from a large insurance claims database [^117DW8RY]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by fluctuating and fatigable skeletal muscle weaknessthat is attributed to antibody-mediated disruptions in transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Approximately 50% of patients with MG initially present with ocular symptoms, including ptosis and diplopia, and about 50% of patients with ocular onset ultimately develop generalised disease, typically within 2 years. Myasthenic crisis, which is characterised by severe bulbar weakness with dysphagia and severe respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation, occurs in a reported 15%–20% of patients with MG.

The epidemiology of MG is not fully understood. Reported incidence and prevalence rates are highly variable, even across studies of patients with similar geographic and genetic backgrounds. Globally, incidence rates ranging from 0.015 to 6.13 cases per 100 000 person-yearsand prevalence rates ranging from 1.5 to 17.9 cases per 100 000 personshave been reported. In the USA, two recent claims-based analyses found incidence rates of 3.1 and 6.85 per 100 000 person-years, respectively, and prevalence rates of 37.0 and 31.6 patients per 100 000 adults, respectively. Different study methodologies — including potential differences in diagnostic criteria, underestimation of patients with milder disease and the small sizes of the populations studied in some reports — may contribute to observed variability. Studies using large nationwide databases may improve the accuracy of incidence and prevalence estimates.

Traditional therapeutic strategies for MG generally include symptomatic treatment (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) as well as corticosteroids and non-steroidal immunosuppressive agents. Thymectomy is considered in select patients; newer targeted options include neonatal fragment crystallisable receptor inhibitors and complement inhibitors. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis are typically used to treat disease exacerbations or myasthenic crisis. Approximately 10%–15% of patients are treatment-refractory or have inadequate disease control. Newer options with recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval or those that are in late-stage development may provide better disease control and mitigate the risk of MG crisis.

A clearer understanding of the size, clinical characteristics and treatment utilisation patterns of the MG population in the USA would help support efforts to provide care that can address patient needs more completely. This study aimed to further investigate the epidemiology of MG in the USA and to characterise the incident and prevalent populations, including demographics, clinical features and treatment utilisation patterns. Characteristics of incident patients who experienced disease exacerbations were also investigated.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^116GhpJP]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — rationale for treatment states that diplopia, loss of binocular vision, compensatory head position, and inability to make eye contact all warrant treatment.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^115S169t]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Exotropia — rationale for treatment emphasizes functional and psychosocial benefits: the potential benefits of treatment include promoting binocular vision and normal visual function in each eye, as well as relieving asthenopia and eye fatigue; normal binocular alignment promotes a positive self-image; and the appearance of misaligned eyes impairs self-image and social interactions and reduces employment opportunities via bias.

### Spasmodic diplopia… [^111QVvE9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Double vision, either transitory or constant, is a fairly common symptom in the practice of ophthalmology and neurology. During the last five years, the literature of epidemic encephalitis has so emphasized diplopia as being a symptom of diagnostic importance that perhaps one is apt to regard it, in certain types of obscure cases, as evidence of encephalitis. Constant diplopia is not so difficult to account for in a given patient. It is my purpose in this paper to present a small series of cases in which transitory diplopia occurred and had a significance which, I believe, is worthy of discussion. In eliciting a history of this symptom, it is important to differentiate distinct double vision from mere blurring or indistinctness of objects. It is not uncommon to have a patient say that he sees double at times, yet on questioning it is manifest that the patient refers merely to indistinctness. HYSLOP GH. SPASMODIC DIPLOPIA.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^112Xzmpq]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Convergence insufficiency — epidemiology, risk factors, natural history, and treatment rationale — has an annual incidence of 8.4 per 100,000 people and in a 2014 review represented 15.7% of new-onset adult strabismus cases; though the median age of new-onset adult cases is 69 years old, some adults present after decompensation that began earlier in life. Risk factors include a history of concussion and certain central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease, which are associated with convergence insufficiency. Natural history notes that in general, convergence insufficiency does not improve, but symptoms may vary as demands for near work change over time, and cases secondary to concussion may improve over time. The rationale for treatment is to ameliorate asthenopia and intermittent diplopia at near and to enhance the ability to perform activities requiring binocularity at near.

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^1119eTGX]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common autoimmune disease affecting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) clinically characterised by fatigable weakness of the ocular, limb and bulbar (speech, swallowing and respiratory) muscles. The incidence of MG varies between 1.7 to 21.3 per million person-years. The estimated United Kingdom (UK) prevalence of MG is 15 per 100,000 population. There is significant social, economic and emotional burden for patients with MG, which can often be more troublesome than the disabling symptoms and hospitalisations.

Most patients with MG present with ocular symptoms (mainly ptosis and ophthalmoplegia) and in ~20% of patients the disease remain localised to the eye muscles (ocular MG). In the remaining patients the disease can cause generalised symptoms which can range from being mild fatigue to those needing ventilatory support for respiratory crisis. The most commonly described antibodies are against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK).

Background

Description of the condition

Autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) is a potentially life‐threatening immune‐mediated disease in which autoantibodies bind to components of the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. This binding disrupts the structural integrity of the synapse and impairs neuromuscular transmission, leading to fatigable and fluctuating muscle weakness. MG is the most common condition affecting neuromuscular transmission, with an incidence rate ranging from 1.7 to 31 cases per million person‐years and a prevalence of between 15 and 370 cases per million. The disease primarily affects women between the ages of 15 and 64. In cases where the onset occurs in children or adolescents, it tends to affect girls more frequently. In contrast, late‐onset MG is more common in men. The mortality rate associated with MG varies from 0.06 to 0.89 per million person‐years, with the myasthenic crisis being the leading cause of mortality.

The primary autoantibodies involved are those against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), followed by muscle‐specific kinase (MuSK) and lipoprotein‐related protein 4 (LRP4). Clinical manifestations of MG can range from fluctuating and fatigable mild and focal weakness to severe tetraparesis and weakness of breathing muscles (also known as myasthenic crisis), leading to respiratory failure and death. Extraocular muscles are commonly affected early in the disease, leading to asymmetrical ptosis and fluctuating diplopia. Within the first year of disease onset, 17% to 50% of individuals develop generalised MG (gMG), increasing to 85% within two years. When gMG affects facial and bulbar muscles, it results in symptoms such as dysarthria, dysphonia, difficulties in chewing, and dysphagia. MG may also affect the neck flexor and chest muscles. Limb weakness typically affects the proximal upper arm, thigh, and hip muscles. The myasthenic crisis affects approximately 15% of patients. Juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMG) is a rare subtype of MG. Although JMG shares clinical phenotypes with adult‐onset MG, it differs in that a higher proportion of patients experience spontaneous remission, among other distinctions.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111Sxg5a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus diagnosis — history indicates that the medical history should include the following elements: a description of ocular misalignment in an adult with a history of persistent or recurrent childhood strabismus; strabismus angle and direction may be the same as the original presentation in childhood or different as a result of aging of the extraocular muscles or the impact of prior strabismus surgery; history of chronicity is important, and an acute change or newly symptomatic diplopia may warrant evaluation for other causes such as cranial nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease (TED), and myasthenia gravis; formal neuro-ophthalmic evaluation may be indicated in some cases where presentation suggests other neurologic or systemic disease; and an attempt should be made to acquire and review past clinical and surgical records as well as any prior imaging studies, although this is not always possible.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^113ZsksS]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — superior oblique muscle palsy background notes that superior oblique muscle palsy is one of the common types of vertical strabismus seen in adults, and annual incidence has been reported to be 6.3 cases per 100,000 people with a higher incidence among males than females; risk factors include head trauma and increasing age (in age-related decompensation of congenital weakness). In long-standing and presumed congenital superior oblique palsy (SOP), patients may experience no diplopia or intermittent diplopia and a long-standing effective compensatory head position minimizes diplopia awareness; based on later-decade presentations, the natural history of presumed congenital SOP is deterioration in some cases. Treatment is warranted for diplopia, compensatory head position sometimes associated with neck pain, and asthenopia.

### Outcomes of extraocular muscle surgery for diplopia or abnormal head posture after treatment of brain disease [^113R8KYE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is well known that most patients with isolated ocular motor nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor, trochlear or abducens cranial nerves) due to microvascular causes recover spontaneously within 6 months.–In this study, as we focused on patients after treatment of severe brain disease with ocular complications such as diplopia or AHP, microvascular causes were excluded. Recently, advances in medical treatment have increased the survival rates for patients with severe brain disease, and a prospective, multicenter, observational case–cohort study, conducted by Rowe et alreported that 16.5% of post-stroke patients had ocular misalignment with diplopia. Therefore, treatment for diplopia and AHP, as well as general complications such as hemiparesis, should be demanded, to improve QOL. However, although surgical and conservative treatments were effective in eliminating diplopia and AHP in approximately 80% of patients, long periods (more than 4 years on average in this study) elapsed before EOM surgery in both groups (45.8 months for the SCVD group and 50.9 months for the BT group); therefore, we strongly believe that these patients should visit an ophthalmologist much sooner after their treatment for brain disease. Furthermore, eye-movement training for saccades and pursuit eye movements, and convergence insufficiency, may be more effective after treatment for diplopia and AHP, because diplopia remained in 10 cases including oculomotor palsy and central ocular motility disorders; of those, 5 showed successful ocular alignment of less than 10 PD by APCT. In such cases, prism therapy was also unable to eliminate diplopia. We think that the remaining diplopia was closely related to the deterioration of fusion and/or accommodation, and perhaps to impaired visual-integration processing due to the brain damage.

### Pearls and oy-sters of localization in ophthalmoparesis [^112oyBGg]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Ocular misalignment and ophthalmoparesis result in the symptom of binocular diplopia. In the evaluation of diplopia, localization of the ocular motility disorder is the main objective. This requires a systematic approach and knowledge of the ocular motor pathways and actions of the extraocular muscles. This article reviews the components of the ocular motor pathway and presents helpful tools for localization and common sources of error in the assessment of ophthalmoparesis.

### Consensus statement on visual rehabilitation in mild traumatic brain injury [^117JwETd]. Neurology: Clinical Practice (2022). High credibility.

Diplopia in mTBI — diplopia is described frequently after mTBI, ocular motor nerve injuries are rare yet diplopia has been reported by over 40% of US military veterans with mTBI from blast and nonblast causes; injury to cranial nerves III, IV, and VI may occur, small angles of strabismus including phorias are better appreciated with Maddox rod testing than with prism cover evaluation, ocular motor alignment is important for daily activities, and correlation of diplopia with afferent TBI symptoms has not been demonstrated.

### Ocular neuromyotonia [^112LNqwJ]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Ocular neuromyotonia is a rare, albeit treatable, ocular motor disorder, characterised by recurrent brief episodes of diplopia due to tonic extraocular muscle contraction. Ephaptic transmission in a chronically damaged ocular motor nerve is the possible underlying mechanism. It usually improves with carbamazepine. A 53-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of recurrent episodes of binocular vertical diplopia (up to 40/day), either spontaneously or after sustained downward gaze. Between episodes she had a mild left fourth nerve palsy. Sustained downward gaze consistently triggered downward left eye tonic deviation, lasting around 1min. MR scan of the brain was normal. She improved on starting carbamazepine but developed a rash that necessitated stopping the drug. Switching to lacosamide controlled her symptoms.

### Magnetic oculomotor prosthetics for acquired nystagmus [^116ffoPM]. Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

There are, however, some limitations that need careful consideration. Whether the benefits can be extended to other types of nystagmus remains to be seen. Because the presence of ferromagnetic materials is an absolute contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging, patients with progressive or recurrent neurologic illness requiring magnetic resonance surveillance are not candidates for such surgery. It is also worth noting that the strongest effect observed in our patient was the creation of a downgaze null point, and it may be the case that only patients without a natural null point are likely to experience a similar functional benefit. Finally, any changes of extraocular muscle function risk creating or exacerbating binocular diplopia. Owing to cerebellar syndrome, there was pre-existing diplopia resulting from a fusional defect, and this became more evident and symptomatic after surgery. Where more than 1 set of implants are used or where the implant is in the lateral plane, such effects may be less pronounced.

### When the penny drops [^111QYaoK]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Progression

Over the next 18 months, she reported more prominent diplopia with occasional blurred vision, as well as frequent dystonic posturing, particularly of the left hand. She suffered extreme fatigue with variable confusion and irritability, exacerbated by chronic headaches. In addition, she developed widespread arthralgia. There was a marked decline in her handwriting, which became progressively smaller and more illegible.

On examination, she had a markedly ataxic gait and worsening coordination. Upper limb examination showed cogwheeling reinforced by synkinesis, and mild dysdiadochokinesis. Reflexes and muscle bulk remained largely intact. A speech and language therapist felt that her fluctuating slurred speech with mild word-finding problems was a 'Parkinsonian-like dysarthria'; there was also dysfunctional coordination of swallowing. The patient reported her speech and swallowing worsened with tiredness or anxiety. Her depression deepened, with frequent mood swings and agitation.

### Preoperative binocular vision characteristics in the age-related cataract population [^112gxYVx]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cataract surgery is the most commonly performed ophthalmic surgical procedure, and satisfactory monocular visual function is usually achieved in most patients. However, studies indicate that post-surgical strabismic and non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies may occur leading to symptoms such as diplopia and asthenopia. Diplopia and strabismus are the most commonly reported binocular vision-related complications after cataract surgery due to extraocular muscle paresis caused by infiltration anesthesia. In recent years, with almost universal application of topical anesthesia, the postoperative frequency of diplopia and strabismus is less common. However, there were still indications in the literature that non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies may occur after topical anesthetic cataract surgery, including heterophoria, aniseikonia, and abnormalities in sensory and motor fusion. Most studies have failed to provide data about pre-surgical binocular vision status, and/or have not performed a comprehensive binocular vision evaluation.

### Juvenile myasthenia gravis: three case reports and a literature review [^113nb6wQ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Juvenile myasthenia gravis is a rare disorder acquired in childhood, representing 10% to 15% of all cases of myasthenia gravis. Like the adult form, it is generally characterized by an autoimmune attack on acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Most patients present with ptosis, diplopia, and fatigability. More advanced cases may also have bulbar problems and limb weakness. Left untreated, the disease may progress to paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Early recognition of this disease helps avoid unnecessary testing, prevent undue parental anxiety, and stop the progression of symptoms. Here, we relate the clinical course and current status of 3 patients with juvenile myasthenia gravis, discuss the disease in general, and review current treatment modalities.

### Consensus statement on visual rehabilitation in mild traumatic brain injury [^115zgJz4]. Neurology: Clinical Practice (2022). High credibility.

Afferent visual symptoms and postconcussion syndrome in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) include that retinostriate pathway or optic nerve damage is rare, yet blur, light sensitivity, difficulty reading, motion sensitivity, and eye fatigue have been reported. In the absence of ocular injury, afferent symptoms may be part of postconcussive syndrome in which symptoms persist beyond the expected recovery period, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria require mTBI plus persistence of 3 or more symptoms across cognitive, somatic, affective, and sleep-arousal domains; visual symptoms may be included in the somatic category but are not specifically listed, whereas blur and diplopia appear in the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire.

### Recurrent orbital myositis… [^111MS1er]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Background In orbital myositis, painful diplopia develops owing to an enlargement of the extraocular muscles. Diagnosis is established based on history, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic response to steroids, with the findings of magnetic resonance imaging providing additional information. PERIORBITAL PAIN, swelling of the eyelid, conjunctival injection, and diplopia due to restriction of extraocular muscle movement characterize orbital myositis. 1 The disorder usually begins acutely and in most cases resolves rapidly after treatment with steroids. Although it is mostly unilateral, occasionally both orbits may become involved. Although systemic steroid therapy was continued afterward at a dosage of 20 mg/d, 3 other episodes involving diplopia, proptosis, and soft tissue signs occurred mainly involving the left orbit.

Notably, each of the exacerbations occurred in the winter of the respective years. Orbital myositis begins acutely with unilateral periorbital pain, particularly on movement of the eye, diplopia, and often exophthalmos. All 3 patients described herein had episodes of painful diplopia, and in all cases onset of the episodes was acute and unilateral. Systemic administration of steroids, which is the treatment of choice for orbital myositis, led to a rapid improvement of the symptoms in patient 1. However, in patients 2 and 3, the clinical manifestations disappeared after some weeks without treatment. Based on the clinical manifestations in the 3 patients, we made a diagnosis of orbital myositis. Although there is a broad list of differential diagnoses in acute diplopia, the main differential diagnosis that remained in our patients was Graves hyperthyroid ophthalmopathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging may, apart from excluding other potential differential diagnoses such as tumor infiltration of the orbit, provide additional diagnostic information. In patient 1, it showed the characteristic finding of enlargement of a single extraocular muscle. It has been repeatedly suggested that magnetic resonance imaging may help to distinguish between orbital myositis and endocrine ophthalmopathy. 5, 6 It is believed that in euthyroid ophthalmopathy the swelling of the extraocular muscles is confined to the muscle belly, which shows a smooth contour, while the tendon remains spared.

### Triple M overlap syndrome following pembrolizumab treatment: importance of multidisciplinary approach [^114EckEH]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice is associated with a broad spectrum of immune-related adverse events, such as cardiac, rheumatological and neurological toxicities. Myocarditis is a life-threatening complication, and the concurrent development of myocarditis, myositis and/or myasthenia leads to difficulties in diagnosis, management and treatment. We describe a case presenting with this triple M overlap syndrome following pembrolizumab treatment. A man in his 80s with a background of chronic ischaemic heart disease, receiving pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for microsatellite instability locally advanced gastric cancer, presented after the second dose of treatment with muscle weakness, binocular diplopia and left ptosis. Elevated transaminases, creatine kinase and high-sensitivity troponin-T levels were revealed. ECG monitoring showed the development of an atrioventricular block, needing a temporary pacemaker. Immune-related myocarditis, myasthenia and myositis were suspected. High-dose corticosteroids were administered without clinical benefit, so an escalation of immunosuppression was needed, using infliximab and immunoglobulins.

### Heimann-bielschowsky phenomenon and hypotropic DVD in case of monocular vision loss: a case report [^114zEv8b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old female presented with a 4-year history of slow, intermittent, downward drift in her left eye. Blunt trauma to the left eye at 10 years of age left her with severe vision impairment therein. About 35 years later, she was diagnosed with traumatic cataract and sensory esotropia in the left eye and underwent left cataract extraction and recession of the medial rectus muscle, and resection of the lateral rectus muscle. Slow, intermittent, downward drifting of the left eye subsequently developed upon distance fixation and increased steadily in size and frequency over the next 4 years. The patient did not experience diplopia due to her poor vision of the left eye. Her visual acuities were 20/20 in her right eye and 20/400 in her left eye without glasses and 20/200 with glasses (+ 1.75 Dsph = − 3.0 Dacylax 180); however, the patient refused to wear glasses or contact lenses after cataract surgery.

Eye movements were normal, and no oblique muscle dysfunction was found. When the patient fixated at a distance, she demonstrated an intermittent, slow, downward drift of the left eye (approximately 0.5 Hz frequency) that never rose above the midline, of variable magnitude ranging up to 30 prism diopters in the primary position. (Fig. 1; Additional file 1) She reported that a slow, downward drift occurred during fatigue, inattention, or distance viewing. When she attempted to fixate with her left eye at a near target, she was orthophoric with no vertical movement in either eye. (Fig. 1) The Bielschowsky head-tilt test demonstrated no significant difference between primary and head-tilt positions. She had a left relative afferent pupillary defect. The anterior and posterior segments were healthy with posterior chamber lens implant of the left eye. She had no other neurologic disorders. A brain magnetic resonance imaging failed to reveal any abnormalities of extraocular muscles or pulley. Laboratory work-up to rule out ocular myasthenia and thyroid eye disease was negative for both.

### Oculomotor fatigability with decrements of saccade and smooth pursuit for diagnosis of myasthenia gravis [^116La4ah]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigability and fluctuating muscle weakness induced by auto-antibodies binding to the postsynaptic region at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Specific auto-antibody formations against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), or lipoprotein-related peptide 4 lead to transmission deficits at the NMJ and its eventual destruction. Extraocular muscles are particularly susceptible to dysfunction, and ocular weakness presenting as ptosis or diplopia is the most common initial presentation of MG. This ocular form of MG (OMG) (15%) in which the weakness is limited to the extraocular, levator, and orbicularis oculi muscles progresses to a generalized form of MG (GMG) (85%), in which the weakness is generalized to involve the limb, bulbar, or respiratory musculature in about 50% of cases, usually within 2 or 3 years. Diagnosis of OMG can be challenging due to symptomatic variability and vague diagnostic criteria in seronegative patients, as well as insufficient sensitivity of current diagnostic methods. Unfortunately, conventional diagnostic tests for OMG have not demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness. Single-fiber electromyography has higher sensitivity in detecting OMG (62–97%) compared to other ancillary tests, but is time-consuming and requires a skilled neurophysiologist. Therefore, to eliminate clinical ambiguity and approach a correct diagnosis of MG, many supportive laboratory techniques have been introduced, such as repetitive ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) test. Specifically, repetitive oVEMP tests evaluate decrements in ocular muscle activity of MG patients, where a unilateral decrement ≥ 15.2% yielded a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 64%. One drawback of oVEMP testing is that any structural or functional lesion present between the otoliths and extraocular muscles affecting the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) pathways can affect the oVEMP amplitude.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^113DuAGJ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

TED diagnosis — history: A detailed medical and ocular history should include specific questions about weight gain or loss, tachycardia, and unexplained fatigue potentially secondary to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Strabismus is likely to be associated with diplopia and, in some cases, a compensatory head posture (i.e., ocular torticollis, often a chin-up position in this population). Because the incidence of myasthenia is increased in patients with TED, assessment for the coexistence of myasthenia is suggested if indicated by findings on clinical examination.

### Outcomes of extraocular muscle surgery for diplopia or abnormal head posture after treatment of brain disease [^112Juk1T]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Visual impairment following severe brain disease such as brain tumor, bleeding or infarction may induce abnormalities of central and/or peripheral vision or ocular motility, and a variety of visual perception problems such as cognitive disorder and agnosia. These visual impairments can be complex, including ocular as well as cortical damage. Diplopia and abnormal head posture (AHP) are typical ocular complications in patients after severe brain disease, and include not only ocular motor nerve palsy but also central ocular motility disorders such as skew deviation, and vertical or horizontal gaze palsy. Hence, these ocular complications are generally considered to be refractory and tend to be left untreated.

As most patients suffer severe general complications such as disordered cognition, weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction or hemiplegia, those complications are accorded priority for treatment and/or rehabilitation. Therefore, in patients with brain disease, ophthalmologic consultation tends to be delayed, even though visual system impairments including diplopia and AHP greatly reduce patients' quality of life (QOL).

At our hospital, we have undertaken extraocular muscle (EOM) surgery to eliminate diplopia or AHP in these refractory patients after treatment for severe brain disease. Here, we report the characteristics and treatment outcomes for patients with diplopia and AHP after treatment of brain disease.

### Acute binocular diplopia: peripheral or central? [^114pmUWe]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Over a period of 3 years, we prospectively recruited adult (≥ 18 years) patients from the neurological emergency department of Campus Grosshadern of the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, who presented because of acute diplopia. Diplopia had to be present for less than 10 days and be the leading symptom and the main cause for the patient's referral to our department. Patients with monocular diplopia or binocular diplopia due to known pre-existing causes, such as myasthenia, were excluded from the study.

At the time of presentation, all patients underwent a complete clinical–neurological evaluation and had to answer a study questionnaire regarding their symptoms and presentation of diplopia. Furthermore, blood samples were obtained. A standardized neuro-ophthalmological and neuro-orthoptic examination, including Harms tangent screen and monocular (each eye separately) measurements of the subjective visual vertical (SVV), was performed on the same or the following day. The SVV was measured using either the bucket test or a dome. The SVV test was performed by an experienced orthoptician, who rotated the bucket manually and slowly from a randomized offset position towards zero, alternating between the two directions in each trial. The patient looked with one eye (the other eye was covered with an eye patch) at a straight line visible on the inner bottom of a bucket or of a dome without other visual cues, and had to align it properly, indicating the vertical position verbally. On the outer bottom surface of the bucket, an angular protractor allowed the examiner to readout the tilt angle; when the dome was used, the tilt angle was computed automatically. Central ocular motor signs included saccadic smooth pursuit, saccade palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and skew deviation (in addition to the ocular motor palsy).

### A computerized red glass test for quantifying diplopia [^114ULpAj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

To overcome those weaknesses of the red glass test, the CRT use a computer software. The CRT can collect and analyze the diplopia with consistency. Immediately after completion of the CRT, the program provides horizontal deviation, vertical deviation, direct distance, and the degree of diplopia. Along with data, the CRT also provides a summarized figure which is similar to the red glass test. Because the figure provides the binocular diplopic image as viewed by the patient in the nine cardinal positions, it enables examiners to easily identify weakened the extraocular muscles.

The Hess test is a gold standard test evaluating patients with diplopia. We demonstrated that the CRT is comparable with the Hess test in terms of localization and quantification. Compared to the Hess test, the CRT has several merits. First, the Hess test separately evaluates each eye. In contrast, the CRT provides binocular diplopic images according to the patients' view to reflect the degree of diplopia in everyday life. Second, the CRT can be performed using a desktop computer and monitor in any place, including a stroke unit, an emergency room, or a clinic. Third, the elapsed time for the three CRT trials was less than 5 min, whereas a single trial of the Hess test requires twice as much time. Fourth, the CRT does not require a skilled technician and devices. By instructions, patients can easily understand the test and cooperate in the examination.

Although overall inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the CRT were excellent, our trials had several limitations. First, the CRT may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle or severe diplopia. One of the study patients showed a discrepancy between the results of the Hess test and the CRT. In order to detect subtle or extensive diplopia, the Hess test might be useful. Second, head movements may influence the results. In fact, head movements can also affect the results of the Hess test. To minimize head movements, a neck collar was applied during the CRT. Third, the monitor size might have influenced the results. Further studies of testing with a smaller screen such as a laptop or a tablet, and a larger projector screen might be needed. Lastly, since this was a pilot study of CRT, further research with a larger sample size and follow-up study in the same patient would be needed.

### United States clinical practice experience with eculizumab in myasthenia gravis: symptoms, function, and immunosuppressant therapy use [^116WvdLx]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare, chronic autoimmune disease characterized by debilitating muscle weakness and fatigue. Common symptoms experienced by patients with gMG may include ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnea, head drop, limb weakness, exertional muscle fatigue, and aching muscles, all of which negatively affect a patient's ability to live a normal life.

The current international consensus guidance of MG experts includes use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine as first-line treatment for most patients with gMG. For patients with an inadequate response to pyridostigmine, corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressant therapies (NSISTs) are recommended (including azathioprine, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus). However, chronic use of corticosteroids is associated with a range of adverse effects, including development or worsening of conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis. An important treatment goal in gMG is to minimize corticosteroid use while maintaining symptom control; therefore, once patients achieve optimal clinical status, the daily dosage of corticosteroids should be tapered to the minimal effective dosage. The consensus guidance also recommends that the treatment goal for patients with gMG should be achievement of minimal manifestation status (MMS; defined as having no symptoms or functional limitations from MG despite having some weakness on examination of some muscles) or better, as determined by the patient's physician, with no more than grade 1 medication-related adverse effects according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The patient-reported Myasthenia Gravis–Activities of Daily Living (MG–ADL) scale is commonly used in clinical practice to monitor the effect of treatment for MG; expanding on this measure, Vissing and colleagues developed the concept of minimal symptom expression (MSE) as a treatment target, with one definition of MSE being an MG-ADL total score of 0 or 1.

Ocular myogenic disorders (n = 30) (Additional file 6: Table S4.3)

Thyroid eye disease

Treatment response in thyroid eye disease is commonly evaluated using composite scores such as " VISA" and "EUGOGO score". Modified versions of existing scales are often developed and used (for example "modified EUGOGO", and "modified Werner grading scale" for orbital inflammation). In addition, we found a high frequency of a number of widely recognised scoring systems such as "The clinical activity score (CAS)" to assess disease activity and "NO SPECS" to assess disease severity.

"Subjective diplopia" was frequently assessed using "the Gorman diplopia score". Ocular muscle motility assessment was mostly involved within composite scores but occasionally measured with dedicated scores (for e.g. The Total Motility score (TMS)). Additional outcome measures reported by studies for thyroid eye disease included "the need for post treatment corrective procedures", and "orbital volume/orbital fat and muscle volume".

Ocular myasthenia gravis and progressive external ophthalmoplegia

In addition to the previously stated outcome measures shared with other eye motility disorders such as "improvement in diplopia" and "eye movement measurement", there were outcome measures specific to myasthenia reported by included studies. These included "quantitative ocular myasthenia gravis score (OMG) score" and "progression to generalised myasthenia gravis". Other associated ocular motility abnormalities reported included "inter-saccadic fatigue", "gaze-paretic nystagmus", "fatigue of accommodation" and "reduced velocity of pupillary constriction". Quality of life was evaluated using "the 15-item Myasthenia Gravis quality of life scale" in one study.

### Fixation stability of the upward gaze in patients with myasthenia gravis: an eye-tracker study [^117KjcvS]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

A quantitative MG score and an MG composite scale are used to evaluate disease severity. For these measures, diplopia is evaluated by asking the patient to gaze in one direction. The time from gaze to subjectively determined diplopia appearance is measured. The 1 min upper gaze test is used to identify ptosis and diplopia and to determine whether the MG fatigue phenomenon is present. However, these evaluations are subjective with the patient condition determined using physician observation or patient symptom reporting. In clinical observation, ophthalmologists infer the presence of diplopia and its severity by measuring ocular alignment and motion using the alternate prism cover test (APCT) and the Hess screen test, respectively. These tests, however, are not objective and have poor reproducibility in patients with MG because ocular alignment is quantified using only one data point (ocular position). This is problematic because ocular alignment and range of ocular motion change over time in patients with MGbecause their muscles easily fatigue which is a characteristic of MG. Therefore, objective and reproducible evaluations of gaze instability caused by fatigability in patients with MG are needed and should include sequential eye position data obtained with a reasonably high sampling frequency (more than 200 Hz). There are several studies that have examined saccadic eye movements of patients with MG using electro-oculography or infrared scleral reflection or scleral search coiland reported that the peak velocity of saccade in patients with MG was similar to or greater than that of normal subjects. These studies, however, did not evaluate gaze stability of patients with MG by measuring fixation position, although fixation methods are more widely used and meaningful clinical tests (eg, the Quantitative MG score, MG composite scale) for the gaze stability of patients with MG.

An eye tracker is capable of measuring ocular position continuously for a long enough period with relatively high time resolution. Upward is the most sensitive gaze direction for detecting the ocular MG symptoms (ie, diplopia and ptosis) because extraocular muscle weakness is known to appear most prominently in the elevator muscles of patients with MG. Therefore, in the present study, fixation stability in upward gaze was quantified by using an eye tracker in subjects with and without MG.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111ns3qP]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult Strabismus Preferred Practice Pattern — Surgical principles include an attempt to recover "lost" muscles whenever possible; if recovery of a muscle proves impossible or if a muscle is determined to be severely paretic, a transposition procedure may be indicated. Matching restriction with the use of posterior fixation sutures or Scott procedures (recess/resect) on the unaffected eye are established methods of expanding the field of single binocular vision, adjustable sutures are often helpful, and because the etiology may be multifactorial with incomitant misalignment, complete elimination of diplopia is difficult, if not impossible in most cases.

Introduction

Autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare condition with antibodies targeted against key proteins of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of skeletal muscles. Several types of antibodies have been identified, but most patients (approximately 80%) have detectable antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Three mechanisms can contribute to the pathogenicity of AChR antibodies: (1) they block the binding of acetylcholine to AChRs, (2) they accelerate degradation of AChRs by crosslinking and internalization of the receptors, or/and (3) they activate the complement system. The predominant clinical phenotype of MG consists of fluctuating and fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles. Extraocular muscles are most frequently involved, leading to asymmetric and fluctuating ptosis and diplopia. Although MG is considered to affect only NMJ, most patients suffer from cognitive or mental fatigue as well. This type of fatigue is conceptually different from muscle weakness or fatigability and is often referred to as central fatigue because it originates in the CNS. Central fatigue can be best defined as a subjective lack of energy and difficulty in initiating or sustaining voluntary activities. It is hypothesized that in neuromuscular diseases, central fatigue is a mechanism to minimize activities, in order to protect the muscles from further damage. Disease-related muscle weakness may require higher levels of effort, which may contribute to central fatigue. Another hypothesis is that local peripheral inflammatory processes in autoimmune diseases may trigger systemic inflammatory cascades responsible for fatigue. It has been proposed that inflammation reduces both internally and externally driven motivation states, to provide the body the opportunity to heal. Several inflammatory biomarkers have previously been associated with central fatigue in numerous chronic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous research has shown that in MG, fatigue is correlated with female sex, depressive symptoms, disease severity, body mass index (BMI), and physical activities. These data suggest that the pathophysiology of fatigue is multifactorial, although there is no evidence on causality.

Our aim was to gain a better understanding on the pathophysiology of fatigue in MG by searching for 1 or more circulating serum biomarkers related to fatigue. Our second aim was to find longitudinal correlations between fatigue and potentially newly identified biomarkers.

### Fixation stability of the upward gaze in patients with myasthenia gravis: an eye-tracker study [^112u4eGj]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

To quantify fixation stability of the upward gaze in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) using an eye tracker.

Methods and analysis

In this study, 21 normal subjects, 5 patients with MG with diplopia, 5 patients with MG without diplopia and 6 patients with superior oblique (SO) palsy were included. Subjects fixated on a target in the upward direction for 1 min. The horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) eye positions were recorded using an eye tracker. Fixation stability was first quantified using the bivariate contour ellipse areas (BCEA) of fixation points as an index of whole stability. Then, the SDs of the X and Y eye positions (SDX and SDY, respectively) were quantified as indices of directional stability, with the data divided into three 20 s fractions to detect temporal fixation fluctuation.

Results

BCEAs were larger in patients with MG (both with and without diplopia) than normal subjects and patients with SO palsy, without significant differences among the three 20 s fractions. Compared with normal subjects, SDXs were larger only in patients with MG with diplopia; SDYs were larger in both patients with MG with and without diplopia. In addition, SDYs in patients with MG with diplopia were larger than those in patients with MG without diplopia and patients with SO palsy. Furthermore, a significant difference among the three 20 s fractions was detected for SDYs in patients with MG with diplopia.

Conclusion

Patients with MG, especially those with diplopia, exhibit fixation instability in the upward gaze. Non-invasive quantification of fixation stability with an eye tracker is useful for precisely identifying MG-specific fatigue characteristics.

Discussion

Directional selectivity of fixation stability during the upward gaze

This study showed that fixation fluctuation during the upward gaze was larger in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction in all subjects. The upper gaze was used in the current study because it has been shown to be suitable for detecting the MG fatigue phenomenon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine upward gaze stability in healthy subjects and patients with MG. Therefore, the difference in fixation stability between the vertical and horizontal directions observed in the present study could be related to the direction of the gaze, although, to get solid evidence for this relation, additional tests using gazes in left and right directions are necessary. The directional selectivity of fixation stability observed in the present study may stem from the peripheral mechanism needed to maintain the upward gaze. Anatomical factors could play a role: muscle bulk is greater for the superior rectus (SR) muscle than for the other recti; the SR muscle load is greater than for the other vertically acting muscle in rabbits; the SR has fewer muscle spindles than the other recti. During upward fixation, the SR and the inferior oblique (IO) contract. Persistent contraction of the SR and the IO may produce fatigue in these extraocular muscles, which could lead to larger fluctuation of eye position in the vertical direction. Indeed, this speculation is consistent with the present observation that the fluctuation in vertical direction was much larger in patients with MG than normal subjects.

Fixation instability in subjects with MG

The present study showed that the upward gaze in patients with MG was more unstable in the vertical position than in normal subjects or patients with SO palsy. Vertical position instability was especially high in the MG with diplopia group. Cleary et al have demonstrated that in patients with MG, weakness of the elevator muscles (ie, the SR and the IO) is significantly greater than that of other extraocular muscles. Almog et al also showed that the IO was involved more often than any other extraocular muscle in patients with MG. Such a trend of extraocular muscle dysfunction (more severe and frequent impairment of the elevator muscles) in patients with MG, which was the reason for using upward gaze in the present testing, may underlie the fixation instability of patients with MG in upward gaze.

### Functional anatomy of muscle mechanisms: compensating vertical heterophoria [^1135ryuB]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of extraocular muscle function was used to evaluate the role of newly recognized mechanisms underlying compensation of large heterophoria by vertical fusional vergence (VFV).

Design

Prospective case series.

Methods

At one academic center, 8 adults with large hyperphoria and supernormal VFV underwent MRI during monocular and binocular fixation of a centered, near target. Contractility of the rectus and superior oblique (SO) extraocular muscles in hypertropic and hypotropic eyes was determined from changes in posterior partial volume (PPV).

Results

Five of 8 patients could sustain binocular fusion in the scanner. In those patients, VFV corrected approximately 5-degree misalignment, approximately 5-fold greater than normal VFV. Vertical strabismus was compensated mainly by significant contractility of the lateral more than the medial compartment of the inferior rectus (IR) in both eyes (P < .005). The superior rectus (SR) and inferior oblique muscles had no significant contractile contribution, although the hypotropic SO relaxed significantly. The IR lateral compartment and SR medial compartment significantly co-relaxed when binocular fusion was attained from monocular target fixation (P < .01).

Conclusions

Although VFV protects patients from small muscle imbalances over the lifespan, even enhanced VFV may be inadequate to avert diplopia. Compensation of hyperphoria by VFV is accomplished mainly by IR muscle relaxation in the hypotropic eye, principally in its selectively innervated lateral compartment, whereas the SO contributes little. Fusion involves compartmentally selective co-relaxation in hypotropic eye vertical rectus muscles. Taken together, these overall findings suggest a physiologic basis to prefer therapeutic surgical weakening of the medial IR in the hypotropic eye.

### Ocular motility findings in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [^117P9dXH]. Eye (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To characterise the ocular motility features of chronic progressive external opthalmoplegia by quantitative and semiquantitative means. To assess the prevalence of diplopia and the binocular adaptations to nonaligned visual axes.

Method

We studied 25 patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. In each case muscle biopsies were consistent with mitochondrial myopathy. All patients underwent cover test in the primary position, assessment of binocular status, and measurement of uniocular fields of fixation using the Goldmann perimeter.

Results

A total of 23 (92%) patients had an exo-deviation, with six (26%) of those having an associated vertical deviation: 12 patients were binocular. Of the 13 patients with a manifest deviation seven had diplopia and six had suppression. Of all paired extra-ocular muscles (EOM), 68% had symmetry of movement within 5 degrees of each other.

Conclusion

Almost all patients had an exo-deviation. Diplopia was more common than expected. The majority of patients had symmetry of EOM limitation.

Cataract extraction or keratoplasty — postoperative motility causes: Anesthetic myotoxicity following retrobulbar or peribulbar anesthesia for any ocular procedure including cataract extraction or keratoplasty may occur, with initial presentation usually transient paresis followed by deviation of the eye into the field of action of the involved extraocular muscle. The hypertropia or hypotropia may result from restriction of the involved extraocular muscle when damage is extensive or as an overaction pattern due to focal contracture or muscle hypertrophy, and the superior and inferior rectus muscles are the most commonly injured by regional and local anesthesia in retrobulbar or peribulbar blocks, though any muscle, including the superior and inferior oblique muscles, may be involved. Additional contributors include trauma from a bridle suture under a rectus muscle, temporary disinsertion and subsequent reattachment of an extraocular muscle during repair of a globe laceration or retinal detachment, and other causes of binocular diplopia such as previously undiagnosed TED, pre-existing/unmasked binocular disorders, fixation switch diplopia, and acquired loss of central fusion. Patients undergoing refractive procedures may develop diplopia due to fixation switch to the nondominant eye, longstanding visual deprivation causing central fusion disruption, and postoperative anisometropia, aniseikonia, and meridional aniseikonia.

### Extra ocular muscle fenestration as a weakening maneuver for surgical management of strabismus: a randomized pilot clinical trial [^116V3rQp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Strabismus is one of the commonly encountered ophthalmologic diseases. It typically involves a lack of coordination between the extraocular muscles, where the eyes are lacking a proper alignment with each other.

Surgical correction of strabismus should be considered after failure of conservative treatments. The aims of surgery are to restore proper ocular alignment, maintain binocular vision, eliminate diplopia, with the ultimate restoration of stereopsis.

Strabismus surgery includes weakening of the extra ocular muscle to decrease the effective strength of muscle action. Many weakening procedures have been described. Muscle recession is the standard and often most commonly used weakening technique. It involves disinserting the muscle from its original attachment and moving it posteriorly away from the limbus. Muscle recession may be associated with complications related to suturing and muscle disinsertion.

Recently, extra ocular muscle fenestration has been reported as a new surgical technique for weakening of the extraocular muscles without using sutures or botulinum toxin. The fenestration technique reduces the muscle force by removing a block of the muscle close to its insertion which is done in between 2 peripheral muscle strips. It is a promising simple technique that might avoid the complications of using sutures such as foreign body reactions and granuloma formation.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenestration in comparison to the classic muscle recession as a weakening maneuver to horizontal and vertical extra ocular muscles in the surgical management of strabismus.

### Fixation stability of the upward gaze in patients with myasthenia gravis: an eye-tracker study [^114pvk3U]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

In spite of the well-known ocular symptoms of patients with MG, no reports on gaze stability in patients with MG were identified in the academic literature. However, some studies that evaluated central fixation stability using BCEAs in patients with amblyopia and macular degeneration found that visual fixation was unstable in eyes with visual impairments. Patients with strabismus have unstable fixation in the deviated eye. Diplopia may also have unstable fixation because of retinal image fusion attempts. However, diplopia is not the underlying cause of the fixation instability observed here in MG subjects because SO palsy subjects (who also had diplopia) did not have the same degree of instability. In addition, the fixation in patients with MG without diplopia was more stable than that in patients with MG with diplopia, but not similar to normal subject. Therefore, it is likely that the marked fixation fluctuation in MG subjects with diplopia was caused by MG fatigability and not by diplopia.

A 24-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented with a 2-month history of rapidly progressive asymmetric weakness and paresthesia that began in her left lower extremity and progressed to involve both legs and arms. It was associated with overflow urinary incontinence and significant weight loss. In addition, she complained of a constant occipital headache that worsened in the supine position and was associated with photophobia, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and horizontal binocular diplopia. She also had signs of meningismus, decreased left facial sensation, and right sensorineural hearing loss. Because multifocal localization suggests a wide variety of possible differential diagnoses, this study expands on the differential of a subacute multifocal process while highlighting the importance of identifying appropriate risk factors and performing a relevant yet focused diagnostic workup.

4. Ocular movement disorders

Extraocular motility disorders may occur in patients with diabetes, secondary to diabetic neuropathy, involving the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve. Rarely, simultaneous palsies of multiple extraocular nerves can occur. Diabetes is the underlying cause in 25–30% of patients aged 45 years and older who develop acute extraocular muscle palsy. In one study, 1% of patients with diabetes were found to have cranial nerve palsies, compared with only 0.13% of control subjects. Of these cases, 41% had a third nerve palsy. In another population-based study, patients with sixth cranial nerve palsy were six times more likely to have diabetes.

Patients with extraocular palsies present with binocular diplopia. Pupil sparing is an important diagnostic feature in diabetes-related third cranial nerve palsy, distinguishing it from surgical causes, such as intracranial aneurysm or tumor. In diabetic cranial nerve palsies, recovery of extraocular muscle function generally occurs within 3 months. Recurrences can be common and may involve the same or other cranial nerves. The presence of other focal neurological signs, progressive deterioration, or palsy in a patient younger than 45 years should be investigated to exclude a compressive lesion. In these instances, a neurology or neuro-ophthalmology consultation is recommended.

### Nuances in visual rehabilitation after pituitary surgery [^113U2RTh]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The care for debilitating diplopia that persists for weeks to months after surgery should be escalated in conjunction with a neuro-ophthalmology team. Botulinum toxin is often a first line of interventional correction among other injection agents. Botulinum toxin prevents the release of acetylcholine from axonal endings at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis of any muscle targeted through injection. When a cranial nerve palsy persists, tonic activation of counteracting muscles causes diplopia. Since cranial nerve palsies produce reliable diplopia syndromes, botulinum toxin injections can weaken or paralyze specific counteracting muscles to bring the globe to a neutral alignment. For instance, botulinum toxin injections in the lateral rectus can help negate the exotropia caused by oculomotor palsy. Injections to the inferior oblique muscle counteract the effects of a trochlear palsy, and injections to the medial rectus counteract the impact of an abducens palsy.

Surgical intervention can improve acquired diplopia from cranial nerve palsies when conservative measures and botulinum toxin injections prove insufficient. Surgical options for diplopia should be considered in conjunction with neuro-ophthalmologists and oculoplastic surgeons and depend on the cadence of symptoms, the specific cranial nerves involved, and the degree of extraocular muscle dysfunction. The goal of surgery for diplopia is usually to re-align the affected eye through muscle and tendon transpositions as well as resective reductions. Given the high rate of recovery from many extraocular movement palsies, waiting 6 months before considering surgery for persistent diplopia maximizes the opportunity for spontaneous recovery.

Surgery for oculomotor palsy includes medial rectus resection and lateral rectus recession to correct horizontal deviation, and superior oblique tendon transposition to adduct the globe into a neutral position. After alignment of the affected eye, lid ptosis can also be surgically corrected. The selection of surgery for trochlear nerve palsy depends on the laxity of the superior oblique muscle on forced duction testing and the degree of hypertropia. For cases with minor hypertropias, the inferior oblique can be reduced. For larger hypertropias, inferior oblique reduction can be combined with superior rectus recession. For partial abducens nerve palsies, the lateral rectus may be resected and the ipsilateral medial rectus is recessed. For complete lateral rectus muscle paresis, there are several complex reconstructions that can be considered.

### Surgical interventions for vertical strabismus in superior oblique palsy [^114pK8V4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Superior oblique palsy is a common cause of vertical strabismus in adults and children. Patients may be symptomatic from binocular vertical diplopia or compensatory head tilt required to maintain single vision. Most patients who are symptomatic elect to undergo strabismus surgery, but the optimal surgical treatment for vertical strabismus in people with superior oblique palsy is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the relative effects of surgical treatments compared with another surgical intervention, non-surgical intervention, or observation for vertical strabismus in people with superior oblique palsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 13 December 2016), Embase Ovid (1947 to 13 December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to 13 December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 13 December 2016, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 13 December 2016, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 13 December 2016. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials that compared at least one type of surgical intervention to another surgical or non-surgical intervention or observation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified two randomized trials comparing four different surgical treatments for this condition, two methods in each trial. The studies included a total of 45 children and adults. The surgical treatments were all procedures to weaken the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle. One study compared inferior oblique myectomy to recession of 10 mm; the other study compared inferior oblique disinsertion to anterior transposition (2 mm anterior to the temporal border of the inferior rectus insertion). We judged both studies to be at unclear risk of bias due to incomplete reporting of methods and other methodological deficiencies. Neither study reported data on the primary outcome of this review, which was the proportion of participants with postoperative surgical success, defined as hypertropia less than 3 prism diopters (PD) in primary gaze. However, both studies reported the average reduction in hypertropia in primary gaze. One study found that at 12 months' postoperatively the average decrease in hypertropia was higher in participants who underwent inferior oblique myectomy than in those who underwent recession, however data were not available for statistical comparison. The other trial found that after at least six months of follow-up, the mean decrease in primary position hypertropia was lower in participants who underwent inferior oblique disinsertion than in those who underwent anterior transposition (mean difference (MD) -5.20 PD, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.76 to -2.64; moderate-quality evidence). Both trials also reported the average postoperative reduction in vertical deviation in adduction. One study reported that the average reduction in hypertropia in adduction was greater in participants who underwent inferior oblique myectomy than in those who underwent recession, but data were not available for statistical comparison. The other study found a lower decrease in hypertropia in contralateral gaze in participants who underwent inferior oblique disinsertion than in those who underwent anterior transposition (MD -7.10 PD, 95% CI -13.85 to -0.35; moderate-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes with sufficient data for analysis included proportion of participants with preoperative head tilt that resolved postoperatively and proportion of participants who underwent a second surgery. These outcomes were assessed in the trial comparing inferior oblique anterior transposition to disinsertion; both outcomes favored anterior transposition (risk ratio 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 121.39 for both outcomes; very low-quality evidence). None of the participants who underwent inferior oblique anterior transposition or disinsertion developed postoperative hypotropia or reversal of the vertical deviation. All participants who underwent inferior oblique anterior transposition developed elevation deficiency, which the authors deemed to be clinically insignificant in all cases, whereas no participants who underwent inferior oblique disinsertion experienced this complication. Additionally, the trial comparing inferior oblique myectomy to recession reported that no participant in either group required another strabismus surgery during the postoperative period.

Authors' Conclusions

The two trials included in this review evaluated four inferior oblique weakening procedures for surgical treatment of superior oblique palsy. We found no trials comparing other types of surgical procedures for this disorder. Both studies had enrolled a small number of participants and provided low-quality evidence due to limitations in completeness and applicability. We therefore found no high-quality evidence to support recommendations for optimal surgical treatment of superior oblique palsy. Rigorously designed, conducted, and reported randomized trials are needed to identify the optimal surgical treatment for vertical strabismus in this disorder.

Methods We identified 7 patients from our practices who had binocular diplopia concurrent with epiretinal membranes or vitreomacular traction. A review of the medical records of all patients was performed. In addition to complete ophthalmologic and orthoptic examinations, evaluation of aniseikonia using the Awaya New Aniseikonia Tests was performed on all patients.

BINOCULAR DIPLOPIA associated with epiretinal membrane formation and subretinal neovascular membranes has been described. 1, 2 The mechanism is postulated to be a mechanical distortion of the macula causing rivalry between central and peripheral fusional mechanisms. Patients with these conditions are unable to fuse when their deviation is offset with prisms owing to the continuing rivalry. We believe that aniseikonia is another condition associated with macular disease. It can contribute to the failure of prisms to eliminate diplopia. We have had the opportunity to follow up 7 patients with macular disease and binocular diplopia. All patients were referred for evaluation of troublesome diplopia. All shared the finding of substantial aniseikonia concurrent with their diplopia. This article attempts to explain the pathophysiology of binocular diplopia associated with macular disease and aniseikonia.

We identified and retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 7 patients who had binocular diplopia concurrent with macular disease. Six patients had epiretinal membranes; 1 patient had vitreomacular traction. Each patient underwent a full ophthalmologic and orthoptic examination including evaluation of visual acuity, pupillary response, slitlamp findings, refraction, ocular motility, and dilated fundoscopy.

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox) [^114ojvzr]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.000000000000000e+00 1 1 Strabismus

BOTOX is intended for injection into extraocular muscles utilizing the electrical activity recorded from the tip of the injection needle as a guide to placement within the target muscle. Injection without surgical exposure or electromyographic guidance should not be attempted. Physicians should be familiar with electromyographic technique.

To prepare the eye for BOTOX injection, it is recommended that several drops of a local anesthetic and an ocular decongestant be given several minutes prior to injection.

The volume of BOTOX injected for treatment of strabismus should be between 0.05–0.15 mL per muscle.

The initial listed doses of the reconstituted BOTOX [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] typically create paralysis of the injected muscles beginning one to two days after injection and increasing in intensity during the first week. The paralysis lasts for 2–6 weeks and gradually resolves over a similar time period. Overcorrections lasting over six months have been rare. About one half of patients will require subsequent doses because of inadequate paralytic response of the muscle to the initial dose, or because of mechanical factors such as large deviations or restrictions, or because of the lack of binocular motor fusion to stabilize the alignment.

### IgG4-related ophthalmic disease involving extraocular muscles: case series [^114RzaaT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum levels of IgG4 varied widely between cases, and though it is one of the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-ROD, it can easily increase or decrease according to disease activity. Case 2 and early phase of case 4 showed normal levels of serum IgG4; however they were firmly diagnosed with IgG4-ROD, according to their typical imaging and histopathologic findings based on the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-ROD.

There have been many reports of extraocular muscle involvement associated with IgG4-ROD, however, most of them did not mention the affected muscles or the clinical features of ocular motility problems. Higashiyama et al. first reported a detailed description of a case with swelling of the left extraocular muscles. The patient reported diplopia on upgaze. Hess chart showed a slight limitation of elevation in the left eye. Intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone improved the supraduction limitation after 5 months. Left ophthalmoplegia was minimal despite severe extraocular muscle swelling. Díaz et al. reported a 60-year-old woman with diplopia. Brain MRI showed enlargement of the extraocular muscles in the left eye. Symptoms improved with steroid treatment. Hussain et al. presented a 48-year-old man with binocular vertical diplopia and limited upgaze in the right eye. Oral prednisolone starting with 80 mg daily and tapered over 4 months resulted in rapid resolution of symptoms and signs. Interestingly, this patient did not show any evident myositis on orbit CT.

Sogabe et al. did not find any predilection for a specific extraocular muscle in 16 patients with IgG4-ROD. However, in our case series, the superior rectus muscle was the least involved (in only 1 patient). Koizumi et al. reported thickened rectus muscles in 6 patients: Bilateral inferior rectus muscles in two patients, left lateral rectus, medial rectus and inferior rectus muscles in one patient, right lateral rectus muscle in one, left lateral rectus, superior rectus and inferior rectus muscles in one patient, and bilateral lateral rectus, right medial rectus and inferior rectus muscles in one patient. Interestingly the lateral rectus muscle was affected in all our patients. Because the lateral rectus muscle is the least affected muscle in thyroid orbitopathy, this finding may be useful to differentiate IgG4-ROD from thyroid eye disease.

### Oculomotor fatigability with decrements of saccade and smooth pursuit for diagnosis of myasthenia gravis [^1144d7D8]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In previous studies, voluntary saccades were studied by electro-oculography in small numbers of MG patients, with analyses mostly focusing on saccadic velocity and accuracy. Compared to control subjects, the velocities of saccades were preserved or increased during the initial phase or during small saccades (1°–3°), while the amplitudes were reduced. In a study that tracked the small-range movement of both eyes in a 60-year-old MG patient, researchers discovered a decrease in amplitude of smooth pursuits in the right eye with conjunctive velocity components and hypermetric saccades with disjunctive velocity components. Another study found that MG patients experienced a significant increase in saccadic peak velocity at 10 ° but not at 20 °, with no difference in saccadic amplitude and with a reduced smooth-pursuit amplitude compared to controls. In this context, the disconjugacy of the velocity profiles of the initial saccade components was caused by impairment of all types of muscle fibers, whereas abnormally fast saccade velocities and saccadic hypermetria with dynamic overshoot were explained by central upregulation of saccadic gain. In MG patients, saccadic fatigue can produce overlapping saccades with high-frequency saccadic bursts separated by long pauses and glissades in which the high-frequency bursts are much shorter than appropriate for the size of the intended saccades. Low-velocity, long-duration, non-main sequence saccades in MG patients compared to normal subjects were also reported. Another study reported that the maximum velocities of 20° and 40° saccades in patients with MG were not significantly different from those in HCs, while patients with other types of ophthalmoplegia showed significantly decreased maximum velocities. A recent small pilot study demonstrated greater saccadic peak velocity in MG patients compared to HCs. Therefore, relatively preserved saccadic velocities in MG patients suggest that twitching muscle fibers generating rapid movements during initial saccades are spared. In the current fatigue quantifications, the diagnostic value in the vertical plane of both saccades and smooth pursuits seems to be superior than that in the horizontal plane in distinguishing MG patients from HCs. MG is characterized by bilateral, fluctuating, and combined extraocular muscle weakness, suggesting that fatigable resistance is not the same in the two movement planes. Several studies have reported the elevating and adducting muscles to be more frequently involved than the depressing and abducting muscles. Muscles that have fewer spindles but greater bulk have a tendency to be more easily fatigued than other muscles.

Myasthenia gravis — definition and ocular involvement: The term myasthenia gravis refers to a group of B-cell mediated autoimmune disorders that profoundly affect activity at the neuromuscular junction causing variable weakness exacerbated by fatigue. Ocular myasthenia gravis affects only the levator, orbicularis oculi, and the extraocular muscles, and it can mimic many types of incomitant strabismus with or without ptosis. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies have been demonstrated in nearly all patients with generalized myasthenia and in 40% to 77% of patients with ocular myasthenia.

### Improvement of fatigue in generalised myasthenia gravis with zilucoplan [^11439f32]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a debilitating autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterised by fluctuating muscle weakness with a prevalence of 100–350 people per million globally. MG causes neuromuscular or muscle fatiguability, where patients' symptoms worsen with sustained activity. However, fatigue in MG goes beyond neuromuscular fatiguability and is also characterised by sensations ranging from tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating and sustained sense of exhaustion that decreases patients' capacity for physical, functional, social and mental activities. A patient-led analysis, with over 114 insights from patients with MG, identified fatigue as one of their major challenges. Patients articulated that fatigue can be debilitating, and unpredictable fluctuations in symptoms lead to feelings of vulnerability and lack of control.

According to a systematic review by Ruiter et al. across 21 studies, the prevalence of fatigue in patients with MG varied from 44 to 82%. The authors suggest that the pathophysiology of fatigue is likely multifactorial in nature, and increased disease severity combined with reduced physical activity could result in lowered muscle strength and increased fatigue. This correlation between disease severity and fatigue was further corroborated in a Dutch study of 420 patients, which found a statistically significant positive correlation between fatigue and MG severity. Fatigue is also associated with depression. As a result of all these factors, fatigue can have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of patients with MG and is strongly associated with reduced quality of life (QoL). Patients describe MG as an "invisible illness" and may find it difficult to explain their challenges to others, which increases the feelings of frustration, loneliness and depression, and such feelings can be exacerbated by fatigue. In a study of real-world clinical practice conducted in the United States, fatigue was included in the five most "troublesome" symptoms for patients with MG together with diplopia, ocular myasthenia, ptosis and weakness in the legs, as reported by physician-completed questionnaires. In a recent study assessing daily activities of patients with MG, general fatigue was identified as one of the most salient symptoms, as reported by the patients. Further, a qualitative, cross-sectional study in the United States with insights from 28 patients with generalised MG (gMG) reported that the most common patient-reported treatment goal for the management of their MG symptoms included reduced fatigue or weakness, followed by achieving symptom stability. Moreover, as reported in another study of 73 patients with MG, treatment with corticosteroids did not alleviate the symptom of fatigue.

### Brimonidine tartrate, timolol maleate (Combigan) [^1166wJMD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Potenti a l for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions

COMBIGAN contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension.

5.2 Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure.

In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, COMBIGAN should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)].

5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which COMBIGAN is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)] should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including COMBIGAN.

5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency

COMBIGAN may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. COMBIGAN should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans.

5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.

5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness

Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.

### Binocular coordination and reading performance during smartphone reading in intermittent exotropia [^115NWgW6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A significant increase in the proportion of monocular viewing in the X(T) group and in fixation disparity in normal subjects when viewing a smartphone at a distance of 20 cm suggests that an adequate viewing distance should be advised to maintain binocular coordination in individuals with X(T) or to reduce visual fatigue in individuals with normal vision.

### Nonneurologic causes of binocular diplopia for the neurologist [^116zeEnX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review several etiologies of nonneurologic diplopia that the neurologist should be familiar with. The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and treatment options are briefly summarized for each condition.

Recent Findings

Certain etiologies for diplopia can be associated with life-threatening neurologic conditions and should be investigated thoroughly for proper localization and immediate management of the underlying disease. However, nonneurological causes of binocular diplopia are very common and disabling, but are often nonemergent and may not require in-depth investigation or neuroimaging. Some of the etiologies of nonneurologic diplopia mimic cranial nerve palsies, making them confusing to evaluate when the physician is not familiar with these etiologies. Unfamiliarity with these diagnoses can lead to unnecessary neuroimaging, inefficient utilization of medical resources, and undue alarm to the patient. Recent advances in clinical diagnostic tools and neuroimaging have clarified our understanding of the diverse underlying mechanisms of nonneurologic binocular diplopia.

Summary

Diplopia can be a difficult symptom for the neurologist to evaluate. A systematic approach to the evaluation of diplopia can help establish the urgency and necessity of an extensive workup. This review will help to familiarize the neurologist with nonneurological causes of binocular diplopia, minimize expensive and unnecessary evaluations, and reassure patients and physicians alike.

### Approach to patient with diplopia [^114iptvo]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

This article presents an overview of the most important points a neurologist must remember when dealing with a patient complaining of diplopia. Patients with monocular diplopia and those with full ocular motility and comitant misalignment should be referred to an ophthalmologist and do not require further testing. Patients with recent onset of binocular diplopia who have associated "brainstem" symptoms should have an urgent brain MRI. All patients with 3rd cranial nerve palsy require urgent brain CTA to rule out compressive aneurysmal lesion. Management of patients over 50 years of age with microvascular risk factors with new onset of 6th nerve palsy is controversial: some image these patients at presentation while others choose a short period of observation as most of these patients would have a microvascular etiology for the 6th nerve palsy which should improve spontaneous in 2–3 months. All others with 6th nerve palsy require brain MRI with contrast. Patients with 4th palsy with hyperdeviation that worsens in downgaze should have an MRI with contrast and all others referred to an ophthalmologist. If there is more than one cranial nerve palsy, urgent neuroimaging should be performed with attention to cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure. Ocular myasthenia should be suspected in patients with eye misalignment that does not fit a pattern for any cranial nerve palsy. Orbital pathology (most commonly thyroid eye disease) can result in restriction of ocular motility and has specific clinical signs associated with it.

### Pathogenic mitochondrial mt-tRNA (ala) variants are uniquely associated with isolated myopathy [^115cUo57]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

mtDNA mutations are frequently associated with multisystemic diseases, although isolated organ involvement is rarely observed. Isolated myopathy owing to mt-tRNA mutations is a rare clinical presentation. Mutations were detected not only in the mt-tRNA Ala gene but single cases are described with mutations in the mt-tRNA Asp, mt-tRNA Trp, mt-tRNA Phe, mt-tRNA Gln, mt-tRNA Leu(CUN), mt-tRNA Pro, mt-tRNA Ile, mt-tRNA Ser(UCN) and mt-tRNA Lys genes. Mutations in the mt-tRNA Ala gene all appear to be associated with isolated myopathy in contrast to mutations in these other mt-tRNA genes that are associated with different phenotypes including multisystemic presentations. In addition to the novel mutations presented here, there are four other previously reported examples of mt-tRNA Ala mutations, two of which are associated with myopathy affecting the limbs (m.5591G > A and m.5650G > A) and two mutations (m.5628T > C and m.5636T > C) associated with a myopathy affecting additionally the extraocular and pharyngeal muscles (Table 1 and Figure 1c). The patient previously described with a m.5591G > A transition presented with pure myopathy, involving predominantly limb girdle muscles, myalgia, elevated CK levels and a severe combined respiratory chain enzyme defect. Follow-up analysis of urine samples from his two unaffected brothers revealed the presence of the m.5591G > A mutation (67% mutant load) in the younger brother, but not in the older brother. Initially, the younger brother presented with asymptomatic elevation of CK, later developing exercise-induced muscle weakness leading to proximal paresis at the age of 51 years. The patient reported with a maternally inherited m.5650G > A mutation in mt-tRNA Ala suffered from an increasingly severe limb girdle myopathy. Two other reported cases showed a preference for skeletal muscle involvement; the m.5628T > C mutation was identified in a patient who presented with proximal paresis, episodic diplopia, external ophthalmoplegia and dysphagia, whilst the m.5636T > C mutation was identified in a patient who presented with fatigue, bilateral ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and mild dysarthria.

### Tocilizumab for the management of corticosteroid-resistant GO combined with OMG: a case series [^114Cdge6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The coexistence of GO and OMG results in obscurity in some of the clinical manifestations or even their omission. GO causes inflammation and fibrosis of orbital connective tissues and extraocular muscles, leading to the upper eyelid retraction, exophthalmos and eye movement disorder. Neuromuscular junction autoimmune reactions cause muscle weakness and fatigue, leading to ptosis and eye movement disorder in OMG patients. When GO and OMG coexist, the typical symptoms become difficult to identify due to overlap of clinical manifestations, such as diplopia. It has been reported that the pathology of muscle tissue in patients with GO combined with OMG may be the result of the interaction between GO-related hypertrophy and MG-related atrophy. These factors cause the delayed diagnosis of GO combined OMG disease. According to the 2020 MG guidelines, in the presence of clinical features, only one positive test, such as AChR antibody or neostigmine test, is required to diagnose MG. In previous studies, diagnosis of GO combined with OMG was made based on thyroid function tests, CT, laboratory tests, and ocular symptoms. Similarly, we collected information on patients diagnosed with GO combined with OMG on the basis of clinical symptoms, laboratory results, and comprehensive imaging analysis (described in methods).

### Fixation stability of the upward gaze in patients with myasthenia gravis: an eye-tracker study [^113ZqWmF]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of eye tracking in evaluating fixation stability in patients with MG

Current clinical evaluations of ocular symptoms in patients with MG with diplopia (initial diplopia and residual diplopia following treatment) are subjective. A published report on the diagnosis and evaluation of MG-associated diplopia describes methods for confirming acquired strabismus caused by MG. These include comparing ocular deviation in the Hess screen test before and after edrophonium infusion. Electromyography demonstrates the fatigue phenomena electrophysiologically and the edrophonium test shows the pharmacological condition of the fatigue phenomenon. However, these tests are diagnostic invasive methods (ie, electromyography is painful; edrophonium has effect on cardiovascular system), and therefore, ophthalmologists avoid repeated use of these tests if alternative, non-invasive methods are available. The ice pack test, which involves cooling the orbital cavity through the application of ice over closed eyelids for 2 min, is less invasive for diagnosing myasthenic ptosis. In contrast, the ice pack test for diagnosing myasthenic diplopia is more invasive because it requires a 5 min or longer cooling time because extraocular muscles are located in the deeper portion of the orbital cavity. Unfortunately, the ice pack test becomes increasingly uncomfortable for the patient when cooling times are longer than 2 min. Compared with these clinical tests, the present quantification method using the eye-tracking system can non-invasively evaluate gaze stability in patients with MG almost without discomforts. As an improvement in gaze stability indicates an improvement in the MG disease state, eye tracking is especially suitable for evaluating treatment efficacy in patients with MG.

Although all the patients met the diagnostic criteria of MGin the present study, not all patients have undergone all tests. This is one of the limitations of this study, making it impossible to further analyse relationships between the degree of fixation instability of the patients with MG and their disease states.

Ocular symptoms associated with MG strongly contribute to the quality of life decline observed in patients with MG. Therefore, evaluating diplopia is important, even after treatment has been initiated. The currently used Hess screen and APCT measure ocular motility and position at only one time point. Therefore, they do not accurately evaluate fatigability over time. Evaluating gaze stability using an eye-tracking system is beneficial to diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy in patients with MG because it is non-invasive, quantitative and accurately measures eye position over a long enough period of time to evaluate the muscle fatigability that is characteristic of MG.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^114AtMUZ]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Esotropia and exotropia PPP — extraocular muscle function specifies that the examiner should evaluate versions (binocular motility) and ductions (monocular motility) and note any limitation, overaction, or incomitance (change in the angle of strabismus in different gaze positions), and when versions are limited, full abduction on monocular duction testing can distinguish the child with infantile or accommodative esotropia from a child with paretic or restrictive esotropia, or esotropic Duane syndrome. Monocular occlusion and oculocephalic rotations are particularly valuable in infants and young children and often reveal clinically normal ductions that may not otherwise be seen, and oblique muscle dysfunction, A or V patterns, and/or dissociated vertical or horizontal deviations should be documented. Diseases associated with paresis, paralysis, or restriction of the extraocular muscles are outside the scope of this PPP.

### Ocular myasthenia revisited: insights from pseudo-internuclear ophthalmoplegia [^113M9rJc]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Ocular myasthenia can mimic central disorders of eye movements. We compared horizontal saccades in two patients with myasthenia gravis who presented as pseudo-internuclear ophthalmoplegia (pseudo-INO), two patients with true INO due to multiple sclerosis (MS), and five healthy subjects. In myasthenics, peak velocity of horizontal saccades was similar to, or greater than, controls; in MS patients, adducting saccades were slower than controls. Differences between the peak velocity of abducting and adducting eyes for each saccade were similar to controls for myasthenic pseudo-INO, but greater than controls for true INO. Using the technique of phase-plane analysis, in which eye velocity is plotted against eye position, we found that initial components of abducting and adducting saccades in the myasthenics were as conjugate as controls, even though later components of myasthenic saccades were highly and variably disjunctive. Conversely, phase planes of saccades in true INO showed disjunctive early components of abducting and adducting saccades. Two hypotheses have been offered to account for preservation of fast saccades despite reduced range of eye movements in ocular myasthenia. The first is intrasaccadic neuromuscular fatigue, which is variable over time. Our finding that initial components of saccades were consistently conjugate in the myasthenics gives support to a second hypothesis: selective sparing of pale global fibers, which are important for generating highspeed eye movements, and which are unique amongst extraocular fibers in possessing well developed synaptic folding.

### Mitochondrial DNA deletions in muscle satellite cells: implications for therapies [^112L7yZo]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mitochondrial myopathies are an important group of muscle conditions caused by defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Patients often present with muscle weakness, although fatigue and exercise intolerance are frequently a problem. In some patients, the predominantly proximal myopathy is accompanied by severe involvement of the extraocular muscles leading to chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), while in others it is part of a multi-system disorder. The myopathic symptoms are progressive and disabling in many patients. Unfortunately, there is little in the way of specific treatment.

Primary mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial myopathy and may be either point mutations or single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. MtDNA is present in tissues in multiple copies and the mtDNA mutations causing mitochondrial myopathies are frequently heteroplasmic, with a mixture of mutated and wild-type forms. The vast majority of mtDNA mutations are functionally recessive and a biochemical deficit is only observed when there are high levels of mutated mtDNA and low levels of wild-type mtDNA. Heteroplasmic mtDNA defects classically give rise to the mosaic pattern of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) normal, intermediate and deficient muscle fibres.

### Diagnosing myasthenia gravis using orthoptic measurements: assessing extraocular muscle fatiguability [^116FwgVz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosing ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) can be challenging because serum antibodies are often not detected. We aimed to explore whether determining extraocular muscle (EOM) weakness using orthoptic measures, including an adapted Hess chart examination, can aid in diagnosing MG.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study among patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody positive MG (20 recently diagnosed, 19 chronic) and 14 seronegative MG patients. We compared orthoptic measures to 19 healthy and 18 disease controls with Graves orbitopathy, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. Maximal eye duction angles were measured using a synoptophore. Gaze deviations between eyes were measured using standard Hess chart examination with addition of 1min persistent gaze to assess MG-associated fatiguability. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed.

Results

For duction angles, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.73 comparing MG to healthy, and 0.69 comparing to patient controls. For the outer field of the Hess chart, the AUC was 0.89 comparing to healthy and 0.54 to patient controls. For drift, the AUC was 0.93 comparing to healthy and 0.93 to patient controls. The sensitivity and specificity of the presence of drift was 81% and 100%.

Discussion

Orthoptic measurements can be used to diagnose MG by quantifying EOM weakness and fatiguability. Drift during persistent gaze on a Hess chart is specific for MG and could be used for diagnostic purposes. The Hess chart examination is widely available, inexpensive and fast. Moreover, orthoptic measurements may be a clinically relevant outcome measure for clinical trials.
