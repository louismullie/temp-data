## Question

can hemodialysis patients take lasix on days they are not on dialysis if still making urine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a hemodialysis patient who is still making urine can take Lasix (furosemide) on non-dialysis days, and how to approach dosing, safety, and monitoring in this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether residual kidney function changes the pharmacologic rationale for loop diuretics. Then, I should verify what regulatory labeling and dialysis guidelines say about furosemide in patients on intermittent hemodialysis. Next, I will review clinical evidence on outcomes with continued loop diuretics after dialysis initiation. After that, I need to check dosing principles and titration in reduced GFR, including the need for higher doses. Finally, I should confirm safety monitoring, contraindications, and practical administration details for non-dialysis days, and synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical premise: if a patient on hemodialysis still has measurable urine output, that residual kidney function (RKF) can meaningfully contribute to sodium and water excretion, and loop diuretics require delivery to the nephron to be effective, so the presence of urine matters for expected response [^116rQbaU] [^1118rvez].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before assuming anything. The FDA labeling for furosemide indicates use is acceptable in patients on intermittent hemodialysis with no dose adjustment required, which supports the appropriateness of continued loop diuretic therapy in HD patients, including on non-dialysis days [^117N6ZQ8] [^116nDWYb].

> Next, I should review guideline-level recommendations. The KDOQI Hemodialysis Adequacy guideline explicitly recommends using diuretics in patients with residual kidney function to help with volume control, aligning with the idea that loop diuretics can be leveraged when urine output persists, albeit with caution regarding ototoxicity and diminishing returns as RKF declines [^113cdm1x] [^116rQbaU].

> I will now examine real-world outcomes data. Continuation of loop diuretics after dialysis initiation has been associated with lower interdialytic weight gain, fewer hospitalizations, and less intradialytic hypotension, without a mortality signal in adjusted analyses, which strengthens the case for maintaining diuretics in patients with RKF who benefit from them [^114ngtU7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose. In reduced GFR, higher loop diuretic doses are often needed to achieve the same natriuretic effect. FDA materials note that increased doses may be required as eGFR falls, and clinical practice commonly uses higher total daily doses in edematous states, titrated to response and tolerability, with careful attention to electrolytes and volume status [^111mtWBX] [^114ytgxe] [^116cuqM1].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. The main contraindication is anuria; if the patient becomes oligoanuric, loop diuretics should be stopped because they will not work and may add risk without benefit. Key adverse effects include hypokalemia, hyponatremia, volume depletion, and ototoxicity, especially at high doses or with interacting drugs; thus, labs for potassium, creatinine/BUN, and bicarbonate should be checked regularly, and patients should be counseled on symptoms of electrolyte disturbances and orthostatic hypotension [^113RFydL] [^1143UZ8K] [^116y5yPg] [^114F3hby].

> Let me think about practical administration on non-dialysis days. Morning dosing is sensible to avoid nocturia, and twice-daily regimens can be used if needed for sustained effect, with dose adjustments based on interdialytic weight gain, blood pressure, and symptoms of congestion. Some programs employ protocolized loop diuretics during incremental HD starts, reinforcing feasibility and safety when RKF is present [^116cuqM1] [^1171GrZb].

> But wait, what if the patient is borderline anuric or has very low urine output. I should double-check the threshold for utility: guidelines suggest loop diuretics are effective when daily urine output is at least about 100 mL, and their benefit wanes as RKF declines. In such cases, a therapeutic trial with close monitoring of urine output and weight response is reasonable, with deprescribing if ineffective [^116rQbaU] [^1118rvez].

> Next, I should review adjuncts and alternatives. If diuretic resistance is suspected, particularly with hypoalbuminemia, short-term coadministration of albumin with furosemide can enhance natriuresis in select patients, though evidence is mixed beyond the early post-dose window and cost and infusion risks must be weighed. In contrast, acetazolamide is not recommended in dialysis patients and should be avoided for this purpose [^114eS1od] [^114Hy95Q] [^115eUFa8].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing is missing. Yes, a hemodialysis patient who is still making urine can take Lasix on non-dialysis days, and in many such patients this is beneficial for volume control, interdialytic weight gain, and hemodynamic stability. Use is label-supported, guideline-endorsed, and associated with improved clinical outcomes in observational cohorts, provided we avoid use in anuria, monitor electrolytes and renal function, and titrate to effect with awareness that higher doses may be needed as RKF declines [^117N6ZQ8] [^113cdm1x] [^114ngtU7] [^111mtWBX] [^114ytgxe].

In select hemodialysis patients with residual urine output, **furosemide may be used on non-dialysis days** to reduce interdialytic weight gain and fluid overload, but only with careful monitoring for electrolyte disturbances and volume depletion [^114ngtU7] [^116y5yPg]. It is **not effective in anuric patients** and should be avoided in those with hypersensitivity to furosemide [^113RFydL] [^1143UZ8K]. Dosing should start low and be titrated to response, with close follow-up of renal function, electrolytes, and clinical status [^116cuqM1] [^116y5yPg].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting furosemide use in hemodialysis patients

- **Residual renal function (RRF)**: Patients with RRF (urine output ≥ 100 mL/day) may benefit from loop diuretics to manage fluid overload and reduce interdialytic weight gain [^116rQbaU] [^1118rvez].

- **Clinical outcomes**: Continuation of loop diuretics after dialysis initiation has been associated with lower hospitalization rates, reduced intradialytic hypotension, and lower interdialytic weight gain [^114ngtU7].

- **Incremental dialysis**: In patients starting twice-weekly hemodialysis with preserved RRF, protocolized loop diuretics were part of a strategy that maintained urine output and reduced ultrafiltration requirements [^1171GrZb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| KDOQI 2006 | - Loop diuretics can be used in hemodialysis patients with RRF to promote sodium and water loss <br/> - Effectiveness depends on adequate urine output (≥ 100 mL/day) [^116rQbaU] [^113cdm1x] |
| ASN 2025 | - In nonoliguric patients with AKI-D, loop diuretics can help control fluid accumulation and reduce ultrafiltration needs <br/> - Suggests trial of furosemide 160 mg twice daily in appropriate patients [^112TMH4G] |
| FDA labeling | - Furosemide is acceptable in patients on intermittent hemodialysis <br/> - No dose adjustment required, but increased doses may be needed in severe renal impairment [^117N6ZQ8] [^111mtWBX] |

---

## Potential benefits of furosemide use on non-dialysis days

- **Reduced interdialytic weight gain**: Furosemide can decrease fluid accumulation between dialysis sessions, potentially improving cardiovascular stability [^114ngtU7].

- **Lower ultrafiltration requirements**: Reduced fluid overload may allow lower ultrafiltration rates, decreasing intradialytic hypotension and cramping [^1138J2W7].

- **Improved symptom control**: Better fluid management may reduce dyspnea, edema, and hypertension [^113UsGBg].

---

## Risks and considerations

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia are common and require monitoring [^116y5yPg].

- **Volume depletion**: Excessive diuresis can cause hypotension and dizziness, especially in elderly patients [^114F3hby].

- **Ototoxicity**: High doses or rapid intravenous administration can cause hearing loss, particularly in patients with renal impairment [^114F3hby].

- **Drug interactions**: Furosemide interacts with aminoglycosides, digoxin, and other ototoxic drugs, increasing toxicity risk [^114F3hby].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Use furosemide primarily in patients with preserved RRF (urine output ≥ 100 mL/day) [^116rQbaU].

- **Dosing strategy**: Start with low doses (e.g. 20–40 mg orally) and titrate based on response and tolerance. Higher doses (up to 160 mg twice daily) may be needed in severe renal impairment [^116cuqM1] [^112TMH4G].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function, electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium), and clinical status. Adjust dialysis prescription as needed to maintain fluid balance [^116y5yPg].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop furosemide if urine output drops below 100 mL/day or if significant adverse effects occur [^notfound].

---

## Alternative strategies for fluid management

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: Limiting sodium intake to < 2.3 g/day can significantly reduce fluid overload [^114iXjzN].

- **Dialysis prescription adjustments**: Modifying ultrafiltration rates, dialysate sodium concentration, and session frequency can improve fluid control [^115396HF].

- **Other diuretics**: Thiazide diuretics are generally ineffective in advanced CKD but may be combined with loop diuretics in select cases [^114jtaQA].

---

Furosemide can be used on non-dialysis days in hemodialysis patients with residual urine output to manage fluid overload, but requires **careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring** to balance benefits and risks [^114ngtU7].

### Magnitude of multiple drug use and determinants of vulnerability among chronic kidney disease inpatients in Ethiopia: a multi-center study [^115t1Ja1]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific drugs in our study, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were the most commonly used drugs, consistent with prior investigations. Deprescribing is important for detecting and discontinuing unnecessary drug. It can be described as "the systemic process of finding and terminating drugs in situations where current or potential adverse effects surpass existing or potential benefits".

Results on medication prescriptions between patients on dialysis and those not on dialysis of this study reveal significant differences in medication prescriptions between CKD patients who are on dialysis and those who are not which is supported by previous study. This analysis provides valuable insights into prescribing patterns and underscores the varied therapeutic approaches based on patients' dialysis status. Furosemide emerged as the most frequently prescribed medication, reflecting its critical role in managing fluid balance in CKD patients. It was prescribed to 50.9% of patients on dialysis and an impressive 99.4% of patients not on dialysis, resulting in an overall prescription rate of 87.4%. This high prevalence underscores furosemide's importance in controlling symptoms of fluid overload, which is particularly relevant for patients with advanced CKD who are at risk of fluid retention. Enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was the second most commonly prescribed medication, with 43.8% of patients on dialysis and 95.3% of those not on dialysis receiving it. The total prescription rate of 85.6% highlights enalapril's role in managing hypertension and proteinuria in CKD patients. Its high usage among patients not on dialysis suggests its efficacy in early CKD stages, where it helps in slowing disease progression and controlling blood pressure. In contrast, spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, was prescribed to only 8.8% of patients on dialysis compared to 55.5% of those not on dialysis, resulting in an overall rate of 43.9%. This discrepancy may be due to the risk of hyperkalemia associated with spironolactone, which can be exacerbated in patients with impaired renal function. Cimetidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, was prescribed to 15.8% of patients on dialysis and 50.9% of those not on dialysis, indicating its use for managing gastrointestinal issues. Insulin was used in 12.3% of patients on dialysis and 34.7% of those not on dialysis, reflecting its importance in managing diabetes, a common comorbidity in CKD patients. Hydrochlorothiazide was not prescribed to any patients on dialysis but was used by 53.2% of those not on dialysis. This difference likely reflects the limited efficacy of thiazide diuretics in advanced CKD, where they are less effective due to decreased renal function. Medications such as nifedipine, aspirin, and atorvastatin showed varied usage, with prescription rates indicating their roles in managing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and hyperlipidemia. Metformin, used primarily for diabetes management, was prescribed only to patients not on dialysis, likely due to concerns about its use in renal impairment. Overall, these findings illustrate the complexity of managing CKD and highlight the importance of tailoring medication regimens to the patient's dialysis status. The variation in prescription patterns reflects the need to balance efficacy, safety, and potential risks associated with renal impairment. Future research could further explore the outcomes associated with these prescribing practices to optimize treatment strategies for CKD patients.

### Association between diuretics and successful discontinuation of continuous renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^112korPw]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

There is still no consensus on the management of patients with AKI discontinuing CRRT. When to discontinue CRRT in patients with AKI depends on various factors. A previous study reported that the possibility of successful CRRT discontinuation is higher in patients with a relatively greater baseline UO or no history of chronic kidney disease. A high 6-h UO immediately before CRRT initiation is associated with lower mortality. Similarly, patients in the CRRT discontinuation group had higher UO compared to patients resuming RRT at both initiation and cessation of CRRT in our study. The HD initiation group had higher sCr and had a greater proportion of hypertensive patients compared with other groups. On the other hand, patients with diuretics in the HD initiation group also had increased UO. Therefore, diuretics may reduce the risk of volume overload regardless of re-initiation of RRT.

In our study, patients treated with diuretics had significantly greater increase in UO, although sCr elevation also occurred. The clinical impact of diuretics on the outcome of AKI has been evaluated in several studies. A previous systematic review reported that furosemide has no significant effect on renal outcome, including RRT and in-hospital mortality. One randomized placebo-controlled study showed that furosemide significantly increased urine volume but did not facilitate post-RRT renal recovery. The best method for evaluation of actual renal function during the peri-RRT period remains unclear, although continuous solute clearance by CRRT is known to stabilize sCr after 48 h. Other observational studies have reported UO as the most significant predictor of successful termination of CRRT. Furthermore, UO during the first 2 h after a furosemide stress test shows predictive value for prognosis of AKI and creatinine clearance > 30 mL/h assessed by 6-h urine collection has been suggested as a criterion for discontinuing RRT. Therefore, both our study and several previous reports support the clinical importance of UO as a better indicator of actual renal function than sCr in patients with AKI who discontinued CRRT.

### Early versus standard initiation of renal replacement therapy in furosemide stress test non-responsive acute kidney injury patients (the FST trial) [^114NL7Gu]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in severe acute kidney injury (AKI) remains controversial, with early initiation resulting in unnecessary therapy for some patients while expectant therapy may delay RRT for other patients. The furosemide stress test (FST) has been shown to predict the need for RRT and therefore could be used to exclude low-risk patients from enrollment in trials of RRT timing. We conducted this multicenter pilot study to determine whether FST could be used to screen patients at high risk for RRT and to determine the feasibility of incorporating FST into a trial of early initiation of RRT.

Methods

FST was performed using intravenous furosemide (1 mg/kg in furosemide-naive patients or 1.5 mg/kg in previous furosemide users). FST-nonresponsive patients (urine output less than 200 mL in 2 h) were then randomized to early (initiation within 6 h) or standard (initiation by urgent indication) RRT.

Results

FST was completed in all patients (100%). Only 6/44 (13.6%) FST-responsive patients ultimately received RRT while 47/60 (78.3%) nonresponders randomized to standard RRT either received RRT or died (P < 0.001). Among 118 FST-nonresponsive patients, 98.3% in the early RRT arm and 75% in the standard RRT arm received RRT. The adherence to the protocol was 94.8% and 100% in the early and standard RRT group, respectively. We observed no differences in 28-day mortality (62.1 versus 58.3%, P = 0.68), 7-day fluid balance, or RRT dependence at day 28. However, hypophosphatemia occurred more frequently in the early RRT arm (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

The furosemide stress test appears to be feasible and effective in identifying patients for randomization to different RRT initiation times. Our findings should guide implementation of large-scale randomized controlled trials for the timing of RRT initiation.

### Diuretic use in renal disease [^114GoXVx]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are agents commonly used in diseases characterized by excess extracellular fluid, including chronic kidney disease, the nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis and heart failure. Multiple diuretic classes, including thiazide-type diuretics, loop diuretics and K(+)-sparing diuretics, are used to treat patients with these diseases, either individually or as combination therapies. An understanding of what determines a patient's response to a diuretic is a prerequisite to the correct use of these drugs. The response of patients with these diseases to diuretics, which is related to the dose, is best described by a sigmoid curve whose contour can become distorted by any of the several sodium-retaining states that are directly or indirectly associated with renal disease. Diuretic actions are of considerable importance to patients who have renal disease, as their effective use assists in extracellular fluid volume control, reducing excretion of protein in urine and lessening the risk of developing hyperkalemia. Diuretic-related adverse events that involve the uric acid, Na(+) and K(+) axes are not uncommon; therefore the clinician must be vigilant in looking for biochemical disturbances. As a result of diuretic-related adverse events, clinicians must be resourceful in the dose amount and frequency of dosing.

### Should diuretics always be included as initial antihypertensive management in early-stage CKD? [^112ps9YR]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the need for combined antihypertensive therapy drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease and the relevance of diuretics.

Recent Findings

Chronic kidney disease is a high-risk situation characterized by the presence of volume overload-related hypertension, micro/macroalbuminuria and other traditional and nontraditional risk factors. To achieve the blood pressure goal in these patients, combined antihypertensive therapy (including diuretics) is usually required.

Summary

Extracellular volume expansion is an important, if not the most important, contributing factor to hypertension seen in chronic kidney disease. Protection against progression of renal dysfunction has two main requirements: strict blood pressure control and lowering proteinuria to values as near to normal as possible. Diuretics have been a useful tool to manage volume overload and to achieve strict blood pressure control in patients with chronic kidney disease. Albeit other blood pressure-lowering agents offer additional favorable effects independently of blood pressure changes, diuretics will continue to be used in these patients.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a novel formulation of furosemide administered as a single subcutaneous injection [^111UM5Zg]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Furoscix (furosemide injection) 80 mg/10 mL is a pH neutral formulation administered subcutaneously (SC) over 5 hours to treat edema in adults with chronic HF or chronic kidney disease. Furosemide 80 mg/mL is a novel concentrated formulation administered as a single 1.0-mL SC injection that could improve convenience for patients. This randomized, open-label, phase 1 study assessed the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, pharmacodynamics, and safety of furosemide 80 mg/mL SC versus furosemide 80 mg administered intravenously (IV).

Methods

Healthy volunteers were randomized 1:1 to furosemide 80 mg/mL SC or furosemide 80 mg IV (two 40-mg boluses, 2 hours apart), and after a 3-day washout, received the opposite treatment. Plasma furosemide pharmacokinetics, urine output, and urinary sodium and potassium excretion were measured through 12 hours post-dose. Bioavailability (the primary endpoint) was assessed as the least-squares mean ratio (LSMR) of area under the curve (AUC) from time 0-last (AUC last) and 0-infinity (AUC inf) between furosemide SC and furosemide IV. Plasma furosemide pharmacokinetics were assessed noncompartmentally. Pharmacodynamics were assessed using a repeated measures, mixed model analysis. Safety was assessed through end of study.

Results

Twenty-one participants were randomized (furosemide SC/IV, n = 10; furosemide IV/SC, n = 11). The furosemide SC/IV LSMR (90% confidence interval [CI]) AUC last was 106.1% (102.7%, 109.6%), and LSMR (90% CI) AUC inf was 107.3% (103.9%, 110.8%). Furosemide 80 mg/mL SC had bioavailability equivalent to furosemide 80 mg IV, as the CIs fell within 80.0%-125.0%. Mean (SD) C max was 4532.9 (1497.7) ng/mL with furosemide 80 mg/mL SC and 10,087.6 (2804.7) ng/mL with furosemide IV. The therapeutic effects of furosemide 80 mg/mL SC on diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis occurred within 1 hour of treatment and were consistent with those of furosemide IV at all time points. There was no significant difference between furosemide 80 mg/mL SC versus furosemide IV in total urine output or urinary sodium or potassium excretion at 0–6 hours, 0–8 hours, or 0–12 hours. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 14 (66.7%) participants (furosemide SC, n = 11 [52.4%]; furosemide IV, n = 7 [35.0%]) and were mild or moderate. Ten (47.6%) participants had injection site AEs, all of which were treatment-related, mild, non-serious, and resolved. Injection site pain scores graded on a Likert 11-point scale remained low (mean, < 0.4; median, 0) at all time points, were similar between groups, and decreased over time.

Conclusions

Furosemide 80 mg/mL SC injection was generally well tolerated and had bioavailability, diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis consistent with those of furosemide IV.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^113cdm1x]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis (HD) guideline 5 — The ultrafiltration component of the HD prescription "should be optimized with a goal to render the patient euvolemic and normotensive. This includes counseling the patient on sodium and fluid restriction, adequate ultrafiltration, and the use of diuretics in patients with RKF. (A)". It further states that "Daily dietary sodium intake should be restricted to no more than 5 g of sodium chloride (2.0 g or 85 mmol of sodium). (A)" and that "Increasing positive sodium balance by "sodium profiling" or using a high dialysate sodium concentration should be avoided. (B)".

### Patient-reported outcomes in a pilot clinical trial of twice-weekly hemodialysis start with adjuvant pharmacotherapy and transition to thrice-weekly hemodialysis vs conventional hemodialysis [^114jtaQA]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

For practicality and in the absence of data regarding optimal level of urea solute clearance in patients with incident KDRD and residual kidney function, the dialysis prescription was adjusted to achieve dialysis single-pool Kt/Vurea (spKdt/Vurea) of ≥ 1.2 and urea reduction ration (URR) of ≥ 65% in both treatment groups throughout the study period — including during the first 6 weeks in the incremental HD group. Under the direction of the treating nephrologist, progression from twice-weekly to thrice-weekly HD was allowed to take place prior to the six-week time point for clinical manifestations (e.g. uncontrolled uremic symptoms, volume overload, persistent biochemical imbalances) deemed to benefit from more frequent HD. Adjuvant pharmacological therapy (ie, loop diuretics ± thiazide diuretics, patiromer potassium-binding agent and/or bicarbonate-based agent) were prescribed during the period of twice-weekly HD in the incremental HD group, as previously detailed.

Outcomes and measurements

Pre-specified exploratory analyses, reported here, included comparison in longitudinal changes in patient-reported outcomes using three questionnaires; and collection of participant feedback on study-related procedures using a semi-structured questionnaire. Sample size selection for the primary outcome of feasibility of incremental HD has been previously described. Questionnaire-based patients' answers were gathered through telephone interview by a study team member (i.e. study coordinator) trained in questionnaire administration. Data was logged as missing when participants declined interview participation.

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^116cuqM1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of LASIX is 20 mg to 80mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg or 40mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of LASIX may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving LASIX on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Test).

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric patients — The usual initial dose of oral LASIX in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

### A comprehensive review of the loop diuretics: should furosemide be first line? [^112DYoKj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the pharmacokinetic profiles, comparative safety and efficacy, and comparative costs of loop diuretics to evaluate the current clinical usefulness of furosemide.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-June 2009) was conducted using the terms furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, and loop diuretics. Articles were limited to those written in English.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed. Studies were eligible if they encompassed pharmacokinetics, comparative safety and efficacy, or comparative costs of the loop diuretics.

Data Synthesis

In patients with heart failure (HF), torsemide demonstrated decreased mortality compared with furosemide in 1 study (2.2% vs 4.5% in the furosemide group; p < 0.05), decreased hospitalizations in 1 study (23 in the torsemide group vs 61 in the furosemide group; p < 0.01), and improved New York Heart Association functional classifications in 2 studies. In the first, 45.8% with torsemide versus 37.2% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.00017). In the second, 40.2% with torsemide and 30.7% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.014). In 2 of 3 studies of patients with cirrhosis, torsemide increased natriuresis and total volume diuresed compared with furosemide in patients with cirrhosis; however, no significant difference between the agents with respect to plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations was demonstrated. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, central venous pressure, capillary wedge pressure, and stroke volume significantly improved from baseline among patients who received torsemide, but not in those who received furosemide, although the intergroup analysis failed to reach statistical significance. Among patients with chronic kidney disease, no significant differences were noted with respect to natriuresis and blood pressure control between the 2 agents; however, in patients with acute kidney injury, patients who received furosemide had a significant improvement in urine output versus the torsemide group. Additionally, 2 trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide were identified, although the results were conflicting. In patients with nephrotic syndrome, bumetanide significantly improved weight loss in the first 4 weeks and in week 20, compared with furosemide. In patients with HF, significant improvement in dyspnea at rest and on exertion was exhibited in the bumetanide group, but not in the furosemide group; no significant difference was noted between the 2 groups when evaluating global assessment.

Conclusions

Growing evidence demonstrates more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles of torsemide and bumetanide compared with furosemide. Furthermore, torsemide may be more efficacious and safer than furosemide in patients with HF. A trial comparing all 3 drugs would be required to confirm torsemide as the primary loop diuretic in patients with HF, but based upon limited current evidence, we recommend torsemide over furosemide. Currently, little evidence exists to support either torsemide or bumetanide as first-line treatment over furosemide in patients with other edematous disease states.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^1138J2W7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis residual kidney function — hemodynamic management and diuretics: Episodes of intravascular volume depletion that frequently result in hypotension should be minimized and measures to maintain hemodynamic stability should be routine, with strategies to minimize hypotension during HD including avoidance of excessive ultrafiltration, maintaining the target hematocrit, reduction in dialysate temperature, increasing dialysate sodium concentration, and possibly administration of an α agonist, such as midodrine; avoidance of hypotension also helps ensure delivery of adequate dialysis and minimize symptoms during HD, and paradoxically, loop diuretics probably benefit HD patients because they reduce the requirement for fluid removal during dialysis.

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^116y5yPg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients receiving LASIX should be advised that they may experience symptoms from excessive fluid and/or electrolyte losses. The postural hypotension that sometimes occurs can usually be managed by getting up slowly. Potassium supplements and/or dietary measures may be needed to control or avoid hypokalemia.

Patients with diabetes mellitus should be told that furosemide may increase blood glucose levels and thereby affect urine glucose tests. The skin of some patients may be more sensitive to the effects of sunlight while taking furosemide.

Hypertensive patients should avoid medications that may increase blood pressure, including over-the-counter products for appetite suppression and cold symptoms.

Laboratory Tests

Serum electrolytes (particularly potassium), CO2, creatinine and BUN should be determined frequently during the first few months of LASIX therapy and periodically thereafter. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting profusely or receiving parenteral fluids. Abnormalities should be corrected or the drug temporarily withdrawn. Other medications may also influence serum electrolytes.

Reversible elevations of BUN may occur and are associated with dehydration, which should be avoided, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency.

Urine and blood glucose should be checked periodically in diabetics receiving LASIX, even in those suspected of latent diabetes.

LASIX may lower serum levels of calcium (rarely cases of tetany have been reported) and magnesium. Accordingly, serum levels of these electrolytes should be determined periodically.

In premature infants LASIX may precipitate nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis, therefore renal function must be monitored and renal ultrasonography performed (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).

### Efficacy and safety of oral tolvaptan in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115KzBFS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatic dysfunction has been reported in tolvaptan clinical trials for ADPKD. In this study, one patient in the tolvaptan 15 mg group reported a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. However, these TEAEs resolved during the study period. The incidence of thirst was lower and that of diarrhea was lower or comparable to that reported in previous tolvaptan clinical trials. No clinically relevant findings were reported in vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory tests among the groups. No deaths were reported during the trial and the incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to the discontinuation of study drugs was similar among the groups. Overall, tolvaptan was well-tolerated during the 24-week treatment period.

This study has some limitations. First, more patients withdrew from this study in the placebo group versus the tolvaptan groups. Therefore the possibility of attrition bias cannot be excluded. Second, only patients with urine volume ≥ 500 mL/day were enrolled to include those with a substantial residual urine volume to allow for the tolvaptan action of increasing urine volume. Thus the results from this study could not confirm the effect of tolvaptan on urine volume in oliguric patients with urine volume < 500 mL/day. Third, we are unable to discuss the diuretic action of tolvaptan in patients who are severely resistant to loop diuretics based on the results of the current study, because the dose of the concomitantly used loop diuretics was low (furosemide-equivalent median dose 40 mg/day). Therefore it also remains unclear whether tolvaptan exhibits aquaretic action in patients who are severely resistant to loop diuretics.

This study suggests that tolvaptan is well-tolerated and increases urine volume and preserves urine output for 24 weeks in HD patients. However, it remains unclear if tolvaptan treatment results in a lower volume of fluid removal during HD and IDWG. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and to define the role of tolvaptan more clearly in improving clinical outcomes, such as deterioration of RKF and cardiovascular mortality, in HD patients.

### Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^112J67py]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ACCORDING TO PATIENT'S RESPONSE.

Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for the previously titrated individual components.

Alternatively, therapy may be instituted with a single tablet of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/15 mg taken once daily. For patients insufficiently responsive to the initial dose, additional captopril or hydrochlorothiazide may be added as individual components or by using captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50 mg/15 mg, 25 mg/25 mg or 50 mg/25 mg, or divided doses may be used.

Because the full effect of a given dose may not be attained for 6 to 8 weeks, dosage adjustments should generally be made at 6 week intervals, unless the clinical situation demands more rapid adjustment.

In general, daily doses of captopril should not exceed 150 mg and of hydrochlorothiazide should not exceed 50 mg.

Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken one hour before meals.

Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment: Because captopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted primarily by the kidneys, excretion rates are reduced in patients with impaired renal function. These patients will take longer to reach steady-state captopril levels and will reach higher steady-state levels for a given daily dose than patients with normal renal function. Therefore, these patients may respond to smaller or less frequent doses of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

After the desired therapeutic effect has been achieved, the dose intervals should be increased or the total daily dose reduced until the minimal effective dose is achieved. When concomitant diuretic therapy is required in patients with severe renal impairment, a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide), rather than a thiazide diuretic is preferred for use with captopril; therefore, for patients with severe renal dysfunction the captopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination tablet is not usually recommended. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis).

### Diuretics, limited ultrafiltration, and residual renal function in incident hemodialysis patients: a case series [^1164oTPh]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of diuretics on residual renal function expressed as residual GFR (rGFR) and urine volume (rUV) using 24-hour urine collections has not been well examined in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We present a small (seven patient) but provocative case series describing a strikingly low rate of decline in rUV and rGFR (average of creatinine and urea clearances, 24-hour urine collections) in patients treated with increasing doses of furosemide (up to 360 mg/day) during the first 2 years after initiation of HD. Between 6 and 12 months, the mean rUV fell by 1 ml/month, whereas rGFR declined by 0.03 ml/min/1.73 m² /month. The mean rate of decline from 12 to 24 months for rUV (33 ml/month) and rGFR (0.02 ml/min/1.73 m² /month) were also low. While data are clearly limited and the observation retrospective, they are consistent with the better documented benefit of diuretics observed in end-stage renal disease patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^114eS1od]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with edema is a common clinical problem resulting from defects in water and solute excretion. Furosemide is the drug of choice for treatment. In theory, good perfusion and albumin are required for the furosemide to be secreted at the tubular lumen. Thus, in the situation of low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and hypoalbuminemia, the efficacy of furosemide alone might be limited. There has been no study to validate the effectiveness of the combination of furosemide and albumin in this condition.

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled crossover study to compare the efficacy of diuretics between furosemide alone and the combination of furosemide plus albumin in stable hypoalbuminemic CKD patients by measuring urine output and sodium. The baseline urine output/sodium at 6 and 24 hours were recorded. The increment of urine output/sodium after treatment at 6 and 24 hours were calculated by using post-treatment minus baseline urine output/sodium at the corresponding period.

Results

Twenty-four CKD patients (GFR = 31.0 ± 13.8 mL/min) with hypoalbuminemia (2.98 ± 0.30 g/dL) were enrolled. At 6 hours, there were significant differences in the increment of urine volume (0.47 ± 0.40 vs 0.67 ± 0.31 L, P < 0.02) and urine sodium (37.5 ± 29.3 vs 55.0 ± 26.7 mEq, P < 0.01) between treatment with furosemide alone and with furosemide plus albumin. However, at 24 hours, there were no significant differences in the increment of urine volume (0.49 ± 0.47 vs 0.59 ± 0.50 L, P = 0.46) and urine sodium (65.3 ± 47.5 vs 76.1 ± 50.1 mEq, P = 0.32) between the two groups.

Conclusion

The combination of furosemide and albumin has a superior short-term efficacy over furosemide alone in enhancing water and sodium diuresis in hypoalbuminemic CKD patients.

### Sodium, volume and pressure control in haemodialysis patients for improved cardiovascular outcomes [^115396HF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

HOW TO BEST APPROACH EUVOLAEMIA — STATE OF THE ART 2020

The heterogeneity in the ESRD population challenges the nephrologist in HD practice to combine disease management with the patient's attainable treatment goal and prognosis.

The context is complex and a multidimensional approach to Na+, fluid and pressure management in HD patients may be required to improve cardiovascular outcomes in HD patients (Figure 3). The pillars of clinical, instrumental and patient management need to complement each other to correctly assess the patient's dry weight, and achieve BP control and haemodynamic tolerance of HD therapy, while reassuring patient acceptance of HD duration and sequence.

FIGURE 3
Multidimensional approach to sodium, fluid and pressure management in haemodialysis patients. US, ultrasound; 23Na MRI, magnetic resonance imaging of tissue sodium stores.

Some dialysis facilities have implemented incremental dialysis as a preventive measure at the start of renal replacement therapy. Other dialysis facilities permit a degree of initial overhydration to preserve residual renal function, which may improve outcomes. A recent DOPPS analysis confirmed the previous finding for incident HD patients that urine output of at least 1 cup daily was associated with better survival and it may be of value to routinely ask patients a simple question about urine output. Diuretics may lessen chronic FO in patients with preserved residual kidney function, but this approach has not been evaluated.

Some experts have suggested imposing UF rate thresholds (such as 13 mL/h/kg) to reduce UF-related risk. UF profiling (decelerating UF rate to match declining plasma refill rate) and sequential dialysis (isolated UF followed by combined HD and UF) are other potential HD prescription changes to reduce the harm of rapid UF rate.

Finally, as once demonstrated by the Tassin group, increased frequency or duration of HD sessions may bring high volume status, left ventricular mass and BP under control by more effectively reducing ECF load than conventional HD.

Unfortunately, classic randomized controlled trials in HD thus far have failed to yield any meaningful information in the area of dose and frequency of HD, mainly due to methodological issues, such as statistical errors, unfeasible trial efficiency, recruitment challenges and applicability of results to the research question. Cluster randomization may be a novel and advantageous trial method and a potential mean to overcome these barriers.

Yet, before we know for certain, we need rigorous cardiovascular outcome studies and thorough study interventions such as the above-mentioned (e.g. effect of UF rate thresholds) on volume status, fluid-related hospitalizations and cardiovascular outcomes while ensuring the patient's acceptance to therapy.

### High-dose furosemide for established ARF: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^114JSi5e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of furosemide on the survival and renal recovery of patients presenting with acute renal failure (ARF) is still debated.

Methods

Three hundred thirty-eight patients with ARF requiring dialysis therapy were randomly assigned to the administration of either furosemide (25 mg/kg/d intravenously or 35 mg/kg/d orally) or matched placebo, with stratification according to severity at presentation. The primary end point was survival. The secondary end point was number of dialysis sessions. Tertiary end points included time on dialysis therapy, time to achieve a serum creatinine level less than 2.26 mg/dL (< 200 micromol/L), and time to reach a 2-L/d diuresis.

Results

There were no differences in survival and renal recovery rates between the 2 groups. Time to achieve a 2-L/d diuresis was shorter with furosemide (5.7 ± 5.8 days) than placebo (7.8 ± 6.8 days; P = 0.004). Overall, 148 patients achieved a urine output of at least 2 L/d during the study period (94 of 166 patients; 57%) with furosemide versus 54 of 164 patients (33%) with placebo (P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in number of dialysis sessions and time on dialysis therapy between the furosemide and placebo groups, even in the subgroup of patients reaching a 2-L/d diuresis.

Conclusion

High-dose furosemide helps maintain urinary output, but does not have an impact on the survival and renal recovery rate of patients with established ARF.

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^116bZfeW]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The potential effect of the combination of furosemide and albumin is still controversial. Fliser et al. have found that the effect of the combination of furosemide and albumin can significantly, but modestly increase urine output and sodium excretion in nephrotic syndrome patients. In contrast, others failed to demonstrate this effect. In studies of hypoalbuminemic cirrhotic patients, one study has shown the benefit of the combination while others have shown no significant differences in water and sodium excretion between furosemide alone and the combination of furosemide plus albumin.

Although there is a common usage of the combination of furosemide and albumin in hypoalbuminemic patients in clinical practice, whether there is any significant benefit of this combination for the treatment of edema in hypoalbuminemic patients especially in patients with chronic kidney disease is still unknown. Due to the high price of albumin and allergic reactions which can occur to it, we conducted a randomized controlled crossover study to compare the efficacy of diuresis between furosemide alone and the combination of furosemide plus albumin for the treatment of edema in stable hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease patients by measuring urine output and urine sodium.

Subjects and methods

Subjects

Twenty-four patients with stable chronic kidney disease (no fluctuation of GFR > 10% in two months) who presented with edema (pretibial pitting edema from physical examination) and low serum albumin were enrolled in this study. CKD patients were defined as patients who have GFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² and low serum albumin was defined as serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL. Exclusion criteria were patients with GFR < 10 mL/min per 1.73 m², heavy proteinuria (24-hour urine protein > 3.5 g/d), critically ill patients such as congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, shock, on respirator and/or previous history of furosemide usage within two weeks. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Studies at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand (ID 06–52–18). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The study protocol was also registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registration (ANZCTR 12611000480987).

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112epHiQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There is no universally recommended FR limit. For FR to be effective, there must be negative fluid balance — with electrolyte-free water output exceeding input. For this reason, US recommendations suggest FR that is 500 mL below the 24-hour urine output, which is a "rule of thumb" to achieve this (given the difficulty of measuring insensible losses). For consistency, most available studies evaluate FR in the range of 500 to 1000 mL. The efficacy of a 1000-mL FR was recently evaluated in comparison to no treatment, in a randomized trial in 46 patients (mean age 73 years) with chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia, mean baseline pNa 127 mmol/L. This trial observed a modest early rise in serum sodium of 3 mmol/L in fluid-restricted patients, compared to 1 mmol/L with no treatment (allowed ad libitum fluid intake, average intake 1.5 L). However, 39% patients assigned to FR did not respond, with serum sodium persistently below 130 mmol/L after 3 days. Notably, 9 of 23 (39%) participants receiving no treatment achieved pNa greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L after 4 days, illustrating a relatively high rate of "spontaneous correction" even in chronic hyponatremia. These results were similar to the Thai EFFUSE-FLUID trial of 92 participants with hyponatremia, mean age 59 years, that evaluated FR (limit 500–1000 mL), determined based on urine/serum electrolyte ratio (ie, Fürst ratio, discussed later) with or without furosemide and oral salt tablets. This trial reported a mean increase in pNa of 5 mmol/L after 4 days in the 31 patients allocated to FR alone; however, there was no control group. In the group allocated to FR alone, 52% had pNa persistently below 130 mmol/L after 4 days and 26% had pNa less than 130 mmol/L after 30 days. Regarding the "dose" of FR, across this study as a whole, 57% participants were allocated to FR less than 1000 mL and 43% to less than 500 mL, based on prespecified criteria for urine:serum electrolyte ratio. Adherence to FR was much lower, with the 500 mL limit (43% vs 79% for the 1000 mL limit) suggesting this tighter limit was not as well tolerated. In a Swiss prospective observational trial, total daily fluid intake (above or below 500 mL) was not significantly associated with nonresponse to FR, indicating marginal benefit to a tighter restriction. In general, a FR limit of 1000 mL per day is the most widely studied, and any benefits to a restriction limit below this are unproven.

### Diuretic use, residual renal function, and mortality among hemodialysis patients in the dialysis outcomes and practice pattern study (DOPPS) [^112oUJKu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Information about residual renal function (RRF) and outcomes associated with practices of diuretic use in patients with end-stage renal disease is not available worldwide.

Methods

Diuretic use was investigated in 16,420 hemodialysis patients from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, a prospective observational study of hemodialysis patients selected from nationally representative facilities on 3 continents. Logistic regressions were used to investigate associations between diuretic use and patient characteristics. Outcomes of interdialytic weight gain, increased serum potassium and phosphorus levels, and odds of retaining RRF after 1 year were investigated. Cox regression was used to analyze the association between mortality and diuretic use.

Results

Facility diuretic use varied substantially from 0% to 83.9% of patients. Diuretic use decreased sharply after the start of dialysis therapy. Loop diuretic use ranged from 9.2% in the United States to 21.3% in Europe, whereas use within 90 days of starting dialysis therapy ranged from 25.0% in the United States to 47.6% in Japan. Diuretic use was associated with lower interdialytic weight gain and lower odds of hyperkalemia (potassium > 6.0 mmol/L). Patients with RRF on diuretic therapy had almost twice the odds of retaining RRF after 1 year in the study versus patients not on diuretic therapy. Patients administered diuretics had a 7% lower all-cause mortality risk (P = 0.12) and 14% lower cardiac-specific mortality risk (P = 0.03) versus patients not administered diuretics.

Conclusion

Variation exists in facility practices of diuretic use. In patients with RRF, there may be benefit associated with continuing diuretic use rather than automatically discontinuing diuretic therapy at dialysis initiation.

### Spontaneous diuresis in combination with furosemide stress test (SD-FST) as predictor for successful liberation from kidney replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^112Qsu8F]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a challenge in critical care medicine. AKI is common in critically ill and is associated with high mortality, which increases particularly when kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is required.

The optimal time to initiate KRT has been extensively studied in recent years. Delaying KRT may be justified in certain cases, because renal function may recover spontaneously. However, KRT should not be postponed if mandatory indications are observed.

In contrast, there are currently insufficient data on the best time to discontinue KRT. This issue is highly relevant, since shorter dialysis time is cost-effective and possible complications of the procedure could be avoided. Patient factors that can be associated with non-recovery after AKI include for example age, chronic kidney disease, or surgical versus non-surgical admission. Furthermore, the severity of the acute illness, high urine output, KRT duration, decreasing serum creatinine, urinary creatinine and urea, kinetic of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or biomarker-based estimates may be helpful in decision-making to discontinue KRT.

A large multicenter observational study found a 24-h spontaneous diuresis (SD) of at least 436 mL without diuretics to be the most important predictor for successful discontinuation of KRT, similar findings were found for increased urine output with diuretics.

Therefore, this could be used as a diagnostic test, although this association was not consistently demonstrated. A diagnostic candidate for unmasking the tubular reserve and thus indirectly estimating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the furosemide stress test (FST). The test has been shown to help to identify patients with severe and progressive AKI and improve the timing for KRT initiation. Current data suggest that FST may also be a promising candidate for predicting successful recovery of renal function after KRT.

Given this background, we hypothesized that a combination of re-onset SD and FST can predict renal function recovery after KRT with a high degree of accuracy. This may help to develop reliable predictors for liberation from KRT.

### Captorpil (Captopril) [^1116WxES]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Therapy may be initiated as early as three days following a myocardial infarction. After a single dose of 6.25 mg, captopril tablets therapy should be initiated at 12.5 mg t.i.d. Captopril tablets should then be increased to 25 mg t.i.d. during the next several days and to a target dose of 50 mg t.i.d. over the next several weeks as tolerated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Captopril tablets may be used in patients treated with other post-myocardial infarction therapies, e.g. thrombolytics, aspirin, beta blockers.

Diabetic Nephropathy: The recommended dose of captopril tablets for long term use to treat diabetic nephropathy is 25 mg t.i.d.

Other antihypertensives such as diuretics, beta blockers, centrally acting agents or vasodilators may be used in conjuction with captopril tablets if additional therapy is required to further lower blood pressure.

Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment: Because captopril is excreted primarily by the kidneys, excretion rates are reduced in patients with impaired renal function. These patients will take longer to reach steady-state captopril levels and will reach higher steady-state levels for a given daily dose than patients with normal renal function. Therefore, these patients may respond to smaller or less frequent doses.

Accordingly, for patients with significant renal impairment, initial daily dosage of captopril should be reduced, and smaller increments utilized for titration, which should be quite slow (one- to two-week intervals). After the desired therapeutic effect has been achieved, the dose should be slowly back titrated to determine the minimal effective dose. When concomitant diuretic therapy is required, a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide), rather than a thiazide diuretic, is preferred in patients with severe renal impairment. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis .)

WARNING

LASIX (furosemide) is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required and dose and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs (s ee DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Association of continuation of loop diuretics at hemodialysis initiation with clinical outcomes [^114ngtU7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Loop diuretics are commonly used to manage nondialysis-dependent CKD. Despite benefits of augmented urine output, loop diuretics are often discontinued after dialysis initiation. Here, we assessed the association of the early decision to continue loop diuretics at hemodialysis start with clinical outcomes during the first year of dialysis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We considered all patients on in-center hemodialysis at a large dialysis organization (2006–2013) with Medicare Part A and D benefits who had an active supply of a loop diuretic at dialysis initiation (n = 11,297). Active therapy was determined on the basis of whether loop diuretic prescription was refilled after dialysis initiation and within 30 days of exhaustion of prior supply. Patients were followed under an intention-to-treat paradigm for up to 12 months for rates of death, hospitalization, and intradialytic hypotension and mean monthly values of interdialytic weight gain, serum potassium, predialysis systolic BP, and ultrafiltration rates.

Results

We identified 5219 patients who refilled a loop diuretic and 6078 eligible controls who did not. After adjustments for patient mix and clinical differences, continuation of loop diuretics was associated with lower hospitalization (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.98) and intradialytic hypotension (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 0.99) rates, no difference in death rate (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.01), and lower interdialytic weight gain (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Continuation of loop diuretics after hemodialysis initiation was associated with lower rates of hospitalization and intradialytic hypotension as well as lower interdialytic weight gain, but there was no difference in mortality over the first year of dialysis.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Edema

LASIX is indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. LASIX is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.

Hypertension

Oral LASIX may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with LASIX alone.

### Diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111Wa9xM]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Diuretic drugs act on electrolyte transporters in the kidney to induce diuresis and are often used in chronic kidney disease (CKD), given that nephron loss creates a deficit in the ability to excrete dietary sodium, which promotes an increase in plasma volume. This rise in plasma volume is exacerbated by CKD-induced systemic and intra-renal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which further limits urinary sodium excretion. In the absence of a compensatory decrease in systemic vascular resistance, increases in plasma volume induced by sodium retention can manifest as a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure. Management of sodium and volume overload in patients with CKD is therefore typically based on restriction of dietary sodium intake and the use of diuretic agents to enhance urinary sodium excretion. Thiazide and thiazide-type diuretics are foundational therapies for the management of hypertension, whereas loop diuretics are often needed for volume overload, which might also require combination therapies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have an important role in the management of diuretic-resistant volume overload or treatment-resistant hypertension. Additionally, diuretics can be used for the diagnosis of kidney diseases and in the management of hyperkalaemia or hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia.

### Furosemide does not improve renal recovery after hemofiltration for acute renal failure in critically ill patients: a double blind randomized controlled trial [^113GELhi]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the potential beneficial role of furosemide in resolving renal failure after hemofiltration in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.

Design

Single-center randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

A 13-bed mixed intensive care unit (ICU) in a teaching hospital.

Patients

Patients who had been treated with continuous venovenous hemofiltration were included.

Interventions

After the end of continuous venovenous hemofiltration, the urine of the first 4 hours was collected for measuring creatinine clearance. Patients were subsequently randomized for furosemide (0.5 mg/kg/hr) or placebo by continuous infusion. To prevent hypovolemia, the rate of fluid infusion was adapted every hour and was set as the urinary production of the previous hour.

Measurements and Main Results

End points were renal recovery (creatinine clearance more than 30 mL/min or stable serum creatinine without renal replacement therapy) in the ICU and in the hospital. Seventy-two patients were included and 71 were eligible for the analysis. The 36 furosemide-treated patients had a significantly increased urinary volume compared with the 35 placebo-treated patients (median 247 mL/hr (interquartile range [IQR] 774 mL/hr) vs. 117 mL/hr (IQR 158 mL/hr), p = 0.003) and greater sodium excretion (median 73 mmol/L (IQR 48) vs. 37 (IQR 48) mmol/L, p = 0.001). In the furosemide group 25 patients and in the placebo group 27 patients showed recovery of renal function at ICU discharge (p = 0.46). Two patients of the furosemide group needed long-term dialysis dependency (p = 0.23).

Conclusion

Furosemide by continuous infusion in the recovery phase of hemofiltration-dependent acute kidney failure did increase urinary volume and sodium excretion but did not lead to a shorter duration of renal failure or more frequent renal recovery.

### Furosemide stress test as a predictive marker of acute kidney injury progression or renal replacement therapy: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^114mh6DM]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Furosemide has been used for decades. Its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects are well described in patients with chronic kidney disease or nephrotic syndrome, but less data is available regarding its effects in AKI populations. Because of its low cost and availability, using diuretic response as a preserved renal functional marker has been proposed. In 1973, Baek et al. reported that the urinary free water excretion following intravenous furosemide administration could serve as a diagnostic tool for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Pandit and colleagues found that, while on furosemide therapy, patients who had urine output less than 1200 mL 1 day after coronary artery bypass graft surgery were more likely to experience AKI, with a specificity of 97.93%. It has been no one until 2013, Chawla et al. proposed a standard FST protocol, in which diuretic-naive patients receive 1 mg/kg of furosemide and patients who were exposed to furosemide within 7 days received 1.5 mg/kg of furosemide. They use 200 mL urine output at 2 h after furosemide administration to serve as a cutoff value. In subjects with normal renal function or mild AKI, the infusion dose and creatinine clearance are major determinants of diuretic response. After AKI, several tubular function alterations could affect diuretic response, including a decrease of Na-K-Cl cotransporter 2 expression, Na-K-ATPase redistribution, and organic acid transporter mistargeting. Therefore, the FST seems to provide a quick and easy method for the assessment of glomerular filtration and tubular damage. Despite this aforementioned role in diagnostics, furosemide is unlikely to reduce mortality or decrease the risk of RRT in AKI populations. We thus performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the predictive value of the FST on AKI progression, the need for RRT, and in-hospital mortality. First, the analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of the FST for AKI progression yielded an AUROC of 0.88, with pooled sensitivity and specificity values of 0.81 and 0.88, respectively. Although there are no studies directly comparing the diagnostic accuracy of FST with other biomarkers, the AUROC of FST for AKI progression is not inferior to that of biomarkers, which ranged from 0.70 to 0.85 in previous reports. The diagnostic performance of FST was not affected by whether the enrolled patients have high plasma NGAL or not. Koyner et al. by using the same cohort with Chawla et al. reported the AUROC of FST was higher than that of each biomarker alone. Compared to the overall cohort, the diagnostic accuracy of FST improved in patients with elevated biomarkers. The aforementioned studies and our work imply that FST could serve as a simple risk triage tool combined with or without novel biomarker in early AKI patients.

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^115wfWb3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Use

Controlled clinical studies of LASIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function (s ee PRECAUTIONS: General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Efficacy and safety of oral tolvaptan in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115oyfRV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive tolvaptan 15 or 30 mg/day or placebo for 24 weeks on off-dialysis days. To minimize bias, treatment allocation was stratified by urine osmolarity (≥ 290/ < 290 mOsm/L) before HD in the pretreatment observation period. An independent treatment allocation manager prepared a master random allocation table using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and coded the study drug as per the operating procedures of randomization. The allocation table was sealed by the treatment allocation manager immediately after completion of treatment randomization and was kept under strict control until unblinding. The investigators, patients and trial staff were blinded to treatment randomization.

Tablets of tolvaptan (15/30 mg) or placebo, indistinguishable from each other, were administered once daily after breakfast on off-dialysis days for 24 weeks. To prevent rapid diuresis, patients in the tolvaptan 30 mg group were initiated on a once-daily dose (on off-dialysis days) of 15 mg for the first week followed by 30 mg once daily for 23 weeks. Any drug or food having potent inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) was prohibited during the study period because CYP3A4 metabolizes tolvaptan. Initiation of any other diuretics or blood purification therapies during the study was not permitted and patients taking diuretics before enrollment were maintained on the same dose and regimen throughout the study period or until study withdrawal.

Methods

Trial design and oversight

We conducted this prospective, individually-randomized, unblinded controlled clinical trial at 14 outpatient dialysis facilities in North Carolina, US. The trial protocol was approved by the relevant health authorities and the Institutional Review Board of Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina, USA; and was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry (NCT03740048). This was an academic investigator–initiated trial, funded by Relypsa, Vifor Pharma (IE19–00819/GTS47902). All the patients provided written informed consent and fulfilled all eligibility criteria before randomized treatment allocation. The study was carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Eligibility criteria

These are summarized in Table S 1. Excluded were patients with eGFR ≥ 5 mL/min/1.73 m² and urine output of < 500 mL/day at the time of HD initiation, and abrupt decline in kidney function as result of severe acute kidney injury (stage 3 AKI defined by Acute Kidney Injury Network [AKIN]) preceding HD initiation.

Randomization and treatments

Patient recruitment began on June 14, 2019, was paused between March 13, 2020 and May 31, 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, and resumed on June 01, 2020. The study enrolled adults patients with incident KDRD who had sufficient residual kidney function at dialysis initiation, characterized by presence of urine volume of ≥ 500 mL/day and estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 5 mL/min/1.73 m². A detailed study protocol along with full eligibility criteria has been published. Participant recruitment occurred at Wake Forest Outpatient Nephrology Clinics, Wake Forest Inpatient Nephrology Service, and Wake Forest Outpatient Dialysis facilities. Randomization was determined by a computer algorithm, in random blocks of 2 or 4 size and 1:1 allocation, stratified by type of vascular access used at HD initiation (catheter or arteriovenous access). Participants were assigned to one of the two HD regimens: (1) twice-weekly HD and clinically-indicated adjunctive pharmacological therapy (loop diuretic, potassium-binding agent (patiromer) and sodium bicarbonate) for six consecutive weeks, continued by thrice-weekly HD (incremental HD group); or (2) thrice-weekly HD (conventional HD group). Patients were recruited by a member of the study team (e.g. physician investigator, study coordinator) and the allocation sequence was generated automatically by a computerized system.

### Captopril [^114x3aeu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapy may be initiated as early as three days following a myocardial infarction. After a single dose of 6.25 mg, captopril therapy should be initiated at 12.5 mg three times a day. Captopril tablets, USP should then be increased to 25 mg three times a day during the next several days and to a target dose of 50 mg three times a day over the next several weeks as tolerated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Captopril may be used in patients treated with other post-myocardial infarction therapies, e.g., thrombolytics, aspirin, beta blockers.

Diabetic Nephropathy: The recommended dose of captopril tablets, USP for long term use to treat diabetic nephropathy is 25 mg three times a day.

Other antihypertensives such as diuretics, beta blockers, centrally acting agents or vasodilators may be used in conjunction with captopril if additional therapy is required to further lower blood pressure.

Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment: Because captopril is excreted primarily by the kidneys, excretion rates are reduced in patients with impaired renal function. These patients will take longer to reach steady-state captopril levels and will reach higher steady-state levels for a given daily dose than patients with normal renal function. Therefore, these patients may respond to smaller or less frequent doses.

Accordingly, for patients with significant renal impairment, initial daily dosage of captopril should be reduced, and smaller increments utilized for titration, which should be quite slow (one-week to two-week intervals). After the desired therapeutic effect has been achieved, the dose should be slowly back-titrated to determine the minimal effective dose. When concomitant diuretic therapy is required, a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide), rather than a thiazide diuretic, is preferred in patients with severe renal impairment. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis .)

1.2: Risk assessment

1.2.1 We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities, especially pre-existing proteinuria and CKD, and exposures to nephrotoxic medication or interventions. (1C)

1.2.2 We recommend monitoring patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of serum creatinine and urine output to detect AKI at an early stage. (Ungraded statement). Frequency and duration of monitoring should be planned based on patient risk and clinical course. (Ungraded statement).

1.2.3 We recommend developing and implementing pathways of care at the broader hospital level, in close collaboration with the other individual specialities, to achieve the above-mentioned targets. (Ungraded statement).

Rationale

Risk for AKI is increased by exposure to factors that cause AKI (e.g. nephrotoxic medication) or the presence of factors that increase susceptibility to AKI [e.g. dehydration, co-morbidities, and also pre-existing proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD)]. The interaction between susceptibility and the type and extent of exposure to insults determines the risk of AKI occurrence. Particularly in the hospital setting, the patient's susceptibility should be assessed on a regular basis and some factors modified or even avoided (e.g. administration of potentially nephrotoxic agents). ERBP wants to point out that in patients on dialysis, but with preserved diuresis, it can be of importance to follow-up this parameter after procedures with a risk of deterioration of residual renal function, as unnoticed loss of residual renal function is an important risk factor in this patient group.

As prevention is still the best 'treatment' of AKI, and as many cases of avoidable AKI do not occur in patients in the ICU or on the nephrology ward, but in general wards, ERBP stresses the importance of developing and implementing pathways of care to detect and monitor patients at risk of AKI outside nephrology units and ICUs. These pathways should be developed in collaboration with the different involved specialities, to address the specific needs and risks per particular patient group. Even if patients are only seen after having been exposed to a risk factor, they still should be assessed in order to identify those who are more likely to develop AKI, as well as those who will require closer monitoring and general supportive measures in order to avoid further injury.

### Early versus standard initiation of renal replacement therapy in furosemide stress test non-responsive acute kidney injury patients (the FST trial) [^1137ozEf]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Trial design and oversight

The FST trial was funded by the Kidney Foundation of Thailand. The study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, two-group randomized trial conducted in five intensive care units (ICU) in Thailand from March 2016 to July 2017. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02730117). The institutional ethics boards of all participating centers approved the protocol. The investigators informed patients or their surrogates about the trial both orally and with a written document. Informed consent was obtained from participating patients or their substitute decision-makers before the FST was performed. Co-investigators at each participating site were responsible for enrolling patients, ensuring adherence to the protocol, and completing the case record form. All analyses were performed by an independent statistician in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Patients

All adult patients (≥ 18 years old) admitted to the ICU were screened. Patients with AKI at any stage (defined by KDIGO criteria) were assessed for additional inclusion criteria (both of the following needed to be fulfilled): 1) clinical diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (e.g. the presence of granular or epithelial cast, fractional excretion of sodium ≥ 1%, fractional excretion of urea ≥ 50%, plasma NGAL ≥ 150 ng/mL); 2) in the opinion of the treating team, the patient was well resuscitated and euvolemic; and 3) in the opinion of the treating team, the patient had neither an emergent indication nor a contraindication to RRT (Additional file 1: Appendix 1). We excluded patients with any of the following criteria: 1) baseline serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL (male) or ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (female); 2) history of renal allograft; 3) known pregnancy; 4) allergy or known sensitivity to loop diuretics; 5) moribund patients with expected death within 24 h or whose survival to 28 days was unlikely due to an uncontrollable comorbidity (i.e. end-stage liver or heart disease, untreatable malignancy); 6) patients with advanced directives who issued the desire not to be resuscitated; 7) prior treatment with RRT within 30 days; 8) serum albumin < 2 g/dL; and 9) patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or circulatory assistance (Additional file 1: Appendix 1). We considered the patients to be provisionally eligible if all the inclusion criteria were met, and no exclusion criteria were present.

### Are diuretics underutilized in dialysis patients? [^116okQZL]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

While oral diuretics are commonly used in patients with chronic kidney disease for the management of volume and blood pressure, they are often discontinued upon initiation of dialysis. We suggest that diuretics are considerably underutilized in peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis patients despite numerous potential benefits and few side effects. Moreover, when diuretics are used, optimal doses are not always prescribed. In peritoneal dialysis, the use of diuretics can improve volume status and minimize the need for higher glucose-containing solutions. In patients on haemodialysis, diuretics can help lessen interdialytic weight gain, resulting in decreased ultrafiltration rates and fewer episodes of intradialytic hypotension. This paper will review the mechanism of action of diuretics in patients with renal insufficiency, quantify the risk of side effects and elaborate on the potential advantages of diuretic use in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients with residual kidney function.

### Twice-weekly hemodialysis with adjuvant pharmacotherapy and transition to thrice-weekly hemodialysis: a pilot study [^1171GrZb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD) is the most common treatment modality for kidney failure in the United States. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility and safety of incremental-start HD in patients beginning maintenance HD.

Study Design

Pilot study.

Setting & Participants

Adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 5 mL/min/1.73 m² and urine volume ≥ 500 mL/d beginning maintenance HD at 14 outpatient dialysis units.

Exposure

Randomized allocation (1:1 ratio) to twice-weekly HD and adjuvant pharmacologic therapy for 6 weeks followed by thrice-weekly HD (incremental HD group) or thrice-weekly HD (conventional HD group).

Outcome

The primary outcome was feasibility. Secondary outcomes included changes in urine volume and solute clearance.

Results

Of 77 patients invited to participate, 51 consented to do so, representing 66% of eligible patients. We randomized 23 patients to the incremental HD group and 25 patients to the conventional HD group. Protocol-based loop diuretics, sodium bicarbonate, and patiromer were prescribed to 100%, 39%, and 17% of patients on twice-weekly HD, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 281.9 days, participant adherence was 96% to the HD schedule (22 of 23 and 24 of 25 in the incremental and conventional groups, respectively) and 100% in both groups to serial timed urine collection. The incidence rate ratio for all-cause hospitalization was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.08–1.17); and 7 deaths were recorded (1 in the incremental and 6 in the conventional group). At week 24, the incremental HD group had lower declines in urine volume (a difference of 51.0 [95% CI, -0.7 to 102.8] percentage points) and in the averaged urea and creatinine clearances (a difference of 57.9 [95% CI, -22.6 to 138.4] percentage points).

Limitations

Small sample size, time-limited twice-weekly HD.

Conclusions

It is feasible to enroll patients beginning maintenance HD into a randomized study of incremental-start HD with adjuvant pharmacotherapy who adhere to the study protocol during follow-up. Larger multicenter clinical trials are indicated to determine the efficacy and safety of incremental HD with longer twice-weekly HD periods.

Loop diuretics in dialysis patients — Large doses of potent loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide) can be administered to promote loss of sodium and water, but therapy is effective only when RKF is high enough to provide daily urine output of at least 100 mL and its effectiveness may not last long. Loop diuretics should be used with caution because of the possibility of ototoxicity, with the incidence appearing greater with furosemide and much less with bumetanide or torsemide.

### Sacubitril-valsartan in patients requiring hemodialysis… [^11338r4R]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

We estimated both intention-to-treat and as-treated effects. In the AT analysis, individuals were additionally censored at end of medication dispense, defined as no refill within 30 days after end date of last dispense. Sacubitril-valsartan users were additionally censored for switching to an ACEI or ARB. Results of subgroup analysis for all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization in both ITT and AT analyses were generally consistent across age, sex, race, smoking status, dysrhythmia, atherosclerotic heart disease, diabetic kidney disease, history of diabetes, and diuretic use with some significant interaction effects. None, however, were consistent across both all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization. Similarly, we did not observe increased benefit in those with lower dialysis vintage.

Instead, we observed that patients with higher dialysis vintage tended toward more benefit, though they were younger and healthier compared with those with lower dialysis vintage. Given that Asian patients receiving hemodialysis have higher renal reserve 16, 33 and may benefit more from the diuretic effects of sacubitril, 34 we looked at a subgroup interaction by diuretic use, which was negative. in PARADIGM-HF). 13, 35 Additionally, one of these studies compared sacubitril-valsartan use vs no medication use, raising concern for bias. 12, 36 Importantly, we saw a beneficial association despite the high morbidity and mortality among patients receiving dialysis.

Alternatively, the reduction in all-cause mortality but not cardiovascular mortality with sacubitril-valsartan could be related to decreases in hyperkalemia, 39–42 which is common in patients receiving dialysis. Previous studies have suggested that patient factors have stronger associations with serum potassium levels and that potassium-specific interventions could improve clinical outcomes. 39 Considering that the interplay among potassium level, 43–46 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition, and clinical outcomes is complex, 47, 48 further investigation is warranted as it may contribute to our positive findings.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The signs and symptoms of overdosage can be anticipated to include those of excessive pharmacologic effect: dehydration, hypovolemia, hypotension, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hemoconcentration. Treatment of overdosage should consist of fluid and electrolyte replacement.

Laboratory determinations of serum levels of torsemide and its metabolites are not widely available.

No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of torsemide and its metabolites. Torsemide is not dialyzable, so hemodialysis will not accelerate elimination.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for diuretic renal scintigraphy in adults with suspected upper urinary tract obstruction 1.0 [^111LJcWe]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Diuretic renal scintigraphy — voided volume and urine flow rate assessment: Measuring the voided volume and urine flow rate is relatively easy and can alert the nuclear medicine physician to inadequate diuresis. A patient with normal renal function should produce about 200–300 mL of urine in 20–30 minutes after receiving 40 mg of furosemide. As renal function decreases, a urine flow rate of as high as 4 mL/min has been reported for patients with creatinine clearances reduced to 20% of normal, and this rate may be sufficient to exclude obstruction in a poorly functioning kidney, particularly if the renal pelvis is not excessively dilated. As renal function further deteriorates, an abnormal diuretic response cannot reliably distinguish obstruction from a poorly functioning kidney that failed to respond to furosemide. Conversely, if the kidney has a normal or near-normal clearance, it should have a good diuretic response, and collecting system retention after furosemide is much more suggestive of obstruction.

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^1128hQ4n]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

It is well known that the effect of albumin binding is to trap furosemide in the plasma so it can be delivered to the kidneys as opposed to being distributed throughout the body. In the situation of hypoalbuminemia, less furosemide-albumin complex can be delivered to the kidneys. Moreover, a decline in renal perfusion (CKD in our study) also decreased the rate of drug delivery to its site of action. In addition, a low serum albumin concentration enhanced furosemide metabolism and lead to decreased tubular secretion of active diuretics. Another mechanism of albumin is favouring an enhanced vascular refilling rate which is able to promote effective reabsorption of fluid accumulation from the interstitial space, thereby inducing transient retrieval of increased effective circulating volume. In this manner, an increased renal flow is propitiated and more efficient glomerular filtration function and urine output are achieved irrespective of possible favourable effects on the pharmacodynamics of furosemide. Taken together, our findings in this study are compatible with the hypothesis that the added-up albumin may enhance the rate of furosemide-albumin complex delivery to the kidneys, assist the active metabolite of furosemide to its site of action and increase renal blood flow leading to more efficient glomerular filtration function. The effect of increased intratubular albumin which is found in severe nephrotic syndrome patients and which might blunt the response of furosemide was not prominent in our study since all the patients in our studies had 24-hour urine protein less than 3.5 g/d.

### Effect of furosemide on left ventricular mass in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients: a randomized controlled trial [^114vrpoh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), loop diuretics correct volume-dependent hypertension, but their effect on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) is unknown.

Methods

Forty hypertensive CKD patients (estimated creatinine clearance 60–15 mL/min/1.73 m²), treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, were randomized to receive furosemide or non-diuretic antihypertensive treatment (control group). Office blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg was pursued in both groups. Primary end point was the reduction of LVMI after 52 weeks. Secondary aims were to verify safety related to furosemide treatment and its effects on ambulatory and clinic BP and body fluid volumes.

Results

Office BP similarly declined in the furosemide group (from 161 ± 14/80 ± 10 to 139 ± 14/74 ± 8 mmHg) and in controls (from 159 ± 16/81 ± 10 to 137 ± 16/75 ± 10 mmHg). We detected a greater reduction (P = 0.013) of LVMI in patients receiving furosemide (-7.9, IQR from -15.8 to -1.4 g/h(2.7)) than in controls (0.0, IQR from -6.2 to + 9.5 g/h(2.7), P = 0.013). Bio-impedance analysis-derived extracellular water (ECW) significantly decreased in furosemide-treated patients (from 18.7 ± 3.9 to 17.7 ± 3.3 L) while remained unchanged in the control group (from 19.5 ± 2.2 to 19.6 ± 1.9 L). Absolute change of LVMI correlated with changes of ECW in furosemide-treated patients (r = 0.458, P = 0.042) but not in controls. In the furosemide group, no patient experienced side effects requiring drug withdrawal.

Conclusions

In hypertensive CKD patients treated with RAS inhibitors, add-on furosemide efficaciously reduces LVMI independently from BP changes. The effect is possibly mediated by better control of volume expansion.

### A qualitative study on the perceived barriers to accessing haemodialysis for patients with kidney failure (KF) in Northern Ghana: perspectives of healthcare providers [^117HW216]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Accommodation

Diverse responses were drawn when participants were asked how health care providers manage kidney failure amidst all the challenges. The participants, specifically those from Bolgatanga Regional Hospital, revealed that patients who have the financial ability to afford haemodialysis are referred to Tamale. This stems from the glaring reality that the region lacks a dialysis facility, necessitating patients to travel to Tamale for haemodialysis. Conversely, patients who are unable to bear the financial burden of haemodialysis are managed through an alternative approach, primarily involving the use of furosemide (Lasix). While furosemide may not directly treat kidney failure, it is used with the expectation of providing some symptomatic relief and improvement. The focus is on managing fluid retention, a common manifestation of kidney failure, and alleviating associated symptoms. This alternative approach reflects the pragmatic decision-making of healthcare providers, who, in the face of resource constraints, aim to optimize patient care within the available means. Conversely, healthcare facilities with haemodialysis services (TTH and Wa Regional Hospital) reported limited available resources coupled with the rising demand for haemodialysis, placing undue strain on haemodialysis delivery. The current number of available dialysis stations falls significantly short of meeting the increasing demand from patients, resulting in long waiting times and compromised quality of care. Healthcare providers are therefore compelled to make decisions on available resources and the financial capacity of patients. As healthcare providers constantly strive to optimize care within the confines of a resource-constrained environment, they experience psychological trauma when caring for patients with kidney failure. These emotions stem from witnessing the suffering of patients under their care, especially young patients. The vulnerability of young patients and the repeated experience of being unable to provide necessary care intensify the emotional burden on healthcare providers.

### Association between furosemide administration and outcomes in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^113DnWQo]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of furosemide was associated with reduced short-term mortality and improved recovery of renal function in critically ill patients with AKI. Furosemide was especially effective in patients with AKI oliguria stage 2–3 degree, but not in those with AKI SCr stage 2–3 and chronic kidney disease. Our results may be helpful for the rational use of furosemide in critically ill patients with AKI. The results need to be verified in the future by multicenter randomized controlled trials.

### Measuring residual renal function in dialysis patients: can we dispense with 24-hour urine collections? [^114mRLub]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Residual renal function is associated with improved survival and quality of life for dialysis patients. Whereas residual renal function is monitored in peritoneal dialysis patients, many hemodialysis centers simply concentrate on achieving dialyzer urea clearance targets. Accurately quantifying residual renal function from urine collections is arduous. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop alternative methods of assessing residual renal function based on serum testing, especially for patients receiving less than thrice weekly dialysis.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^112TMH4G]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

AKI-D volume management and ultrafiltration — volume and BP assessments need to be conducted at every hemodialysis treatment to set fluid removal goals, and volume management may require a degree of permissive hypervolemia to minimize hypovolemia-induced hypotension; in patients with AKI-D, a more conservative ultrafiltration approach has been associated with lower intradialytic hypotension and we suggest that prescribed ultrafiltration should be < 10 ml/kg per hour. In nonoliguric patients, loop diuretics can help control fluid accumulation and reduce ultrafiltration needs, and we suggest a trial of furosemide 160 mg twice a day (or equivalent dose of torsemide or bumetanide) in all patients with AKI except those with already significant urine output and minimal interdialytic weight gain (< 1 kg); in patients who remain oligoanuric, diuretics can be held until there is a reported or documented increase in urine output. Cool dialysate reduces intradialytic hypotension in ESRD and has been found beneficial in the AKI-D setting and is therefore a reasonable tool for patients at higher risk of intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

### Optimal dialysate sodium-what is the evidence? [^114meeRg]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Oligo-anuric patients with end-stage kidney disease are dependent on hemodialysis to achieve and maintain the desired goal of euvolemia. The dialysis prescription, in addition to sodium and fluid restriction, is therefore a critically important factor in the care of hemodialysis patients. Various dialysate sodium concentrations have been favored throughout the history of dialysis, but the "optimal" concentration remains unclear. In this manuscript, we examine the historical context of changes to the dialysate sodium prescription, review the evidence of its associated effects, discuss 'individualization' of dialysate sodium, and highlight the need for definitive trials that are powered for important clinical outcomes.

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^114eFf65]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we focused to compare the efficacy of diuretics between furosemide alone and the combination of furosemide plus albumin in stable hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease patients with clinical edema and without nephrotic range proteinuria. The results of our study show the short-term beneficial effect (at 6 hours) of the combination of furosemide plus albumin over furosemide alone in natriuresis and diuresis in these patients. This may imply that, in the situation of diuretic resistance, CKD patients with low serum albumin and fluid overload may receive more benefits from this combination regimen.

At 24 hours after treatment, the results of the study did not show the beneficial effect of the combination treatment over furosemide alone. These data are similar to the results studied by Fliser et al. They found that the superior effect of one single dose of the combination of furosemide plus albumin over furosemide alone is found in only the first 8 hours after treatment. This has also been noted in other studies. This could possibly be due to the short duration of action of furosemide. Furosemide is a short half-life diuretic (1–2 hours). A significant natriuresis and free water clearance is noted during the 6-hour period that the diuretic is acting. However, sodium excretion gradually falls down during the remaining 18 hours of the day, because the associated volume depletion leads to the activation of the sodium-retaining mechanism. Our findings suggest that combination treatment increases the natriuretic potency of furosemide at least at submaximal doses, but does not directly address the issue of whether the same is still true at maximal does of furosemide. Thus, one single dose of the combination of furosemide plus albumin might not be adequate to show the beneficial effect over furosemide alone at 24 hours. Multiple administrations or an increased dose of diuretic may be required to maximize its potency.

### Efficacy of loop diuretics in the management of undocumented patients with end-stage renal disease [^114HBzWH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

An estimated 6000 patients who are undocumented immigrants have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and routinely present to public safety-net hospitals for life-saving emergent dialysis treatments. Because these patients lack a dialysis unit, they often do not have access to medication management consistently coordinated by a nephrologist, and this can result in more frequent emergency department (ED) utilization and cost of care. We hypothesized that patients who were taking loop diuretics had fewer ED visits for emergency dialysis. Loop diuretics can potentially take advantage of residual renal function and mitigate excess fluid gain that can induce heart failure and high potassium, the two most common indications for emergency dialysis. In our univariable analysis, patients on furosemide had 3.1 fewer ED visits on average compared with patients who are not on furosemide. After adjusting for vintage and serum potassium measures, the average number of ED visits was about 1.1 visits less in furosemide-treated patients compared with patients not receiving furosemide (95% confidence interval, -4.4 to 2.1). These results suggest that loop diuretics may have an important role in undocumented patients with ESRD with residual renal function. Further study to develop practical approaches to the care of undocumented patients with ESRD is greatly needed.

### The use of furosemide in patients on dialysis… [^11271UZj]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with significant renal sodium reabsorption would be the ones who would be expected to respond to furosemide. Thus patients whose urine is less than 80 mM are reabsorbing significant amounts of filtered Na and thus might be expected to respond to furosemide. After 2 weeks, to establish whether there is any diurnal variation in the urine they will collect their urine in separate containers, appropriately labeled with the date and time, during the 24 hr period ending pre dialysis after the long interdialytic interval. These collections will also determine whether there is any diurnal variation in, the individual urine, as well as indicate the 24 hour urine volume and Na excretion off the furosemide.

All urine samples will be assayed for the concentration of Na, K, and creatinine, as well as their volume. Thereafter, each patient will be given furosemide 120 mgm every morning for 2 weeks and they will collect the urine voided with each voiding in separate containers during the 24 hr period ending pre dialysis after the long interdialytic interval after 2 weeks. These collections will answer whether there is any diurnal variation in while on furosemide, as well as determine the 24 hour urine volume and Na excretion on the furosemide. The results will determine whether those patients taking furosemide are indeed benefitting from it and will help one to predict whether patients not taking furosemide, might indeed benefit from taking it.

At the conclusion of the 2-week period of furosemide therapy, the patient's primary nephrologist will determine the need for continuing this agent and if a decision is made to continue furosemide, the dose would be at the discretion of the nephrologist. The primary outcome is the increase in urine volume and 24 hour sodium excretion in response to the furosemide therapy Drug: Withdrawal of furosemide Drug: furosemide administration
