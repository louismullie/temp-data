## Question

Leukocyte estrase large

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "leukocyte esterase large" means on a urinalysis and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what leukocyte esterase actually detects and how dipsticks report it. Then, I should verify how "large" maps to semiquantitative grading. Next, I will consider the clinical significance, including sensitivity and specificity across populations. After that, I need to check common causes of false positives and false negatives. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, population-specific interpretation and outline next steps, including when to culture and when to treat empirically.

> Let me first confirm the basics: leukocyte esterase is an enzyme produced by neutrophils. A positive dipstick reaction indicates pyuria, i.e., white blood cells in the urine, which usually reflects an inflammatory response, most commonly from a urinary tract infection, but also from other causes such as sterile inflammation or contamination [^113jyM3S] [^115fzLcz].

> Wait, let me verify the grading system. Dipsticks typically report leukocyte esterase on a semiquantitative scale from trace to 4+ (or 1+ to 4+), where "large" corresponds to a strong positive reaction, generally 3+ to 4+, indicating a high concentration of leukocyte esterase and, by inference, substantial pyuria. This is a relative, not absolute, quantification and should be interpreted in clinical context [^115jggxv] [^113jyM3S].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what "large" means diagnostically. I need to check test performance across settings. In children, leukocyte esterase has moderate sensitivity and specificity, and combining leukocyte esterase with nitrite improves sensitivity. However, even a positive combination does not replace the need for culture when suspicion is high, and a negative dipstick does not fully exclude UTI, especially in infants and with non–E. coli pathogens [^114Ffzkq] [^113uY6g7] [^1176gH8H]. In older adults, high pyuria prevalence and asymptomatic bacteriuria blunt the positive predictive value of leukocyte esterase, so a "large" result is not diagnostic of symptomatic UTI by itself and must be paired with compatible symptoms [^115GYSnF] [^111KXDxU]. In emergency department cohorts, dipstick positivity modestly increases the likelihood of UTI but remains insufficient to rule in disease without symptoms, reinforcing that "large" is not equal to "definite UTI" [^116MoKZi].

> I should double-check the causes of false positives and false negatives. False positives can occur with contamination from vaginal or foreskin secretions, with sterile pyuria from nonurinary infections or inflammatory conditions, and with certain detergents or chemicals. Trichomonas and other parasites can also cause pyuria without bacteriuria, so a "large" leukocyte esterase does not automatically imply bacterial infection [^113jyM3S] [^115fzLcz]. False negatives happen with dilute urine, very early infection, or pathogens that induce minimal pyuria, such as Enterococcus or some Klebsiella, and in infants who void frequently, which limits nitrite formation and can reduce leukocyte esterase sensitivity [^1176gH8H] [^1119PSn9].

> Let me consider the clinical implications by population. In symptomatic, nonpregnant adults with acute urinary symptoms, a "large" leukocyte esterase increases the likelihood of UTI and, when combined with nitrite positivity, can support empiric treatment while awaiting culture, though culture remains the reference standard for definitive diagnosis and stewardship [^1173wmU7] [^112KNEot]. In children, a "large" leukocyte esterase supports a preliminary diagnosis of UTI in the right clinical context, but culture is still recommended when antibiotics are started, and a negative dipstick cannot safely exclude UTI in high-risk infants [^116m7CLs] [^117DtL44]. In older adults, especially women, a "large" leukocyte esterase is common even in asymptomatic bacteriuria, so I should avoid overcalling UTI and instead correlate with acute urinary symptoms before treating [^115GYSnF] [^111KXDxU].

> Next, I should review what to do when "large" appears. First, I need to ensure the specimen is clean-catch or catheterized and fresh, because bagged or stale specimens increase contamination and degrade accuracy. If the sample is suboptimal, I should repeat it before interpreting results [^113jyM3S] [^114T7zrd]. Second, I should integrate symptoms and risk factors: in patients with dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or fever, a "large" leukocyte esterase meaningfully raises post-test probability and supports empiric therapy while awaiting culture. In patients without urinary symptoms, I should be cautious and consider alternative sources of pyuria or contamination before treating [^1173wmU7] [^114AHHdU]. Third, I should confirm with urine culture when the stakes are high, such as in children, pregnant patients, immunocompromised hosts, or when symptoms persist despite negative testing, because no rapid test replaces culture in these scenarios [^112KNEot] [^117DtL44].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on antibiotics or has very dilute urine? I need to check for timing and urine concentration effects. Recent antibiotic exposure can blunt bacteriuria and pyuria, leading to falsely low or negative leukocyte esterase, whereas concentrated urine can artifactually intensify dipstick reactions. In both cases, I should interpret "large" cautiously and, if clinical suspicion remains high, repeat testing or obtain a catheterized specimen for culture [^111zuXw3].

> In summary, "leukocyte esterase large" on a urinalysis indicates a strongly positive reaction for pyuria, reflecting a high concentration of neutrophil-derived enzyme in the urine. It is not specific for bacterial infection and must be interpreted in clinical context, with attention to symptoms, specimen quality, and patient population. In symptomatic patients, it increases the likelihood of UTI and can support empiric treatment, but in asymptomatic or high-prevalence populations, it may reflect sterile inflammation or asymptomatic bacteriuria, so I should confirm with culture before treating whenever feasible [^113jyM3S] [^114AHHdU] [^112KNEot].

A "large" leukocyte esterase on urinalysis indicates **high pyuria** (≥ 3+ or 4+) and strongly suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI) when aligned with symptoms, but it is **not specific** and can be positive in other inflammatory or contaminant states. Confirm with **urine culture** when clinically indicated, especially in children, older adults, or complex cases, and interpret results in the clinical context to avoid overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriria or contamination [^114AHHdU] [^112KNEot].

---

## Clinical significance of leukocyte esterase

Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme produced by neutrophils; its presence in urine indicates **pyuria** (WBCs in urine), which is a hallmark of inflammation or infection of the urinary tract [^113jyM3S]. A "large" result corresponds to a high concentration of WBCs, typically graded as 3+ or 4+ on dipsticks, and suggests a significant inflammatory response [^115GYSnF].

---

## Diagnostic implications

A "large" leukocyte esterase result is **highly suggestive of UTI**, particularly when accompanied by symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, or fever. However, it is not specific to bacterial infection and can be positive in other inflammatory conditions or due to contamination [^113jyM3S].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Confirmatory testing**: A positive leukocyte esterase test should be confirmed with a urine culture, especially in children, older adults, or patients with recurrent or complicated infections [^116m7CLs] [^112KNEot].

- **Clinical correlation**: Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical symptoms and patient history to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^114AHHdU].

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: In older adults, a positive leukocyte esterase test alone is insufficient to diagnose UTI due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Treatment should be reserved for symptomatic patients [^114AHHdU] [^111KXDxU].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can influence leukocyte esterase results:

- **Contamination**: Vaginal or foreskin contamination can cause false-positive results [^113jyM3S].

- **Non-bacterial inflammation**: Conditions such as interstitial cystitis, glomerulonephritis, or recent catheterization can cause pyuria without bacterial infection [^113jyM3S].

- **Dilute urine**: Highly dilute urine can lead to false-negative results due to low concentration of leukocytes [^111zuXw3].

- **Storage conditions**: Improper storage or delayed analysis can degrade leukocytes, leading to inaccurate results [^117XeZs7].

---

## Clinical actions and follow-up

When a "large" leukocyte esterase result is observed, the following steps are recommended:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Obtain a urine culture to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy [^116m7CLs].

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate the patient for symptoms of UTI, including dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or fever [^114AHHdU].

- **Repeat testing**: If contamination is suspected, repeat the urinalysis with a clean-catch or catheterized specimen [^113jyM3S].

- **Empiric treatment**: In symptomatic patients, initiate empiric antibiotic therapy based on local resistance patterns while awaiting culture results [^114AHHdU].

---

## Interpretation in specific patient populations

| **Patient population** | **Interpretation and recommendations** |
|-|-|
| Children | - High sensitivity but lower specificity <br/> - Confirm with culture <br/> - Avoid overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^114Ffzkq] [^116m7CLs] |
| Elderly | - High prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria <br/> - Treat only if symptomatic <br/> - Avoid routine screening [^114AHHdU] [^111KXDxU] |
| Pregnant women | - Screen and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent complications [^113jyM3S] |
| Immunocompromised patients | - Lower threshold for confirmatory testing and treatment due to increased risk of complications [^notfound] |

---

A "large" leukocyte esterase result indicates **significant pyuria** and strongly suggests a UTI, but it is not definitive. Confirm with **culture** and interpret in the clinical context to guide appropriate management and avoid overtreatment.

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^117R7Uff]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of the dipstick accuracy stimulates an ongoing debate. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to summarise the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various pre-defined potential sources of heterogeneity.

Methods

Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and by reference tracking. Selected publications should be concerned with the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigate the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and present empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

Results

70 publications were included. Accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were ≥ 80% in elderly and in family medicine. Accuracy of leukocyte-esterase was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 276). Sensitivities were highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high in both tests in all patient groups and settings, except for in family medicine. The combination of both test results showed an important increase in sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 52), in children (DOR = 46), and if clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies carried out in family medicine (90%). Predictive values of combinations of positive test results were low in all other situations.

Conclusions

Overall, this review demonstrates that the urine dipstick test alone seems to be useful in all populations to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte-esterase are negative. Sensitivities of the combination of both tests vary between 68 and 88% in different patient groups, but positive test results have to be confirmed. Although the combination of positive test results is very sensitive in family practice, the usefulness of the dipstick test alone to rule in infection remains doubtful, even with high pre-test probabilities.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^1161SvQk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 108 colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis. The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies, showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### How to use… urine dipsticks [^1173MQgQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

'Urine dipstick', the commonly used point-of-care test, is an extremely sensitive investigation. Results of this test affected by numerous factors, if not meticulously linked with detailed history and examination, can lead a well-meaning clinician down the wrong clinical pathway. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of this every day test, touching on the physiological and technological basis initially, but mainly focusing on common questions like when to request the dipstick test, the correlation of dipstick results with urine specimen collected by different method and complexities of interpretation of dipstick results in everyday clinical scenarios.

### Neutrophil extracellular traps protect the kidney from ascending infection and are required for a positive leukocyte dipstick test [^112Gz3G2]. Science Translational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is common but only rarely complicated by pyelonephritis. However, the mechanisms preventing extension to the kidney are unclear. Here, we identified neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in healthy human urine that provide an antibacterial defense strategy within the urinary tract. In both in vivo murine models of UTI where uropathogenic E. coli are inoculated into the bladder and ex vivo human urine models, NETs interacted with uromodulin to form large webs that entrapped the bacteria. Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) inhibition in mice blocked NETosis and resulted in progression of cystitis into pyelonephritis, suggesting that NETosis of urinary neutrophils acts to prevent bacterial ascent into the kidney. Analysis of UK Biobank data revealed that genetic variants in PADI4 that associated with increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis in multiple genome-wide association studies were consistently associated with reduced susceptibility to UTI. Last, we showed that urine dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase was negative in the presence of intact blood neutrophils but became positive when neutrophils were stimulated to NET, and this could be prevented by selective PADI4 inhibition, demonstrating that this test does not detect absolute neutrophil count, as has long been assumed, but specifically detects neutrophils that have undergone NETosis. These findings highlight the role of NETosis in preventing ascending infections in the urinary tract and improve our understanding of one of the most common clinical tests in medicine.

### Accuracy of leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests for diagnosing bacteriuria in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jggxv]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine dipsticks are commonly used for the diagnosis of bacteriuria and/or urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Objectives

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of positive leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite results from dipsticks (index test) for diagnosing bacteriuria in older individuals, using urine culture as the reference standard.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (Pubmed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from the inception date up to April 2025. We also searched the reference lists of all the studies identified.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Both prospective observational cohort and case-control diagnostic studies were included. No language restriction was applied.

Participants

Individuals aged 60 or more with or without symptoms of UTI in the community, nursing homes or hospitalised.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for assessing risk of bias.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of leukocyte esterase and/or nitrites for the detection of bacteriuria. PROSPERO identifier: CRD42024561882.

Results

Of 1,933 articles screened, 16 met inclusion criteria and had moderate risk of bias. Ten studies were hospital-based; six were in nursing homes. Pooled urine dipstick sensitivity and specificity for bacteriuria were 90% (95% CI, 84–94%), and 56% (43–68%), respectively (diagnostic odds ratio [DOR] 11.4; 10.4–12.7). In symptomatic older adults, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting UTI were 92% (76–97%) and 39% (19–62%), respectively, with a DOR of 7.3 (5.2–10.3).

Discussion

A positive dipstick result is inconclusive and does not confirm bacteriuria or UTI in symptomatic older adults. Due to high asymptomatic bacteriuria prevalence in older individuals, bacteriuria alone lacks diagnostic value. These findings support discontinuing dipstick testing for UTI diagnosis in this population.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^115WNT2u]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1116DtDy]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urine dipstick tests (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) — Dipstick assays detect leukocyte esterase (LE) and urinary nitrite, and bacterial conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites requires approximately 4 hours in the bladder; because infants void frequently, a nitrite test is not sensitive and negative results have little value in ruling out urinary tract infection (UTI), although a positive nitrite is highly specific. In clinically suspected UTI, LE sensitivity is 94%, with overall reported sensitivity 83% and specificity average 72% (range: 64%–92%); positive LE results should be interpreted with caution because false-positive results are common and pyuria is nonspecific.

### The abnormal urinalysis [^1126CRh8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics, and whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^111qMvi2]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm³ on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^1173eXVD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study of adult women presenting to 1 of 2 community hospital EDs or an intermediate care center with dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency on history, or suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness on examination. Patients who had taken antibiotics in the past 72 hours, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or were unable to provide a reliable history were excluded. The patient's clean-catch or catheterized urine specimen was tested immediately by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. A second aliquot was sent within 1 hour of collection to the hospital laboratory, where a semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and a urine culture were performed. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of 1 or 2 uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated at various definitions of a positive test, or "test cutoff points", for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick and for RBCs and WBCs on urinalyses. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment on the basis of a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment", or 1 minus the negative predictive value. "Overtreatment" was defined as 1 minus the positive predictive value.

Results

Three hundred forty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Twelve patients were withdrawn because of missing laboratory results. Forty-six percent (152/331) of patients had positive urine cultures. If urine dipstick results are defined as positive when leukocyte esterase or nitrite is positive or blood is more than trace, the overtreatment rate is 47% (156/331) and the undertreatment rate is 13% (43/331). If urinalysis results are defined as positive when WBCs are more than 3 per high-power field or RBCs are more than 5 per high-power field, the overtreatment rate is 44% (146/331) and the undertreatment rate is 11% (36/331). Matched pairs of test characteristics were identified when the analysis was repeated using more than 10,000 colonies per mL as a positive culture.

Conclusion

In this patient population, similar overtreatment and undertreatment rates were identified for various test cutoff points for urine dipstick tests and urinalysis. Although a urine dipstick may be equivalent to a urinalysis for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection, the limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of both tests should be incorporated into medical decisionmaking.

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^1132d69D]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis is essentially a clinical diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase and nitrites in this cohort are in agreement with a meta-analysis that found sensitivity and specificity of nitrites were around 50% and 95%, whereas leukocyte esterase was highly variable, with a sensitivity of 50–60% and a lower specificity than nitrites. It has been suggested that nitrites alone indicate the need for further urine testing and could be used to initiate treatment, which would overtreat a large percentage of patients in this setting. Urine sediment microscopy proved more sensitive than urine dipsticks for diagnosis of pyelonephritis. A WBC count of ≥ 7/HPF in the presence of bacteria and with epithelial cell count < 5/HPF predicted a positive urine culture with the highest sensitivity, but this was not as specific as WBC count of ≥ 10/HPF or the presence of leukocytes and nitrites on urine dipstick. In areas where microscopy is practiced routinely to diagnose malaria and microbiological facilities are not available, the urine sediment is likely to provide a cheap alternative for urine examination. Cut-offs are best confirmed with microbiological support, but this could be done as a survey. Known limitations of the dipstick nitrite test in diagnosing bacteriuria include infection with non–nitrite-producing pathogens and insufficient time since the last void for nitrites to appear at detectable levels (ideally, at least 4 hours); in this setting, another limitation is possibly a lack of dietary nitrate.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^113vD2ya]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24 and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing recurrent infections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centres and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalisations in the USA. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy) and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10³ cfu mL⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism too. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence. It is now recognised that routine urinalyses, including dipstick and culture, are insensitive, thus missing genuine infection in many symptomatic patients.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116Lq8ka]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^113jyM3S]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### Evaluation of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity tests for the diagnosis of acute symptomatic urinary tract infection in men [^116C12Hu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

For 422 male patients with symptoms indicative of a urinary tract infection, nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity dipstick test results were compared with results of culture of urine samples. The positive predictive value of a positive nitrite test result was 96%. Addition of results of the leukocyte esterase test did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the nitrite test.

Point-of-care dipstick and automated urinalysis performance in febrile catheterized children — In a Class III prospective study of febrile (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [100.4°F]) infants and children younger than 48 months, urine cultures were positive if bacterial growth was greater than or equal to 50,000/mL and 12% (42/346) had urinary bacterial growth; a point-of-care dipstick with greater than or equal to 1+ leukocyte esterase or positive nitrite had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 98%, automated leukocyte counts greater than or equal to 100/μL had sensitivity 86% and specificity 98%, and automated bacterial counts greater than or equal to 250/μL had sensitivity 98% and specificity 98%.

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^115GYSnF]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The urine, a final product of nephron function which consists of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes, provides valuable information about numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Urine dipstick tests are routinely used as a diagnostic tool in medical practice, facilitating early detection of diseases, such as urinary tract infections (UTI), and renal and metabolic disorders. Urine dipstick measurements are semiquantitative traits; positive urine dipstick results are expressed as intervals (e.g. pH and specific gravity) or graded according to severity on a scale from 1 to 4 plus (written as + to ++++; e.g. proteinuria and hematuria), and require medical interpretation. Apart from various diseases, environmental factors, such as exercise and food supplements, are known to affect urine dipstick results. However, it is an open question as to how genetic variation influences urine dipstick test results, both in a disease dependent and independent context.

Here we describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of urine dipstick measurements, testing for associations of variants in the sequence of the genome with glucosuria, ketonuria, proteinuria, hematuria, urine pH, signs of UTI (i.e. nitrites and leukocyte esterase) and urine specific gravity in a set of 150 274 Icelanders. In addition, we assess the variants detected for association with a broad set of diseases and other biological traits. By doing so, we attempt to shed light on whether the variants that affect urine dipstick test results are associated with specific diseases, or if they simply affect urinary traits separate from everything else.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to first void urine, IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a leukocyte esterase dipstick on the remains of the first void urine specimen to detect urethritis in symptomatic male patients with a negative urethral smear.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Evaluation of dipstick analysis among elderly residents to detect bacteriuria: a cross-sectional study in 32 nursing homes [^1122wkgL]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

It is beyond the scope of this study to conclude which clinical conditions should be investigated for bacteriuria. However, if there is a reason for investigating this, the present study may provide some simple guidelines.

When testing is performed in nursing homes for elderly by non-laboratory personnel this study showed that there were no clinically relevant differences between visual and analyzer reading of dipsticks. Thus, the choice between visual and analyzer reading could be based on personal preferences and economic aspects.

A single nitrite dipstick performs as well or better than a single leukocyte esterase dipstick. However, different combinations of the dipsticks improve the diagnostic value.

When dipstick urinalyses for nitrite and leukocyte esterase are simultaneously negative it is unlikely that the urine culture will show growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Thus, in a patient with an uncomplicated illness, no further testing is needed. However, a positive dipstick or any combination thereof cannot completely rule in bacteriuria.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infant, more specifically with respect to urine tests, ACEP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using a positive test result of urine leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, or Gram's stain to make a preliminary diagnosis of UTI in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^1145uCfe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

In asymptomatic controls, median urine leukocyte values were higher than the most commonly used cutoff value of 10 leukocytes/µL. Therefore, applying the current pyuria threshold to older women leads to misclassification of many of these women, both with and without ASB. This has several consequences. First, the true cause of the symptoms (eg, vaginal atrophy, Candida vulvovaginitis, and overactive bladder) remains unidentified and thus untreated if symptoms are wrongfully attributed to UTI. Second, it leads to overprescription of antimicrobials, contributing to gut dysbiosis, side effects, and selection of resistant pathogens. Gupta et al show that 25% of asymptomatic patients with pyuria on routine preoperative urinalysis (without urine cultures) were treated with antimicrobials, and that the degree of pyuria predicted prescribing of antimicrobials. These findings, combined with our own data, imply that separate, higher reference values are needed for older women with regard to pyuria. For instance, a threshold of 300 leukocytes/µL would be a considerable improvement, increasing specificity to avoid overtreatment while still maintaining a fair sensitivity. As in any diagnostic test, pyuria levels should be interpreted within the clinical context of individual patients and should not be the only deciding factor when diagnosing UTI. Since both older women with UTI and asymptomatic older women have a high pre-test probability of pyuria, and leukocyte esterase activity is a very rough estimate of the absolute number of leukocytes in the urine, the role of urine dipsticks in older patients should, at best, be limited to ruling out UTI. In addition to clinical implications, there are also implications for research, as misclassification influences the validity of UTI studies.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of our study include the use of a stringent UTI definition instead of urine culture as a reference standard, the consistency of results across 2 quantification methods (identical AUCs), inclusion of participants from multiple settings, and the rapid analysis of urine samples, increasing the reliability of results. Our study also has several limitations. Results may not be generalizable to institutionalized older people with high frailty and/or advanced dementia. However, our population was chosen to prove a concept for which a clear definition and reliable assessment of UTI and ASB were deemed necessary. Moreover, our control group contained a higher proportion of LTCF residents than our UTI group. Nonetheless, ADL dependency scores were similar between the UTI and control groups, and median leukocyte values within the LTCF subgroup were comparable to the values of the overall group.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^116fQ3mA]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Well-appearing 8- to 21-day-old febrile infants — urinalysis and culture (KAS 1): For febrile (temperature ≥ 38.0°C), well-appearing, term infants 8 to 21 days of age, clinicians should obtain a urine specimen by catheterization or SPA of the bladder for urinalysis and, if urinalysis result is positive, for culture (Evidence Quality: A; Strong Recommendation). A positive urinalysis result is defined as the presence of any leukocyte esterase (LE) on dipstick, > 5 WBCs per high-powered field (hpf) in centrifuged urine, or > 10 WBCs/ mm³ in uncentrifuged urine on microscopic urinalysis using a hemocytometer. Of the estimated 10% of febrile infants with UTIs, 94% have urinalysis positive for leukocyte esterase (LE) (95% CI, 91%–97%).

Dipstick tests

A total of 39 studies reporting 107 data sets evaluated dipstick tests for the diagnosis of UTI. These studies assessed the utility of dipstick tests for nitrite, leukocyte esterase (LE), protein, glucose and blood, alone and in combination. Table 2 summarises the results of these studies.

Table 2
Summary of results for studies of dipstick tests

* There was significant heterogeneity in all pooled estimates therefore these should be interpreted with caution

Figure 3 shows the estimates of sensitivity and 1-specificity plotted in ROC space for glucose, and dipstick tests for nitrite and LE, alone and in combination. This graph suggests that glucose is considerably better than the other tests, both for ruling in and ruling out disease, this is supported by the pooled likelihood ratios. However, the confidence intervals around the pooled likelihood ratios are very large, especially for the negative likelihood ratios (ruling out disease), suggesting considerable uncertainty in these estimates. It should also be noted that very few studies of glucose tests were available and that they were all conducted over 30 years ago and the test used ("Uriglox") is no longer commercially available.

### Can urine dipstick testing for urinary tract infection at point of care reduce laboratory workload? [^112XhLot]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust microbiology laboratory receives 150 000 urine samples each year, approximately 80% of which prove to be culture negative. The aim of this study was to reduce the proportion of culture negative urines arriving in the laboratory, by producing local evidence based guidelines for the use of urine dipstick testing at point of care within the trust's three acute hospitals.

Methods

One thousand and seventy six unborated urine samples were dipstick tested at the point of care using an automatic strip reader. Quantitative results for the four infection associated markers-leucocyte esterase, nitrite, blood, and protein-were compared with the results of conventional laboratory microscopy and culture.

Results

The performance of different marker combinations was calculated against the routine laboratory methods. One hundred and seventy five (16.3%) samples were negative for all four markers. Of these dipstick negative samples, only three (1.7% of all true positives) were positive by culture. The absence of all four infection associated markers was found to have a greater than 98% negative predictive value and a sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 19.2%, respectively.

Conclusions

A urinary dipstick testing algorithm for infection associated markers was derived for use in hospital patients to screen out negative urines. Two years after distributing the algorithm and promoting access to reagent strips and strip readers, a reduction in the urine workload has been seen against an otherwise increasing laboratory specimen load.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^117ETkLJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A second commonly used instrument for diagnostic testing is the dipstick. A meta-analysis concluded that urine dipstick tests are only useful to exclude the presence of an infection provided the results for both nitrites and leukocyte-esterase are negative. A cross-sectional study confirmed this in a NH setting.

In an attempt to increase the precision of diagnostic algorithms several biomarkers are being tested. Increased levels of some inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins) are seen in UTIs but their diagnostic or prognostic utility has not been documented so far. Only few studies have explored these biomarkers in an elderly population like NH residents.

Inflammatory markers could play an important role in diagnosing serious infections in older persons in whom clinical signs are often presented atypically. CRP, an acute phase protein produced by the liver in response to any infection or inflammation, has been studied extensively but its role in predicting severe infections in older adults remains unclear. Point-of-care testing (POCT) allows CRP to be tested at the bedside. The added value of this method could be substantial in NHs. These facilities, mainly providing accommodation to frail older adults, often have a more restricted access to clinical laboratories and it sometimes takes a long time to obtain the final test result. The major advantage of POCT is that it provides results in only a few minutes, allowing physicians to make clinical decisions more quickly and efficiently. Older patients could benefit from such a timely bedside diagnosis as they tend to deteriorate more rapidly from infections. In addition, POCT CRP requires only a droplet of blood and may therefore be easier to use in older persons from whom it is not always easy to obtain traditional blood samples. Nonetheless, a restriction of CRP is that it can increase also as a result of other medical conditions or infectious diseases.

Febrile infants and young children in emergency departments — dipstick and urinalysis accuracy are reported from multiple Class III studies. In a retrospective review of 375 pediatric ED patients aged 0 to 10 years, urinary tract infection prevalence was 10.7%, urine dipstick sensitivity 92.5% (95% CI 84.3% to 100%) and specificity 39.4% (95% CI 34.2% to 44.6%). In the 0- to 2-year group (160 patients), prevalence was 15%, sensitivity 87.5% (95% CI 74.3% to 100%), and specificity 39.7% (95% CI 31.5% to 47.9%); in the 2- to 10-year group, prevalence was 7.0%, sensitivity 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), and specificity 39.2% (95% CI 32.4% to 46%). In another study of febrile patients younger than 2 years (mean age 9.3 months) at a United Kingdom pediatric ED, a test positive for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood was 97.12% specific (95% CI 94.17% to 98.96%) with a positive LR of 15.13 (95% CI 6.99 to 32.76), and a test negative for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, blood, and protein had a sensitivity of 97.44% (95% CI 91.12% to 99.29%) with a negative LR of 0.10 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39). A multicenter febrile infant study from Spain (N = 649; ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL sterile collection; < 90 days; ≥ 38°C) reported leukocyte esterase mean sensitivity 82.1%, mean specificity 92.4%, mean negative predictive value 97.8% for female patients (N = 176) and 94.1% for male patients (N = 473), and mean positive predictive value 58% for female patients and 79.4% for male patients. Another pediatric ED Class III study of febrile patients younger than 5 years (half the patients were ≤ 12 months) with a urinary tract infection prevalence of 17.6% found, for all patients, sensitivities and negative predictive values respectively: nitrite 20% and 85%, hemoglobin 44% and 88%, leukocyte esterase 48% and 90%, 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 48% and 90%, centrifuge Gram's stain 60% and 92%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%; for infants aged 12 months or younger versus older than 12 months, respective sensitivities were nitrite 7% and 23%, hemoglobin 33% and 53%, leukocyte esterase 42% and 53%; 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 42% and 53%, centrifuge Gram's stain 42% and 76%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^112humPF]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Performance of urine dipstick

We collected the results of a total of 417 urine dipsticks (91.4%) performed in the emergency department, including 66 for the UTI group (95.6%) and 351 for the control group (90.7%). Urine dipsticks were considered negative if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were negative (AUC = 0.7405 [0.706–0.775]) and positive otherwise (Table S5). Sensitivity of urine dipstick for UTI (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) was lower than the sensitivity of UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (98.48% [91.90–99.79]) (p < 0.01) but similar to the sensitivity of the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) (p < 0.99). However, specificity was higher for both the UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (67.81% [62.75–72.48]) and the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (70.66% [65.69–75.17]) compared to the specificity of the urine dipstick (57.83% [52.61–62.89]) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The LR- was < 0.1 for all test methods. Urine dipstick in patients with at least one major symptom had a sensitivity of 91.43% [77.62–97.04], a specificity of 73.08% [53.92–86.30], a LR- of 0.117 [0.059–0.234] and a LR + of 3.396 [2.55–4.42].

### Rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid using leukocyte esterase dipstick testing [^116h4W5A]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ascitic fluid infection is presumptively diagnosed when the fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) concentration equals or exceeds 250 cells/microl. The leukocyte esterase (LE) test has been shown to be a good predictor of the presence of PMNs and bacteria in urine and other body fluids. This study examines the value of the Multistix 10 SG LE Dipstick test for the rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid.

Methods

One hundred thirty-six ascitic fluid samples were evaluated by PMN count, culture, and LE Dipstick testing. LE dipstick values of "small" or greater were considered positive. For each sample, the LE test result was compared to the corresponding PMN count and culture result.

Results

Ten of the 11 LE-positive samples had PMN ≥ 250 cells/microl, while 10 of 12 samples with PMN ≥ 250 cells/microl were also LE-positive. Of the 125 LE-negative samples, 123 were also negative by PMN count. One hundred twenty-three of the 124 samples with PMN < 250 cells/microl had negative LE tests. There was a less concordant relationship between the LE test and culture results. The sensitivity and specificity of the LE test for detecting ascitic fluid PMN ≥ 250 cells/microl were 83% and 99%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 91% and a negative predictive value of 98%.

Conclusions

The Multistix leukocyte esterase test is useful for the prompt detection of an elevated ascitic fluid PMN count, and represents a convenient new method for the rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1174tKiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm³ on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^116MoKZi]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the added diagnostic value of dipsticks for urinary tract infections (UTI) in acutely hospitalised individuals.

Design

Prospective population-based cohort study.

Setting

North Denmark.

Participants

All adults (≥ 18 years) examined with dipsticks at emergency departments in North Denmark Region from September 20 through 23 October 2021.

Main outcome measures

UTI was defined as ≥ 1 symptom of new-onset frequency, dysuria or suprapubic tenderness combined with a positive urine culture. Positive dipsticks were defined as any reaction for leucocyte esterase and/or nitrite.

Results

Dipsticks were used in 1052/2495 (42%) of acutely hospitalised patients with a median age of 73 years (IQR 57–82) and 540 (51%) were female. Overall, 89/1052 (8%) fulfilled the UTI criteria and urine cultures were done in 607/1052 (58%) patients. Among patients examined with both dipstick and urine culture, sensitivity and specificity for UTI were 87% (95% CI 78% to 93%) and 45% (95% CI 41% to 50%). Positive and negative predictive values were 21% (95% CI 17% to 26%) and 95% (95% CI 92% to 98%), whereas positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.58 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.77) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.51). Pretest probabilities of UTI ranged from 29% to 60% in participants with specific UTI symptoms with corresponding post-test probabilities of 35–69% if dipsticks were positive and 12–27% if dipsticks were negative. Results remained comparable if final clinical diagnosis was used as outcome among all patients examined with dipsticks. Modified Poisson regression yielded an adjusted relative risk of 4.41 (95% CI 2.40 to 8.11) for empirical antibiotics for UTI in participants without specific UTI symptoms and a positive dipstick.

Conclusions

Dipsticks yielded limited clinical decision support compared with a symptom-driven approach in this study and were independently associated with excess antibiotics for UTI.

### The inadequacy of urinary dipstick and microscopy as surrogate markers of urinary tract infection in urological outpatients with lower urinary tract symptoms without acute frequency and dysuria [^111ipgfa]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diagnosing urinary infection in patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms without dysuria is a critical step. In this study we scrutinize the sensitivity and specificity of dipstick urinalysis and microscopic pyuria (10 or more white blood cells per microl) to identify infection in such patients.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective, blinded, observational cohort study of urological outpatients with painless lower urinary tract symptoms. Midstream and catheter urine samples were analyzed. A total of 508 midstream urine samples were used to compare leukocyte esterase, nitrite dipstick and urine microscopy with cultures seeking 10⁵ cfu/ml. Similarly 470 catheter urine samples were used to compare the same surrogates with 10⁵ cfu/ml and with an enhanced culture method seeking 10² cfu/ml. A comparison of leukocyte esterase against microscopic pyuria was made using the 508 midstream and 470 catheter specimens of urine. Midstream urine specimens were provided by 42 normal volunteers for comparison.

Results

For a midstream urine culture at 10⁵ cfu/ml leukocyte esterase was 56% sensitive, nitrite was 10% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 56% sensitive. Specificities were 66%, 99% and 72%, respectively. For a catheter specimen of urine culture at 10⁵ cfu/ml leukocyte esterase was 59% sensitive, nitrite was 20% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 66% sensitive. Specificities were 84%, 97% and 73%, respectively. The enhanced culture of catheter specimen of urine at 10² cfu/ml was positive in 29% of patients vs 15% at 10⁵ cfu/ml.

Conclusions

Despite official guidelines and widespread use these tests cannot be considered appropriate for diagnosing urinary tract infection in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, and should be abandoned in this context.

### Biomarkers for diagnosing serious bacterial infections in older outpatients: a systematic review [^1158WGdK]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing guidelines

SIGN guidelines for UTI in older adults advise against the use of the urine dipstick as a diagnostic test due to lack of high quality evidence. This advice is echoed by Public Health England guidance, because positive urine dipsticks are often be caused by asymptomatic bacteriuria. The results of our review contradict these recommendations, and suggest that a positive urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocytes is helpful in diagnosing UTI in symptomatic older adults. Further studies in this area are required to corroborate or refute these findings.

Among 101 nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), we determined the negative predictive value of dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase and nitrite to be 100% (95% confidence interval, 74%-100%), compared with laboratory evidence of UTI (greater than 10 white blood cells/mm(3) on urinalysis and greater than 100,000 colony forming units/mL on urine culture). Nursing home dipstick testing effectively excluded the possibility of UTI.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — synovial fluid testing and diagnostic ranges: Regardless of how joint fluid is obtained, an adequate volume of fluid should be submitted to the laboratory rather than a culture swab, and synovial fluid WBC count and Gram stain should be performed, with the WBC count an important but rough guide that should be interpreted in clinical context. In ABA, joint fluid WBC counts are usually greater than 50 000/μl and often exceed 100 000/μl with a neutrophil predominance, whereas transient nonbacterial synovitis commonly shows 5000 to 15 000/μl with mononuclear predominance, and in JIA it is typically < 50 000/μl. Lyme arthritis may mimic ABA, with over half of pediatric cases exceeding 50 000 WBC/μl; in one Lyme-endemic study, children with intermediate (25 000 to 75 000 cells/mm³) hip-joint WBC counts were most likely to have ABA, followed by Lyme arthritis and then transient nonbacterial synovitis. Two small recent studies suggest potential moderate utility of urine dipstick leukocyte esterase test results on synovial fluid as a rapid discriminator of infection, but further validation is required.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^115CCwfn]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common sources of infection in children under 5. In a small proportion of children UTI may lead to renal scarring. This outcome of infection is of concern as it is associated with significant future complications and ultimately with end stage renal disease. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is therefore important to reduce the risk of future scarring.

Clinical history and examination is the first step in any diagnosis and is the means of identifying children with suspected UTI. Elements of the clinical examination have also been evaluated as diagnostic tests for UTI but there is little data available on these. Urine tests are commonly used for the diagnosis of UTI.

The reference standard for the diagnosis of UTI in children is considered to be any bacterial growth on a culture of urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration. Culture has the disadvantage of taking at least 48 hours to give a result. More rapid methods of UTI diagnosis are therefore desirable. The most widely used rapid tests are dipsticks. Analytes commonly tested by dipsticks include leukocyte esterase, nitrite, blood and protein. Dipstick tests have the advantage of being quick and easy to perform and can be carried out in primary care giving an immediate result. Microscopic examination of urine samples for leukocytes or bacteria is considerably more time consuming and labour intensive than the dipstick method. However, unlike culture, it can be used to give results within the primary care setting. An uncontaminated sample is necessary to reach an accurate diagnosis. Obtaining this is a particular issue when investigating young children. Table 1 presents a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of these tests.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^111KXDxU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) incidence increases with age and is higher in women than in men. In older women, diagnosing UTI is complicated for several reasons. First, symptom communication may be affected by cognitive impairment. Second, pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as urinary incontinence and urgency, are common and distinguishing acute from chronic LUTS can be challenging. Finally, 20% of community-dwelling and 50% of institutionalized older women have asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), defined as the presence of 1 or more uropathogens with 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or higher in the absence of signs or symptoms attributable to UTI. As a result, inappropriate antimicrobial treatment is common, leading to unnecessary side effects, drug interactions, Clostridioides difficile infection, and the selection of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Distinguishing ASB from UTI is further complicated by the fact that over 90% of older women with ASB have concomitant pyuria. Consequently, the positive-predictive value of the presence of pyuria for UTI is low in older women. However, it is unclear whether the degree of pyuria differs between older women with UTI and ASB, partly because urine dipstick is the most ordered screening test, providing only semiquantitative results of leukocyte esterase activity. Pyuria can be quantified in different ways. Initially, Mabeck found that a leukocyte excretion rate of 400 000 per hour could distinguish UTI from asymptomatic women. This rate corresponds to a cutoff value of 10 leukocytes/mm³ in non-centrifuged urine. In clinical practice and research, pyuria is most often quantified by direct or automated microscopy of (non)centrifuged urine, usually after initial dipstick screening. Automated microscopy reduces variability in centrifugation and resuspension of urine and is more efficient than direct microscopy. In recent years, an increasing number of laboratories are adopting urine flowcytometry for quantification of pyuria. Although cutoff values for "significant" pyuria vary in the literature and depend on quantification methods, commonly accepted cutoffs include 10 leukocytes/µL and 5–10 leukocytes per high-power field (hpf). These cutoff values are largely derived from studies involving nonpregnant premenopausal women, in whom ASB is uncommon. The objective of this study was to determine sensitivity and specificity of automated microscopy and urine flowcytometry for diagnosing UTI in older women, with the ultimate goal to derive optimal cutoff values for pyuria for UTI in this population, taking ASB into account.

### Urinalysis findings and urinary kidney injury biomarker concentrations [^117GgmrA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this post-hoc analysis of a subcohort of a large, multicenter prospective cohort study of cardiac surgery patients without creatinine-based acute kidney injury, we did not find evidence of association between either pre- or postoperative biomarker levels and age or sex. However, there were significant differences in biomarker levels associated with urine dipstick findings, including proteinuria, hematuria, leukocyte esterase and nitrites.

All biomarkers were mildly correlated with hematuria, indicating that blood might interfere with biomarker levels or their measurement even in the absence of overt kidney injury evidenced by creatinine rise. Preexisting substances in the urine interfering with assays for novel analytes has been previously described.

We found evidence that proteinuria is associated with all four biomarkers both pre- and post-operatively. Dipstick proteinuria is a marker of preexisting kidney damage and is associated with both the incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury. In addition, there is evidence that proteinuria may represent subclinical or early acute tubular necrosis, which has not yet manifested as a rise in creatinine. Thus, the part of the correlation we observed between proteinuria and biomarker levels may be the association between proteinuria and subclinical kidney injury. When we adjusted for measures of discrimination of AKI for urine protein, all of the pre-op AUCs diminished and 2 of the 4 post-operative AUCs diminished. Since dipstick proteinuria is a readily available and inexpensive test, future studies should assess the impact of accounting for dipstick proteinuria in evaluating the predictive and diagnostic performance of novel biomarkers.

We also found evidence of an association between NGAL levels and leukocyte esterase/nitrites. Urinary NGAL has been previously shown to be elevated in patients with septic shock. This is especially important, since critically ill patients, in whom novel biomarkers could potentially be deployed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, have high rates of urinary tract infections or may have leukocyturia/urine nitrites secondary to urinary catheters. This may lead to false positive AKI diagnosis in patients with no kidney injury but leukocyturia/urinary nitrites. Although, currently the mainstay of AKI management is supportive, if future therapies for AKI develop, misdiagnosis may expose patients with no kidney injury to unnecessary risk of a novel therapy.

Our study has several limitations. Since our study population was predominantly white, we could not assess racial differences in biomarker levels. In addition, we did not have urine sediment or histology to discern acute tubular necrosis in absence of serum creatinine rise and for correlation with biomarker levels. Thus, there may have been underlying subclinical injury that resulted in the correlations between the dipstick findings and the biomarkers levels.

### Accuracy of screening tests for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in young children [^117Qwkiu]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of available tests for pyuria, including newer automated tests, and to examine the implications of requiring them for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Methods

We included children between 1 and 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTIs who presented to 1 of 3 pediatric centers. Using a positive urine culture result as the reference standard, we compared the sensitivity of 5 modalities for assessing pyuria at the cutoffs most often used clinically for detecting children with a positive culture result: leukocyte esterase on a dipstick, white blood cell (WBC) count on manual microscopy with and without using a hemocytometer, automated WBC enumeration using flow cytometry, and automated WBC enumeration using digital imaging with particle recognition.

Results

A total of 4188 children were included. Among febrile children, the sensitivity of the 2 most widely available modalities, the leukocyte esterase test and WBC enumeration using digital imaging, had sensitivity values of 84% (95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.87) and 75% (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.83), respectively.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that for febrile children < 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTI, pyuria will be absent in ∼20% of children who are eventually shown to have pure growth of a pathogen on a culture. This raises questions about the appropriateness of requiring pyuria for the diagnosis of UTIs.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for non-gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to consider diagnosing urethritis based on the following criteria if microscopy is not available:

- presence of a mucopurulent or purulent urethral discharge on examination

- ≥ 1+ on a leukocyte esterase dipstick in a first void urine specimen

- threads in a first void urine specimen (threads may be physiological, such as semen).

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^115edraS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection rapid tests — meta-analysis performance in children is summarized as follows: A Class II meta-analysis of 95 studies in 95,703 children aged 18 years or younger reported nitrite-only sensitivity 49% (95% CI 41% to 57%) and specificity 98% (95% CI 96% to 99%); leukocyte esterase or nitrite sensitivity 88% (95% CI 82% to 91%) and specificity 79% (95% CI 69% to 87%); urine WBC counts (> 10/μL) sensitivity 74% (95% CI 67% to 80%) and specificity 86% (95% CI 82% to 90%); unstained bacteria sensitivity 85% (95% CI 75% to 94%) and specificity 92% (95% CI 84% to 96%); and Gram's-stained bacteria sensitivity 91% (95% CI 80% to 96%) and specificity 96% (95% CI 92% to 98%). These rapid diagnostic tests were negative in about 10% of children with urinary tract infections and "cannot replace urine culture".

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115tJ7Au]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Symptom control

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hour they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials. Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit, but as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infection based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick resultsmight be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

Antibiotic use

A modest reduction in antibiotic use (20–25%) was achieved in all groups except the symptom score group. While these reductions are probably useful for public health, and the effect might plausibly increase with time as patient expectations change, the magnitude of the effect is in contrast to delayed antibiotic prescription among patients with respiratory infections. This is perhaps not surprising given that few respiratory infections are bacterial whereas most suspected urinary tract infections are (66% of the midstream urine group had confirmed infection, similar to the previous study). There was some evidence that delayed prescribing might reduce reconsultation as we hypothesised, but this was not significant, probably because of the relatively low power of this analysis.

### Fast and sensitive: automated point-of-care urine dips [^114c9xdH]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Point-of-care (POC) urine dipstick is a highly used test in the pediatric emergency department (PED) owing to its fast turn-around time and inexpensive cost. Past studies have shown hand-held urine dipsticks and automated urinalysis in children younger than 48 months to be sensitive predictors for urinary tract infection (UTI). It is hypothesized that POC dip testing is as accurate as laboratory urinalysis in the diagnosis of UTI.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients (aged birth through 18 years) presenting to a PED between January 2015 and December 2015. Eligible subjects included those that had a POC dip, laboratory urinalysis (lab UA), and urine culture performed during their PED visit. Subjects were selected, using a random number generator; 334 charts were selected. A positive POC dip was defined as having a positive leukocyte esterase or the presence of nitrites. A positive lab UA was defined as having a positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or greater than 10 white blood cells per high-power field. Urine culture was used as the criterion standard for comparison.

Results

A total of 334 subjects' charts were reviewed. Sensitivity and specificity of the POC dip were 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.9%-98.2%) and 63.9% (95% CI, 57.2%-69.3%); lab UA, 91.4% (95% CI, 76.9%-98.2%) and 63.9% (95% CI, 58.2%-69.3%); and lab dip, 88.6% (95% CI, 73.3%-96.8%) and 65.6% (95% CI, 59.9%-70.9%).

Conclusions

Point-of-care dips are as sensitive in detecting UTI as the lab UA. A prospective study could allow for further demographic evaluation of POC dip diagnosed UTI.

### Evaluation of dipstick analysis among elderly residents to detect bacteriuria: a cross-sectional study in 32 nursing homes [^115EFSJL]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have evaluated dipstick urinalysis for elderly and practically none present confidence intervals. Furthermore, most previous studies combine all bacteria species in a "positive culture". Thus, their evaluation may be inappropriate due to Yule-Simpson's paradox. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of dipstick urinalysis for the elderly in nursing homes.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study voided urine specimens were collected from 651 elderly individuals in nursing homes. Dipstick urinalysis for nitrite, leukocyte esterase and urine culture were performed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Visual readings were compared to readings with a urine chemistry analyzer.

Results

207/651 (32%) of urine cultures showed growth of a potentially pathogenic bacterium. Combining the two dipsticks improved test characteristics slightly compared to using only one of the dipsticks. When both dipsticks are negative, presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria can be ruled out with a negative predictive value of 88 (84–92)%. Visual and analyzer readings had acceptable agreement.

Conclusion

When investigating for bacteriuria in elderly people at nursing homes we suggest nitrite and leukocyte esterase dipstick be combined. There are no clinically relevant differences between visual and analyzer dipstick readings. When dipstick urinalysis for nitrite and leukocyte esterase are both negative it is unlikely that the urine culture will show growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and in a patient with an uncomplicated illness further testing is unnecessary.

### Urinary tract infections in older women: a clinical review [^114AHHdU]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women are commonly encountered in outpatient practice.

Objective

To review management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI and review prevention of recurrent UTIs in older community-dwelling women.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for English-language human studies conducted among adults aged 65 years and older and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1946 to November 20, 2013.

Results

The clinical spectrum of UTIs ranges from asymptomatic bacteriuria, to symptomatic and recurrent UTIs, to sepsis associated with UTI requiring hospitalization. Recent evidence helps differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is transient in older women, often resolves without any treatment, and is not associated with morbidity or mortality. The diagnosis of symptomatic UTI is made when a patient has both clinical features and laboratory evidence of a urinary infection. Absent other causes, patients presenting with any 2 of the following meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for symptomatic UTI: fever, worsened urinary urgency or frequency, acute dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. A positive urine culture (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) with no more than 2 uropathogens and pyuria confirms the diagnosis of UTI. Risk factors for recurrent symptomatic UTI include diabetes, functional disability, recent sexual intercourse, prior history of urogynecologic surgery, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence. Testing for UTI is easily performed in the clinic using dipstick tests. When there is a low pretest probability of UTI, a negative dipstick result for leukocyte esterase and nitrites excludes infection. Antibiotics are selected by identifying the uropathogen, knowing local resistance rates, and considering adverse effect profiles. Chronic suppressive antibiotics for 6 to 12 months and vaginal estrogen therapy effectively reduce symptomatic UTI episodes and should be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Establishing a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI in older women requires careful clinical evaluation with possible laboratory assessment using urinalysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be differentiated from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women should not be treated.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^1119PSn9]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Who needs evaluation for UTI

Clinical diagnosis of UTI is unreliable, so many children with fever or symptoms of UTI need a urine sample to exclude or make the diagnosis. Urine samples should be collected before starting antibiotics, but therapy should not be delayed in the septic child.

Children with localising signs or suspected UTI need a urine sample to confirm the diagnosis.

Children with fever without focus, particularly neonates and infants, need a urine sample to evaluate potential UTI. Outside early infancy and if the child is not unwell, it may be reasonable to wait 24 hours for collection to see if an alternative focus emerges.

Children with an alternative focus of illness generally do not need a urine sample. Exceptions are septic infants, children with predisposing conditions (eg, renal anomalies), children at risk of complications (eg, single kidney) and febrile illness not following the expected clinical course.

Screening – dipstick and microscopy

Urine dipsticks are a quick, inexpensive bedside screening tool. Chemical reagent strips change colour in the presence of leucocyte esterase (an enzyme present in leucocytes) and nitrites, which may arise from UTI. Leucocytes generally appear in the urine in response to UTI. However, sterile pyuria can occur with other infections. Enterococcus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species are also less likely to produce pyuria than E.coli in children with symptomatic UTI. Most uropathogens convert dietary nitrates into urinary nitrites. However, not all do, including Enterococcus and Klebsiella species. Dipsticks are also less reliable in young infants, where frequent voiding flushes substrates out of the bladder.

Neither leucocytes or nitrites are fully sensitive or specific for UTI, but they are a useful screening test, particularly when used in combination. If UTI is thought unlikely, dipsticks have a good negative predictive value to exclude the diagnosis. In the presence of suggestive symptoms and either leucocytes or nitrites, empirical antibiotics while awaiting culture is indicated.

Urine microscopy also identifies leucocytes and bacteria, augmenting dipstick screening.

### Routine tests and automated urinalysis in patients with suspected urinary tract infection at the ED [^11146mKo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequently encountered. Diagnostics of UTI (urine dipstick, Gram stain, urine culture) lack proven accuracy and precision in the emergency department. Utility of automated urinalysis shows promise for UTI diagnosis but has not been validated.

Methods

A total of 381 cases presenting with fever and/or clinically suspected UTI were analyzed. Diagnosis was based on clinical presentation, urine culture and/ or blood culture, and successful treatment. Performance of standard diagnostics and automated urinalysis (Sysmex UF-1000i) was analyzed at various cutoff values, and diagnostic algorithms were tested.

Results

One hundred forty-three (37.5%) cases were diagnosed with UTI. Sensitivity of urine dipstick nitrite was 32.9% and specificity was 93.7%. Sensitivity of urine dipstick leukocyte esterase (3+) was 80.4% and specificity was 82.8%. Receiver operating characteristic curves of automated bacterial and leukocyte count showed area under the curve of 0.851 and 0.872, respectively. Cutoff values of 133 bacteria/μL and 48 leukocytes/μL resulted in > 90% sensitivity. Diagnostic values for complicated cases (antibiotics, catheters) were inferior to uncomplicated cases. Algorithms combining dipstick and automated counts did not improve accuracy with the exception of a 5.2% increase in uncomplicated cases (n = 247).

Conclusions

Automated leukocyte and bacterial count can be used in the emergency department setting with comparable accuracy compared with standard dipstick analysis with minor improvement when combined.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^114EjrBU]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common sources of infection in children under five. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce the risk of renal scarring. Rapid, cost-effective, methods of UTI diagnosis are required as an alternative to culture.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests for detecting UTI in children under five years of age.

Results

The evidence supports the use of dipstick positive for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite (pooled LR+ = 28.2, 95% CI: 17.3, 46.0) or microscopy positive for both pyuria and bacteriuria (pooled LR+ = 37.0, 95% CI: 11.0, 125.9) to rule in UTI. Similarly dipstick negative for both LE and nitrite (Pooled LR- = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.26) or microscopy negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria (Pooled LR- = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.23) can be used to rule out UTI. A test for glucose showed promise in potty-trained children. However, all studies were over 30 years old. Further evaluation of this test may be useful.

Conclusion

Dipstick negative for both LE and nitrite or microscopic analysis negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria of a clean voided urine, bag, or nappy/pad specimen may reasonably be used to rule out UTI. These patients can then reasonably be excluded from further investigation, without the need for confirmatory culture. Similarly, combinations of positive tests could be used to rule in UTI, and trigger further investigation.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111c2ts7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We combined the nitrite and leukocyte esterase dipstick test results because studies showed that the urine dipstick test seems most useful in all populations, including older adults, to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte esterase are negative.

In the absence of formal cut-off values for CRP, we used the most common cut-offs, i.e. < 5 mg/L (normal range) and ≥ 5 mg/L (elevated values). In real life practice, general practitioners are most likely to apply these cut-offs that are also stated in the manufacturer's instructions. NH staff could report the CRP test result to the resident's general practitioner, but we do not know whether this was always done and if this influenced UTI management.

One study found that a serum CRP cut-off value of 60 mg/L was the best predictor for early detection of bacterial infections, including UTIs, in an older hospitalised population. The mean CRP value in their non-infection control group was however 21.3 mg/L, suggesting that ageing and frailty can increase serum inflammation protein levels. In our study, we did not explore CRP levels in residents without UTI suspicions.

We identified one similar study that explored the sensitivity of POCT CRP and procalcitonin to diagnose UTIs in Dutch NH residents. They used the same POCT device, but applied a more stringent definition of a confirmed ('true') UTI, namely a positive urine leucocyte esterase test and symptom resolution in the course of adequate antibiotic treatment (i.e. proven susceptibility of isolated uropathogens to the administered antibiotic) in addition to the presence of at least two urinary or non-specific symptoms. They registered 266 episodes of suspected UTIs (out of the targeted 440 episodes), and 19.8% of these met their definition of a 'true' UTI, a percentage slightly higher than ours (11.7%). With an empirically estimated cut-off of 6.5 mg/L, their sensitivity (57.2%, 95% CI: 48.9–65.4%) and specificity (54.4%, 95% CI: 51.8–57.0%) of POCT CRP were similar to ours (60.0% and 50.9%, respectively). Signs/symptoms triggering UTI suspicion were not reported.

### Validation of the Spanish acute cystitis symptoms score (ACSS) in native Spanish-speaking women of Europe and Latin America [^116Sp5Ub]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Clinical and microbiological considerations

Following the EAU guidelines on urological infections, the diagnosis of AC was made by the treating physician based on the clinical history and the typical clinical symptoms of patients referred to the clinic. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of AC underwent urinalysis and urine culture, obtaining a urine sample collected in the middle of urination. UTI–AC is defined microbiologically, according to the recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society of America, by the presence of ≥ 10⁵ CFU (colony‐forming units)/ml of a bacterial species isolated in a urine culture. In patients with the typical symptoms of UTI, a cut‐off point of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml was also accepted. Women clinically diagnosed with AC based on symptoms and with a positive urine leukocyte esterase test but without significant bacteriuria of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml in urine culture were not excluded from the study, as there is evidence that AC can occur with a low bacterial count. The results of urine analysis were usually evaluated in the midstream as the number of cells in a chamber's cell (high power field [HPF]). Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false‐positive and false‐negative results can occur. According to publications, the normal reference value for women is 0–5 white blood cells/HPF. However, it can vary depending on regulatory issues, equipment, local guidelines, clinical protocols.

### The importance of urine concentration on the diagnostic performance of the urinalysis for pediatric urinary tract infection [^111zuXw3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The presence of leukocyte esterase by urine dipstick and microscopic pyuria are both indicators of possible urinary tract infection. The effect of urine concentration on the diagnostic performance of the urinalysis for pediatric urinary tract infection has not been studied. Our objective is to determine whether the urinalysis performance for detecting urinary tract infection varies by urine concentration as measured by specific gravity.

Methods

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of the urine laboratory results of children younger than 13 years who presented to the emergency department during 68 months and had a paired urinalysis and urine culture obtained. Urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a uropathogen at standard culture thresholds. Test characteristics were calculated across 4 specific gravity groups (1.000 to 1.010, 1.011 to 1.020, 1.021 to 1.030, and > 1.030).

Results

In total, 14,971 cases were studied. Median age was 1.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 5.5 years) and 60% were female patients. Prevalence of urinary tract infection was 7.7%. For the presence of leukocyte esterase and a range of pyuria cut points, the positive likelihood ratios decreased with increasing specific gravity. From most dilute to most concentrated urine, the positive likelihood ratio decreased from 12.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7 to 13.7) to 4.2 (95% CI 3.0 to 5.8) and 9.5 (95% CI 8.6 to 10.6) to 5.5 (95% CI 3.3 to 9.1) at a threshold of greater than or equal to 5 WBCs per high-power field and presence of leukocyte esterase, respectively. The negative likelihood ratios increased with increasing specific gravity for leukocyte esterase and microscopic pyuria.

Conclusion

For the detection of pediatric urinary tract infection, the diagnostic performance of both dipstick leukocyte esterase and microscopic pyuria varies by urine concentration, and therefore the specific gravity should be considered when the urinalysis is interpreted.

### Improving urinary tract infection diagnostics in oncology: reliability of reflex urine culture in immunosuppressed neutropenic and non-neutropenic cancer patients [^114GHFCb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are prone to overdiagnosis, and reflex urine culture protocols offer a valuable opportunity for diagnostic stewardship in this arena. However, there is no recommended standard testing approach. Patients with cancer are often excluded from reflex urine culture protocols, especially if they are severely immunosuppressed or neutropenic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of urine screening studies, including dipstick urinalysis for nitrite and leukocyte esterase and urine microscopy for white blood cell count, to detect significant pathogen growth.

Methods

A retrospective study of 58 098 urine cultures with a paired dipstick urinalysis with or without urine microscopy was performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, evaluating data from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. A dipstick urinalysis was considered negative only if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were undetected.

Results

A negative dipstick urinalysis had a negative predictive value of 98% for clinically significant bacteriuria in voided urine and 95% for catheterized urine. Notably, a negative urine dipstick test screen maintained a high negative predictive value among patients with neutropenia and in those with antibiotic exposure before testing. Finally, the presence of pyuria ≥ 10 white blood cells per high-power field on urine microscopy offered negligible incremental diagnostic benefit in samples with a negative dipstick urinalysis.

Conclusions

Reflex urine culture protocols contingent upon a screening dipstick urinalysis are a safe and effective platform for diagnostic stewardship in patients with cancer including those with neutropenia.

### Evaluation of dipstick analysis among elderly residents to detect bacteriuria: a cross-sectional study in 32 nursing homes [^116NW74W]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Only 4.0% (26/651) had ongoing antibiotic treatment thus no urinary bacteria growth and negative nitrite dipstick may have been expected. However, leukocyte esterase dipstick may remain positive for some time. Thus, these patients were more likely to influence test results of leukocyte esterase rather than nitrite dipstick. Due to the low prevalence of ongoing antibiotic treatment this effect was considered low.

Procedures allowing presence of a few specific symptoms or outcomes of prior dipstick testing influence the decision of cut-off levels for CFU in urine culture may enhance the diagnostic procedure. These procedures are very common in microbiologic laboratories in Sweden. Thus, the present procedure for urine culture was used without modification to be representative of ordinary clinical practice.

Dipstick urinalysis was performed by non-laboratory personnel in this study. If the analysis had been performed by laboratory personnel, results might have differed slightly. On the other hand, these bedside tests are usually performed by non-laboratory personnel in clinical practice at nursing homes for the elderly. Thus, this study represented ordinary clinical practice.

The results of this study can be considered generalisable in developed countries when evaluating urine dipstick analysis for elderly individuals at nursing homes performed in ordinary clinical practice.

The NPV for nitrite to predict absence of E. faecalis in a urine culture is higher than for E. coli despite E. faecalis being a poor converter of nitrate to nitrite. The most likely explanation being the prevalence of E. faecalis is very low (2.6%) resulting in a high NPV even if sensitivity and specificity are low.

The kappa coefficient for agreement between visual and analyzer readings was lower for leukocyte esterase dipsticks than for nitrite dipsticks. This is logical whereby leukocyte esterase dipsticks have several color blocks while nitrite dipstick has only a binary outcome. The more possible outcomes the lower the kappa value becomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of UTI in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, to guide further decisions:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low risk|- Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only without testing|
|Non-low risk, first option|- Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture and urinalysis|
|Non-low risk, second option|- Obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means for urinalysis < br > - Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture if urinalysis results suggest a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results, nitrite test, or microscopic analysis results for leukocytes or bacteria) < br > - Consider monitoring the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy if urinalysis of fresh urine (less than 1 hour since void) yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty.|

### Serologic and urinary characteristics of laboratory-confirmed genitourinary tuberculosis at a tertiary hospital in the Philippines [^111jda7H]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary findings were defined as: (1) acidic urine as urine pH ≤ 5.5, (2) low specific gravity as urine specific gravity ≤ 1.010, (3) hematuria as three or more erythrocytes per high-power field, (4) proteinuria as detection of proteinuria by dipstick examination, and (5) pyuria as detection of more than 5 white blood cells per high-power field in urine microscopy or positive leukocyte esterase dipstick testing.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis of this study. Frequency and percentage were used to describe categorical variables and proportions of patients who improved, expired, or developed short-term outcomes such as the need for pressors or renal replacement therapy. Continuous variables were expressed as median.

Associations were determined by bivariate analysis using Fisher's exact test for characteristics involving 2 categories or Chi-square test for those with > 2 categories. Mean lengths of hospital stay between those with and without the identified clinical, serologic, and urinary characteristics were compared using Mann–Whitney U-test for characteristics involving 2 categories or Kruskal–Wallis test for those with > 2 categories. For all tests, p value of at most 0.05 indicate significance.

### Pitfalls in diagnosing urinary tract infection in children below the age of 2: suprapubic aspiration vs clean-catch urine sampling [^112M8nz3]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Reliable urine samples are of eminent importance when diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children. Noninvasive procedures are convenient but likely to be contaminated. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine samples obtained by the midstream clean-catch method (CCU) to urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration (SPA) and to evaluate the ability of urinary dipstick to predict true infection.

Materials and Methods

Retrospectively, data on children < 2 years of age seen at our center for suspicion of UTI who had a CCU and a SPA performed the same day were included. Any growth in SPA was considered significant, whereas for CCU we tested 2 cutoff values of 10⁴ and 10⁵ CFU/ml, along with urinary dipstick results.

Results

A total of 223 children were included. Using a cutoff of ≥ 10⁴ CFU/ml, 16.6% of the cohort (37 cases) would be misdiagnosed if relying only on CCU. Using ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml, the rate was 24.6% (55 cases). Evaluating leukocyte esterase on urinary dipstick, a large difference between using CCU (sensitivity 94.7%, specificity 14.4%) and SPA (sensitivity 78.9%, specificity 82.2%) became obvious.

Conclusions

A large number of children will be misdiagnosed if relying on CCU specimens compared to SPA. Relying on a negative leukocyte esterase dipstick test to rule out a UTI is not sufficient in a child with high suspicion of such an infection. SPA is a safe procedure, and we thus recommend its use to avoid delay of treatment and unnecessary invasive followup investigations.

### Unsatisfactory performance of flow cytometer UF-100 and urine strips in predicting outcome of urine cultures [^114G4cQo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

UF-100 flow cytometer and urine strip results were cross-interpreted to predict culture outcomes. The best negative predictive value was obtained with bacteria at ≥ 1,000/microl, white blood cells at ≥ 20/microl, or leukocyte esterase positivity. Nine of 24 false negatives were clinically significant. Thus, UF-100 and urine strip results do not accurately predict the outcome of cultures.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112KNEot]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^115rWDXz]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the clinician determines that the febrile infant is not in a low-risk group, then there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): Option 1 is to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or SPA for culture and urinalysis; Option 2 is to obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and to perform a urinalysis, proceeding to catheterization or SPA and culture if urinalysis suggests UTI, whereas if urinalysis of fresh (less than 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112yE1He]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111sfDpY]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections in nursing homes (NHs). A high error rate of a UTI diagnosis based solely on clinical criteria is to be expected in older persons as they often present infections in an atypical way. A study was set up to assess the diagnostic value of signs/symptoms and urine dipstick testing in identifying UTIs in NH residents and to explore whether C-reactive protein (CRP) measured by point-of-care testing (POCT) can help in the diagnosis.

Methods

During a three month prospective multicentre study, urine sampling for culture, POCT CRP and urinary dipstick testing were performed in each NH resident with a suspected UTI. UTIs were defined according to Stone et al. i.e. criteria based upon the presence of a set of signs/symptoms and a positive urine culture.

Results

Eleven NHs and 1 263 residents participated. Sixteen out of 137 recorded UTI suspicions were confirmed. Acute dysuria (positive likelihood ratio (LR +): 7.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.94–14.5) and acute suprapubic pain (LR +: 11.4, 95% CI: 3.58–35.9) were found to be significant predictors. The combined nitrite and leucocyte esterase urine dipstick test (one or both positive) had a 96.0% negative predictive value (95% CI: 80.5–99.3%). The sensitivity of a positive CRP test (≥ 5 mg/L) was 60.0% (95% CI: 32.3–83.7%). Antimicrobials were prescribed in 60.2% of suspected but unconfirmed UTIs and in 92.3% of confirmed UTIs.

Conclusions

Using a stringent definition, only 11.7% of our suspicions were confirmed. Besides acute dysuria and suprapubic pain, we were not able to prove that any other clinical sign/symptom or POCT CPR adds useful information to the UTI diagnosis. We confirmed the findings of earlier research that urine dipstick tests are useful in ruling out UTIs and identified a potential overuse of antimicrobials in our NH population.

### Leukocytosis: basics of clinical assessment… [^111LTomS]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, defined as a white blood cell count greater than 11, 000 per mm³, 1 is frequently found in the course of routine laboratory testing. An elevated white blood cell count typically reflects the normal response of bone marrow to an infectious or inflammatory process. Occasionally, leukocytosis is the sign of a primary bone marrow abnormality in white blood cell production, maturation or death related to a leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder. Often, the family physician can identify the cause of an elevated white blood cell count based on the findings of the history and physical examination coupled with basic data from the complete blood count. Production, Maturation and Survival of Leukocytes Common progenitor cells, referred to as "stem cells, " are located in the bone marrow and give rise to erythroblasts, myeloblasts and megakaryoblasts. Three quarters of the nucleated cells in the bone marrow are committed to the production of leukocytes.

These stem cells proliferate and differentiate into granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes, which together comprise the absolute white blood cell count. An excessive white blood cell response associated with a cause outside the bone marrow is termed a "leukemoid reaction. " Even this exaggerated white blood cell count is usually caused by relatively benign processes. An underlying malignancy is the most serious but least common cause of a leukemoid reaction. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia results from the proliferation and persistence of relatively mature-appearing lymphocytes. The spleen and lymph nodes are enlarged because of the excessive accumulation of lymphocytes.

Despite the increased number of lymphocytes, this disease is associated with impaired immunity as a result of the scarcity of normal lymphocytes. Leukocytosis is also found in patients with essential thrombocythemia. Although elevated platelet counts occur in all myeloproliferative disorders, essential thrombocythemia is distinguished by the singular prominence of platelets. Markers of other disorders, such as the Philadelphia chromosome and bone marrow fibrosis, are absent.

### A blinded observational cohort study of the microbiological ecology associated with pyuria and overactive bladder symptoms [^116b6afN]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between infection, inflammation and the generation of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms has not been scrutinised in a prospective, controlled study, and our dismissal of an infective association for this symptom group may be compromised by deficiencies in urinalysis on which we rely heavily. Quantitative microbiological bacterial culture remains the reference gold standard in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). However, it is now appreciated that in patients with nonacute lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a midstream urine culture (MSU) that does not show ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU) μl⁻¹ of a single species of a known urinary pathogen does not exclude significant UTI. There is growing evidence of polymicrobial infections of the urinary tract. Traditional culture methods assume, without evidence, dominant pathogenicity from the Enterobacteriaceae species, notably E. coli, so the MSU culture is performed on selective media, favouring Enterobacteriaceae under aerobic conditions. This culture method will miss a number of potential pathogens. Microscopic counting of pyuria remains the best surrogate marker of UTI that we have. However, in some clinical settings, dipstick tests to detect leucocyte esterase have replaced leucocyte counting by fresh-urine microscopic examination, without validation. Despite this, some laboratories use dipsticks to screen urine samples; others use microscopy, only culturing urine samples that are pyuria-positive. Where microscopy is used, the delay caused by specimen transit compromises the specimen. In assessing anyone who presents with OAB, a mandatory step is the exclusion of UTI, but given the deficiencies in the tests, an OAB diagnosis may be flawed.

Studies of patients in the broader category of LUTS report increased inflammatory activity and bacterial colonisation not seen in asymptomatic controls. Bacterial strains from LUTS patients were shown to invade urothelial cell lines, whilst bacteria isolated from controls did not. It is possible that LUTS may be associated with urothelial microbial changes that stimulates an inflammatory response, generating the symptoms. OAB is an important subclass of LUTS that merits specific attention. Lunawat et al. found that in all 61 patients with OAB and pyuria but negative routine microbial culture, bladder biopsies manifested all the uroepithelial features of chronic cystitis; no features of inflammation were identified in control samples. Vijaya et al. found increased bacterial growth on culturing bladder biopsies obtained at cystoscopy from patients with OAB despite negative MSU culture.

### Alternative strategies to provide actionable results when a supply of urinalysis strips is unavailable [^113WvZ3V]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Urinalysis instrument-specific dip strips offer physicians qualitative results for actionable analytes (protein, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, hemoglobin, and ketones).

Objective —

To explain a strategy implemented to support clinical decision-making by providing urine quantification of protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBCs), and red blood cells because of urine strip shortages.

Design —

During shortages, we implemented an automated algorithm that triggered sending urine samples to the automation line for quantification of protein and glucose and ensured that urine microscopy was performed to obtain WBC and red blood cell counts. The algorithm printed 2 labels so nursing staff would collect 2 specimens. We monitored the turnaround time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to result verification, ensured that the culture reflex order was triggered, and tracked complaints by physicians regarding not having usual urinalysis results. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was found acceptable.

Results —

The algorithm was put in place twice during 2022. The turnaround time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was done with the strips; however, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more. Urine reflex cultures were triggered correctly with the algorithm, as they were derived entirely from a WBC count higher than 10 per high-power field. During the shortage period we had only 1 complaint, by a physician wanting to have results of nitrates.

Conclusions —

During urine strip shortages, we successfully implemented a diversion algorithm that provided actionable urinalysis analytes in a timely manner with minimal provider complaints.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^111SLBpi]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The growing incidence of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria poses a significant public health threat, driven heavily by inappropriate antibiotic use. Diagnostic stewardship, including tools like reflex urine culture, can help reduce unnecessary testing and subsequent unwarranted antibiotic treatments, though optimal thresholds are not well-defined. In our analysis of urinary parameters, urine microscopy WBC count demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the presence of uropathogens.

Our study findings show that no single urinalysis parameter achieves both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting uropathogens from urine culture. However, WBC count on the microscopic portion of the urinalysis showed the best test performance with an AUC of 0.72, indicating acceptable or fair discriminative power.

Our results align with an analysis of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center healthcare system data, which assessed urinalysis parameters for diagnostic accuracy of "significant bacteriuria", a proxy definition for UTI. They found that WBC had the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.79), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.78) and bacteria (AUC = 0.77). Interestingly, our AUC values were lower. Differences may stem from test ordering practice variation, with some systems performing urinalysis with urine cultures more or less discriminately, including ordering tests for patients without UTI symptoms. The bias introduced by selecting patients based on clinician-initiated urinalysis ordering, rather than on symptoms, has been shown to underestimate diagnostic accuracy and may have contributed to inter-study variability in AUC results. Another key difference is our mean population age was lower (48 versus 57 years), attributed to our inclusion of children, whereas the other study included only adults. Increased age is associated with a higher prevalence of pyuria and colonization in women, – which might contribute to test performance differences. Finally, uropathogen definition differences may explain discrepant AUC values. The previous study's outcome was > 10,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, whereas our definition was organisms likely to prompt clinical action.

### What is the optimal timing for reading the leukocyte esterase strip for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection? [^115CCYn2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains a catastrophic complication after total joint arthroplasty, but diagnosing PJI remains a challenge. Few patients meet what have been described as the major criteria, so the diagnosis of PJI still predominantly relies on a combination of minor criteria. Analysis of joint synovial fluid is a substantial part of the 2018 International Consensus Meeting (ICM 2018) criteria. The leukocyte esterase (LE) strip test, initially used in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections, is an important method in analyzing synovial fluid that is extensively used in clinical practice because it is simple and yields a quick result. The early strip test for diagnosing urinary tract infection required 15 to 30 minutes, but now it takes only 60 to 90 seconds to obtain a result. Given that the viscosity of synovial fluid is higher than that of urine, it is appropriate to extend the reading time correspondingly. In accordance with the manufacturer's directions, the LE strip test with a 3-minute reading time has been used for the diagnosis of PJI.

However, the 3-minute reading time for LE is controversial. We have found no relevant clinical research that supported the best timing for reading these strip tests. In clinical practice, we found that the color of the LE strip gradually deepened over time (more than 3 minutes) after application, changing from nonpositive (0, ±, and 1+) to positive (2+) (Fig. 1). Therefore, the timing for reading the LE strip may affect the final diagnosis because the LE strip test plays an important role in the ICM 2018 criteria. It is imperative to determine the most appropriate time for reading results. The definite reading time will further standardize the clinical application of LE strip tests for diagnosing PJI and will provide a basis for further research to improve the accuracy of LE strip testing (such as the development of quantitative tests).

### Utility of dipstick urinalysis in peri-and postmenopausal women with irritative bladder symptoms [^117Ao8CW]. International Urogynecology Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Previous studies of dipstick urinalysis (UA) in asymptomatic peri- and postmenopausal women demonstrate poor sensitivity to detect a urinary tract infection (UTI). We hypothesized that sensitivity of this test would be improved in symptomatic peri- and postmenopausal women.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of 76 women seeking urogynecology care for irritative bladder symptoms. Subjects with a positive clean-catch (CC) dipstick UA for leukocyte esterase (LE) or nitrites (NIT) were offered enrollment. Dipstick UA was performed on CC and catheterized specimens, followed by microbiologic culture. Test characteristics were calculated for CC and catheterized UA. CC culture was compared with catheterized culture (gold standard) using Spearman's correlation coefficient.

Results

Data was available for analysis in 75/76 (98.7%) enrolled subjects. Mean age was 68 ± 11 years. Most subjects were postmenopausal (98.7%) and Caucasian (97.3%). Dipstick sensitivity ranged from 48% to 87% and 35% to 57% in CC and catheterized specimens, respectively. Dipstick UA from a CC specimen positive for NIT had the highest sensitivity (60.9), specificity (100), negative predictive value (85.2), and positive predictive value (100) in this population. Dipstick UA from CC and catheterized specimens had similar sensitivity for detecting UTIs. When culture results of 10³ colony-forming units were considered positive, CC and catheterized specimens were moderately correlated (ρ = 0.470).

Conclusions

Dipstick UA in this study had improved sensitivity compared with previously published results in both CC and catheterized samples. Initiation of empiric antibiotic treatment in women with irritative bladder symptoms and NIT-positive CC dipstick UA prior to obtaining urine culture results is a reasonable option.

### Predicting bacteriuria in urogynecology patients [^115DNVeu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine whether reagent strip testing can predict bacteriuria in urogynecology patients.

Study Design

All women undergoing urodynamic evaluations from June 1997 to October 2001 were identified by using a computerized database. Urine culture results were compared with reagent strip testing. Significant bacteriuria was defined as greater than 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter.

Results

Bacteriuria prevalence was 8.6% (n = 51). Sensitivity and specificity of nitrites were 0.51, (95% CI, 0.31–0.66) and 0.991, (95% CI, 0.974–0.998), respectively. Blood had a lower sensitivity (0.35, 95% CI, 0.20–0.54) and specificity (0.80, 95% CI, 0.75–0.84). Leukocyte esterase was similar to blood with a sensitivity of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.14–0.45) and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78–0.87). No combination of tests offered improved sensitivity or specificity over nitrites alone.

Conclusion

Nitrite dipstick testing has excellent specificity for bacteriuria in urogynecologic patients. These results support the treatment of women with positive nitrites who are preparing to undergo urodynamics without obtaining culture.

Urinalysis parameter combinations

When WBCs, which had the highest AUC (0.722 [95% CI 0.718–0.725]) among urinalysis parameters, were combined with bacterial counts of "few" or more, the AUC was slightly lower (0.711[95% CI 0.706–0.714)). Combinations of WBCs with other microscopic parameters resulted in even lower AUCs (Table 3). Among the macroscopic parameter combinations, leukocyte esterase combined with nitrite (whether positive or negative) had an AUC of 0.695, which was identical to that of leukocyte esterase alone (AUC = 0.700 [95% CI 0.690–0.701], p = 0.08) but higher than nitrites alone (AUC = 0.627 [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), p = 0.001) (Table 3).

### Absolute and relative accuracy of rapid urine tests for urinary tract infection in children: a meta-analysis [^113uY6g7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Rapid urine tests, such as microscopy, for bacteria and white cells, and dipsticks, for leucocyte esterase and nitrites, are often used in children that are unwell to guide early diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection. We aimed to establish whether these tests were sufficiently sensitive to avoid urine culture in children with negative results and to compare the accuracy of dipsticks with microscopy. Medline, Embase, and reference lists were searched. Studies were included if urine culture results were compared with rapid tests in children. Data were analysed to obtain absolute and relative accuracy estimates. Data from 95 studies in 95 703 children were analysed. Summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity for microscopy for Gram-stained bacteria were 91% (95% CI 80–96) and 96% (92–98), for unstained bacteria were 88% (75–94) and 92% (84–96), for urine white cells were 74% (67–80) and 86% (82–90), for leucocyte esterase or nitrite positive dipstick were 88% (82–91) and 79% (69–87), and for nitrite-only positive dipstick were 49% (41–57) and 98% (96–99). Microscopy for bacteria with Gram stain had higher accuracy than other laboratory tests with relative diagnostic odds ratio compared with bacteria without Gram stain of 8.7 (95% CI 1.8–41.1), white cells of 14.5 (4.7–44.4), and nitrite of 22.0 (0.7–746.3). Microscopy for white cells should not be used for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection because its accuracy is no better than that of dipstick, laboratory facilities are needed, and results are delayed. Rapid tests are negative in around 10% of children with a urinary tract infection and cannot replace urine culture. If resources allow, microscopy with Gram stain should be the single rapid test used.

### History and physical examination plus laboratory testing for the diagnosis of adult female urinary tract infection [^1173wmU7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians often encounter females presenting with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for female UTIs in emergency departments (EDs) have not been quantitatively described.

Objectives

This was a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P) and urinalysis in diagnosing uncomplicated female UTI in the ED.

Methods

The medical literature was searched from January 1965 through October 2012 in PUBMED and EMBASE using the following criteria: Patients were females greater than 18 years of age in the ED suspected of having UTIs. Interventions were H&P and urinalysis used to diagnose a UTI. The comparator was UTI confirmed by a positive urine culture. The outcome was operating characteristics of the interventions in diagnosing a UTI. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc.

Results

Four studies (pooled n = 948) were included with UTI prevalence ranging from 40% to 60%. H&P variables all had positive LRs (+LR, range = 0.8 to 2.2) and negative LRs (-LR, range = 0.7 to 1.0) that are insufficient to significantly alter pretest probability of UTI. Only a positive nitrite reaction (+LR = 7.5 to 24.5) was useful to rule in a UTI. To rule out UTI, only a negative leukocyte esterase (LE; -LR = 0.2) or blood reaction on urine dipstick (-LR = 0.2) were significantly accurate. Increasing pyuria directly correlated with +LR, and moderate pyuria (urine white blood cells [uWBC] > 50 colony-forming units [CFUs]/ml) and moderate bacteruria were good predictors of UTI (+LR = 6.4 and 15.0, respectively).

Conclusions

No single H&P finding can accurately rule in or rule out UTI in symptomatic women. Urinalysis with a positive nitrite or moderate pyuria and/or bacteruria are accurate predictors of a UTI. If the pretest probability of UTI is sufficiently low, a negative urinalysis can accurately rule out the diagnosis.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^117DtL44]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic approach in febrile infants — If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the infant is not in a low-risk group, there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for culture and urinalysis, or obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and perform a urinalysis; if the urinalysis suggests a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results or nitrite test or microscopic analysis results positive for leukocytes or bacteria), then a urine specimen should be obtained through catheterization or SPA and cultured; if urinalysis of fresh (< 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite test results, then it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that negative urinalysis results do not rule out a UTI with certainty.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^115Ji3rC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to observing the presence and absence of symptoms, we also calculated a symptom score to determine the magnitude of LUTS within each patient group. The number of symptoms was summed for each of the four categories to provide a score and compared across the groups using Mood's median test. The median symptom scores for UUI, SUI, voiding, and pain symptom categories differed across the three study groups. Post hoc analysis revealed higher median UUI, SUI, and voiding scores for new patients than relapsed patients. However, both patient cohorts had similar pain scores and total symptom scores (Table 1). Statistical comparison of the respective frequencies for each assessed LUTS between new and relapsed patient groups are provided within the supplemental material (Table S2).

Urinary microscopy and dipstick analysis.

We performed urinary leukocyte counts to determine whether patient urine manifested evidence of infection independent of the bacterial assessment. As shown in Table 2, there was a significant difference in the log₁₀ leukocyte counts among the three study groups (χ² = 6.2, df = 2, P < 0.05). Post hoc analysis using Bonferroni's correction identified significant differences between controls and new patients and between controls and relapsed patients. No significant difference in the log₁₀ leukocyte counts was identified between new patients and relapsed patients.

TABLE 2
Descriptive measures of in-house (clinic) microscopic leukocyte counts and reported routine hospital MSU culture results for each study group a

Analysis of the urinary dipstick results showed that 13 (39.4%) new patients, 11 (36.7%) relapsed patients, and 6 (20.7%) controls tested positive for leukocyte esterase, with only 1 (3.0%) new patient testing positive for urinary nitrite. The results were unsurprising, as previous work suggested that the dipstick is not sensitive enough to diagnose infection (leukocyte esterase = 46 to 66%, nitrite = 6 to 18%), particularly in patients with nonacute symptoms of UTI.

Although LUTS can be driven by noninfectious causes, the association between patient symptoms and leukocyte recruitment demonstrates urinary tract inflammation. This is critical if an infective etiology for LUTS is being considered.

Evidence base and diagnostic performance for urinalysis components: Searches included January 2003 through recent search dates of February 6, 2015 and March 13, 2015, identifying four hundred ninety-two articles; one hundred nine were selected for further review, with 10 studies included for this critical question, consisting of 2 Class II and 8 Class III studies including infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years. In a subset of the Pediatric Research in Office Settings febrile infant study of 38,066 infants aged 0 to 3 months with a fever (≥ 38°C [100.4°F]), urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a single pathogen with ≥ 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for bag samples and ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL for catheterization samples; of the 1,482 infants who had urinalysis and urine cultures, 1,384 specimens were bag or catheterization, and for all specimens nitrites had better specificity (99% nitrites versus 91% leukocyte esterase).

Agreement between visual reading and analyzer

Visual and analyzer readings had, for nitrite, good agreement with a kappa coefficient 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.88–0.95, SE for kappa 0.019). However, the agreement for leukocyte esterase was lower with kappa coefficient 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.49–0.60, SE for kappa 0.027).

Association between dip stick findings and urine culture

The association between dipstick findings and urine culture was further evaluated by logistic regression to consider gender or age dependent effects. A visually read leukocyte esterase dipstick > 0 added information to the question of whether E. coli and "any bacteria" were present in the urine [see Additional file 5]. For E. faecalis and Klebsiella spp. a leukocyte esterase dipstick added information in some color blocks but not in others [see Additional file 5].

A positive nitrite dipstick, visually or analyzer read, added information to the question if E. coli, Klebsiella spp. or "any bacteria" was present in the urine [see Additional file 5]. For E. faecalis a nitrite dipstick added no statistically significant information [see Additional file 5].

When determining whether E. coli or "any bacteria" was present in the urine the use of nitrite dipstick added more information than the use of a leukocyte esterase dipstick [see Additional file 5].

We examined the impact of adjusting for dipstick proteinuria on the diagnostic performance of the 4 urinary biomarkers for stage 2 or 3 AKI in the overall cohort of 1219 participants (with and without clinical AKI). As shown in Table 2, the AUC for post-operative AKI was attenuated for all 4 urine biomarkers measured at the pre-operative time point after adjusting for proteinuria. For the 1st post-operative biomarker value, after adjusting for proteinuria, the AUC improved for IL-18, was unchanged for urine NGAL, and decreased for urine KIM-1 and urine L-FABP.

Introduction

Antimicrobial drugs are used to treat bacterial infections and have revolutionised modern medicine. However, the inappropriate use and dosage of antimicrobials increases the risk of treatment failure, toxicity to the patient, and the development of drug resistance, rendering antimicrobials ineffective and putting medicine and global health at risk. Bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) affects 150 million people globally each year. On average, one in two adult women will experience a UTI during their lifetime. Treating UTIs with empirical antibiotics when patients report symptoms results in overuse of antimicrobials, as more than half of the gold standard urine culture results of symptomatic females do not confirm a UTI. Developing novel antimicrobials, enhancing diagnostic precision, and optimising the use of current treatments are approaches that can be used to mitigate the impact of drug resistance and maintain access to effective antimicrobial drugs.

Both bacteria-specific and immune response biomarkers directly measured from the urine are frequently used to diagnose UTI, as the direct quantification of bacterial load in urine through culture is slow. Their diagnostic value has been extensively explored, specifically compared to the gold standard culture and count. It is generally agreed that conventional biomarkers tested with urinary dipstick tests, such as nitrite and leucocyte esterase, have limited accuracy in the diagnosis of UTIs –. Only a few of these biomarkers have been explored longitudinally in the literature, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin or leucocyte esterase –. Similar to the diagnosis of UTIs through biomarker detection, the need for rapid susceptibility testing has also been addressed in the literature. In vitro models mimic the urinary environment to understand the action and find the optimal dose of antimicrobial drugs. But pharmacokinetic optimisation has not been explored in-vivo. Real-time monitoring of known biomarkers used for UTI diagnosis alongside drug concentration in urine has not yet been explored and could enable real-time estimation of treatment success.

In this Comment, we aim to present the unexplored potential of using current and emerging technologies to monitor biomarkers alongside urinary antimicrobial drug concentration in UTI to gain an understanding of the relationship between drug exposure linked with host and pathogen response. We argue this could be used towards real-time pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) monitoring and support truly individualized approaches to the antimicrobial treatment of UTI.

### Dipstick urinalysis… [^115fzLcz]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

7 If urinalysis shows the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites, follow-up urinalysis using clean urine collection by urethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration should be performed. 8 An online risk calculator can help in the assessment of urinary tract infection in infants. Visual Appearance and Odor The yellow color of urine is caused by urochrome generated from the breakdown of hemoglobin. Foods, drugs, metabolic products, and infections can cause an abnormal urine appearance. 6, 9–11 Cloudy urine suggests an infection but can indicate alkaline urine with precipitated phosphate crystals. 6, 12 Gross hematuria is concerning for malignancy. Visible feces in the urine can suggest an enterovesical fistula, whereas nonfeculent brown urine may indicate ingestion of fava beans. LEUKOCYTE ESTERASE AND NITRITES Leukocyte esterase and nitrites found on dipstick testing suggest a UTI.

Leukocyte esterase is produced by neutrophils and may be present with inflammatory processes and infections. 6, 13 In one study of 705 children with culture-confirmed UTI, 71% of patients were positive for leukocyte esterase; however, this percentage decreased to 44% in patients with Enterococcus or Klebsiella infection.
19. 6, 13, 24, 25 RED BLOOD CELLS Microhematuria in adults is defined as three or more RBCs per high-power field on spun urine. In children, microhematuria is diagnosed with more than five RBCs per high-power field. WHITE BLOOD CELLS Neutrophils are the most common WBCs found in urine. On microscopy, neutrophils are larger than RBCs and contain nuclei. Neutrophils can be found in infectious and inflammatory processes, including UTIs, sexually transmitted infections, and urolithiasis. The presence of casts in urine suggests certain renal pathologies.

Hyaline casts are made of protein and may be a normal finding or occur with renal disease. RBC and WBC casts confirm glomerular disease. Granular casts consist of protein or degraded cellular casts and may indicate tubular injury, such as acute tubular necrosis. 6, 25.

The unexplored potential of longitudinal monitoring of drug exposure, host-response, and infection biomarkers in urine

Dipstick tests are frequently used to detect biomarkers qualitatively to support UTI diagnosis. Below, we categorise biomarkers frequently used in dipstick tests, and recently described as promising for UTI diagnosis, into host-response and bacteria-specific biomarkers. The detected ranges of these biomarkers are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Biomarker levels in non UTI and UTI patients

Reported ranges of commonly used biomarkers for UTI diagnosis.

LE Leucocyte esterase, XO Xanthine Oxidase, MPO Myeloperoxidase.

Despite the development of quantitative point-of-care technologies for nitrite, leucocyte esterase(LE), xanthine oxidase (XO)and myeloperoxidase (MPO)in urine, these biomarkers are frequently reported in a yes or no fashion. The sensitivity and specificity of XO and MPO for diagnosing UTIs show promising diagnostic values (100% and 87% sensitivity for XO and MPO, 100% specificity for both). Sensitivity and specificity of a positive nitrite and LE test vary depending on UTI prevalence and the bacterial count threshold used to define a UTI. Sensitivities in different studies range from 36–57% for nitrite and 72–95% for LE, and specificities 78–98% for nitrite and 9–59% for LE.

Few studies have evaluated biomarker concentration at more than one time point during UTI, and the possibility of using quantitative measurements serially to estimate PD remains unexplored (Fig. 1). Longitudinal, quantitative monitoring of biomarkers in UTI using point-of-care technologies, alongside drug measurement, could facilitate novel approaches to real-time PK-PD monitoring and individualised antimicrobial dosing (Fig. 2).

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^114T7zrd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients — bag versus catheter urine and white blood cell thresholds are reported as follows: Leukocyte esterase had higher sensitivity (84% leukocyte esterase versus 39% nitrites), and leukocyte esterase specificity was lower in bag urine (84%) than catheterization urine (94%). Urine white blood cells per high-power field (WBC/hpf) showed graded likelihood ratios (LRs): LR = 19 for WBC count greater than 20/hpf, LR = 18.2 for 11 to 20 WBCs/hpf, LR = 2.8 for 6 to 10 WBCs/hpf, LR = 1 for 3 to 5 WBCs/hpf, and LR = 0.3 for 0 to 2 WBCs/hpf. Relative risk of an ambiguous culture was higher for bag specimens at 2.7 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5), with absolute risks 7.4% in bag urine versus 2.7% with catheterization; 21 cultures (95% CI 13 to 53) by catheterization would be required to avoid 1 ambiguous bag culture. With a 5% prevalence and bagged urine specificity of 70%, the positive predictive value of a bag culture is 15% and 85% of positives would be false; a positive bagged urinalysis result should prompt a urine culture obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration.

### Association of pyuria with uropathogens in young children [^1176gH8H]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between uropathogens and pyuria in children < 24 months of age.

Study Design

A retrospective study of children < 24 months of age evaluated in the emergency department for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) with paired urinalysis and urine culture during a 6-year period. Bagged urine specimens or urine culture growing mixed/multiple urogenital organisms were excluded. Analysis was limited to children with positive urine culture as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline culture thresholds.

Results

Of 30 462 children, 1916 had microscopic urinalysis and positive urine culture. Urine was obtained by transurethral in-and-out catheterization in 98.3% of cases. Pyuria (≥ 5 white blood cells per high-powered field) and positive leukocyte esterase (small or more) on the urine dipstick were present in 1690 (88.2%) and 1692 (88.3%) of the children respectively. Children with non-Escherichia coli species were less likely to exhibit microscopic pyuria than children with E coli (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17–0.34) with more pronounced effect on Enterococcus and Klebsiella (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03–0.18 and OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11–0.27 respectively). Similarly, positive leukocyte esterase was less frequently seen in non-E coli uropathogens compared with E coli.

Conclusions

Pyuria and leukocyte esterase are not sensitive markers to identify non-E coli UTI in young children. More sensitive screening biomarkers are needed to identify UTI with these uropathogens.

### Evaluation of dipstick analysis among elderly residents to detect bacteriuria: a cross-sectional study in 32 nursing homes [^111kqkRH]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV

If a single leukocyte esterase dipstick was negative then the high NPV showed it unlikely that the urine culture was positive for E. coli, E. faecalis and Klebsiella spp [see Additional file 1]. However, presence of "any bacteria" could not be excluded [see Additional file 1]. If a single leukocyte esterase dipstick was positive it could not sufficiently predict bacteriuria [see Additional file 1].

Where a single nitrite dipstick was negative the high NPV showed it unlikely that the culture was positive for E. coli, E. faecalis and Klebsiella spp. respectively [see Additional file 2]. However, presence of "any bacteria" could not be excluded [see Additional file 2]. If a single nitrite dipstick was positive it could not sufficiently predict bacteriuria [see Additional file 2].

A single negative nitrite dipstick was as good as a single negative leukocyte esterase dipstick in excluding presence of E. coli [see Additional file 1] [see Additional file 2]. Raising the cut-off point in a single leukocyte esterase dipstick decreased its ability to exclude E. coli without making PPV for E. coli acceptable [see Additional file 2]. Thus, if a single dipstick was to exclude or predict presence of E. coli then the nitrite dipstick performed better than the leukocyte esterase dipstick. The accuracy of excluding or predicting E. faecalis and Klebsiella spp. did not differ between a single leukocyte esterase dipstick or a single nitrite dipstick [see Additional file 1] [see Additional file 2].

Combining the two dipsticks so that presence of both leukocyte esterase and nitrite were considered a positive test and all other test outcomes as negative altered test characteristics slightly compared to using only one of the dipsticks [see Additional file 3]. NPV for predicting absence of E. coli was lower compared to using only one of the dipsticks while PPV for predicting presence of E. coli increased only marginally.

Combining the two dipsticks so that presence of leukocytes and/or nitrite were considered positive and all other test outcomes as negative also altered test characteristics compared to using only one of the dip sticks [see Additional file 4]. NPV for predicting absence of a specified potentially pathogenic bacteria or predicting "any bacteria" was high enough to rule out bacteriuria.
