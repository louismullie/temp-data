## Question

Dizziness evaluation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate dizziness using the timing-and-triggers framework and bedside algorithms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic paradigm and why the old "type of dizziness" approach fails. Then, I should verify how to classify presentations into AVS, s-EVS, and t-EVS. Next, I will examine the bedside examination strategy for each syndrome, including HINTS, STANDING, and positional testing. After that, I need to check the imaging and testing recommendations, including when to avoid CT/MRI and when to use MRI or vascular imaging. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure I double-check any areas where I might overstate certainty or misattribute guidance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic paradigm shift, because I need to ensure we are not anchoring on outdated terminology. The traditional approach that relied on patient descriptions like "vertigo", "lightheadedness", or "disequilibrium" has poor inter-rater reliability and limited diagnostic utility, whereas the timing-and-triggers framework aligns with Barany Society consensus and is endorsed by GRACE-3 for ED evaluation of acute dizziness, even though it has not been fully validated in all-comers ED populations yet [^114G7oBs] [^112pM8ME] [^111WGnuB].

> I will now examine the three core clinical categories, but wait, let me verify the exact definitions before proceeding. Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is continuous dizziness lasting days to weeks with features of new vestibular dysfunction and symptoms even at rest; spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome (s-EVS) consists of transient episodes lasting minutes to hours without a positional trigger; and transient episodic vestibular syndrome (t-EVS) consists of brief attacks lasting seconds to minutes with clear positional triggers, which in the ED can often be reproduced at the bedside with maneuvers [^111R64Nm] [^111dAkAH] [^114ZN1T3].

> Next, I should review the bedside strategy for AVS, and I need to ensure I do not overstate test performance. HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) performed by trained clinicians has high sensitivity for detecting central causes, particularly stroke, and outperforms early MRI in some contexts; however, I should confirm that this applies when HINTS is correctly applied to patients with nystagmus and interpreted by trained examiners, and that CT is not reliable to exclude posterior circulation stroke in this setting [^114ybb7W] [^1128EUjR] [^113FFt1r]. Hold on, I should verify the role of hearing assessment: adding a bedside finger rub test for new unilateral hearing loss (HINTS plus) helps detect AICA strokes that can mimic peripheral disease, so I should incorporate that when evaluating AVS with nystagmus [^116espsU] [^115YJy2J].

> For t-EVS, let me think about positional testing and treatment sequencing, and I should double-check the maneuvers. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver diagnoses posterior canal BPPV when it elicits torsional upbeating nystagmus, and if negative but suspicion remains, the supine roll test identifies lateral canal BPPV with direction-changing horizontal nystagmus; treatment is with canalith repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley for posterior canal and Lempert (barbecue roll) for lateral canal, and I should avoid post-maneuver postural restrictions because they do not improve outcomes [^114FPKMQ] [^113gmNgZ] [^111Swr6D] [^111RLEWr]. Wait, let me verify imaging guidance: routine CT or MRI is not indicated for typical BPPV, and vestibular testing is not recommended when the diagnosis is already established clinically, which helps prevent unnecessary testing and false positives [^114QbsN3] [^112SULQL] [^113GzaMa].

> For s-EVS, I should confirm that history and targeted cranial nerve and gait exams are the primary tools to distinguish vestibular migraine from TIA, and I need to ensure I do not jump to imaging prematurely. In spontaneous episodic presentations, CT is low yield and should be avoided; instead, if TIA is suspected, vascular imaging with CTA or MRA of the head and neck is appropriate, whereas MRI brain is reserved for selected cases or when vascular imaging is unavailable or nondiagnostic [^112daYq2] [^113C67Qu] [^111WGnuB]. Hold on, I should verify that bedside cranial nerve and gait assessments are emphasized in GRACE-3 for this phenotype, which they are, reinforcing the centrality of the neurologic exam here [^112d3ESn] [^116y9XcM].

> I need to check the imaging caveats and correct any overstatements. I initially thought MRI sensitivity for posterior fossa stroke was 85–95% in the first 24–48 hours, but wait, I should verify the actual miss rate; recent data indicate MRI can miss 10–20% of acute posterior circulation strokes in the first 24–72 hours, so a negative early MRI does not fully exclude stroke when pretest probability is high, and repeating MRI or using vascular imaging may be warranted in that scenario [^113FFt1r] [^115YJy2J]. I should also confirm that CT is not recommended to distinguish central from peripheral causes in AVS, which GRACE-3 explicitly advises against, given poor sensitivity for posterior fossa ischemia [^1158bJLk] [^1128EUjR].

> Let me consider special populations and follow-up, and I should double-check fall-risk guidance. In older adults, dizziness markedly increases fall risk, so I should routinely screen for falls and assess mobility, home supports, and CNS comorbidities; in BPPV, reassessment within one month is recommended to document resolution and evaluate for persistent symptoms or alternative diagnoses, and vestibular rehabilitation should be considered for incomplete recovery or recurrent symptoms [^113EtkmY] [^111Ar3eC] [^113LTu4A]. For concussion-related dizziness, I need to ensure a targeted primary care vestibular assessment precedes referral, with attention to symptom character, timing, and triggers, and then consider vestibular rehabilitation once other causes are excluded [^111YGjua].

> Next, I should review a concise decision algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. First, screen for red flags and non-isolated dizziness; if present, activate stroke or medical emergency pathways. Second, classify by timing and triggers into AVS, s-EVS, or t-EVS. Third, apply the syndrome-specific bedside exam: HINTS plus hearing for AVS with nystagmus, Dix-Hallpike and supine roll with CRP for t-EVS, and focused neurologic and gait assessment with vascular imaging when indicated for s-EVS. Fourth, avoid low-yield imaging such as routine CT/MRI for typical BPPV and avoid vestibular testing when the diagnosis is clear. Fifth, arrange follow-up and rehabilitation as indicated, including reassessment at one month for BPPV and vestibular rehabilitation for persistent symptoms or unilateral vestibular hypofunction [^1145UgUC] [^111WGnuB] [^111qjy1c].

> Finally, I should confirm training and systems implications, because misapplication of these tools undermines accuracy. GRACE-3 emphasizes that emergency clinicians should be trained in HINTS and BPPV maneuvers, acknowledges that many ED clinicians currently lack validated training programs, and notes that portable video-oculography can improve documentation and diagnostic consistency; until validated training is widespread, MRI remains the next-best test when HINTS expertise is unavailable, and teams should invest in competency-building to safely operationalize these bedside strategies [^111WGnuB] [^116noZ7b] [^114UvFpU] [^1128EUjR].

The dizziness evaluation should be structured around **timing, triggers, and targeted examination** (TiTrATE) to distinguish peripheral from central causes and guide testing and treatment [^1132xzrG] [^112pM8ME]. Most dizziness is benign and peripheral, but **red flags** (acute neurologic deficits, head/neck pain, focal findings, sudden severe vertigo, or nonpositional symptoms) require urgent imaging and stroke evaluation [^1128EUjR] [^1145UgUC]. Routine labs and imaging are not needed for typical presentations; use **MRI with DWI** when stroke is suspected or HINTS is equivocal, and reserve CT for emergencies when MRI is unavailable [^111WGnuB] [^1158bJLk]. Management is cause-specific: canalith repositioning for BPPV, vestibular rehabilitation for persistent symptoms, and urgent stroke care when indicated [^111RLEWr] [^111qjy1c] [^1128EUjR].

## Clinical classification of dizziness

Dizziness is broadly classified into four categories, but **patient descriptions are unreliable**; therefore, use timing and triggers to guide evaluation [^114G7oBs]:

- **Vertigo**: False sense of motion or spinning [^112WUPD1].
- **Presyncope**: Near-fainting or lightheadedness [^112WUPD1].
- **Disequilibrium**: Imbalance or unsteadiness [^112WUPD1].
- **Lightheadedness**: Nonspecific discomfort [^112WUPD1].

---

## Key historical features

A focused history should prioritize **timing, triggers, and associated symptoms**:

- **Onset and duration**: Sudden vs gradual; seconds, minutes, hours, or days [^111R64Nm].
- **Triggers**: Positional changes, head movements, standing, anxiety, or none [^111R64Nm].
- **Associated symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, focal neurologic deficits, chest pain, palpitations, or syncope [^111R64Nm].
- **Medication use**: Antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, sedatives, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or alcohol [^notfound].
- **Past medical history**: Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, migraine, or psychiatric disorders [^notfound].

---

## Physical examination

The physical examination should include:

- **Vital signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate, orthostatic measurements [^116pTeU9].
- **Head and neck examination**: Otoscopy, cranial nerve assessment, and neck range of motion [^116y9XcM].
- **Neurologic examination**: Coordination, gait, Romberg test, and focal deficits [^112d3ESn].
- **Vestibular tests**: Dix-Hallpike maneuver for BPPV, head impulse test, nystagmus assessment, and test of skew (HINTS) [^114FPKMQ] [^114ybb7W].

---

## Diagnostic approach

The TiTrATE approach (**Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Examination**) is recommended:

| **Category** | **Timing** | **Triggers** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) | Hours to days | Continuous | - Vestibular neuritis <br/> - Stroke [^1128EUjR] |
| Spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome (s-EVS) | Minutes to hours | None | - Vestibular migraine <br/> - TIA [^1145UgUC] |
| Triggered episodic vestibular syndrome (t-EVS) | Seconds | Positional | - BPPV <br/> - Orthostatic hypotension [^1145UgUC] |

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- **Acute neurologic deficits**: Hemiparesis, ataxia, dysarthria, or altered mental status [^notfound].
- **Head or neck pain**: Suggests vertebral artery dissection or subarachnoid hemorrhage [^notfound].
- **Focal neurologic findings**: Cranial nerve deficits or hemiplegia [^notfound].
- **Sudden severe vertigo**: Persistent and nonpositional [^111R64Nm].
- **Nonpositional symptoms**: Suggest central causes [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic tests and imaging

Routine laboratory tests are generally not indicated unless suggested by history or examination [^1132xzrG]. Imaging is not routine; **MRI with DWI** is preferred when stroke is suspected or HINTS is equivocal, whereas CT is reserved for emergencies when MRI is unavailable [^1128EUjR] [^1158bJLk]. Audiometry is indicated for suspected Meniere's disease or sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116baGoQ] [^1122s78U].

## Common causes of dizziness and their management

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) | - Brief <br/> - Positional vertigo <br/> - Nystagmus [^113gmNgZ] | - Canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley) <br/> - Vestibular rehabilitation [^111RLEWr] [^113LTu4A] |
| Vestibular neuritis | - Acute <br/> - Continuous vertigo <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Unilateral vestibular loss [^114Jobje] | - Vestibular suppressants <br/> - Vestibular rehabilitation [^1132xzrG] |
| Meniere's disease | - Episodic vertigo <br/> - Hearing loss <br/> - Tinnitus <br/> - Aural fullness [^115VBww4] | - Salt restriction <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Vestibular rehabilitation [^113teZZ9] |
| Vestibular migraine | - Episodic vertigo <br/> - Migraine history <br/> - Photophobia <br/> - Phonophobia [^116baGoQ] | - Migraine prophylaxis <br/> - Lifestyle modifications [^notfound] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | - Lightheadedness on standing <br/> - Drop in BP [^116pTeU9] | - Volume expansion <br/> - Medication adjustment <br/> - Compression stockings [^notfound] |
| Stroke | - Acute <br/> - Continuous vertigo <br/> - Neurologic deficits [^1145UgUC] | - Immediate stroke protocol <br/> - Thrombolysis <br/> - Anticoagulation [^1145UgUC] |

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Follow-up should reassess symptoms within one month and address persistent dizziness or treatment failure [^111Ar3eC]. Patient education should explain the diagnosis, expected course, and warning signs that require urgent care, and patients with BPPV or balance disorders should receive **fall-prevention counseling** [^notfound].

Diagnostic approach to the acutely dizzy patient — adult emergency department patients are triaged through a three-step flowchart with explicit branch actions. Step 1 asks "Initial exam shows obvious neurologic findings?"; if yes, "Initiate local acute STROKE protocol", if no, proceed to Step 2. Step 2 asks "Clinical evaluation suggests a non-neurologic general medical cause?"; a yes branch directs "Evaluate & treat presumed diagnosis or diagnoses", while a no branch proceeds to Step 3. Step 3 asks "Has the dizziness been continuously present & persists at time of evaluation?"; a yes branch (AVS, acute vestibular syndrome) directs "Use physical exam to distinguish vestibular neuritis from stroke". If no, assess "Is the dizziness triggerable?"; a yes branch (t-EVS, transient episodic vestibular syndrome) directs "Use physical exam to distinguish BPPV w/ CPPV & orthostatic hypotension", and a no branch (s-EVS, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome) directs "Use history to distinguish vestibular migraine from TIA". Acronyms are defined in the figure caption as "AVS, acute vestibular syndrome; BPPV, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; CPPV, central paroxysmal positional vertigo; s-EVS, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome; t-EVS, transient episodic vestibular syndrome; TIA, transient ischemic attack".

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113EtkmY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — falls risk and screening summarizes that symptomatic dizziness confers a 12-fold increase in the risk for falls and that among community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, 1 in 3 falls each year, with U.S. fall costs estimated to exceed $20 billion annually. Across studies of fall etiology, dizziness and vertigo were the primary etiology 13% of the time compared with balance and gait problems 17% and person-environment interactions 31%. In a geriatric referral series, 9% had undiagnosed BPPV and three-fourths of those with BPPV had fallen within the 3 months prior to referral. Accordingly, evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of BPPV should include an assessment of risk for falls, and elderly patients will be more statistically at risk for falls with BPPV. An initial falls risk screening might start with questions such as those suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015: (1) Have you had a fall in the past year? How many times? Were you injured? (2) Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? (3) Do you worry about falling? A positive response to questions such as these might then prompt the clinician to conduct a more detailed falls risk assessment or refer to a clinician who can use tools such as the Get Up and Go test, Tinetti Balance Assessment, Berg Balance Scale, or others.

### Clinical progress note: diagnostic approach to dizziness and vertigo [^1171j8NP]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common clinical presentation that incurs huge financial costs. It is frequently misdiagnosed due to a wide differential involving both benign (inner ear disease) and serious (stroke) disorders. Traditional frameworks that emphasize symptom quality (dizziness/lightheadedness/vertigo) lack diagnostic utility. This Clinical Progress Note reviews the literature on acute dizziness evaluation in adult patients and presents an evidence-based framework for hospitalists to diagnose the majority of undifferentiated dizzy patients at the bedside. Future research should assess the validity of this approach with hospitalists' ability to accurately diagnose dizzy patients, and its impact on patient care and healthcare outcomes.

### The assessment and management of the dizzy patient [^115eywpM]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

A significant number of individuals are affected by symptoms of dizziness. It is the most common complaint among patients over 75 years of age. A large number of these patients seek counsel from their physicians. It is imperative for the evaluating physician to obtain a thorough history and perform a complete physical exam. The proper diagnostic studies must also be obtained to confirm or rule out particular diagnoses. The physician should never assume that the dizziness is the result of normal aging prior to ruling out pathologic conditions.

### Vestibular assessment: a practical approach [^1141ejLA]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dizziness and ataxia: 2023 update [^112WUPD1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of a patient with dizziness or vertigo is complicated by a lack of standardized nomenclature, significant overlap in symptom descriptions, and the subjective nature of the patient's symptoms. Although dizziness is an imprecise term often used by patients to describe a feeling of being off-balance, in many cases dizziness can be subcategorized based on symptomatology as vertigo (false sense of motion or spinning), disequilibrium (imbalance with gait instability), presyncope (nearly fainting or blacking out), or lightheadedness (nonspecific). As such, current diagnostic paradigms focus on timing, triggers, and associated symptoms rather than subjective descriptions of dizziness type. Regardless, these factors complicate the selection of appropriate diagnostic imaging in patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo. This document serves to aid providers in this selection by using a framework of definable clinical variants. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Diagnostic paradigm and terminology — the traditional diagnostic paradigm, developed 50 years ago, based on symptom quality and asking the patient "What do you mean by dizzy?", suggests basing the differential diagnosis and clinical evaluation on the patient's description, but this paradigm was never properly validated, has significant methodological flaws, and does not reliably predict underlying causes; the Barany Society has developed formal international consensus criteria, terminology, and definitions for many vestibular disorders, and the writing committee has tried to use terms aligned with these consensus definitions that make sense to frontline clinicians.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^111YsUis]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

### Chronic dizziness: a practical approach [^112gaQvQ]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic dizziness pose a particular challenge to the clinician, partly because their symptoms correlate poorly with standard vestibular tests; so a 'test and think later' approach is likely to lead to diagnostic confusion rather than clarity. Rather, a meticulous clinical assessment is required. Here our approach to the chronic dizzy patient is described with an emphasis on treating the patient's symptoms.

STANDING algorithm for patients with dizziness, vertigo, or instability — structure, validation, and performance: The algorithm directs clinicians to examine for nystagmus and proceed via sequential steps "1: Is nystagmus present? 2: Nystagmus characteristics? 3: If HIT is indicated, what is the result? 4: Patient can stand/walk independently?", with action nodes including "Perform Head Impulse test", "Supine head roll test for hc-BPPV", and "Dix-Hallpike test for pc-BPPV", and terminal labels "Central cause of symptoms" and "Peripheral cause of symptoms". The protocol "has been internally and externally validated" and "is a focused physical examination aimed at differentiating central from peripheral causes of dizziness (and specifically making the diagnosis of pc- and hc-BPPV) in four steps", with step descriptions specifying nystagmus presence/characteristics, head impulse testing for spontaneous direction-fixed nystagmus, and final assessment of gait unsteadiness. Reported performance shows that the "sensitivity for identifying a central cause of the dizziness (mostly strokes) ranged from 93.4% to 100% and the specificities from 71.8% to 94.3%", it "does not include the test of skew (part of HINTS) or test of hearing (part of HINTS plus)", and "The average time needed for emergency physicians to perform the STANDING protocol is less than 3 min".

### Diagnosis of patients with acute dizziness [^113FFt1r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Using an algorithmic approach to acutely dizzy patients, physicians can often confidently make a specific diagnosis that leads to correct treatment and should reduce the misdiagnosis of cerebrovascular events. Emergency clinicians should try to become familiar with an approach that exploits timing and triggers as well as some basic "rules" of nystagmus. The gait should always be tested in all patients who might be discharged. Computed tomographic scans are unreliable to exclude posterior circulation stroke presenting as dizziness, and early MRI (within the first 72 hours) also misses 10% to 20% of these cases.

### A new diagnostic approach to the adult patient with acute dizziness [^113wqDst]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment.

Objective Of The Review

This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department.

Discussion

Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions.

Conclusions

The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.

### Dizziness in older persons at high risk of future hospitalization: prevalence, differences between those with and without dizziness, and effect of a proactive primary care intervention [^113sTjXS]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Stam et al. evaluated the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention for dizziness in older people who were consulting their general practitioner about dizziness. The intervention consisted of medication adjustment in cases of fall-risk-increasing drugs and/or stepped mental health care in cases of anxiety/depression, and/or exercise therapy in cases of impaired functional mobility, and the control group received usual care. The results showed no significant intervention effect on dizziness, and adherence to the multifactorial intervention was low, especially in participants eligible for more than one intervention. A qualitative study in primary care showed that older persons with chronic dizziness have needs that are not met by health care. Parry et al. found that unmet needs were targeted with a multidisciplinary and multifactorial assessment when fall risk, syncope, or dizziness were found in an initial screening. It is therefore important to always ask older vulnerable patients in primary care about dizziness, and to provide dizziness-specific assessment and individually tailored interventions based on the individual causes of dizziness in order to decrease the negative consequences of this frequent symptom.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^111YGjua]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Dizziness and disequilibrium — assessment in post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) should document symptom character, timing, and triggers, perform a targeted primary care vestibular assessment prior to referral, and include specified examination domains and functional testing, with referral to vestibular rehabilitation recommended once other causes are excluded. Dizziness and disequilibrium are common symptoms that individuals present with in the primary care settings and may be related to mTBI. In individuals with symptoms attributed to mTBI, a description and characterization of their dizziness, temporal pattern, and symptom-provoking activities provides valuable information in establishing a working differential diagnosis. Primary care assessment for vestibular disorders should be done before referring for further vestibular examination and rehabilitation, and observation and patient interview are key elements to guide care. Evaluation should include a thorough examination of neurologic function, orthostatics, vision, auditory, sensory, motor, cervical, and vestibular systems, and evaluation of functional activities should include sitting and standing balance and gait. Once the initial assessment is completed and other causes are eliminated, referral to a vestibular rehabilitation specialist is recommended for symptom management.

### Approach to acute dizziness / vertigo in the emergency department: selected controversies regarding specialty consultation [^1147u18n]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute dizziness and vertigo are common emergency department presentations (≈4% of annual visits) and sometimes, a life-threatening diagnosis like stroke is missed. Recent literature reviews the challenges in evaluation of these symptoms and offers guidelines for diagnostic approaches. Strong evidence indicates that when well-trained providers perform a high-quality bedside neurovestibular examination, accurate diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorders and stroke increases. However, it is less clear who can and should be performing these assessments on a routine basis. This article offers a focused debate for and against routine specialty consultation for patients with acute dizziness or vertigo in the emergency department as well as a potential path forward utilizing new portable technologies to quantify eye movements.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^111WGnuB]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This third Guideline for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE-3) from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine is on the topic adult patients with acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department (ED). A multidisciplinary guideline panel applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations regarding five questions for adult ED patients with acute dizziness of less than 2weeks' duration. The intended population is adults presenting to the ED with acute dizziness or vertigo. The panel derived 15 evidence-based recommendations based on the timing and triggers of the dizziness but recognizes that alternative diagnostic approaches exist, such as the STANDING protocol and nystagmus examination in combination with gait unsteadiness or the presence of vascular risk factors. As an overarching recommendation, (1) emergency clinicians should receive training in bedside physical examination techniques for patients with the acute vestibular syndrome (AVS; HINTS) and the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; Dix-Hallpike test and Epley maneuver). To help distinguish central from peripheral causes in patients with the AVS, we recommend: (2) use HINTS (for clinicians trained in its use) in patients with nystagmus, (3) use finger rub to further aid in excluding stroke in patients with nystagmus, (4) use severity of gait unsteadiness in patients without nystagmus, (5) do not use brain computed tomography (CT), (6) do not use routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a first-line test if a clinician trained in HINTS is available, and (7) use MRI as a confirmatory test in patients with central or equivocal HINTS examinations. In patients with the spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome: (8) search for symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia, (9) do not use CT, and (10) use CT angiography or MRI angiography if there is concern for transient ischemic attack. In patients with the triggered (positional) episodic vestibular syndrome, (11) use the Dix-Hallpike test to diagnose posterior canal BPPV (pc-BPPV), (12) do not use CT, and (13) do not use MRI routinely, unless atypical clinical features are present. In patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, (14) consider short-term steroids as a treatment option. In patients diagnosed with pc-BPPV, (15) treat with the Epley maneuver. It is clear that as of 2023, when applied in routine practice by emergency clinicians without special training, HINTS testing is inaccurate, partly due to use in the wrong patients and partly due to issues with its interpretation. Most emergency physicians have not received training in use of HINTS. As such, it is not standard of care, either in the legal sense of that term ("what the average physician would do in similar circumstances") or in the common parlance sense ("the standard action typically used by physicians in routine practice").

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^115VBww4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease — history and examination emphasize that the history and physical examination should evaluate for neurologic, neurotologic/otologic, oncologic, inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes, and clinicians should ask patients detailed questions about attack onset and duration (second, minutes, hours, or entire day) and concurrent otologic symptoms. Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while "dizziness" is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

### Postconcussion dizziness severity predicts daily step count during recovery among adolescent athletes [^116JjP8s]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physical activity (PA) after concussion is an important aspect of appropriate clinical management. However, symptoms or functional deficits may reduce patient propensity toward PA, thereby negatively affecting recovery. Our purpose was to examine whether postconcussion dizziness, total symptom severity, or postural stability predicts PA level in the 2 wk after initial evaluation.

Methods

We evaluated adolescent athletes within 14 d of concussion on assessments of symptoms, dizziness, and postural stability. Athletes were provided an activity monitor to track PA for 2 wk after the evaluation. Our primary outcome was step count (mean steps per day). Potential predictor variables included sex, Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) total symptom severity, individual PCSI ratings of dizziness and balance impairment, and postural stability assessments (single- and dual-task tandem gait, modified Balance Error Scoring System). To examine predictors of PA, we calculated correlation coefficients between steps per day and each potential predictor and included significantly correlated variables in a multivariable regression model.

Results

Participants were ages 12–18 yr (n = 35, 15.2 ± 1.7 yr, 49% female) and initially evaluated 7.3 ± 3.0 d after concussion. Upon univariable evaluation, PCSI dizziness rating (Pearson R = -0.49, P = 0.003) and sex (mean difference, 2449 steps per day; P = 0.05) were associated with steps per day. Within the multivariable regression analysis, PCSI dizziness rating (β = -1035; 95% confidence interval, -191 to -1880; P = 0.018), but not sex, predicted average steps per day in the 2 wk after initial evaluation.

Conclusions

Self-reported dizziness, but not overall symptom severity or postural stability, assessed within 14 d of concussion predicted daily step count in the subsequent 2 wk. Given the importance of PA for concussion recovery, treating acute postconcussion dizziness can potentially reduce a barrier to PA and improve recovery trajectories.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management [^113teZZ9]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common yet imprecise symptom. It was traditionally divided into four categories based on the patient's history: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and light-headedness. However, the distinction between these symptoms is of limited clinical usefulness. Patients have difficulty describing the quality of their symptoms but can more consistently identify the timing and triggers. Episodic vertigo triggered by head motion may be due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vertigo with unilateral hearing loss suggests Meniere disease. Episodic vertigo not associated with any trigger may be a symptom of vestibular neuritis. Evaluation focuses on determining whether the etiology is peripheral or central. Peripheral etiologies are usually benign. Central etiologies often require urgent treatment. The HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination can help distinguish peripheral from central etiologies. The physical examination includes orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Laboratory testing and imaging are not required and are usually not helpful. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be treated with a canalith repositioning procedure (e.g. Epley maneuver). Treatment of Meniere disease includes salt restriction and diuretics. Symptoms of vestibular neuritis are relieved with vestibular suppressant medications and vestibular rehabilitation.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Dix-Hallpike maneuver technique and sequence include counseling that vertigo should subside within 60 seconds and orienting the patient so the head can hang by about 20°. For right-ear testing, the examiner rotates the head 45° to the right and maintains the 45° head turn while quickly moving to the supine right-ear-down position and extending the neck approximately 20° below the horizontal plane as eye movements and symptoms are observed; if the initial right-side result is negative, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (steps 1–4) should then be repeated for the left side.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^117SLvEN]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vestibular disorders assessment

Expert recommendation. Routinely ask about dizziness symptoms, and undertake follow-up assessment as necessary to identify cardiovascular, neurological and/or vestibular causes (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Dizziness is a common complaint in older adults who fall, with different meanings between individuals, and often no single explanatory cause. Careful history taking is of particular importance. Presyncope and observable unsteadiness or ataxia may be present.
Additionally, the vestibular system has a key role in the control of posture and gait, and there is evidence of a high incidence of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular dysfunction in those presenting with falls. In younger adults, such disorders can often be identified in the clinical history by a reported sensation of vertigo with clear positional or motion-provoked triggers. Identifying cases of vestibular dysfunction is more challenging in older adults due to more variable symptoms.
Where vertigo is reported, positional tests should be used to identify cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from non-cases (e.g. Dix-Hallpike, Head Impulse Test); however, the sensitivity of case-finding algorithms based purely upon symptoms compared with screening with positional testing in older adults is unknown.

### Vertigo and dizziness in the emergency room [^1149WYQX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an update on diagnostic algorithms for differential diagnosis of acute vertigo and dizziness and swift identification of potentially harmful causes.

Recent Findings

About 25% of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness have a potentially life-threatening diagnosis, including stroke in 4–15%. Diagnostic work-up relies on the combination of symptom features (triggers, duration, history of vertigo/dizziness, accompanying symptoms) and a comprehensive vestibular, ocular motor, and balance exam. The latter includes head impulse, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, gaze-holding, smooth pursuit, skew deviation, and Romberg's test. Recent standardized diagnostic algorithms (e.g. HINTS, TriAGe+) suggest the combination of several elements to achieve a good diagnostic accuracy in differentiation of central and peripheral vestibular causes. Neuroimaging with MRI must be applied and interpreted with caution, as small strokes are frequently overlooked, especially in the acute setting (false-negative rate of up to 50%).

Summary

Diagnostic differentiation of acute vertigo and dizziness remains a complex task, which can be tackled by a structured clinical assessment focusing on symptom characteristics and constellations of ocular motor and vestibular findings. Specific challenges arise in cases of transient or atypical vestibular syndromes.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^114SbFtg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^1122s78U]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a health care provider. It is frequently but not universally accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 27 per 100,000 people annually, with about 66,000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with sudden hearing loss. It focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss in adult patients aged ≥ 18 years and primarily on those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Prompt recognition and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life. The guideline update is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with sudden hearing loss.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline update is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with sudden hearing loss and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, with particular emphasis on managing idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group recognized that patients enter the health care system with sudden hearing loss as a nonspecific primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of this guideline update address distinguishing sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss at the time of presentation with hearing loss. They also clarify the need to identify rare, nonidiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to help separate those patients from those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, who are the target population for the therapeutic interventions that make up the bulk of the guideline update. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, this guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Methods

Consistent with the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition" (Rosenfeld et al. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2013;148[1]:S1-S55), the guideline update group was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, radiology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and the prior clinical practice guideline on sudden hearing loss was reviewed in detail. Key Action Statements (KASs) were updated with new literature, and evidence profiles were brought up to the current standard. Research needs identified in the original clinical practice guideline and data addressing them were reviewed. Current research needs were identified and delineated.

Results

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following: (KAS 1) Clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss. (KAS 7) Clinicians should educate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy. (KAS 13) Clinicians should counsel patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus about the possible benefits of audiologic rehabilitation and other supportive measures. These strong recommendations were modified from the initial clinical practice guideline for clarity and timing of intervention. The guideline update group made strong recommendations against the following: (KAS 3) Clinicians should not order routine computed tomography of the head in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 5) Clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory tests in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 11) Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or vasoactive substances to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following: (KAS 2) Clinicians should assess patients with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss through history and physical examination for bilateral sudden hearing loss, recurrent episodes of sudden hearing loss, and/or focal neurologic findings. (KAS 4) In patients with sudden hearing loss, clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 6) Clinicians should evaluate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining magnetic resonance imaging or auditory brainstem response. (KAS 10) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, intratympanic steroid therapy when patients have incomplete recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss 2 to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. (KAS 12) Clinicians should obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss at the conclusion of treatment and within 6 months of completion of treatment. These recommendations were clarified in terms of timing of intervention and audiometry and method of retrocochlear workup. The guideline update group offered the following KASs as options: (KAS 8) Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss within 2 weeks of symptom onset. (KAS 9a) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy within 2 weeks of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 9b) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, and differences of opinion Included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials Highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence Clarification of terminology by changing potentially unclear statements; use of the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that > 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and to avoid confusion in nomenclature for the reader Changes to the KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1-When a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural. KAS 2-The utility of history and physical examination when assessing for modifying factors is emphasized. KAS 3-The word "routine" is added to clarify that this statement addresses nontargeted head computerized tomography scan that is often ordered in the emergency room setting for patients presenting with sudden hearing loss. It does not refer to targeted scans, such as temporal bone computerized tomography scan, to assess for temporal bone pathology. KAS 4-The importance of audiometric confirmation of hearing status as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 5-New studies were added to confirm the lack of benefit of nontargeted laboratory testing in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 6-Audiometric follow-up is excluded as a reasonable workup for retrocochlear pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, and, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation are the modalities recommended. A time frame for such testing is not specified, nor is it specified which clinician should be ordering this workup; however, it is implied that it would be the general or subspecialty otolaryngologist. KAS 7-The importance of shared decision making is highlighted, and salient points are emphasized. KAS 8-The option for corticosteroid intervention within 2 weeks of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 9-Changed to KAS 9A and 9B. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains an option but only when combined with steroid therapy for either initial treatment (9A) or salvage therapy (9B). The timing of initial therapy is within 2 weeks of onset, and that of salvage therapy is within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 10-Intratympanic steroid therapy for salvage is recommended within 2 to 6 weeks following onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The time to treatment is defined and emphasized. KAS 11-Antioxidants were removed from the list of interventions that the clinical practice guideline recommends against using. KAS 12-Follow-up audiometry at conclusion of treatment and also within 6 months posttreatment is added. KAS 13-This statement on audiologic rehabilitation includes patients who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus who may benefit from treatment. Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs Enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making with tools provided to assist in same.

### Acute vestibular syndrome and ER presentations of dizziness [^114Jobje]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) describes sudden onset, severe, continuous dizziness that persists for more than 24 hours. Its wide differential presents a diagnostic challenge. Vestibular neuritis is the most common cause, but stroke, trauma, medication effects, infectious, and inflammatory causes all present similarly. The TiTrATE model (Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Exam) is systematic way to evaluate these patients, and the HINTS Plus exam (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew, plus hearing loss) is critical in differentiating central and peripheral causes. The importance of recognizing risk factors for stroke and the role of imaging is also discussed.

### Clinical techniques and technology: vestibular telemetry [^117EfRjg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

When a patient presents to a clinician with dizziness, it can be difficult for the patient to describe their symptoms in a clear manner, and clinical examination often yields entirely normal results. Ideally, it would be favorable to measure key physiological parameters during their episodes of dizziness. From a clinical perspective, this would allow a more timely and more accurate diagnosis. From a research perspective, it would allow a greater understanding of how the vestibular system malfunctions as a consequence of vestibular disease. The authors of this report have been funded by the UK Medical Research Council to develop and test a novel technology to measure, record, and analyze key physiological parameters provided by the dizzy individual during an episode of dizziness while active in the community. We provide the context to evolving work in this field, the outcome of preliminary studies, and a consideration of future opportunities.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113GzaMa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Vestibular testing in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, with recommendation against vestibular testing based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and level of confidence is Medium; benefits include facilitating timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses, avoiding patient discomfort from nausea and vomiting from vestibular testing, and reduced costs from unnecessary testing; risks/harms/costs are noted as none; benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; the policy level is recommendation against; and exceptions are patients who have separate indications for vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. The diagnosis of BPPV is based on the clinical history and physical examination with a positive result on the Dix-Hallpike test, which can be accomplished by a trained clinician without specialized testing equipment, and an appropriate CRP can be implemented immediately. Comprehensive vestibular testing is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV, and this does not imply that the use of video-oculographic technology with or without recording should not be used when available to help in identification and differentiation of types of BPPV. Comprehensive vestibular testing may have a role if the clinical presentation is atypical, if Dix-Hallpike testing is equivocal or shows unusual nystagmus, if the diagnosis is unclear, or if additional symptoms aside from those attributable to BPPV are present. In a retrospective chart review of 100 consecutive patients referred for vestibular assessment, a 9% reduction in referrals for specialized testing could be realized if the initial provider obtained a thorough case history and completed a Dix-Hallpike test, and among complex patients referred for subspecialty evaluation of BPPV, atypical or unclear nystagmus findings may approach 13% among patients with diagnoses suspicious for BPPV.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^114UvFpU]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Acute dizziness and vertigo — diagnostic challenges and guideline objective are underscored by evidence that emergency clinicians missed over a third of strokes presenting with dizziness (16 of 46 validated stroke or TIA cases were missed in the ED), that emergency clinicians harbor misconceptions about how nystagmus informs the diagnostic process, and that when nystagmus is documented by front-line providers the descriptions are often inconsistent with the recorded diagnoses, with a clinical trial finding that nystagmus descriptions by emergency clinicians frequently did not match eye movements recorded contemporaneously in the ED by portable VOG; accordingly, the objective of this guideline is to provide an evidence-based framework intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in decisions about the evaluation and management of adult ED patients with acute dizziness who do not have an obvious central cause with frank neurological findings or an obvious general medical one.

Conclusion

Initial OH is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years or older, particularly when measured continuously, highlighting the need to screen and diagnose initial OH. Future research should investigate whether the inclusion of symptoms in the definition of initial OH is clinically relevant. Furthermore, there is a need to establish a consensus on the diagnosis of initial OH using continuous blood pressure devices to consistently identify participants with initial OH.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113gmNgZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline — diagnosis and testing: Clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and the maneuver should be repeated with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative (Strong recommendation). If the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus, the clinician should perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV (Recommendation). Clinicians should differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo (Recommendation). Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging (Recommendation (against)), and clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing (Recommendation (against)).

Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) — FOR: Diagnosis using HINTS testing to distinguish a peripheral vestibular disorder (usually vestibular neuritis) from a central one (usually stroke) by an appropriately trained clinician. If examination confirms a peripheral disorder, then treat accordingly; no imaging required. If examination suggests stroke or a central cause, obtain confirmatory magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion‑weighted images [MRI‑DWI] and/or consult neurology. NEXT BEST: MRI‑DWI if no one qualified in using the HINTS examination is readily available. AGAINST: CT with or without CT angiography (CTA)/CT cerebral perfusion analysis (CTP).

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the Evaluation and management of Patients with syncope: executive Summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116pTeU9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic syndromes — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^1151nByK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — clinical follow-up, vertigo control, hearing loss, and quality of life (QOL) assessment are outlined as follows: One of the major goals of therapy is adequate control of vertigo. Follow-up to determine a patient's level of control of vertigo with current therapy allows for changes in therapy if control is inadequate or potential reduction in therapy if patients have complete vertigo control. Hearing loss is another variable component of MD, although in most cases it progresses with longer duration of disease, and hearing impairment can be divided into low frequency, mostly prominent in early stages, and high frequency, which can manifest in later stages of the disease process; audiometric testing is an important component of follow-up to inform further therapeutic or rehabilitative options. Determination of adequate follow-up for MD is dependent on the severity and progression of the disease, and if vertigo is not adequately controlled, if hearing loss is progressive, or if the patient is experiencing more frequent drop attacks, there may be alternate therapeutic options. Patients with severe or progressive disease should have more frequent follow-up, but those who have stabilized or have fewer disabling symptoms may not require it as frequently. Utilizing baseline assessment and frequent follow-up in the early stages of the disease will allow for accurate and effective therapy, including, but not limited to, aural/vestibular rehabilitation, and a questionnaire that establishes a baseline assessment to outline patient needs may help dictate the long-term surveillance schedule that will afford the patient and physician the best opportunity to optimize outcome. Measurement of QOL before and after therapeutic interventions can provide a valuable tool for evaluation of long-term effect and outcome data development, and the CPG currently does not recommend a specific QOL measure over another; rather, this CPG recommends that the provider use a measure that will lead to a consistent evaluation of the MD patient.

### Dizziness: state of the science [^115tXFhD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dizziness is prevalent in all adult populations, causing considerable morbidity and utilization of health services. In the community, the prevalence of dizziness ranges from 1.8% in young adults to more than 30% in the elderly. In the primary care setting, dizziness increases in frequency as a presenting complaint; as many as 7% of elderly patients present with this symptom. Classification of dizziness by subtype (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and other) assists in the differential diagnosis. Various disease entities may cause dizziness, and the reported frequency of specific diagnoses varies widely, depending on setting, patient age, and investigator bias. Life-threatening illnesses are rare in patients with dizziness, but many have serious functional impairment. Dizziness can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in elderly persons, in whom it often represents dysfunction in more than one body system. Given the relatively underdeveloped state of the empirical literature on dizziness, investigators would benefit from use of consistent criteria to describe dizziness symptoms and establish diagnoses. Investigation of the effects of testing and treatment should focus on diagnoses that are life threatening or lead to significant morbidity. In the elderly, a function-oriented approach should be studied and compared with current diagnosis-focused strategies. Alternative therapies for chronic and recurrent dizziness also merit investigation.

The diagnosis and management of vertigo remains a challenge for clinicians, including general neurology. In recent years there have been advances in the understanding of established vestibular syndromes, and the development of treatments for existing vestibular diagnoses. In this 'update' I will review how our understanding of previously "unexplained" dizziness in the elderly is changing, explore novel insights into the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine, and its relationship to the newly coined term 'persistent postural perceptual dizziness', and finally discuss how a simple bedside oculomotor assessment may help identify vestibular presentations of stroke.

Recently, the Academy of Emergency Medicine published the GRACE-3 guidelines for the management of acute dizziness and vertigo in the ED. These guidelines cover the dizzy patient who presents within 2 weeks of symptom onset, regardless of whether symptoms are consistent with AVS or EVS. Because this article is more directed at the outpatient provider, we would like to briefly touch on when to suspect stroke or TIA when patients present to clinic > 2 weeks after symptom onset.

Importantly, the outpatient clinician should be aware that for acutely dizzy patients, MRI is estimated to miss 15–20% of acute posterior fossa ischemic strokes up to 48 ​h after symptom onset. Therefore, if suspicion for a stroke is high and an MRI brain was performed < 48 ​h after symptom onset, a repeat MRI should be considered. As a result of this lack of sensitivity of MRI early on, the HINTS examination was first described in 2009, where a 3-step bedside test was found to have higher sensitivity early on in patients with the AVS. For a peripheral vestibular disorder (i.e. vestibular neuritis) to be diagnosed, the following findings must be present: an abnormal (ipsilesional) head impulse test, unidirectional (contralesional) horizontal or horizontal-torsional nystagmus, and a negative test of skew. Any other pattern must be considered central until proven otherwise. A few years later, HINTS was addended to include a test of hearing, now known as HINTS plus. Because the labyrinthine artery is a branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), an AICA stroke can present with unilateral hearing loss. Thus, if a patient presents with a peripheral HINTS exam and hearing loss (with normal otoscopy), this is suggestive of an AICA or labyrinthine artery stroke, and a cerebrovascular event should be assumed. For the clinician seeing these patients weeks to months later, if a patient has had no loss of hearing and a clearly documented HINTS exam that is consistent with a peripheral lesion, and a patient is recovering as expected, then no MRI is indicated. The diagnostic criteria for vestibular neuritis includes an acute onset of vertigo lasting at least 24 ​h, a peripheral HINTS examination, an absence of otologic or neurologic symptoms, and it is not better accounted for by another condition. Patients will slowly improve over time, however that time varies quite a bit and can occur over days to months. If there are any atypical historical features (e.g. focal neurological deficits) or examination findings, a contrast-enhanced MRI with internal auditory canal protocol is indicated, which evaluates for central and peripheral structural lesions such as a vestibular schwannoma.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^115PGVeH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline scope and outcomes — the guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV in any setting, targets patients aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV, and identifies the primary outcome as resolution of BPPV symptoms; secondary outcomes include increased accurate diagnoses, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduced recurrence, reduced adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV, and other outcomes such as minimizing costs, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing health-related quality of life.

### Exploring vestibular assessment in patients with headache and dizziness [^1178KypC]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients often report symptoms of headache and dizziness concomitantly. Symptoms of dizziness can be explored with a comprehensive vestibular assessment, allowing for the investigation of central and peripheral vestibular system contributions to symptoms of dizziness. Patients who report both symptoms of headache and dizziness demonstrate abnormalities of the vestibular system which can be measured quantitatively. Completion of comprehensive vestibular testing can help to guide diagnosis and strategies for intervention.

### Abstract… [^113kyVtK]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

General Approach Questions regarding the timing and triggers that provoke dizziness can categorize the dizziness as more likely to be peripheral or central in etiology. Findings from the physical examination can help confirm a probable diagnosis. A diagnostic algorithm can help determine whether the etiology is peripheral or central. TITRATE THE EVALUATION TiTrATE is a novel diagnostic approach to determining the probable etiology of dizziness or vertigo. 2 The approach uses the Timing of the symptom, the Triggers that provoke the symptom, And a Targeted Examination. The responses place the dizziness into one of three clinical scenarios: episodic triggered, spontaneous episodic, or continuous vestibular. With spontaneous episodic symptoms, patients have episodes of dizziness lasting seconds to days.

Because these episodes have no trigger, the patient's history establishes the diagnosis. Common diagnostic considerations for spontaneous episodic symptoms include Meniere disease, vestibular migraine, and psychiatric diagnoses such as anxiety disorders. Symptoms associated with lying down are more likely vestibular. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Findings from the physical examination — including a cardiac and neurologic assessment, with attention to the head, eye, ear, nose, and throat examination — are usually normal in patients presenting with dizziness. Blood pressure should be measured while the patient is standing and in the supine position. LABORATORY TESTING AND IMAGING Most patients presenting with dizziness do not require laboratory testing. Patients with chronic medical conditions may require blood glucose and electrolyte measurements.

Patients with symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should undergo electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, and possibly carotid Doppler testing. However, in a summary analysis of multiple studies that included 4, 538 patients, only 26 had a laboratory result that explained their dizziness. Treatment of BPPV consists of a canalith repositioning procedure such as the Epley maneuver, which repositions the canalith from the semicircular canal into the vestibule. The diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine include at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity lasting five minutes to 72 hours; current or previous history of migraine headache; one or more migraine features, and at least 50% with vestibular symptoms; and no other cause of vestibular symptoms. 51.

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management… [^116baGoQ]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

General Approach Questions regarding the timing and triggers that provoke dizziness can categorize the dizziness as more likely to be peripheral or central in etiology. Findings from the physical examination can help confirm a probable diagnosis. A diagnostic algorithm can help determine whether the etiology is peripheral or central. TITRATE THE EVALUATION TiTrATE is a novel diagnostic approach to determining the probable etiology of dizziness or vertigo. 2 The approach uses the Timing of the symptom, the Triggers that provoke the symptom, And a Targeted Examination. The responses place the dizziness into one of three clinical scenarios: episodic triggered, spontaneous episodic, or continuous vestibular. If vertigo is described, physicians should ask about hearing loss, which could suggest Meniere disease.

10 Diagnostic criteria for Meniere disease include episodic vertigo associated with documented low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss by audiometric testing in the affected ear and tinnitus or aural fullness in the affected ear. 10 The auditory symptoms are initially unilateral. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Findings from the physical examination — including a cardiac and neurologic assessment, with attention to the head, eye, ear, nose, and throat examination — are usually normal in patients presenting with dizziness. Blood pressure should be measured while the patient is standing and in the supine position. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed. Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy. 18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway.

The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. Treatment of BPPV consists of a canalith repositioning procedure such as the Epley maneuver, which repositions the canalith from the semicircular canal into the vestibule. The diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine include at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity lasting five minutes to 72 hours; current or previous history of migraine headache; one or more migraine features, and at least 50% with vestibular symptoms; and no other cause of vestibular symptoms. 51.
