## Question

What are the most effective antibiotic regimens for treating Enterococcus faecalis infections in immunocompromised patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic regimens are most effective for treating Enterococcus faecalis infections in immunocompromised patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification in immunocompromised hosts. Then, I should verify the pathogen's intrinsic resistance patterns and how they differ from E. faecium. Next, I will review site-specific syndromes and their empiric and definitive regimens, including endocarditis, bacteremia, intra-abdominal infections, and urinary tract infections. After that, I need to check dosing, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic optimization, and duration. Finally, I should consider special populations, stewardship, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification. Immunocompromised patients include those with hematologic malignancy, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, corticosteroid therapy, and advanced HIV, and they are at higher risk for invasive enterococcal disease, polymicrobial bacteremia, and treatment failure, so I need to ensure early source control and ID consultation whenever feasible [^116tv4gP]. Hold on, I should verify the mortality signal with VRE: vancomycin resistance independently predicts higher mortality in enterococcal bacteremia, and early effective therapy within 48 hours improves survival, which reinforces the need for timely, active regimens in this population [^115YecQf].

> Next, I should review the pathogen profile. E. faecalis remains largely ampicillin-susceptible, though rare β-lactamase–producing strains occur; intrinsic penicillin resistance is uncommon in E. faecalis but common in E. faecium, and high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) is clinically important because it abrogates classic synergy with β-lactams, so I need to check HLAR status early to guide therapy [^112hXKbw] [^111wMajc]. Wait, let me verify the VRE distinction: most VRE are E. faecium, and E. faecalis VRE is relatively uncommon, which matters when I choose empiric coverage and avoid overcalling VRE risk in E. faecalis infections [^111pWX1m].

> I will now examine infective endocarditis due to E. faecalis, since this is the highest-stakes scenario. The preferred regimen is high-dose ampicillin or amoxicillin plus ceftriaxone for 6 weeks, which achieves synergy without aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity and works irrespective of HLAR status; typical adult dosing is ampicillin 12 g/day IV in 4–6 divided doses plus ceftriaxone 4 g/day IV in 2 doses, and I should confirm that this is endorsed by contemporary guidelines and supported by observational data showing similar cure and less nephrotoxicity than gentamicin-containing regimens [^111La9pf] [^11154Tbp] [^113B6CAu]. Hold on, I should verify the alternative: ampicillin or penicillin G plus gentamicin for 4–6 weeks is still acceptable if HLAR is absent and renal function permits, with duration shortened to 4 weeks for native valve disease if symptoms are less than 3 months, but I must monitor gentamicin closely for nephrotoxicity and avoid prolonged aminoglycoside courses when risk is high [^1158WWn5] [^113yxx9w]. But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate β-lactams? Then vancomycin-based therapy is reasonable, though less preferred for E. faecalis, and I should remember that vancomycin plus gentamicin is an option in penicillin-resistant strains or when β-lactams are contraindicated [^113pY2Jf] [^112emJsN].

> Let me consider bacteremia without endocarditis. Ampicillin remains first-line for E. faecalis bacteremia when susceptible, and I should obtain an echocardiogram to exclude endocarditis in all enterococcal bacteremias, especially in immunocompromised hosts, because missing endocarditis changes duration and regimen selection [^116tv4gP]. I should double-check the role of combination therapy: for high-inoculum or persistent bacteremia, adding gentamicin or ceftriaxone to ampicillin can be considered to enhance killing, but I need to weigh nephrotoxicity risks and tailor to MICs and clinical response; synergy testing may help in select cases, though evidence is evolving [^112G9atf]. If HLAR is present or aminoglycosides are unsafe, ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is a reasonable combination strategy based on endocarditis data extrapolated to bacteremia, with close follow-up for clearance [^111La9pf].

> Now, intra-abdominal infections. I need to ensure empiric anti-enterococcal coverage in immunocompromised patients with severe or healthcare-associated intra-abdominal infection, particularly when prior cephalosporins or broad-spectrum agents were used, because E. faecalis is more likely to be pathogenic in this setting and inadequate initial therapy worsens outcomes [^115TxeUH] [^112KMBcx]. Let me verify regimens: piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam provide enterococcal coverage; if using a cephalosporin-based regimen without enterococcal activity, I should add ampicillin or vancomycin empirically, and then de-escalate to ampicillin monotherapy once E. faecalis is confirmed susceptible [^116tnpB2] [^113vdGp9]. Hold on, I should confirm duration: after adequate source control, 7–10 days is typical, extending if response is slow or if prosthetic material is present, and in critically ill patients I should use extended or continuous infusion of β-lactams to optimize PK/PD targets [^115TxeUH].

> For urinary tract infections, I should confirm that E. faecalis is a common uropathogen and that ampicillin is usually active. For uncomplicated cystitis, oral amoxicillin or nitrofurantoin are reasonable if susceptible; for complicated pyelonephritis, IV ampicillin is preferred, with vancomycin or high-dose daptomycin if ampicillin-resistant, and I should remember that fluoroquinolones have labeled activity for E. faecalis UTIs but local resistance may limit reliability, so I need to check susceptibilities before relying on them [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify duration: uncomplicated cystitis is typically 5–7 days, while complicated pyelonephritis generally requires 10–14 days, with longer courses if there is obstruction or abscess that delays source control [^notfound].

> Next, I should review dosing and PK/PD optimization. For high-inoculum infections or sepsis, extended or continuous infusion of β-lactams improves time above MIC and is recommended in critical illness; I need to ensure appropriate loading doses and adjust for renal function, especially for vancomycin and aminoglycosides, to minimize toxicity while maintaining efficacy [^115TxeUH]. I should double-check gentamicin targets: peak 3–4 μg/mL and trough less than 1 μg/mL in patients with normal renal function, and I must reassess frequently in immunocompromised patients who are prone to nephrotoxicity and volume shifts [^115mBRpX].

> I will now examine special populations and stewardship. In neutropenia, monotherapy with high-dose daptomycin or linezolid may be necessary for VRE, but I should confirm MICs and consider combination strategies if bacteremia persists; in liver transplant recipients, VRE risk and mortality are high, so early effective therapy and ID input are critical [^111g5roc] [^1167Pw54] [^111i9v4d]. Let me reconsider the VRE breakpoint issue: CLSI revised daptomycin breakpoints for enterococci, establishing MIC ≤ 2 μg/mL as susceptible for E. faecalis at 6 mg/kg/day, with higher MICs prompting consideration of higher doses and combination therapy, and EUCAST cautions that PK/PD target attainment can be challenging at the high end of MIC ranges, so I should verify MICs and consult ID when MICs are borderline [^112WWEx9] [^115M47hV]. For endocarditis, I should remember that partial oral therapy after clinical stability is noninferior to continued IV therapy in selected patients, which can facilitate earlier discharge in immunocompromised hosts once criteria are met [^1152W5uJ] [^115zkTWG].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall I almost made: I initially thought vancomycin might be a first-line alternative to ampicillin for E. faecalis endocarditis when β-lactams are tolerated, but that overstates vancomycin's role; vancomycin is less preferred for E. faecalis and is generally reserved for β-lactam intolerance or resistance, with double β-lactam therapy preferred when HLAR is present, so I need to correct that inclination and prioritize ampicillin-based regimens when active [^111La9pf] [^113pY2Jf] [^111dUa6A]. I also need to ensure I do not overuse tigecycline for bacteremia due to low serum levels, reserving it for select intra-abdominal scenarios when better options are unavailable [^114RCMHD].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm. If the syndrome is endocarditis, use ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for 6 weeks if β-lactams are tolerated; if not, consider vancomycin-based therapy with specialist input and plan for early surgical evaluation because surgery reduces relapse and mortality in EFIE [^111La9pf] [^111TfdX3]. If the syndrome is bacteremia without endocarditis, start ampicillin and add gentamicin or ceftriaxone for persistent or high-inoculum disease, obtain an echocardiogram, and tailor duration to whether endocarditis is excluded and how quickly bacteremia clears [^116tv4gP]. If the syndrome is intra-abdominal infection, include anti-enterococcal coverage empirically in immunocompromised or high-risk patients, then de-escalate to ampicillin monotherapy for E. faecalis when susceptible, ensuring source control and appropriate duration [^115TxeUH] [^113vdGp9]. If the syndrome is UTI, use ampicillin or amoxicillin when susceptible, reserving vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid for resistant organisms, and adjust duration to complexity and response [^notfound]. Throughout, I should confirm susceptibilities including HLAR, monitor for nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides or vancomycin, and engage ID early to navigate resistance and optimize outcomes in this vulnerable population [^116tv4gP] [^113PvUjZ].

The most effective antibiotic regimens for Enterococcus faecalis infections in immunocompromised patients are **ampicillin or amoxicillin as first-line therapy** [^111La9pf] when the isolate is susceptible, given their superior activity and safety [^notfound]. For high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains or when nephrotoxicity is a concern, **ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is preferred** [^114p85eN] because it provides synergistic activity [^1143Q2zp] with lower nephrotoxicity than gentamicin-containing regimens [^113B6CAu]. Vancomycin is reserved for **β-lactam allergy or intolerance** [^113pY2Jf], and linezolid or daptomycin are alternatives for multidrug-resistant or vancomycin-resistant isolates [^111pWX1m]. Therapy should be individualized based on susceptibilities, clinical syndrome, and patient factors, with early ID consultation and close monitoring for adverse effects and response [^116tv4gP].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

### β-lactam antibiotics

- **Ampicillin or amoxicillin**: First-line for E. faecalis due to consistent susceptibility and favorable safety [^111La9pf]; ampicillin 12 g/day IV in 4–6 divided doses or amoxicillin 200 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 divided doses [^111La9pf].

- **Penicillin G**: Alternative to ampicillin/amoxicillin; 18–30 million units/day IV continuously or in 6 divided doses [^1158WWn5].

- **Duration**: 4–6 weeks for native valve endocarditis; 6 weeks for prosthetic valve endocarditis or persistent infection [^113yxx9w].

---

## Combination therapy for severe infections

### Ampicillin or amoxicillin plus gentamicin

- **Rationale**: Synergistic bactericidal activity via cell wall inhibition plus ribosomal disruption [^111vcQys].

- **Regimen**: Ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours plus gentamicin 3 mg/kg/day IV in 2–3 divided doses for 4–6 weeks [^1158WWn5].

- **Limitations**: Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, especially in immunocompromised patients; monitor renal function and drug levels closely [^115mBRpX].

---

### Ampicillin or amoxicillin plus ceftriaxone

- **Rationale**: Synergistic activity via different β-lactam targets; effective in HLAR strains and with lower nephrotoxicity than gentamicin [^1143Q2zp].

- **Regimen**: Ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours for 6 weeks [^1158WWn5].

- **Evidence**: Comparable efficacy to ampicillin–gentamicin with significantly less nephrotoxicity [^11154Tbp] [^113B6CAu].

---

## Alternative therapy for β-lactam allergy or intolerance

### Vancomycin

Vancomycin is indicated for **β-lactam allergy or intolerance** [^113pY2Jf]; the dose is 30 mg/kg/day IV in 2 divided doses for 4–6 weeks. Limitations include nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity; monitor renal function and drug levels [^117Dqssm].

---

## Therapy for multidrug-resistant or vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis

### Linezolid

Linezolid is indicated for **MDR or VRE infections** [^111pWX1m]; the dose is 600 mg IV or orally every 12 hours for ≥ 6 weeks. Limitations include myelosuppression, neuropathy, and serotonin syndrome; monitor blood counts and drug interactions [^1177CRNL].

---

### Daptomycin

Daptomycin is indicated for **MDR or VRE infections** [^111pWX1m]; the dose is 10–12 mg/kg/day IV for ≥ 6 weeks. Limitations include the emergence of resistance and limited clinical data; monitor for adverse effects and resistance [^115M47hV].

---

## Clinical considerations in immunocompromised patients

- **Immunosuppression**: Increases risk of severe infection, relapse, and treatment failure; consider combination therapy and longer durations [^116tv4gP].

- **Drug interactions**: Immunosuppressive agents (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus) interact with antibiotics; monitor drug levels and adjust as needed [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for adverse effects, drug interactions, and clinical response is essential [^112emJsN].

## Summary of recommended regimens

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Susceptible E. faecalis infection | Ampicillin or amoxicillin | 4–6 weeks |
| Severe infection (e.g. endocarditis) | Ampicillin + gentamicin or ampicillin + ceftriaxone | 4–6 weeks |
| β-lactam allergy | Vancomycin | 4–6 weeks |
| MDR or VRE infection | Linezolid or daptomycin | ≥ 6 weeks |

---

The most effective antibiotic regimens for E. faecalis infections in immunocompromised patients are **ampicillin or amoxicillin as first-line therapy** [^111La9pf], with combination therapy (ampicillin plus gentamicin or ceftriaxone) for severe infections. Vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin are alternatives for resistant strains or β-lactam allergy [^111pWX1m]. Therapy should be individualized based on susceptibilities, clinical syndrome, and patient factors, with close monitoring for adverse effects and clinical response [^1158WWn5].

### A review of combination antimicrobial therapy for Enterococcus faecalis bloodstream infections and infective endocarditis [^117UXbiE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Enterococci, one of the most common causes of hospital-associated infections, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Enterococcus faecalis, the more common and virulent species, causes serious high-inoculum infections, namely infective endocarditis, that are associated with cardiac surgery and mortality rates that remained unchanged for the last 30 years. The best cures for these infections are observed with combination antibiotic therapy; however, optimal treatment has not been fully elucidated. It is the purpose of this review to highlight treatment options and their limitations, and provide direction for future investigative efforts to aid in the treatment of these severe infections. While ampicillin plus ceftriaxone has emerged as a preferred treatment option, mortality rates continue to be high, and from a safety standpoint, ceftriaxone, unlike other cephalosporins, promotes colonization with vancomycin resistant-enterococci due to high biliary concentrations. More research is needed to improve patient outcomes from this high-mortality disease.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant [^116ifcS7]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Effective prophylaxis against specific infections has allowed increasingly potent conditioning regimens to be given, thereby prolonging survival in HSCT recipients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with numerous professional societies, has recently published guidelines to codify and advance this approach. Controversy remains in several areas but, curiously, the most intense debate concerns prevention of bacterial infections, the most extensively studied of all of the approaches. Central to this debate are the competing priorities of a potentially ill patient on the one hand vs the long-term consequences of unchecked antibiotic use. The emergence in the 1990s of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus demonstrated all too vividly how devastating such an end result could be. This article will review the arguments for and against the routine use of antibacterial prophylaxis in HSCT recipients.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^115TxeUH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

### Advances in the therapy of bacterial bloodstream infections [^1154PJMP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Advances in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) have been achieved in the last years, improving clinical outcome. However, mortality associated with some pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp., is still high. In addition, the spread of antibiotic resistance, mainly among Gram-negative bacteria, reduces treatment options in some circumstances. Therefore, interest in new drugs, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules is rising.

Objectives

Our aim is to summarize the current evidence on available antibiotic regimens for patients with bacterial BSI, focusing on drug choice, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules. We selected bacteria that are difficult to manage because of virulence factors (i.e. methicillin-susceptible S. aureus), tolerance to antibiotic activity (i.e. Enterococcus faecalis), and/or susceptibility patterns (i.e. methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii).

Sources

MEDLINE search with English language and publication in the last 5 years as limits.

Content and Implications

The literature gaps on the use of new drugs, the uncertainties regarding the use of combination regimens, and the need to optimize dosing schedules in some circumstances (e.g. augmented renal clearance, renal replacement therapy, high inoculum BSI sources, and isolation of bacteria showing high MICs) have been revised.

### Revisiting the evidence base that informs the use of adjunctive therapy for Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113B6CAu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend adjunctive gentamicin for the treatment of Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) despite a risk of toxicity. We sought to revisit the evidence for adjunctive therapy in EFIE and to synthesize the comparative safety and effectiveness of aminoglycosides versus ceftriaxone by systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

For historical context, we reviewed seminal case series and in vitro studies on the evolution from penicillin monotherapy to modern-day regimens for EFIE. Next, we searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to 16 January 2024 for studies of EFIE that compared adjunctive aminoglycosides versus ceftriaxone or adjunctive versus monotherapy. Where possible, clinical outcomes were compared between regimens using random effects meta-analysis. Otherwise, data were narratively summarized.

Results

The meta-analysis was limited to 10 observational studies at high risk of bias (911 patients). Relative to adjunctive ceftriaxone, gentamicin had similar all-cause mortality (risk difference [RD], -0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.0 to 3.5), relapse (RD, -0.1%; 95% CI, -2.4 to 2.3), and treatment failure (RD, 1.1%; 95% CI, -1.6 to 3.7) but higher discontinuation due to toxicity (RD, 26.3%; 95% CI, 19.8 to 32.7). The 3 studies that compared adjunctive therapy to monotherapy included only 30 monotherapy patients, and heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis.

Conclusions

Adjunctive ceftriaxone appeared to be equally effective and less toxic than gentamicin for the treatment of EFIE. The existing evidence does not clearly establish the superiority of either adjunctive therapy or monotherapy. Pending randomized evidence, if adjunctive therapy is to be used, ceftriaxone appears to be a reasonable option.

### Management of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections [^114RCMHD]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterococci are organisms with a remarkable ability to adapt to the environment and acquire antibiotic resistance determinants. The evolution of antimicrobial resistance in these organisms poses enormous challenges for clinicians when faced with patients affected with severe infections. The increased prevalence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium worldwide has resulted in a major decrease in therapeutic options because the majority of E. faecium isolates are now resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, and exhibit high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, which are three of the traditionally most useful anti-enterococcal antibiotics. Newer antibiotics such as linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have good in vitro activity against enterococcal isolates, although their clinical use may be limited in certain clinical scenarios as a result of reduced rates of success, possible underdosing for enterococci and low serum levels, respectively, and also by the emergence of resistance. The experimental agent oritavancin may offer some hope for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci but clinical data are still lacking. Thus, optimal therapies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections continue to be based on empirical observations and extrapolations from in vitro and animal data. Clinical studies evaluating new strategies, including combination therapies, to treat severe vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections are urgently needed.

### How do I manage a patient with enterococcal bacteraemia? [^116tv4gP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Enterococcal bacteraemia (EB) is common, particularly in the nosocomial setting, and its management poses a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists.

Objectives

The aim was to summarize the more relevant features of EB and to provide a practical state-of-the-art on the topics that more directly affect its management.

Sources

Pubmed articles from inception to 31 May 2020.

Content

The following topics are covered: epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics and factors associated with prognosis of EB; diagnosis and work-up, including the use of echocardiography to rule out endocarditis; antibiotic management with special focus on antimicrobial resistance and complicated EB; and the role of infectious disease consultation and the use of bundles in EB. In addition, three clinical vignettes are presented to illustrate the practical application of the guidance provided, and major gaps in the current evidence supporting EB management are discussed.

Implications

EB is associated with large burdens of morbidity and mortality, particularly among fragile and immunosuppressed patients presenting complicated bacteraemia due to multidrug-resistant enterococci. Most cases of EB are caused by Enterococcus faecalis, followed by E. faecium. EB often presents as polymicrobial bacteraemia. Rapidly identifying patients at risk of EB is crucial for timely application of diagnostic techniques and empiric therapy. Early alert systems and rapid diagnostic techniques, such as matrix-assisted desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, especially if used together with infectious disease consultation within bundles, appear to improve management and prognosis of EB. Echocardiography is also key in the work-up of EB and should probably be more extensively used, although its exact indications in EB are still debated. Multidisciplinary approaches are warranted due to the complexity and severity of EB.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^116mKkkt]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis — aminoglycoside selection and alternatives: Streptomycin should be avoided in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (Class III; Level of Evidence B). If the strain of Enterococcus is susceptible both to gentamicin and streptomycin, it is reasonable to use gentamicin rather than streptomycin for therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). When gentamicin therapy is not an option, then a double-β-lactam regimen (see later section) is reasonable (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B).

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^113aZRxG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study is its multicentric and exhaustive aspect: inclusion of most hospitals, including all referral centers, in a large area; and the pragmatic approach for evaluation of treatment efficacy considering the antibiotic regimen really received by the patient. The limitations of this study are mainly inherent to its retrospective design, leading to missing data, significant proportion of patients lost to follow-up, and impossibility to fully control confounding factors in treatment effects despite multivariate analysis. The low number of relapses and of patients treated with amoxicillin alone leads to a lack of power in the analysis of treatment efficacy. The definition of acute kidney failure did not allow a reliable assessment of this complication. Finally, we did not evaluate the role of serum concentrations of antibiotics, which could be interesting to better understand the mechanisms of relapse.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^115mBRpX]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus endocarditis — aminoglycoside use and dosing: Approximately 97% of cases of enterococcal IE are caused by E faecalis, and in older, comorbid patients gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity may complicate a "standard" 4- to 6-week course; in some situations the potential risk of attempting to complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy may exceed the benefit. Human studies used dosing intervals ranging from once daily to 3 times daily, and the data were insufficient to compare the efficacy of once-daily with divided doses; until more convincing data demonstrate once-daily dosing is as effective, in patients with normal renal function, gentamicin should be administered in daily multiple divided doses (total, ≈3 mg·kg−1·d−1). In patients with normal renal function, it is reasonable to administer gentamicin every 8 hours with the dose adjusted to achieve a 1-hour serum concentration of ≈3 μg/mL and a trough concentration of < 1 μg/mL; increasing the dose did not enhance efficacy but did increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^115zPStC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Enterococcus

The use of antibiotic therapy for Enterococcus in IAI is controversial. Enterococcus can often be isolated from IAI, and is associated with increased risk of treatment failure and higher mortality. However, outcomes in these patients have shown to be independent of antibiotic coverage for enterococcus. Currently, the general consensus regarding enterococcal coverage is that community-acquired infections require no coverage, however ampicillin, or vancomycin should be added to cover the following high risk patient groups: 1) patients in septic shock who have received prolonged treatment with cephalosporins or other antibiotics that select for Enterococcus, 2) immunocompromised patients, 3) patients with prosthetic heart valves, or other intravascular prosthetic devices, or 4) patients with health care associated/recurrent intra-abdominal infection. Finally, vancomycin resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections occur in patients who are immunocompromised, previously colonized with VRE or treated with vancomycin. In these circumstances VRE should be suspected and treated with alternatives such as linezolid, tigecycline, or daptomycin. In the absence of these risk factors, specific coverage for VRE is not recommended.

Candida

Candida is similar to Enterococcus, in that isolation of Candida from intra-abdominal cultures is associated with increased mortality, but anti-fungal treatment has not been shown to alter this risk. Therefore, fungal coverage is unnecessary unless the patient is immunocompromised, has a severe IAI with Candida grown from intra-abdominal cultures, or has perforation of a gastric ulcer while on acid suppressive medications. Fluconazole is an appropriate initial choice for Candida albicans peritonitis. However, increasingly, non-albicans Candida spp. with resistance to commonly used anti-fungals are responsible for candidemia. Studies have shown that echinocandins are both safe and effective in the treatment of invasive candidiasis. Therefore, in critically ill patients echinocandins, such as caspofungin or echinofungin, should be considered for primary treatment. Required treatment duration for Candida peritonitis is 2–3 weeks.

### Daptomycin in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infections and endocarditis: a EUCAST position paper [^115M47hV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Scope

This position paper describes the view adopted by EUCAST on the role of daptomycin in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterococcus species.

Background

High-dose daptomycin is considered effective in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infection (BSI) and endocarditis, although published clinical experience with the latter condition is limited.

Methods

EUCAST reviewed the available published data on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD), resistance selection, clinical efficacy and safety for the use of 10–12 mg/kg/day of daptomycin for these conditions, noting that the doses licensed by the European Medicines Agency are only 4–6 mg/kg/day, and only for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

Findings and Recommendations

The PK-PD evidence shows that, even with doses of 10–12 mg/kg/day, it is not possible to treat infections caused by isolates at the upper end of the wild-type distributions of Enterococcus faecalis (with MICs of 4 mg/L) and E. faecium (with MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L). For this reason, and because there are ongoing issues with the reliability of laboratory testing, EUCAST lists daptomycin breakpoints for Enterococcus species as "IE"-insufficient evidence. EUCAST advises increased vigilance in the use of high-dose of daptomycin to treat enterococcal BSI and endocarditis. Additional PK-PD studies and prospective efficacy and safety studies of serious Enterococcal infections treated with high-dose daptomycin may permit the setting of breakpoints in the future.

In fact in critically ill patients the possibility that the normal flora may be modified and that the IAI could be caused by several unexpected pathogens and by more resistant flora must be considered. In these patients antimicrobial regimens with broader spectrum of activity are recommended.

Therefore in a stable and low risk patient a simpler antibiotic choice, not including ESBL in the spectrum of activity is correct, while in critical and high risk patients any antibiotic regimen must take into account the risk of ESBL.

The available therapeutic options for the treatment of ESBL-associated infections are limited by drug resistance conferred by the ESBLs. The frequently observed co-resistances include various antibiotic classes (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Carbapenems, stable against hydrolyzing activity of ESBLs, are considered as the drug of choice for the treatment of these infections. Tigecycline and polymyxins have a strong in vitro antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing bacteria, and the first should be considered a reasonable alternative. This is particularly true from an epidemiological point of view; in fact today any large hospital should implement carbapenems-sparing stewardship programs to control the spread of carbapenemase producing gram negative bacteria.

Although in the prospective French survey by Montravers and coll, a higher percentage of isolation of Enterococcus faecalis in non surviving patients was reported (23% versus 9%), empirical treatment against Enterococci and has not been generally recommended for patients with community-acquired IAI. In fact in several clinical trials comparing different therapeutic options inclusion/exclusion of agents with enterococcal coverage provides no impact in outcomes for patients with community-acquired infections.

In the setting of community acquired IAIs, antimicrobial therapy for enterococci should be considered on a patient-by-patient basis, mainly in high risk patients, in immunocompromised patients and in patients with valvular heart disease or prosthetic materials.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is not commonly isolated from patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection. Therefore empirical treatment against MRSA is not recommended in this setting.

### New antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit [^11356AgS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. However, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the ICU setting. Indeed, a recent additional call to action by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. The term ESKAPE has been coined by this IDSA group to refer to Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the United States that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. This article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the ICU.

Treatment of Enterococcus Species

If enterococci (especially Enterococcus faecalis) are sensitive to ampicillin or amoxicillin, this should be the initial agent of choice, with up to a week intravenous therapy followed by oral amoxicillin.

For ampicillin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin and daptomycin are the first choices. Resistance to vancomycin is increasing (vancomycin-resistant enterococci). Apart from daptomycin or oral linezolid, often no other alternative options are available. Pristinamycin may be considered for treatment of E. faecalis, although evidence supporting this is limited for enterococcal implant-related infections.,

IV fosfomycin has extensive tissue penetration in inflamed tissue and bone. In an experimental model of foreign-body infection, the combination of fosfomycin and gentamicin showed good biofilm activity against E. faecalis. Further studies are needed before IV fosfomycin can be recommended as a standard therapy in enterococcal FRI, although it may be considered in selected cases. No safety data exist on long-term oral administration of fosfomycin. This route of administration is therefore not recommended for bone and joint infections.

### Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid: evidence and opinion [^114pyAgo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrate in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including many isolates resistant to earlier antimicrobials. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is inactive against Enterococcus faecalis but has been effective for treatment of infections due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium associated with bacteremia. In comparative trials, linezolid proved to be equivalent to comparator agents, resulting in its approval for several clinical indications. The almost-complete bioavailability of linezolid permits oral administration. Each agent can cause adverse effects that may limit use in individual patients. Resistance to these drugs has been encountered infrequently among vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin is rare among staphylococci in the United States, and resistance to linezolid is very rare. Whether there is any benefit to use of these agents in combination regimens, and whether there are circumstances in which they might be alternatives to cell-wall active antibiotics for treatment of bone or endovascular infections, are questions that deserve further study.

Literature Search

The literature searches identified 4,878 citations; among these, 155 citations were chosen for full-text review, and 20 studies were determined to meet our inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Of these, 1 study did not indicate a study period and 5 studies reported study periods between January 1997 and January 2000 and required confirmation of VRE therapies within each study. Corresponding authors were contacted, but administered VRE therapy information could not be obtained and all 7 studies were excluded from the review. Excluded study details are provided in Supplemental Table 3. Therefore, 13 studies were included in the systematic review.

Description of Studies

The study characteristics of all included studies are outlined in Table 1. All were observational and retrospective studies, 12 of which were conducted between January 2000 and December 2011, following the formal regulatory approval of the first effective VRE therapy. – The study by da Silva et alreported a study period between September 1998 and December 2008. However, these authors confirmed that all patients with VRE bacteremia were diagnosed after January 2000. Billington et alsampled all residents within a Canadian health zone who developed enterococcal bloodstream infections. We contacted these authors to obtain mortality and LOS information for study participants. In addition, 8 studies exclusively sampled adult patients within tertiary care hospital settings, –, and 4 of these studies were limited to immunocompromised patient populations, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients or chemotherapy recipients.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^114EjZiS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Alarming rates of resistance have been described for non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumanniii complex. These difficult-to-treat MDR bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, but also can acquire resistance to most classes of antibiotic agents. Multiple mechanisms may be present simultaneously, conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics, including membrane permeability defects, expression of efflux pumps, and production of antibiotic-hydrolysing enzymes such as AmpC beta-lactamases or carbapenemases. S. maltophilia and A. baumanniii complex are rare cIAI pathogens, but can cause postoperative pneumonia among high-risk critically ill patients with cIAI.

Among gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus spp. is associated with increased morbidity in IAIs, but the effect on mortality is uncertain. Whereas the role of enterococci in high-risk patients is well documented, their role in cIAIs in low-risk patients is doubtful. Zhang et al. found by meta-analysis that anti-enterococcal regimens provide no improvement in cIAI treatment success, with similar mortality and adverse effects, in RCTs enrolling young patients with lower-risk community-acquired infections (median APACHE-II score, 6 points). Malignant disease, corticosteroid use, surgery, any antibiotic treatment, admission to an ICU, and an indwelling urinary catheter each predisposed patients with cIAI to a higher risk of enterococcal infection. The prevalence of enterococcal isolation was 2- to 5-fold higher from hospital-acquired IAIs.

Empiric anti-enterococcal therapy for cIAI is not necessary for most community-acquired infections, but is indicated in hospital-acquired IAIs and may be considered for immunocompromised patients, critically ill patients with sepsis and previous antimicrobial therapy lacking enterococcal coverage, or patients with valvular heart disease or intravascular prosthetics at high risk for endocarditis or blood-borne device-associated infection. The ideal regimen for high-risk patients is undetermined. E. faecalis is generally susceptible to ampicillin whereas E. faecium, encountered increasingly, is almost always ampicillin-resistant and 70% of strains are resistant to vancomycin. The first-line treatment of glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecium is vancomycin. Linezolid or daptomycin may be used to treat vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, but occasional resistance has been reported to both agents. The glyclcyclines also have useful activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.

### Influence of minimum inhibitory concentration in clinical outcomes of Enterococcus faecium bacteremia treated with daptomycin: is it time to change the breakpoint? [^117JyRHv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Daptomycin has become a front-line antibiotic for multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium bloodstream infections (BSIs). We previously showed that E. faecium strains with daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the higher end of susceptibility frequently harbor mutations associated with daptomycin resistance. We postulate that patients with E. faecium BSIs exhibiting daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL treated with daptomycin are more likely to have worse clinical outcomes than those exhibiting daptomycin MICs ≤ 2 µg/mL.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included adult patients with E. faecium BSI for whom initial isolates, follow-up blood culture data, and daptomycin administration data were available. A central laboratory performed standardized daptomycin MIC testing for all isolates. The primary outcome was microbiologic failure, defined as clearance of bacteremia ≥ 4 days after the index blood culture. The secondary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality.

Results

A total of 62 patients were included. Thirty-one patients were infected with isolates that exhibited daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL. Overall, 34 patients had microbiologic failure and 25 died during hospitalization. In a multivariate logistic regression model, daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL (odds ratio [OR], 4.7 [1.37–16.12]; p = 0.014) and immunosuppression (OR, 5.32 [1.20–23.54]; p = 0.028) were significantly associated with microbiologic failure. Initial daptomycin dose of ≥ 8 mg/kg was not significantly associated with evaluated outcomes.

Conclusions

Daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL in the initial E. faecium blood isolate predicted microbiological failure of daptomycin therapy, suggesting that modification in the daptomycin breakpoint for enterococci should be considered.

Higher-risk CA-IAI — empiric anti-enterococcal coverage: The task force concluded that there is rationale for providing empiric anti-enterococcal coverage in seriously ill patients with CA-IAI; based on these data, the task force judged piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, and the regimen of aztreonam, metronidazole, and vancomycin as adequate for empiric treatment of Enterococcus spp. in higher-risk patients with CA-IAI; with use of other broad-spectrum carbapenems, addition of ampicillin or vancomycin could be considered; supplemental ampicillin or vancomycin for coverage of E. faecalis should be added routinely to combinations of cefepime or ceftazidime with metronidazole, because these regimens lack anti-enterococcal coverage; routine therapy directed against E. faecium was not considered necessary for higher-risk patients with CA-IAI, but if there were a high suspicion that this organism was a component of the infecting flora, supplemental vancomycin should be used.

Enterococcus faecalis IE susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides — treatment duration and renal considerations: Patients with < 3 months' duration of symptoms were treated successfully with 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, whereas patients with ≥ 3 months' duration were successfully treated with 6 weeks; in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable. Patients with preexisting mild (creatinine clearance, 30–50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance, < 30 mL/min) renal failure may not be able to safely complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy; alternative regimens that should be considered include the use of streptomycin instead of gentamicin and short-course gentamicin therapy (2–3 weeks).

### Combination of ceftriaxone and ampicillin for the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis: a qualitative systematic review [^115Pfwoj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review is to review all human trials assessing the efficacy and safety of ampicillin and ceftriaxone for enterococcal endocarditis and to discuss the clinical implications of the findings.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1946-), EMBASE (1974-), CENTRAL, Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched through January 2017 using the search terms ampicillin, penicillin, ceftriaxone, cephalosporin, enterococ*, and endocarditis. Unpublished studies were eligible for inclusion. Additional references were identified from literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials in humans that reported on clinical efficacy or adverse outcomes with ceftriaxone and ampicillin therapy in patients with enterococcal endocarditis were included. Case reports, nonhuman, and non-English studies were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four observational clinical studies were identified. One examined the effects of ceftriaxone and ampicillin alone, and 3 compared the therapy to the current standard of care, ampicillin and gentamicin. The studies had small sample sizes and were not adequately designed or powered to establish noninferiority or equivalence to the current standard of care. Rates of clinical cure with ampicillin 2 g every 4 hours and ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours were similar to those of ampicillin and gentamicin. Ampicillin and ceftriaxone therapy was well tolerated with low rates of renal failure (0%-33%).

Conclusion

The evidence to support the use of ampicillin and ceftriaxone for enterococcal endocarditis is not definitive. In the absence of compelling evidence, clinicians may consider ampicillin and ceftriaxone in patients with Enterococcus faecalis infection at high risk for nephrotoxicity or those with aminoglycoside-resistant pathogens.

### Strategies for managing today's infections [^111K3EZc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial infections are becoming more difficult to treat. At the present time c. 70% of nosocomial infections are resistant to at least one antimicrobial drug that previously was effective for the causative pathogen. Pathogens that are notorious for their virulence and ability to develop resistance include Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter species. Notable resistance patterns that have emerged include methicillin resistance in S. aureus, which started in the healthcare setting but has now moved into the community. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci is frequently seen, and vancomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant S. aureus is a public health threat. Resistance patterns seen in pseudomonal and Acinetobacter infections are rapidly shifting. The situation has become sufficiently serious for clinical opinion leaders to call upon governments for assistance in addressing the problem. In this worsening environment, in which patients are at progressively greater risk of untreatable infections, clear recommendations for prescribers are urgently needed. Severity of infection and underlying conditions are key issues, as patients with the most serious diseases are those in most urgent need, and improvements in our ability to predict likely infecting pathogens when empirical therapy is necessary are needed. Risk-factors and local resistance patterns must be accounted for, and initial empirical therapy should be adequately broad spectrum and adequately dosed. Agents must be highly active, able to penetrate adequately to the site of infection, safe, and well-tolerated.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^113rk6F2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Aztreonam-avibactam is currently under clinical development for the treatment of serious infections caused by MBLs-producing Enterobacterales.

Alarming rates of resistance to many antibiotics in hospitals worldwide have been reported for non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobcter baumannii. These bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics; moreover, they can acquire additional resistance to other important antibiotic agents.

Among Gram-positive bacteria involved in IAIs, the impact of Enterococcus spp. on mortality remains uncertain. While the role of Enterococci spp. in determining breakthroughs or superinfections in high-risk patients is well documented, their pathogenic impact on IAIs in low-risk patients is still debated. As far as Enterococcus spp. is believed to possess low virulence factors, it may be supposed that an increase in virulence may be obtained by the development of a synergistic effect with other bacteria like E. coli and anaerobes. Various observational studies highlighted the treatment failure of patients infected by Enterococcus spp. relates with a poorer outcome; however, there is no consistent evidence that routine use of adequate anti-enterococcal coverage improves the survival rate, hypothesizing that Enterococcus spp. isolation represents a negative prognostic marker rather than playing a causative role in the infection. In their meta-analysis, Zhang et al. found that enterococci-covered antibiotic regimens provided no improvement in treatment success compared with control regimens (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; p = 0.15), with similar mortality and adverse effects in both arms. Basic characteristic analysis revealed that most of the enrolled patients with IAIs in RCTs were young, lower-risk CA-IAIs patients with a relatively low APACHE II score. Interestingly, malignancy, corticosteroid use, surgical intervention, antibiotic treatment, admission to the ICU, and indwelling urinary catheters could predispose patients with IAI to a substantially higher risk of enterococcal infection. Also, the acquisition of an IAI in the hospital setting seemed to represent a risk factor for enterococcal infections (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 2.34–3.39; p < 0.001). In Dupont et al. study, patients older than 75 years and admitted to ICU with Enterococcus spp. isolation presented higher SAPS2 and SOFA scores when compared with the enterococci -negative control group (p < 0.001 for both scores), confirming that the identification of these bacteria represents an independent risk factor for ICU mortality. Similarly, in Morvan et al. study ICU patients had higher 30-day mortality when Enterococcus spp. was isolated, especially when species other than Enterococcus faecalis (mostly E. faecium) or a polymicrobial infection were detected. Accordingly, to the above-described evidence, Sanders et al. concluded that the only parameter able to predict Enterococcus spp. isolation was the APACHE-II score (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.07; p < 0.01). In Fabre et al. multicentre study where approximately 65% of patients in both groups had CA-IAIs, there was no difference in the 30-day composite outcome between cIAI patients with E. faecalis isolation from intra-abdominal cultures and those treated with piperacillin/tazobactam rather than receiving ertapenem therapy (which cannot guarantee an adequate anti-enterococcal coverage) (OR 0.80; 95% CI; 0.39–1.63).

### Ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is as effective as ampicillin plus gentamicin for treating Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis [^11154Tbp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the ampicillin plus ceftriaxone (AC) and ampicillin plus gentamicin (AG) combinations for treating Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE).

Methods

An observational, nonrandomized, comparative multicenter cohort study was conducted at 17 Spanish and 1 Italian hospitals. Consecutive adult patients diagnosed of EFIE were included. Outcome measurements were death during treatment and at 3 months of follow-up, adverse events requiring treatment withdrawal, treatment failure requiring a change of antimicrobials, and relapse.

Results

A larger percentage of AC-treated patients (n = 159) had previous chronic renal failure than AG-treated patients (n = 87) (33% vs 16%, P = 0.004), and AC patients had a higher incidence of cancer (18% vs 7%, P = 0.015), transplantation (6% vs 0%, P = 0.040), and healthcare-acquired infection (59% vs 40%, P = 0.006). Between AC and AG-treated EFIE patients, there were no differences in mortality while on antimicrobial treatment (22% vs 21%, P = 0.81) or at 3-month follow-up (8% vs 7%, P = 0.72), in treatment failure requiring a change in antimicrobials (1% vs 2%, P = 0.54), or in relapses (3% vs 4%, P = 0.67). However, interruption of antibiotic treatment due to adverse events was much more frequent in AG-treated patients than in those receiving AC (25% vs 1%, P < .001), mainly due to new renal failure (≥ 25% increase in baseline creatinine concentration; 23% vs 0%, P < .001).

Conclusions

AC appears as effective as AG for treating EFIE patients and can be used with virtually no risk of renal failure and regardless of the high-level aminoglycoside resistance status of E. faecalis.

### Infections due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistant to linezolid [^114b6F8r]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Linezolid is a new oxazolidinone antibiotic used to treat infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In early clinical trials, emergence of resistance occurred rarely. We report clinical details and antibiotic susceptibility from five patients treated with linezolid for VRE infections who had resistant organisms isolated during therapy. Four were transplant patients receiving protracted courses of the drug; three cases were associated with treatment failure. One of 45 linezolid-treated patients developed resistance during therapy. Susceptibility testing should be done in all cases on starting therapy.

### Challenges in anti-infective development in the era of bad bugs, no drugs: a regulatory perspective using the example of bloodstream infection as an indication [^113MFEeW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections present many challenges to clinicians. The number of hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection continues to increase, and the number of newly available antimicrobial agents to treat these particularly lethal infections and many other serious infections continues to decrease. Drug-development programs for bloodstream infection that have adhered to existing regulatory guidelines have not been significantly successful. This article examines the regulatory history of the bloodstream infection indication as an example of the challenges faced by individuals and sponsors developing drugs for treatment of the current spectrum of antimicrobial-resistant infections, with the goal of providing insight into development pathways for agents targeting drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Disease-specific and pathogen-specific indications are discussed, and recent regulatory approvals for bloodstream infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are reviewed.

### Determinants of vancomycin resistance and mortality rates in enterococcal bacteremia. a prospective multicenter study [^115YecQf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Enterococcus species are major nosocomial pathogens and are exhibiting vancomycin resistance with increasing frequency. Previous studies have not resolved whether vancomycin resistance is an independent risk factor for death in patients with invasive disease due to Enterococcus species or whether antibiotic therapy alters the outcome of enterococcal bacteremia.

Objective

To determine whether vancomycin resistance is an independent predictor of death in patients with enterococcal bacteremia and whether appropriate antimicrobial therapy influences outcome.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Four academic medical centers and a community hospital.

Patients

All patients with enterococcal bacteremia.

Measurements

Demographic characteristics; underlying disease; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores; antibiotic therapy, immunosuppression, and procedures before onset; and antibiotic therapy during the ensuing 6 weeks. The major end point was 14-day survival.

Results

Of 398 episodes, 60% were caused by E. faecalis and 37% were caused by E. faecium. Thirty-seven percent of isolates exhibited resistance or intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin. Twenty-two percent of E. faecium isolates showed reduced susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Previous vancomycin use (odds ratio [OR], 5.82 [95% CI, 3.20 to 10.58]; P < 0.001), previous corticosteroid use (OR, 2.43 [CI, 1.22 to 4.86]; P = 0.01), and total APACHE II score (OR, 1.06 per unit change [CI, 1.02 to 1.10 per unit change]; P = 0.003) were associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. The mortality rate was 19% at 14 days. Hematologic malignancy (OR, 3.83 [CI, 1.56 to 9.39]; P = 0.003), vancomycin resistance (OR, 2.10 [CI, 1.14 to 3.88]; P = 0.02), and APACHE II score (OR, 1.10 per unit change [CI, 1.05 to 1.14 per unit change]; P < 0.001) were associated with 14-day mortality. Among patients with monomicrobial enterococcal bacteremia, receipt of effective antimicrobial therapy within 48 hours independently predicted survival (OR for death, 0.21 [CI, 0.06 to 0.80]; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Vancomycin resistance is an independent predictor of death from enterococcal bacteremia. Early, effective antimicrobial therapy is associated with a significant improvement in survival.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112xsgeD]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric community-acquired intra-abdominal infection empiric therapy — patients older than one month: For lower-risk patients, preferred regimens are cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ertapenem; alternative is cefuroxime plus metronidazole; optional regimens are ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus metronidazole. For higher-risk patients, preferred regimens are piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem-cilastatin, or meropenem; alternatives are ceftazidime or cefepime plus metronidazole or aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin. Footnotes specify applicability to those more than 45 weeks post-conceptual age and that use of an agent effective against Enterococcus spp. is suggested in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock who receive a cephalosporin-based regimen.

### Emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^111VAZbJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and ampicillin resistance in clinical Enterococcus faecium strains has developed in the past decade. Failure to adhere to strict infection control to prevent the spread of these pathogens has been well established. New data implicate the use of specific classes of antimicrobial agents in the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins and drugs with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria may promote infection and colonization with VRE and may exert different effects on the initial establishment and persistence of high-density colonization. Control of VRE will require better understanding of the mechanisms by which different classes of drugs promote gastrointestinal colonization.

### Impact of antibiotic use on the evolution of Enterococcus faecium [^113AkSdZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Enterococci are commensals of the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of animals, from simple invertebrates to humans, and likely evolved early in a primitive GIT-type environment. This presumption is supported by their ubiquity and their streamlined genomes (an indicator of host adaptation, which results in a number of nutritional needs that must be fulfilled by the host, the diet of the host, or nutrients produced by other members of the GIT consortium). As the result of widespread antibiotic use over the past 75 years, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium have spawned distinct sublineages that are now leading causes of multidrug-resistant infection and are endemic to many hospitals.

Competition among microbes in the gut is intense. The concept of "fitness cost" arises in discussions of microbes acquiring or evolving antibiotic resistance. Enterococci not only have acquired antibiotic resistance, they also have adapted in other ways to the unique hospital niche. The question, then, is whether an approximately 80-year history of adapting to the unusual opportunities for growth within the ecology of the antibiotic treated patient gut (followed by cycles of shedding into the hospital environment, surviving cleaning and disinfection, surviving desiccation, and recolonizing a new patient) has resulted in multidrug-resistant variants that are now ill tuned to compete effectively in a normal human gut. The answer could explain why vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains and infections are common in hospitals but infection and carriage rare in the community. The article by Montealegre et al in this issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases takes an important step in addressing this question.

Empirical antibiotic treatment options for blood culture–negative endocarditis: literature‐based recommendations.*,

AUC 24 /MIC indicates area under the serum concentration versus time curve for 0 to 24 hours/minimum inhibitory concentration; BCNE, blood culture–negative endocarditis; HCA‐IE, health care–associated infective endocarditis; NVE, native valve endocarditis; and PVE, prosthetic valve endocarditis. *A clear distinction must be made between BCNE in patients who received antibiotics before blood cultures were sampled, when empirical treatment should primarily target methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci, and BCNE in patients not previously treated with antibiotics, where empirical treatment active on fastidious organisms such as Bartonella spp, Coxiella burnetii, and Tropheryma whipplei may be warranted. Current recommendations are only based on expert opinion and clinical practice. † USA‐based regimens per the 2015 AHA scientific statement "Infective Endocarditis in Adults: Diagnosis, Antimicrobial Therapy, and Management of Complications". Some members of the writing group use a combination of vancomycin and ceftriaxone only to treat NVE. ‡ European‐based regimens per the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of endocarditis. In France, amoxicillin plus cefazolin is the preferred empirical treatment for acutely ill patients with community‐acquired native valve or late prosthetic valve IE, because it allows optimal coverage of the 3 major pathogens in this setting: cefazolin for methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, amoxicillin for penicillin‐susceptible streptococci, and the synergistic effect of both for Enterococcus faecalis. § The writing group favors adding rifampin once source control is attained. Some writing group members include rifampin in late PVE. ‖ Gentamicin is often avoided by writing group members due to risk of toxicity and side effects.

After molecular, serologic, or pathologic test results identify a specific pathogen, empiric antimicrobial therapy can be subsequently tailored in accordance with pathogen‐specific treatment, always in consultation with an infectious diseases expert to assist with interpretation of test results and to guide treatment decisions.

In selected BCNE cases where the confirmed causative pathogen is either methicillin‐susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, or enterococci, transitioning to highly bioavailable oral therapy may be considered in patients who are stable and meet the POET (Partial Oral Treatment of Endocarditis) trial criteria.

### Editorial commentary: linezolid vs daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci: the evidence gap between trials and clinical experience [^1167Pw54]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococcal species (VRE-BSI) can be a lethal complication for hospitalized patients. VRE-BSI principally affects vulnerable patient populations, including complex postsurgical and internal medicine patients with multiple comorbid conditions. VRE-BSI has particularly high attributable mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, liver transplant recipients, oncology patients, and other critically ill hospitalized populations.

Despite the high human and economic burden of VRE-BSI, the optimal treatment for these infections has not been established, and due to the fact that most enterococcal isolates (ie, E. faecium) are multidrug-resistant, clinicians are often faced with no reliable therapeutic options in critically ill patients. Linezolid is the only drug specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of VRE-BSI. However, studies leading to approval were based on limited data in an era where even fewer treatment options were available. Two phase-III clinical trials for VRE-BSI were started but were subsequently aborted due to enrollment difficulties. Additionally, there have been concerns that linezolid may not be optimal in deep-seated VRE infections. Linezolid is a bacteriostatic agent, and its activity may not be ideal for patients with severe VRE infections including those with infective endocarditis and other endovascular infections. Furthermore, linezolid toxicity when administered for prolonged courses may limit its use in VRE endocarditis.

Due to the above issues and despite lacking FDA approval for VRE infections, daptomycin (DAP, a lipopeptide antibiotic with in vitro bactericidal activity against VRE) has become a first-line agent to treat severe VRE infections. Although robust clinical evidence for the use of daptomycin for this indication is lacking, its in vitro profile and perceived clinical success has made DAP attractive for clinicians. However, the use of DAP for these infections have several caveats including, (i) emergence of resistance during therapy, (ii) the presence of mutations associated with DAP-resistance in isolates that are currently reported as DAP "susceptible" (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 3–4 µg/mL, breakpoint 4 µg/mL) that may jeopardize DAP clinical utility as monotherapy, and (iii) the optimal DAP dosing for VRE infections has not been established with some in vitro data suggesting that doses of 10–12 mg/kg should be used to prevent development of resistance, a notion that is also supported by some clinical data indicating better outcomes with higher doses.

### Aminoglycosides for infective endocarditis: time to say goodbye? [^117D8XSC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Based on experimental studies showing synergism with β-lactams and glycopeptides, aminoglycosides have long been considered essential in the treatment of infective endocarditis (IE). However, their use is associated with a high risk of renal failure, especially in elderly patients.

Aims

The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the evidence to support reducing or even avoiding the use of aminoglycosides for the treatment of IE. We also analysed data supporting the use of aminoglycosides in specific subgroup of IE patients.

Sources

PubMed database was searched up to July 2019 to identify relevant studies.

Contents

Recent European Guidelines reduced the use of aminoglycosides in IE, no longer recommended in Staphylococcus aureus native-valve IE, and shortened to 2 weeks for IE related to Enterococcus faecalis and streptococci with penicillin MIC > 0.125 μg/mL. In addition, an alternative regimen without aminoglycosides (ampicillin or amoxicillin plus ceftriaxone) is proposed for E. faecalis. Observational studies suggested that gentamicin would not be necessary in the case of staphylococcal prosthetic valve IE as long as rifampicin is maintained. Recent clinical studies showed that for streptococcal IE, gentamicin could be restricted to isolates with penicillin MIC > 0.5 μg/mL. For the empirical and definitive treatment of E. faecalis IE, amoxicillin or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone may be considered, irrespective of high-level of aminoglycoside resistance.

Implications

In a scenario of progressive increase in the age and frailty of IE patients, the use of aminoglycosides can be reduced or avoided in ~90% cases. This should result in reduced incidence of renal failure, an important prognostic factor in IE.

### Accelerated treatment of endocarditis-the POET II trial: rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial [^116UfQMd]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic treatment length for infective endocarditis (IE) is uncertain. International guidelines recommend treatment duration of up to 6 weeks for patients with left-sided IE but are primarily based on historical data and expert opinion. Efficacies of modern therapies, fast recovery seen in many patients with IE, and complications to long hospital stays challenge the rationale for fixed treatment durations in all patients.

Objective

The objective was to conduct a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (acronym POET II) investigating the safety of accelerated (shortened) antibiotic therapy as compared to standard duration in patients with left-sided IE.

Methods

The POET II trial is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients with definite left-sided IE due to Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis will be eligible for enrolment. Each patient will be randomized to accelerated antibiotic treatment or standard-length treatment (1:1) following clinical stabilization as defined by clinical parameters, laboratory values, and transesophageal echocardiography findings. Accelerated treatment will be between 2 and 4 weeks, whereas standard-length treatment will be between 4 and 6 weeks, depending on microbiologic etiology, complications, need for valve surgery, and prosthetic versus native valve endocarditis. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, relapse of bacteremia, or embolization within 6 months of randomization.

Conclusions

The POET II trial will investigate the safety of accelerated antibiotic therapy for patients with left-sided IE caused by Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis. The results of the POET II trial will improve the evidence base of treatment recommendations, and clinical practice may be altered.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^112hXKbw]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis β-lactamase and intrinsic resistance — susceptibility notes: Rarely, strains of E faecalis produce an inducible β-lactamase; these β-lactamase–producing strains are susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam and to vancomycin. Intrinsic penicillin resistance is uncommon in E faecalis but is common in E faecium, and it is reasonable to treat patients with E faecalis IE caused by strains that are intrinsically resistant to penicillin with a combination of vancomycin plus gentamicin.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112fCLif]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus and MRSA management in intra-abdominal infection (IAI) is addressed with graded suggestions: We suggest that ampicillin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide pathogen-directed therapy against susceptible enterococcal strains (Grade 2-B). We suggest that vancomycin may be used for treatment of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Grade 2-B), and we suggest inclusion of vancomycin in an aztreonam-based regimen for coverage of gram-positive organisms (Grade 2-B). We suggest that linezolid and daptomycin may be used for management of IAI in adults and children to provide empiric or pathogen-directed therapy for suspected or proven infections from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., and as an alternative to vancomycin for suspected or proven infections because of MRSA (Grade 2-B).

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^115bxM7C]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

First isolated in the late 1980s, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have rapidly become established as important nosocomial pathogens in the United States. In some hospitals, VRE are responsible for > 20% of enterococcal infections.

Given the complex genetic machinery required to confer vancomycin resistance, de novo emergence of resistance is unlikely in an individual patient. Thus, newly detected VRE may represent either acquisition of resistant organisms (or genes) or expansion of preexisting but undetected populations of VRE with which the patient is colonized. The likelihood of nosocomial VRE may vary with time and space, according to the endemicity of VRE in a specific location (i.e. colonization pressure) and to the duration of hospitalization (i.e. time at risk). Indeed, initially most VRE isolates were recovered from patients in intensive-care units (ICUs); later VRE became more prevalent in patients on other wards. Certain coexisting conditions, e.g. malignancies, organ transplants, and chronic renal failure, were found to be associated with increased risk for VRE, as were exposure to contaminated equipment and proximity to a VRE carrier.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^116aeCik]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Regimen

Overall, the A-C therapy was administered to 177 patients (63.4%) and A-G therapy to 146 (52.3%). Of them, 63 patients (22.6%) received a sequential A-G/A-C treatment (only two of them had at first A-C and then A-G) defining the A-G/A-C group. Twenty-two patients (7.9%) received additional oral antibiotic therapy (fluoroquinolone [n = 11], rifampicin [n = 8] or linezolid [n = 4]), mainly because of associated infectious embolism (73%, n = 16). Nine patients received A therapy; only 1 of them underwent surgery during treatment (Supplementary Table 3). Overall, 69.2% patients (n = 193) received a complete antibiotic treatment.

During the study period, the A-C regimen was increasingly used, becoming the predominant treatment in 2018–2019 (50.0%, 67/134), although use of A-G and sequential A-G/A-C trended to decrease (Supplementary Figure 1).

Comparing patients who received an amoxicillin-based combination in univariate analysis, A-G patients had less chronic heart failure (P = 0.09) and were less likely to have acute heart failure (P = 0.01) than patients treated with A-C or with A-G/A-C (Table 1). A-C patients were older (P = 0.002), had a higher Charlson score (P = 0.004), had more chronic renal failure (P = 0.03), were more likely to have vertebral osteomyelitis (P = 0.08), and received suppressive antimicrobial therapy more frequently (P = 0.005). A-C/A-G patients were more susceptible to have acute kidney injury during hospitalization (P = 0.005).

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^113qKYTi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infections have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Many factors can increase the risk of colonization with VRE. These include previous antibiotic therapy (the number and duration of antibiotics received) prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization in an intensive care unit severity of illness, invasive procedures and devices, gastrointestinal surgery, transplantation, proximity to another VRE-positive patient.

Affected patients usually have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with prolonged hospital stay and received long courses of broad spectrum antibiotics.

In the survey of Montravers and coworkers no differences in frequency of isolation of Candida spp were identified in community or hospital acquired IAIs, and the overall prevalence was under 5%, in contrast with other observations, especially those related to patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforation/anastomotic leakage.

Although the epidemiological role of Candida spp in nosocomial peritonitis is not yet defined, the clinical role is significant, because Candidal isolation is normally associated to a poor prognosis.

The same study group on 2006 published an elegant retrospective, case-control study conducted in critically ill patients admitted to 17 French ICUs where the yielding of Candida spp from peritoneal specimen was a variable independently associated to mortality in the setting of nosocomial peritonitis.

More recently Montravers and coll. reported a mortality rate of 38% in a prospective cohort of 93 patients admitted to ICU with candidal peritonitis.

Therefore, like for Enterococci, the inclusion of an anticandidal drug in the empiric regimen of severe nosocomial acquired IAIs, seems appropriate as confirmed by IDSA guidelines.

The recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis don't comprise a chapter specifically dedicated to candidal peritonitis. However the expert panels generically favor the use of echinocandins as first line empirical therapy in severely ill patients, recommending fluconazole for less severe conditions.

Therefore, transferring this concept to the context of IAIs we might advise the proscription of echinocandins as first line treatment in severe nosocomial IAIs. The IDSA guidelines also recommend the transition from an echinocandin to fluconazole for patients clinically stable and who have isolates of Candida spp susceptible to fluconazole; so the final recommendation would be to start with an echinocandin and to de-escalate to fluconazole as soon as possible on a clinical or microbiological basis.

In appendices 9,10 are summarized the antimicrobial regimens for hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections, recommended by WSES consensus conference.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci utilise antibiotic-enriched nutrients for intestinal colonisation [^111a1rpA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are multidrug-resistant pathogens and a major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. These hospital-acquired pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge as they have intrinsic resistance to several commonly prescribed antibiotics and also have acquired resistance to many available antibiotics.

E. faecium and E. faecalis are responsible for 75% of enterococcal infections and are commonly associated with hospital outbreaks of invasive infections such as bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis. E. faecalis was more virulent and more prevalent in healthcare-associated infections than E. faecium, however, the prevalence of E. faecium is increasing due to the rise of vancomycin-resistant and lactam-resistant E. faecium strains. E. faecium has higher levels of intrinsic and acquired resistance than E. faecalis, where 80% of E. faecium isolates are vancomycin-resistant compared to 10% of E. faecalis isolates. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium has gained attention as the World Health Organisation classified it as a high priority pathogen due to its unfavourable rankings in several criteria, including mortality, trends of resistance, transmissibility, preventability, treatability, and pipelines for new medicines and diagnostics.

### Enterococcus faecalis-associated lung abscess in a male adolescent-a case report [^11169eiA]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

E. faecalis was isolated from BAL samples obtained in our patient by bronchofibroscopy, so one could consider the isolated agent as contaminant or colonizer. Nevertheless, isolation of Enterococcus spp. from respiratory samples also varies according to the literature- it ranges from bronchial aspirate obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscope, transtracheal sputum and bronchial secretions obtained by bronchoscopy, lung tissue obtained by lung needle biopsy, to BAL samples. In our case report, E. faecalis was isolated as a sole pathogen.

The currently recommended empiric regimen for community-acquired pneumonia does not cover enterococcal infection. The most adequate treatment for Enterococcus -associated airway disease has to be defined case-by-case; a combination of antibiotics and empyema/ abscess drainage may be required. Various antibiotics regimens and combinations have been used as reported in the literature, such as penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and ampicillin, fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, vancomycin, aeromycin and streptomycin and linezolid. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn with regards to the most appropriate treatment regimen. Most authors seem to agree that the antibiotics choice should be based on susceptibility testing. Our patient showed a favourable evolution with a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone+clindamycin, combined with a four-week course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanate. No surgical intervention for resolution was required.

Obtaining appropriate cultures in all non-resolving community cases of pneumonia is paramount, especially because the non-specific clinical picture of Enterococcus -associated lung abscess may delay the initiation of an adequate treatment. This was illustrated by our case report, where all culture exams were negative, except for the BAL samples.

Regarding the outcome, in the case series reported by Grupper M et al. complications were described in six out of nine patients, and two of them died during hospitalization. In contrast, Vanschooneveld T et al. describe 11 cases of Enterococcus pleuro-pulmonary infections, where clinical cure was achieved in all except for one patient, where data was not available. Therefore, patients with Enterococcus pleuro-pulmonary infections appear to have good clinical outcomes. This is in accordance with our case report as our patient obtained an apparent clinical cure with intravenous and oral antibiotics treatment. His young age and absence of co-morbidities or risk factors may have contributed to the favourable clinical outcome.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^114Vf6e6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In this study the number of peritoneal microorganisms per sample was ≥ 3 in 34% and 54% of cases, respectively, for community-acquired and nosocomial infections (P < 0.001). The distribution of the microorganisms differed according to the nosocomial or community origin of the infection but not according to their location (data not shown). In nosocomial patients, increased proportions of Enterococcus faecalis (33% versus 19% in community-acquired patients; P < 0.05) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (13% versus 5% in community-acquired patients; P < 0.01) were observed. Conversely, in nosocomial patients, decreased proportions of Escherichia coli (52% versus 72% in community-acquired patients, P < 0.001) and streptococci strains were reported (31% versus 50% in community-acquired patients, P < 0.01).

Therefore the inclusion of anti-enterococcal drugs in any empirical antibiotic regimens in severe nosocomial IAIs and/or in patients with well known risk factors, seems appropriate, mainly if directed against E. faecalis.

Empiric therapy directed against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium is not recommended unless the patient is at very high risk for an infection due to this organism, such as a liver transplant recipient with an intra-abdominal infection originating in the hepatobiliary tree or a patient known to be colonized with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.

Enterococcus infections are difficult to treat because of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics.

Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many penicillins, and all cephalosporins with the possible exception of ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Besides Enterococci have acquired resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, to which the organisms are not intrinsically resistant, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and penicillins. Many strains of E. faecalis are susceptible to certain penicillins and glycopeptides; however, some strains of E. faecium may be resistant to these agents.

Enterococcus infective endocarditis (IE) caused by strains resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin — treatment and care team guidance include the following: Linezolid 600 mg IV or orally every 12 h for > 6 weeks is a Class IIb; Level of Evidence C option, and linezolid use may be associated with potentially severe bone marrow suppression, neuropathy, and numerous drug interactions; daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg per dose for > 6 weeks is also Class IIb; Level of Evidence C, and if daptomycin therapy is selected, then doses of 10 to 12 mg·kg−1.24 h−1 may be considered. Patients with IE attributable to Enterococcus species resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin should be managed by specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, if necessary, pediatrics (Class I; Level of Evidence C); patients with IE caused by these strains should be treated by a care team including specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiac surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, in children, pediatrics, and cardiac valve replacement may be necessary for cure. Combination therapy with daptomycin and ampicillin or ceftriaxone may be considered, especially in patients with persistent bacteremia or enterococcal strains with high MICs (ie, 3 μg/mL) to daptomycin within the susceptible range (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Doses recommended are for patients with normal renal and hepatic function.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^111TfdX3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Three of 5 patients who received a full and complete course of amoxicillin monotherapy relapsed despite receiving 12 g/day for 42 days. This is consistent with data previously described, with low patient numbers. In our opinion, the difference observed between monotherapy and combination therapy is sufficient to put an end to the questioning of amoxicillin use in combination.

Surprisingly, the lower relapse rate was observed in patients who received the A-G/A-C treatment. This group of patients had a higher rate of acute kidney injury, often related to gentamicin toxicity, and tended to have more surgery during treatment. These 2 events probably prompted the clinicians to switch treatment from A-G to A-C. To the best of our knowledge, use of this sequential treatment has not been reported and described, although our data suggest that it is already widespread. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential regimen comprising 7 to 14 days of A-G followed by A-C combination. A prospective study including long-term patient follow-up is still necessary.

Studies suggested a higher frequency of relapse among non-operated prosthetic valve-related-endocarditis: 11% to 17.4%, consistent with our 12.8% rate. Our data suggest that the presence of a prosthetic valve is not associated with relapse, whereas surgery seems to be the best way to prevent it. Surgery during treatment was associated with a reduced risk of one-year death and relapse in multivariate analysis.

Sterilization by antibiotics without surgery may be insufficient in some cases. This is supported by cases of positive valve culture regardless of the duration of antibiotics administered before surgery, as previously described. This is probably favored by the known natural tolerance to penicillin or phenotypic and genetic changes in enterococci that may confer a selective advantage.

Using WGS we demonstrated that true relapse may occur more than 1 year after the initial diagnosis and patients may be asymptomatic at the time of relapse diagnosis. This encourages prolonged surveillance, with systematic blood culture, of patients who have been treated for EFIE, especially if they have not undergone surgery.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^1155LAdL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) is characterized by a higher frequency of relapses than other infective endocarditis. The role of the treatment on its occurrence remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the antibiotic regimen could impact the risk of relapse in EFIE.

Materials

This was a multicenter retrospective study of patients diagnosed with definite EFIE between 2015 and 2019 in 14 French hospitals. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of relapses within the year following endocarditis diagnosis. As death was a competing risk for relapse, Fine and Gray models were used for studying risk factors and impact of treatment.

Results

Of the 279 patients included, 83 (29.7%) received the amoxicillin-gentamicin (A-G) combination, 114 (40.9%) amoxicillin-ceftriaxone (A-C), 63 (22.6%) A-G and A-C (A-G/A-C) sequentially, 9 (3.2%) amoxicillin (A), and 10 received other treatments. One-year-relapse rate was 9.3% (26 patients). Relapse occurred after a median delay of 107 days from EFIE diagnosis; 6 occurred after 6 months, and 6 were diagnosed by blood cultures in asymptomatic patients. In multivariate analysis, surgery during treatment was a protective factor against one-year relapse and death. The cumulative incidence of relapse 1 year after endocarditis was 46.2% for patients treated with amoxicillin, 13.4% with A-G, 14.7% with A-C, and 4.3% with A-G/A-C (P ≥ .05 in multivariate analysis).

Conclusions

Relapses after treatment of EFIE are frequent, frequently asymptomatic, and may occur more than 6 months after the initial episode.

### Can oritavancin Be used for treatment and / or suppressive antimicrobial therapy of bone and joint infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium? [^116yDFTX]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections pose substantial challenges for the treatment and suppression of bone and joint infections. Oritavancin, a long-acting lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against VRE. Limited data are available on using oritavancin for bone and joint infections caused by VRE, both for treatment (therapy to eliminate active infection) and suppressive antimicrobial therapy (long-term antibiotic administration to prevent infection recurrence in patients at high risk for that complication).

Questions/Purposes

(1) What proportion of patients in a small case series achieve freedom from infectious symptoms with use of oritavancin for treatment of VRE bone and joint infections? (2) What proportion of patients achieve freedom from infection recurrence with use of oritavancin when used for suppressive antimicrobial therapy of VRE bone and joint infections? (3) What proportion of patients develop adverse drug events associated with oritavancin use in VRE bone and joint infections?

Methods

We describe a retrospective, multicenter, observational case series of patients who received oritavancin for treatment and/or suppressive antimicrobial therapy of VRE bone and joint infection, including osteomyelitis, native septic arthritis, myositis, and prosthetic joint infection, between December 2014 and April 2024. The minimum surveillance period was 1 year, unless infection recurrence or an adverse drug event was documented before 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a life expectancy of less than 7 days, dual use of VRE antibiotics, or brain or spinal cord abscesses related to VRE, although no patients met these exclusion criteria in our study group. Clinical signs and symptoms of infection, corresponding microbiological cultures, and adverse drug events were assessed throughout follow-up. Eleven patients (6 treatment, 5 suppressive antimicrobial therapy) with VRE (all Enterococcus faecium) bone and joint infection in which at least one dose of oritavancin was used were included. No patients were excluded because of insufficient follow-up time. In the treatment group, the median (range) age was 60 years (48 to 66), 4 of 6 patients were male, and patients had received prior therapy for VRE with either linezolid or daptomycin. Infections were hardware-associated osteomyelitis in 2 of 6 patients, osteomyelitis in 3 of 6, and prosthetic joint infection in 1 of 6. In the suppressive antimicrobial therapy group, the median (range) age was 61 years (25 to 68), and 3 of 5 patients were female. Four of 5 patients had hardware-associated infections, including 3 of 5 with hardware-associated osteomyelitis and 1 of 5 with prosthetic joint infection of the hip.

Results

In the treatment group, 2 of 6 patients remained symptom free at a minimum follow-up of 3 years (range 3.0 to 3.25), and 2 patients developed recurrent infection-one with worsening knee stiffness and growth of VRE and one with radiologic signs of osteomyelitis and growth of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Candida glabrata. One of 6 patients in the treatment group was lost to follow-up, and one pursued end-of-life care after 28 days. All 5 patients who underwent suppressive antimicrobial therapy remained free from recurrent symptoms with a minimum duration of therapy of 21 months (range 21 to 48). After 48 months of oritavancin as suppressive antimicrobial therapy, one patient in the cohort developed an infusion reaction-shortness of breath, cough, and hypotension-resulting in drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

In this small, retrospective cohort of patients with multiple comorbidities, oritavancin showed possible promise as suppressive antimicrobial therapy for VRE bone and joint infection, with all patients receiving suppressive antimicrobial therapy lacking recurrence of infectious symptoms. However, the role of oritavancin as treatment-in salvage situations after multiple therapies failed-appeared more limited in preventing infection recurrence. Larger studies are needed to further define the role of oritavancin in the treatment of VRE bone and joint infections.

Level Of Evidence

### Linezolid (Zyvox) [^113ctxHK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcal Infections

Adult patients with documented or suspected vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind trial comparing a high dose of ZYVOX (600 mg) with a low dose of ZYVOX (200 mg) given every 12 hours either intravenously (IV) or orally for 7 to 28 days. Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam or aminoglycosides. There were 79 patients randomized to high-dose linezolid and 66 to low-dose linezolid. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population with documented vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection at baseline consisted of 65 patients in the high-dose arm and 52 in the low-dose arm.

The cure rates for the ITT population with documented vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection at baseline are presented in Table 15 by source of infection. These cure rates do not include patients with missing or indeterminate outcomes. The cure rate was higher in the high-dose arm than in the low-dose arm, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^113yvLwt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Enterococcal infective endocarditis (IE) accounts for around 13–18% of all endocarditis cases, E. faecalis being the enterococcal species causing most cases (around 90%). Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) incidence has been increasing in the past few years, possibly due to the increasing use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

The synergistic combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin (A-G) was the reference treatment for EFIE. This dual therapy has the disadvantage of a high risk of acute kidney injury (25% of patients) and loses its synergistic effect against isolates with high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR). The combination of ampicillin and ceftriaxone has shown synergistic activity in vitro against E. faecalis, and retrospective studies have shown that this combination had a similar clinical cure rate for EFIE as the A-G combination, with a better safety profile.

For these reasons, since 2015, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends using the combination of ampicillin or amoxicillin with ceftriaxone (A-C) as first-line therapy for non-HLAR EFIE and preferred therapy for HLAR EFIE.

However, the combination of high-dose amoxicillin with gentamicin or ceftriaxone has never been compared with amoxicillin monotherapy; and some authors question the benefits of the combination, suggesting that the same efficacy could be obtained with amoxicillin monotherapy.

Compared to endocarditis due to other pathogens, enterococcal endocarditis had a significantly higher 6-month relapse rate estimated to be around 7%. The 6-month threshold in relapse definition has been set empirically to differentiate relapse from reinfection. However, molecular bacterial typing analyses based on pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) have shown that, in the case of EFIE, relapse may occur up to 1 year after the initial episode. Thus, the real frequency of relapses could be underestimated. Due to their scarcity, the impact of treatment on the risk of relapse has not been explored, and there is still limited data about clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of these relapses.

The aims of this study were to describe the rate and clinical features of relapses in a large retrospective cohort of EFIE, and to investigate whether the choice of the antibiotic regimen could have an impact on the occurrence of relapse.

### Daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia in neutropenic patients [^111g5roc]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Vancomycin resistant enterococcal (VRE) blood stream infection (BSI) in neutropenic patients is associated with poor outcome. We report our experience in treating VRE BSI in febrile, neutropenic patients with daptomycin, a recently licensed lipopeptide with bactericidal activity against VRE.

Patients and Methods

Patients with fever, neutropenia and VRE BSI were treated with more than one dose of daptomycin (either 6 mg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day) in an open label, emergency-use trial. Patients were then assessed for clinical and microbiological cures and survival. MIC's of isolates to daptomycin were determined.

Results

Nine febrile, neutropenic patients with VRE BSI received daptomycin. Four of 9 courses (44%) had clinical and/or microbiologic cure. Two of the 5 who failed cure died within 3 days of initiation of daptomycin. Five subjects survived to 30 days after the onset of BSI.

Conclusions

Use of daptomycin in neutropenic patients with VRE BSI deserves further study as a treatment for VRE BSI in neutropenic patients.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to general principles, setting of care, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering outpatient parenteral or oral antibiotic treatment in patients with left-sided IE caused by Streptococcus species, E. faecalis, S. aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci, provided they were receiving appropriate IV antibiotic treatment for at least 10 days (or at least 7 days after cardiac surgery), are clinically stable, and do not show signs of abscess formation or valve abnormalities requiring surgery on TEE.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^1113DGGN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Relapses after treatment of EFIE are frequent, may be asymptomatic, and can occur more than 1 year after the initial episode. We showed that the choice of ceftriaxone or gentamicin as combined antibiotics does not seem to have an impact on the risk of relapse. Although our results should be interpreted with caution given the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of power arising from the rarity of relapses, our findings suggest that treatment with amoxicillin monotherapy should not be used in this indication. We also showed that surgery associated with antibiotic therapy is the best way to prevent relapse. Thus, non-operated patients with EFIE should particularly undergo careful clinical and biological observation, including systematic drawing of blood cultures, during extended follow-up.

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses for dalbavancin in pediatric patients [^117Dqssm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a significant source of morbidity in children, with cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis being the predominant skin infections treated by pediatricians. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause hospitalization and serious life-threatening complications. Since the year 2000, rates of hospitalizations among pediatric patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) have increased rapidly, with a 2013 survey showing a doubling between 1997 and 2009 to exceed 70,000 per year. This increase, which is also seen in adult patients with SSSI, coincided with the emergence of resistant pathogens, including community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), with many areas in the United States now reporting > 40% MRSA rates among SSSI isolates. –

For more than 50 years, vancomycin has been the mainstay of antibacterial therapy for severe infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. However, vancomycin is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, the need for drug monitoring, and the emergence of resistant S aureus and enterococci strains. Current guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIwere published before the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved dalbavancin, a second-generation, intravenous (IV) lipoglycopeptide, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI known or suspected to be caused by susceptible strains of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: S aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S agalactiae, S dysgalactiae, S anginosus (including S anginosus, S intermedius, S constellatus), and vancomycin-susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Dalbavancin is also approved in the United States for the treatment of ABSSSI in pediatric patients from birth to < 18 years, and is the first and only single-dose IV treatment for ABSSSI currently approved in the United States and the European Union. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of dalbavancin, including its long half-life, makes it a convenient treatment option, even in the outpatient setting, and a single-dose regimen may improve compliance and reduce healthcare resource use.

Daptomycin — enterococcal infective endocarditis (IE) considerations: Enterococci are considered daptomycin susceptible with MIC ≤ 4 μg/mL, and although > 90% of enterococci are reportedly susceptible in vitro, daptomycin is FDA approved for treatment of S aureus infections but not for enterococcal infections and is not approved for pediatric patients; the number of published vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium IE cases treated with daptomycin is extremely small with variable success, including cure in 6 of 9 patients in one report and deaths in another series. Other investigators have suggested higher doses (8–10 mg·kg−1·d−1) and combination regimens; in vitro evaluations suggested that ampicillin and ceftriaxone with daptomycin demonstrate the greatest synergistic activity compared with other β-lactam–daptomycin combinations. In summary, there are insufficient data to recommend monotherapy with daptomycin for multidrug-resistant enterococcal IE; if selected, doses of 10 to 12 mg·kg−1.24 h−1 may be considered, and consideration may be given to combinations including ampicillin or ceftriaxone, particularly when MICs are within the susceptible range (< 4 μg/mL).

### Development of daptomycin susceptibility breakpoints for Enterococcus faecium and revision of the breakpoints for other enterococcal species by the clinical and laboratory standards institute [^112WWEx9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Daptomycin is one of the few treatment options for infections caused by enterococci that are resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The emergence and clinical significance of daptomycin-resistant enterococci and evolving microbiologic, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, and clinical data indicated that the pre-2019 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) susceptible-only breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL for daptomycin and enterococci was no longer appropriate. After analyzing data that are outlined in this article, the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing established new breakpoints for daptomycin and enterococci. For E. faecium, a susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL was established based on an increased dosage of 8–12 mg/kg/day (≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant). CLSI suggests infectious diseases consultation to guide daptomycin use for the SDD category. For Enterococcus faecalis and other enterococcal species, revised breakpoints of ≤ 2 μg/mL-susceptible, 4 μg/mL-intermediate, and ≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant were established based on a standard dosage of 6 mg/kg/day.

### Brief communication: treatment of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis with ampicillin plus ceftriaxone [^111wMajc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) that precludes bactericidal synergism with penicillins or glycopeptides and nephrotoxicity related to aminoglycoside treatment are major problems in treating Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for treating endocarditis due to E. faecalis with and without HLAR.

Design

Observational, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter clinical trial.

Setting

13 centers in Spain.

Patients

21 patients with HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis and 22 patients with non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis. All were at risk for nephrotoxicity related to aminoglycoside use.

Intervention

6-week course of intravenous ampicillin, 2 g every 4 hours, plus intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 g every 12 hours.

Measurements

Clinical and microbiological outcomes.

Results

The clinical cure rate at 3 months was 67.4% (29 of 43 patients) among all episodes. During treatment, 28.6% of patients with HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis and 18.2% of patients with non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis died of infection-related causes. The rate of clinical and microbiological cure in patients who completed the protocol was 100% in the HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis group. No episodes of breakthrough bacteremia occurred, although there were 2 relapses in the non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis group. Treatment was withdrawn in 1 case because of fever and skin rash.

Limitations

The study had a small sample and was observational.

Conclusion

The combination of ampicillin and ceftriaxone is effective and safe for treating HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis and could be a reasonable alternative for patients with non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis who are at increased risk for nephrotoxicity.

1.6 Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis due to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

1.7 Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The effectiveness of levofloxacin tablets is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.

Levofloxacin tablets have not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin tablets in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin tablets therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [see Clinical Studies (14.9)].

1.8 Plague

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and prophylaxis for plague in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Efficacy studies of levofloxacin tablets could not be conducted in humans with plague for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].

1.9 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 5-day Treatment Regimen

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].

1.10 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 10-day Treatment Regimen

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa [see Clinical Studies (14.8)].

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including vancomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When vancomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

We found that inadequacy of IAT on Enterococcus species identified on peritoneal sample was associated with a worse 30-day survival especially when it was not an E. faecalis alone. This inadequacy was partly due to the absence of vancomycin in the empiric antibiotic regimen. These results should encourage the physician to use an antimicrobial regimen active against non- faecalis Enterococcus (like vancomycin) in severe, postoperative, ICU-acquired IAI, especially when an antimicrobial therapy with third-generation cephalosporins has been used within 3 months preceding IAI. Our study also suggests that IAI with non E. faecalis Enterococci have a poorer prognosis than IAI with E. faecalis alone. It would be interesting to conduct a prospective and larger study to confirm these results.

### Outcomes for and risk factors associated with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia in cancer patients [^1168zzxn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a major cause of nosocomial infection. We sought to compare vancomycin-resistant (VR) Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia and VR Enterococcus faecium bacteremia in cancer patients with respect to risk factors, clinical presentation, microbiological characteristics, antimicrobial therapy, and outcomes.

Methods

We identified 210 cancer patients with VRE bacteremia who had been treated between January 1996 and December 2004; 16 of these 210 had VR E. faecalis bacteremia and were matched with 32 patients with VR E. faecium bacteremia and 32 control patients. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted.

Results

Logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with VR E. faecalis bacteremia, VR E. faecium bacteremia was associated with a worse clinical response to therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.07–0.98]; p = 0.046) and a higher overall mortality rate (OR, 8.3 [95% CI, 1.9–35.3]; p = 0.004), but the VRE-related mortality rate did not show a statistically significant difference (OR, 6.8 [95% CI, 0.7–61.8]; p = 0.09). Compared with control patients, patients with VR E. faecalis bacteremia were more likely to have received an aminoglycoside in the 30 days before the onset of bacteremia (OR, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.2–27.6]; p = 0.03), whereas patients with VR E. faecium bacteremia were more likely to have received a carbapenem in the 30 days before the onset of bacteremia (OR, 11.7 [95% CI, 3.6–38.6]; P < .001). In a multivariate model that compared patients with VR E. faecium bacteremia and control patients, predictors of mortality included acute renal failure on presentation (OR, 15.1 [95% CI, 2.3–99.2]; p = 0.004) and VR E. faecium bacteremia (OR, 11 [95% CI, 2.7–45.1]; P < .001). No difference in outcomes was found between patients with VR E. faecalis bacteremia and control patients.

Conclusions

VR E. faecium bacteremia in cancer patients was associated with a poorer outcome than was VR E. faecalis bacteremia. Recent receipt of carbapenem therapy was an independent risk factor for VR E. faecium bacteremia, and recent receipt of aminoglycoside therapy was independent risk factor for E. faecalis bacteremia.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^114QwYYb]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, enterococci, susceptible, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering regimens including either ampicillin or aqueous crystalline penicillin G plus gentamicin or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone in patients with IE caused by enterococci susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides. Consider completing either 4 or 6 weeks of ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin therapy in patients with native valve IE, depending on the duration of IE symptoms before the initiation of therapy. Consider completing a 6-week therapy if ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is selected as the treatment regimen, regardless of symptom duration. Consider administering a 6-week antimicrobial therapy in patients with prosthetic valve IE.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in infective endocarditis — epidemiology and agents: The rapid emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has become a global issue of major clinical importance. Most of these strains are E faecium, and as many as 95% of strains express multidrug resistance to vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and penicillins; only about 3% of E faecalis strains are multidrug resistant, and many vancomycin-resistant E faecalis are penicillin susceptible. Enterococci are considered to be resistant to vancomycin if MICs are > 4 μg/mL. Linezolid and daptomycin are the only 2 antimicrobial agents currently available in the United States that may be useful for the treatment of multidrug-resistant E faecium IE; quinupristin-dalfopristin may be active in vitro only against strains of E faecium and is inactive against E faecalis, and tigecycline is active in vitro against some strains of multidrug-resistant enterococci, but there are minimal published data on its use clinically.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^112sgHoZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The numerical MIC number, expressed as micrograms/ml, is usually reported by microbiology laboratories as a categorical guide for clinicians, i.e. as "susceptible", "resistant", or "intermediate", according to Clinical or Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria in the United States or the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria in Europe.

Knowledge of mechanisms of secretion of antibiotics into bile may be helpful in designing the optimal therapeutic regimen for patients with biliary-related intra-abdominal infections (Recommendation 1C).

Organisms most often isolated in biliary infections are those isolated in intra-abdominal infections including the gram-negative aerobes, E. coli and K. pneumonia and anaerobes, especially B. fragilis. The role of enterococci in biliary tract infections remains unclear, and specific coverage against these microorganisms is not routinely suggested for community-acquired biliary infections.

Although there are no clinical data to support the use of antibiotics with biliary penetration for these patients, the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections may depend on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations too. Obviously in patients with obstructed bile ducts, the biliary penetration of antibiotics may be poor and effective biliary concentrations are reached only in a minority of patients.

Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infections and their biliary penetration ability are illustrated in Table 5.

Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is recommended for patients with hospital-acquired IAIs, especially those with recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic leak (Recommendation 1C).

The epidemiological profile of Candida spp in the context of nosocomial peritonitis is incompletely defined. Its clinical presence is usually associated with poor prognosis. Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida spp is typically not recommended for patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections, with the notable exceptions of critically ill patients or immunocompromised patients (due to neutropenia or concurrent administration of immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators). Recently, IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were developed and addressed Candida peritonitis. IDSA guidelines suggested considering empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections in liver transplant recipients: clinical impact and therapeutic approaches [^111i9v4d]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) is an important cause of infection in liver transplant recipients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Liver transplant candidates and recipients share various risk factors for VRE infections and colonization has been shown to be associated with increased risk for infection. With limited antimicrobial options and data available for guidance, treatment can be challenging. This review discusses the epidemiology of VRE infections in patients with end stage liver disease and after liver transplant as well as therapeutic approaches.

### Partial oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment of endocarditis [^1152W5uJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with infective endocarditis on the left side of the heart are typically treated with intravenous antibiotic agents for up to 6 weeks. Whether a shift from intravenous to oral antibiotics once the patient is in stable condition would result in efficacy and safety similar to those with continued intravenous treatment is unknown.

Methods

In a randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial, we assigned 400 adults in stable condition who had endocarditis on the left side of the heart caused by streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci and who were being treated with intravenous antibiotics to continue intravenous treatment (199 patients) or to switch to oral antibiotic treatment (201 patients). In all patients, antibiotic treatment was administered intravenously for at least 10 days. If feasible, patients in the orally treated group were discharged to outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, embolic events, or relapse of bacteremia with the primary pathogen, from the time of randomization until 6 months after antibiotic treatment was completed.

Results

After randomization, antibiotic treatment was completed after a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the intravenously treated group and 17 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the orally treated group (P = 0.48). The primary composite outcome occurred in 24 patients (12.1%) in the intravenously treated group and in 18 (9.0%) in the orally treated group (between-group difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -3.4 to 9.6; P = 0.40), which met noninferiority criteria.

Conclusions

In patients with endocarditis on the left side of the heart who were in stable condition, changing to oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment. (Funded by the Danish Heart Foundation and others; POET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01375257 .).

### How do physicians cope with controversial topics in existing guidelines for the management of infective endocarditis? Results of an international survey [^115jXV1B]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

International guidelines are available to help physicians prescribe appropriate antibiotic regimens to patients with infective endocarditis (IE). However some topics of these guidelines are controversial. We conducted an international survey to assess physicians' adherence to these guidelines, focusing on these controversial items. An invitation to participate to a 15-question online survey was sent in 2012–2013 to European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) members, scientific societies and corresponding authors of publications on IE mentioned in PubMed from 1990 to 2012, inclusive. Eight hundred thirty-seven physicians participated in the survey, and 625 (74.7%) completed it over the first question. The results showed great heterogeneity of practices. Claiming to follow guidelines was marginally associated with more guideline-based strategies. Gentamicin use depended on causative pathogens (p < 0.001) and physician specialty (p 0.02). Eighty-six per cent of the physicians favoured vancomycin alone or in combination with gentamicin or rifampicin as a first-line treatment for left-sided native valve methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus IE, 31% considered switching to oral therapy as a therapeutic option and 33% used the ampicillin and ceftriaxone combination for enterococcal IE as a first-line therapy. Physician specialty significantly affected the choice of a therapeutic strategy, while practicing in a university hospital or the number of years of practice had virtually no impact. Our survey, the largest on IE treatment, underscores important heterogeneity in practices for treatment of IE. Nonetheless, physicians who do not follow guidelines can have rational strategies that are based on the literature. These results could inform the revision of future guidelines and identify unmet needs for future studies.

Although there are no clinical data to support the use of antibiotics with biliary penetration for these patients, the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections may also depend on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations. Obviously, in patients with obstructed bile ducts, the biliary penetration of antibiotics may be poor and effective biliary concentrations are reached only in a minority of patients.

Empiric antibiotic regimens. Normal renal function

One of the following intravenous antibiotics

Amoxicillin/clavulanate 2.2 g every 8 h

Increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae worldwide, during the last decade, has compromised clinical utility of this agent for empirical therapy of serious Gram-negative infections and therefore it should be used based on local rates of resistance. Avoid its use if Enterobacteriaceae resistances > 20%. Piperacillin/tazobactam 6 g/0.75 g LD then 4 g/0.5 g every 6 h or 16 g/2 g by continuous infusion, (in critically ill patients)

Ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 h + metronidazole 500 mg every 8 h

Cefotaxime 2 g every 8 h + metronidazole 500 mg every 8 h

or

In patients with beta-lactam allergy

A fluoroquinolone-based regimen

Ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 or 12 h + metronidazole 500 mg every 8 h

or

In patients at high risk for infection with community-acquired ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae

One of the following intravenous antibiotics

Tigecycline 100 mg LD, then 50 mg every 12 h (carbapenem-sparing strategy)

Ertapenem 1 g every 24 h (not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa)

Meropenem 1 g every 8 h (only in patients with septic shock)

Doripenem 500 mg every 8 h (only in patients with septic shock)

Imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg every 6 h (only patients with septic shock)

In patients at high risk for infection from enterococci including immunocompromised patients or patients with recent antibiotic exposure, consider the use of ampicillin 2 g every 6 h if patients are not being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam or imipenem/cilastatin (active against ampicillin-susceptible enterococci) or tigecycline.

### Daptomycin [^113LbZ7V]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults

In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial.

Antimicrobial Activity

Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive Bacteria
Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only)
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates)
Streptococcus agalactiae
Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis
Streptococcus pyogenes

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-Positive Bacteria
Corynebacterium jeikeium
Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-resistant isolates)
Enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-resistant isolates)
Staphylococcus epidermidis (including methicillin-resistant isolates)
Staphylococcus haemolyticus

### Antimicrobial combination therapy for treatment of Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia (microEFfAECT) [^112G9atf]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

The optimal treatment of EF-BSI uncomplicated with endocarditis is still a matter of debate. Ampicillin is commonly considered the drug of choice, when active in vitro. However, several studies demonstrated the synergistic effect of the combination treatment with an aminoglycosides or ceftriaxone in case of life-threatening infections. Indeed, in vitro evaluation of the drug combination effect has the potentiality for improving treatment by suggesting the possible synergistic or antagonistic interaction of antimicrobial associations. Although, different studies suggested the potential clinical utility of synergy testing, the real prognostic value of these methods is not defined yet. In this context, synergy testing could be used as strategy for improving antibiotic treatment of EF-BSI by suggesting the optimal antimicrobial combination therapy. Ceftaroline and ceftobiprole are two novel cephalosporins, which exhibit intrinsic activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

Both drugs seem to show a good level of affinity to penicillin binding protein 5, a class B, commonly expressed by Enterococcus spp. The use of these drugs in association with ampicillin or daptomycin seems promising. However, clinical efficacy of these combinations is not well defined yet. Gut microbiota of healthy individual is composed by a consortium of bacteria balanced by symbiotic or antagonistic relationships. Antimicrobial treatments altered this equilibrium conferring competitive advantage for different species, including host pathogens. Disruption of the balance in the gut microbial composition has been associated to different pathological conditions. Also, administration of antimicrobials contributes to increase resistome in the intestinal microbiota and diffusion of antimicrobialresistant pathogens through selective pressure.

The central objective of this study is to identify the gut microbiota signature associated to different antimicrobial therapy of EF-BSI and to clinically validate novel diagnostic tools for optimizing antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients.
- Adult
- Monomicrobial EF-BSI
- Receipt of ≥ 5 days of at least one in vitro active drug with or without a synergistic drug, at common suggested dosages for EF-BSI in empirical or definitive therapy.

### Penicillin and gentamicin therapy for enterococcal infections… [^111vcQys]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

None of the currently available antibiotic regimens is completely effective for the therapy of severe enterococcal infections. Recent studies have shown that a combination of penicillin plus gentamicin produces enhanced killing against virtually all strains of enterococci in vitro. We report four cases of enterococcal endocarditis and two cases of enterococcal meningitis that were successfully treated with penicillin and gentamicin, thus confirming the in vivo effectiveness of this combination of antibiotics against enterococci.
