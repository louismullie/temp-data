## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the height of a square-based pyramid given the base area and the area of each identical triangular face, with multiple-choice answers provided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the base dimensions and the slant height of the triangular faces. Then, I should verify the relationship between slant height, pyramid height, and the apothem of the base. Next, I will apply the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the pyramid height. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and match the result to the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the base side length. The base is a square with area 1440 cm², so each side is √1440 cm. Wait, let me verify that simplification: √1440 = √(144 × 10) = 12√10 cm, so the side length is 12√10 cm, and half the side length is 6√10 cm, which will be the apothem distance from the center to the midpoint of a base edge [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the triangular faces. Each triangular face has area 840 cm² and base equal to the side of the square, 12√10 cm. The area of a triangle is [1/2] × base × height, so the slant height l satisfies 840 = [1/2] × 12√10 × l, which simplifies to l = [140/√10]. Hold on, I should rationalize that: l = [140√10/10] = 14√10 cm, so the slant height is 14√10 cm [^notfound].

> Now, I need to relate slant height, pyramid height, and the apothem. The slant height forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are the pyramid height h and the apothem 6√10 cm. By the Pythagorean theorem, h² + (6√10)² = (14√10)². Let me compute that carefully: (6√10)² = 36 × 10 = 360, and (14√10)² = 196 × 10 = 1960, so h² = 1960 − 360 = 1600, which means h = √1600 = 40 cm [^notfound].

> I should double-check the options. The calculated height is 40 cm, which corresponds to option B. Wait, let me verify the alternatives to ensure there's no misinterpretation: 30√2 ≈ 42.4, 20√6 ≈ 49.0, 20√3 ≈ 34.6, and 30 is just 30, so 40 cm is indeed option B and matches our derivation precisely [^notfound].

---

The height of the pyramid is **40 cm**. Here's the solution: the square base has area 1440 cm², so each side is √1440 = 12√10 cm. Each triangular face has area 840 cm², so the slant height is [2 × 840/(12√10)] = 14√10 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the pyramid height h satisfies h² + (6√10)² = (14√10)², which gives h² = 1960 − 360 = 1600, so h = 40 cm. The correct answer is **(B) 40**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### 1. Find the side length of the square base

The base area is 1440 cm², so the side length (s) is:

s = √1440 = 12√10 cm

---

### 2. Find the slant height of the triangular faces

Each triangular face has area 840 cm² and base (s = 12√10) cm. The area of a triangle is ([1/2] × base × height), so the slant height (l) is:

l = [2 × 840/(12√10)] = [1680/(12√10)] = [140/√10] = 14√10 cm

---

### 3. Relate slant height, pyramid height, and base apothem

The slant height, pyramid height, and apothem of the base form a right triangle. The apothem is half the base side:

apothem = [s/2] = 6√10 cm

By the Pythagorean theorem:

h² + (6√10)² = (14√10)²

h² + 360 = 1960

h² = 1600

h = 40 cm

---

The height of the pyramid is **40 cm**, which corresponds to option **(B)**.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Examining volumetric gradients based on the frustum surface ratio in the brain in autism spectrum disorder [^38501d0a]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Yet, traditional volumetric neuroimaging studies estimate grey matter volume as the product of SA and CT at each cerebral vertex, which is also known as the product method. As noted by Winkler and colleagues, this approach introduces a considerable bias as it underestimates grey matter volume in cortical gyri where the outer surface area is larger than the inner, and overestimates grey matter volume in cortical sulci where the inner area is larger than the outer, hence overestimating total grey matter volume across hemispheres (Winkler et al. 2018). The product method therefore only serves as a rough approximation of the true grey matter volume at a given location on the cortical surface. In order to overcome this limitation, Winkler and colleagues (Winkler et al. 2018) proposed a more advanced way of estimating local CV by using the so‐called analytic method, where volume is not simply estimated as the product of SA and CT. Instead, each face (i.e. triangle) on the white matter surface and its matching face on the pial (i.e. outer) surface are used to define an oblique truncated pyramid, the volume of which is computed analytically without introducing additional error (Winkler et al. 2018). To date, this approach has become the default for surface‐based analyses of CV as implemented in FreeSurfer. While the analytic method has become state‐of‐the‐art for quantifying vertex‐wise estimates of grey matter volume, it does not contain any information on the exact position of a vertex on the folded surface of the brain. Based on the analytic method alone, it is therefore not possible to determine if a vertex is located on a gyral crown with an outward‐weighting of grey matter volume towards the pial surface, or on a sulcal fundus with an inward‐weighting of cortical volume towards the white matter surface (Waehnert et al. 2014).

### Diffusion MRI signal cumulants and hepatocyte microstructure at fixed diffusion time: insights from simulations, 9.4T imaging, and histology [^be588bd7]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

We simulated intracellular signals at fixed diffusion time and processed them to estimate cell sizeand cell diffusivity. The approach was also tested on 9.4T ex vivo MRI scans of fixed mouse livers. All analysis code is made available, and was executed on two Ubuntu 20.04.2 machines (18‐core, 3.00‐GHz Intel® Core i9‐10980XE CPU).

2.1 Cell generation

We simulated hepatocytes (polygonal cells) by perturbing regular prisms with square/pentagonal/hexagonal bases. Prisms were described by triangular meshes and featured a characteristic length L (base‐to‐base height and diameter of the circumcircle relative to each base). We considered 33 values of L in [11; 60] μm (increment: 1.5 μm), obtaining15 unique cell shapes for each value of L. Thecells at fixed L were obtained by perturbing each prism base shape 5 times, displacing vertices at random (displacements drawn from a normal distribution, σ = 0.1 L). The range for L covers sizes seen in healthy mammal livers (e.g. 20–30 μm in humans,30–40 μm in mice) and in pathology (e.g. swollen hepatocytes in steatosis; hepatocyte substitution by smaller cancer cells). Supporting Information Figure S1 shows synthetic cells.

2.2 Intracellular spin dynamics

We generated random walks with the MCDC simulator, distributing = 1000 spins uniformly inside each cell (elastic reflection at walls; impermeable walls). We simulated = 140 ms (3000 steps) and varied the intrinsic cell diffusivityin [0.20; 2.40](45 values; increment: 0.05).

The experiments proceeded as follows. A specific height is imposed on the sample using the L-shaped plates and the sample is secured in this configuration by locking the sliders with the locking system. We use a tape measure at various positions along the circular edge of the tessellation to manually verify the uniformity of the sample height. We then capture a photo with each of the two cameras in the locked configuration. We repeat this process for eight different configurations, specifically imposing heights of 31.5 cm, 32 cm, 33 cm, 34 cm, 35 cm, 36 cm, 37 cm, and 37.5 cm. Finally, we estimate the relationship between the height and radius via post-processing of these photos.

### Direct chiroptical correlation of dissymmetric crystal morphologies [^7a6b504a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

One of the best views of the morphology comes from X-ray microtomography (microCT; Fig. 2D). Some of these crystals have several curious features. (1) The bipyramids are longer on the bottom than on the top, as pictured in Figs. 1 B2 and 2D. The length of the top pyramid is 75–80% of the bottom. (2) The bottom pyramid is more acute than the top, albeit this apparent angle depends upon the azimuth of the micrograph with respect to the vertical axis. The angle of the top pyramid is near 55° in projection, whereas the angle in the bottom pyramid is closer to 45°. These morphologies are consistent with the polar point group 6, as opposed to 622 where the top and bottom are equivalent. The sense of this axis could be a consequence of differences in mass transport that make some crystals appear polar. (3) The interfacial edges that separate the top and bottom pyramids have long and short bounding edges, horizontal and inclined, respectively. We have found that the best way to approximate this intersectionis with two types of pyramids: the bottom pyramid with isohedral facesand the top pyramid with enantiomorphous faces either {122} or {212}. In contrast, symmetry 622 with twelve {111} facets, i.e. symmetry 6 with six {111} facets and sixfacets, would give a bipyramid with edges between the large faces of top and bottom pyramids nearly parallel to the intersecting planes. The crystal face assignments been validated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. S4). Interpenetrated twinned crystals (RR, LL, and RL) were also observed as clearly seen by micro-CT (Fig. S5).

Participants

Participants were 22 years or older with dry eye symptoms for the previous 3 or more months, reported use of lubricants for the previous 1 or more months, and had an OSDI score between 23 and 79. The key clinical criteria were TBUT < 10 seconds in both eyes, MGS ≤ 12 in each eye, and at least 15 glands in each lower eyelid that were expressible during slitlamp examination. Key exclusion criteria included the use of dry eye treatments (other than lubricants) and contact lens wear within a prespecified period before the study. In addition, eligibility required no history of major dermatologic, systemic or ocular conditions, no tattoos, permanent make-up, or irritated skin in the treatment area.

Procedures: Intervention/Treatment

The Tixel device used in the study consisted of a small tip with an array of 24 (6 × 4) pyramids, spaced evenly within a 0.30 cm² area. The pyramids were 1.25 mm tall with a blunt apex of approximately 0.01 mm² (Figure 1). The parameters used in this study for a single pulse had a duration of 6 milliseconds and tip protrusion distance of 400 μm.

Figure 1.
The Tixel system used for treatment in the periorbital area is comprised of a console, connected through a cord to a small handpiece (panel A). The small handpiece has a small tip, which consists of an array of 24 (6 × 4) evenly spaced square-based pyramids, that are 1.25 mm in height with a blunt apex of approximately 0.01 mm² (panel B).

The Tixel procedure involved 3 bilateral sessions at 2-week intervals. After both lids were cleaned and anesthetized, the clinician delivered a row of 5 pulses near each lid margin in the nasal, medial, and temporal regions. A second row of 5 pulses was delivered to each eyelid, adjacent to the first row and distal from the lid margin for a total of 20 pulses applied to both the upper and lower eyelids (Figure 2). This was repeated for the contralateral eyelids. The first treatment session was day 0.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^a7cfb7be]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Dilation

Dilation is a homothetic transformation that relates two similar shapes with respect to a homothetic center. Any two figures related by a dilation are similar and have the same orientation (see Fig. 1). This transformation preserves the shape and orientation of the figure, but changes the size of each of the elements of the structure by the same factor. In a dilational structure the distances between a representative set of points on the structure, typically corner joints, all scale by the same factor during actuation.

Fig. 1
Dilation of structures. Under dilation, a structure scales with respect to a homothetic center (point H in this figure), preserving its size and orientation

Triangulation

The first step of the presented design method is to triangulate the curved surface from which we want to create a dilational structure. Triangulation is a common strategy to approximate curved surfaces by a mesh of triangular faces and lies at the basis of the STL file format used in 3D printing. Triangulation is illustrated in Fig. 2 for a sphere. It is observed that the accuracy of the approximation increases with the number of triangular faces in the resulting mesh.

Fig. 2
Triangulation of surfaces. Any curved surface, in this case a sphere, can be approximated by a mesh of triangles in a process called triangulation. A larger mesh of triangular faces gives a better approximation of the original surface. Shown are polyhedral triangulations of a sphere withtriangular faces

The triangulation results in a polyhedral surface with only triangular faces. It can be shown that every surface (by which we mean a 2-manifold with or without boundary) can be triangulated such that at most two triangular faces share an edge. If the resulting polyhedron undergoes dilation, the number of triangles, their shapes and their respective relations must stay constant. Only the size of the triangles is allowed to change, their aspect ratio and orientation are preserved.

### 3D nanoprinting via spatially controlled assembly and polymerization [^8e4080eb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

3D nanoprinting of structures

The capability to print 3D structures by design was also demonstrated, with representative 3D structures shown in Fig. 4. The first structure is a set of stacked grids: an array of 10 parallel lines, 100 µm long with 10 µm separation, were printed atop a pre-functionalized quartz surface. Then the same printing protocols were followed by delivering 10 lines of p(PEGA-co-HEANB) atop and perpendicular to the first array. As shown in Fig. 4A the outcome exhibited high fidelity when compared to the design, with completely parallel lines separated by designed periodicity and perpendicularity from one array to the next without distortion or fuzzy edges. The height of lines measured to be 26 and 34 nm, for the first and second arrays, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4B. The cross-section was 60 nm tall, consistent with the concept of stacking individually printed passes on top of one another and is shown more clearly in the 3D image in Fig. 4C. The printing of multiple layers of a square pattern one after another is shown in Fig. 4D. The structure was created by printing 10 consecutive squares atop each other with 30 µm side length. The resulting structure shows a 3D square with walls of 98 ± 12 nm in height and 2.3 ± 0.3 μm in width, showing that the continuous deposition of materials enables the formation of taller features when compared to a single deposition, with minimal distortion in the final structure. Another 3D structure demonstrated was the stacking of cuboids (Fig. 4E) atop one another, whose designed dimensions are summarized in Table 1. The base was a cuboid with designed dimensions of 40 μm × 40 μm × 40 nm. Stacking atop this cuboid was a smaller cuboid with 20 μm × 20 μm × 15 nm. At the top were four cones designed to be 15 nm tall and 400 nm wide. As shown in Fig. 4E and outlined in Table 1, the outcome faithfully followed the design. The base cuboid measured as 42.1 ± 1.6 μm × 41.2 ± 1.5 μm in lateral dimensions and 61 ± 5 nm tall, produced by printing 133 lines at 300 nm separation. The next cuboid atop of the center region of the base measured 21.5 ± 1.3 μm × 20.8 ± 1.4 μm × 15 ± 2 nm created by printing 40 lines with 500 nm separation. The four cones are located at the center of the four quadrants atop the second cuboid. Each cone was produced by dispensing a droplet of liquid polymer with a contact time of 1 s under 200 mbar delivery pressure. The dimensions of the cones measured 340 ± 23 nm at the base and 17 ± 2 nm tall. The capability of printing 3D structures by design has been demonstrated by other designs and using a variety of probes (Supplementary Figure 5). In all cases, the neat polymer ink crosslinked rapidly and maintained its stability for a minimum of 7 days. Additionally, depositing atop of this structure through the delivery of neat polymer does not alter the cured structures underneath. These observations further prove that our approach and materials enabled 3D nanoprinting by design.

### Fractal modes and multi-beam generation from hybrid microlaser resonators [^29f660d7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fractal modes for three and four microsphere topologies

We observe fractal laser modes in the interstices of a microsphere array that are encompassed by three or more spheres. Owing to the reflectivity of polystyrene or silica spheres at grazing incidence, diffraction losses in the resonator of Fig. 1a are reduced in the vicinity of the sphere/water (gain medium) interface and fractal modes appear. Furthermore, the fractal modes associated with specific microsphere arrangements appear to be unique to that geometry. Both three and four sphere topologies have been examined and, for interstitial regions encompassed by three spheres, four distinct fractal laser modes have been observed. Two of these resemble the Sierpinski Triangle and one matches the prediction of Fresnel diffraction simulations. The ability afforded by microfabrication techniques to position microspheres precisely on a mirror surface allows for a desired fractal mode to be produced and to pattern the requisite sphere arrangement over substantial areas.

A light scattering system devised by Sweet et al. comprising reflecting spheres arranged in the form of a trigonal pyramid, yielded fractal patterns in the light intensity distribution emerging from any of the four optical ports ("basins"). In the present experiments, the top sphere of the ref.pyramid has been removed, and a symmetric resonator is realized in which microsphere ensembles in the form of quasi-triangles, rectangles, etc. are positioned between two mirrors (Fig. 1a). Figure 2 is a representative microscope image of a portion of an array of 200 μm diameter spheres within the resonator of Fig. 1a. Recorded in plan view (oriented toward the bottom mirror) with a 20 × microscope objective, this micrograph was acquired with a single pulse of the pump laser, and the spatial scale at lower right indicates a length of 25 μm. The interstice at upper right (where dashed white circles denote the perimeters of the three bordering spheres) shows a laser fractal mode, and a second, weaker mode is developing in the inter-sphere gap at lower right. The dominant feature of the stronger transverse laser mode comprises two superimposed triangles forming a "Star of David" pattern, lying at the junction of three larger triangles separated azimuthally by 120 o. Another unanticipated aspect of the experimental results reported here is that of coupled fractals, illustrated by the inset to Fig. 2 (lower left). In this case, two of the spheres have been separated intentionally and the extension of laser radiation beyond the 3-sphere interstice is evident.

Methods

Stimulus generation

We generated synthetic texture stimuli using the analysis–synthesis procedure described by Portilla and Simoncelli (2000)(software and examples are available at). We measured the statistics of 320 × 320 pixel grayscale texture photographs, each of which served as the prototype for a texture "family". Each image was decomposed using a steerable pyramid, consisting of a bank of filters with four orientations and four spatial scales that tile the Fourier domain and constitute an invertible linear transform (technically, a tight frame). For each filter, we computed the linear responses as well as the local magnitude responses (square root of sum of squared responses of the filter and its Hilbert transform), in rough correspondence with responses of V1 simple and complex cells, respectively. We then computed pairwise products of responses at different positions (for each orientation and scale, within a 7 × 7 spatial neighborhood) for both sets of responses, and (for the magnitude responses only) across different orientations and scales. We also included products of linear filter responses with phase-doubled responses at the next coarsest scale. All of these pairwise products were averaged across the spatial extent of the image, yielding covariances. The covariances of the linear responses are second-order statistics, in that they represent averages of quadratic functions of pixel values. The covariances of magnitudes (and phase-doubled responses) are of higher order, due to the additional nonlinearities in the magnitude and phase-doubling computations. We additionally computed the average magnitude within each frequency band and the third- and fourth-order marginal pixel statistics (equivalently, the skew and kurtosis).

### Natural scene sampling reveals reliable coarse-scale orientation tuning in human V1 [^ca39a4a1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Steerable pyramid

We built two models based on the steerable pyramid: a full model and a constrained model. The full model simulates each neuron in V1 with a receptive field that is tuned for both spatial frequency and orientation, and then allows for variable weighting of these model neurons. The constrained model also simulates populations of V1 neurons, but enforces equal weighting of model neurons across orientation by summing across orientation subbands of the pyramid. It is possible to create steerable pyramid models with a wide range of parameters, each instantiating different hypotheses regarding the tuning properties of individual neurons.

We used a steerable pyramid with eight orientations, seven spatial frequency levels, and a spatial frequency bandwidth of one octave, resulting in tuning profiles that resemble those of individual V1 neurons. The pyramid, and the full model, had a total of 56 filters. After summing across the eight orientation filters, the constrained model consisted of seven filters. The number of spatial frequency levels was determined by the size of the image (512 × 512) and the spatial frequency tuning bandwidth (1 octave). This results in seven filters, with preferred spatial frequencies of 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 cycles per image. These values were then converted to cycles per degree given the size of the image in degrees (12.05°): 21.85, 10.93, 5.46, 2.73, 1.37, 0.68, and 0.34 cycles/degree (cpd) (Fig. S3). In our previous work with the steerable pyramid, we used only the level corresponding to the stimulus spatial frequency. In this study, all levels were fit to the data. We chose to have eight orientations, two more than in our previous study, in order to increase the accuracy of the estimated orientation preference, while maintaining tuning width that was comparable to those measured in primate electrophysiological recordings. For each orientation and spatial frequency, the pyramid includes a quadrature pair: two RFs with different phases. We take the sum of the squares of the responses of the two RFs, yielding an "energy" response, which uniformly tiles all orientations and spatial frequencies.

### Three-dimensional surface imaging: limitations and considerations from the anthropometric perspective [^ed83a9ab]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The use of three-dimensional (3D) surface imaging for clinical measurement purposes has increased considerably as the technology has become more affordable. Like any measurement technique, 3D surface-based anthropometry is subject to a number of limitations and methodological caveats and thus should not be applied without sufficient consideration of its potential strengths and weaknesses. In this brief report, the authors consider 3D surface imaging from the anthropometric perspective, specifically focusing on issues related to the capture of reliable quantitative information from the head and face.

The scaling constraint in Eq. (1) forces the direction of connection on the-th face to be parallel after shrinking, i.e. critical for building a connection with adjacent shrunken polyhedrons. Our work is different from previous work, where the connecting direction was normal to the regular polyhedrons; instead, we determine the connecting direction by bridging the centroids of the deformed polyhedrons in the template. We obtain the length of the connectionbetween the adjacent shrunken polyhedrons:

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^59af4302]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Gridness in trapezoid environments

To simulate the effect of asymmetric boundaries in a trapezoid enclosure on gridness, we took cluster positions from simulations after learning in square environments, and ran an additional learning phase for 250,000 trials. In this new learning phase, the shape of the environment was now a trapezoid (the agent could only move to those locations), and the annealed learning rate schedule continued (starting at 0.0025, reducing to 0.002 at the end). The trapezoid dimensions were 5 × 24 × 50 pixels, closely matching the proportions in(0.2 × 0.9 × 1.9 meters; multiplied by (50/1.9) equals to 5.26, 23.7, and 50).

In order to test whether the asymmetric boundaries of the trapezoid affected gridness, the trapezoid was split into two halves and we computed the grid score for the spatial autocorrelogram on the left (wide) and right (narrow) side of the shape. Due to discretization, we split it as close to equal as possible. The wide half extended from the leftmost pixels to the 17th pixel (338 pixels), and the narrow side extended from the 18th pixel to the 50th pixel (339 pixels).

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^4fae72db]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Through simple geometric calculations, the azimuth and elevation angles of a hidden scene point can be estimated from the slope and height of the illuminated right trapezoidal region of the observation. However, spatially extended hidden scenes do not create sharp shadows. They instead produce a superposition thereof, that is dependent on the geometry of the scene from the vantage of the observed ceiling portion, appearing as a region of highly informative penumbra(see Fig. 2 a for an example photograph of penumbra). The penumbra region encodes information about the geometry of the hidden scene from the perspective of the ceiling, along two dimensions (i.e. in azimuth and elevation angles). Efficiently extracting this information for reconstructing a general spatially extended scene is achievable through a computational algorithm presented later on.

### Natural scene sampling reveals reliable coarse-scale orientation tuning in human V1 [^1dc69b7f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Analysis pipeline for a single voxel.

Top, full model. Bottom, constrained model. Natural scene images were converted to grayscale and passed as input to a steerable pyramid (shown here with only four orientations and three spatial frequencies for visualization purposes). Each filter yielded an energy response that was sampled by the voxel pRF, resulting in a scalar output for each filter. Linear regression was performed on the response amplitudes observed for each voxel with filter output values as predictors. This procedure yielded a set of model weights, which were subsequently used to simulate responses to a range of gratings in order to determine the voxel's preferred orientation and spatial frequency. The constrained model (bottom) was identical to the full model except for an additional step of summing model outputs across orientations. As a result, the constrained model yielded a weight for each spatial frequency filter but enforced equal contribution across orientations.

### Pituitary adenoma with posterior area invasion of cavernous sinus: surgical anatomy, approach, and outcomes [^b118599d]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

We found a series of Knosp grade 3A-4 pituitary adenomas in the posterior areas of the cavernous sinus (CS), a triangular-like structure on axial MRI. In this study, we dissected the surrounding neurovascular structure, discussed the surgical approach, and analyzed outcomes for patients with this invasion into this area. Eight embalmed adult cadaveric specimens were prepared for this study to demonstrate in detail the surgical anatomy related to this triangular-like structure. We used the "two points and one line" method to determine the surgical approach, and 35 cases with this area invasion were retrospectively reviewed. According to the endoscopic and microsurgical anatomy, the triangular-like structure appearing on the axial MRI is correlated with a square-based pyramid structure in the CS, and the upper surface is the posterior portion of the oculomotor triangle. A total of 37 posterior areas of the CS were involved in 35 patients. The accuracy of the "two points and one line" method in predicting the surgical approach is 86.5% (32/37). All three patients with Knosp 3A underwent gross total resection (GTR). Twenty (62.5%) patients with Knosp 4 underwent GTR, 9 (28.1%) patients underwent subtotal resection, and 3 (9.4%) patients underwent partial resection. Preoperative symptoms were alleviated to varying degrees, and no worsening occurred. Postoperative complications included two (5.7%) cases of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, one (2.9%) case of meningitis, two (5.7%) cases of permanent diabetes insipidus, and three (8.6%) cases of transient cranial nerve palsy. The "two points and one line" method is of great value in predicting the surgical approach of pituitary adenomas with CS invasion. The anatomic description of this particular square-based pyramid structure in the CS refines the understanding of pituitary adenomas with CS invasion.

### Endoscopic shield: barrier enclosure during the endoscopy to prevent aerosol droplets during the COVID-19 pandemic [^23a1db09]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Video description

The device is a plastic cube with sides measuring 45 cm. Four square, 1.5-mm thick plastic plates were glued together, with 2 holes in the plate on the facial side. With the patient in a left lateral position, the bottom and left side of the cube are open, and the head of the patient is covered, especially on the facial side (Fig. 1 A). In our situation, a 170-cm tall endoscopist in standard PPE performed upper GI endoscopy on a mannequin with the mouthpiece placed as usual.

Details of the endoscopic shield. A, This device is a plastic cube with sides measuring 45 cm. With the patient in a left lateral position, the bottom and left side of the cube are open, and the head of the patient is covered. B and C, The facial side of the cube contains 2 small holes, and the endoscope is inserted through 1 of the holes, selected according to the size of the patient's face and the height of the patient's mouth. The other hole is closed with medical tape.

The facial side of the cube contains 2 small holes, each 2 cm in diameter, and the endoscope is inserted through 1 of the holes, selected according to the size of the patient's face and the height of the patient's mouth (Figs. 1 B and C). The other hole is closed with medical tape (Fig. 1 C). The size of the hole was determined based on the diameter of the TJF-260V side-view endoscope (Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan); it has a diameter of 13.5 mm and working space because the TJF-260V has the largest diameter of any endoscope in Japan and is used for urgent ERCP.

A single episode of reflex vomiting or cough was simulated by bursting a small nitrile rubber balloon containing 10 mL of fluorescent dye. The balloon was attached to a tube and placed in the hypopharynx of the mannequin, and oxygen was pumped through the tube inside the mannequin until the balloon burst. Simulated endoscopy was then performed without and with placement of the endoscopic shield. The scene for each simulation was illuminated with ultraviolet light to visualize the area of scattered dye droplets.

### Two-dimensional materials in functional three-dimensional architectures with applications in photodetection and imaging [^b661a65e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Efficient and highly functional three-dimensional systems that are ubiquitous in biology suggest that similar design architectures could be useful in electronic and optoelectronic technologies, extending their levels of functionality beyond those achievable with traditional, planar two-dimensional platforms. Complex three-dimensional structures inspired by origami, kirigami have promise as routes for two-dimensional to three-dimensional transformation, but current examples lack the necessary combination of functional materials, mechanics designs, system-level architectures, and integration capabilities for practical devices with unique operational features. Here, we show that two-dimensional semiconductor/semi-metal materials can play critical roles in this context, through demonstrations of complex, mechanically assembled three-dimensional systems for light-imaging capabilities that can encompass measurements of the direction, intensity and angular divergence properties of incident light. Specifically, the mechanics of graphene and MoS 2, together with strategically configured supporting polymer films, can yield arrays of photodetectors in distinct, engineered three-dimensional geometries, including octagonal prisms, octagonal prismoids, and hemispherical domes.

### Exact, time-dependent analytical equations for spiral trajectories and matching gradient and density-correction waveforms [^a4c9208e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2026). Medium credibility.

2.7 Moment nulling trapezoids

Designing a pair of trapezoids to null zeroth and first moments of a single gradient waveform is common; for spiral imaging, the design of "vector" trapezoid pairs that are played out in both in‐plane directions and are freely rotatable under gradient constraints has not been shown to our knowledge. We have developed a fast algorithm for joint design of this trapezoid pair, which reduces their total duration compared with those made using separate, single‐channel designs. Joint design ensures simultaneous nulling across both axes while maximizing gradient usage without exceeding system limits, resulting in more efficient and symmetric gradient waveforms. Using the notation illustrated in Figure 2, we define variables t a and t b to be the effective total duration (area divided by amplitude) of two trapezoids A and B, respectively, and the effective ramp time t r to be one‐half the actual ramp time. Defining M0 and M1 as the relative gradient moments at the end of spiral waveforms, we write matrix equations for the desired moments of the gradient waveforms and invert them, givingWe enforce these equations in the following iterative solution:

FIGURE 2
Illustration of trapezoids used for pair‐wise design of M1 and M0 nulling with full rotational compatibility.

Step 0: Initialize with t ra = t rb = 0.5*Gmax/Smax, t a = 2 t ra, t b = t rb.

Step 1: Solve for gradient amplitudes, using Equations (19) and (20).

Step 2: Normalize A and B vector gradient amplitudes separately by factorsand, respectively.

Step 3: Solve for new trapezoid durations, using Equation (21).

Iterating these 3 steps converges on a solution quickly. One can modify this approach routine (see code) to account for nontrapezoid (triangular) waveforms.

### Gradient matters via filament diameter-adjustable 3D printing [^c3c92cbf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Gradient matters with hierarchical structures endow the natural world with excellent integrity and diversity. Currently, direct ink writing 3D printing is attracting tremendous interest, and has been used to explore the fabrication of 1D and 2D hierarchical structures by adjusting the diameter, spacing, and angle between filaments. However, it is difficult to generate complex 3D gradient matters owing to the inherent limitations of existing methods in terms of available gradient dimension, gradient resolution, and shape fidelity. Here, we report a filament diameter-adjustable 3D printing strategy that enables conventional extrusion 3D printers to produce 1D, 2D, and 3D gradient matters with tunable heterogeneous structures by continuously varying the volume of deposited ink on the printing trajectory. In detail, we develop diameter-programmable filaments by customizing the printing velocity and height. To achieve high shape fidelity, we specially add supporting layers at needed locations. Finally, we showcase multi-disciplinary applications of our strategy in creating horizontal, radial, and axial gradient structures, letter-embedded structures, metastructures, tissue-mimicking scaffolds, flexible electronics, and time-driven devices. By showing the potential of this strategy, we anticipate that it could be easily extended to a variety of filament-based additive manufacturing technologies and facilitate the development of functionally graded structures.

### An image-based finite difference model for simulating restricted diffusion [^e20e6b0b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Water diffusion in tissues is generally restricted and often anisotropic. Neural tissue is of particular interest, since it is well known that injury alters diffusion in a characteristic manner. Both Monte Carlo simulations and approximate analytical models have previously been reported in attempts to predict water diffusion behavior in the central nervous system. These methods have relied on axonal models, which assume simple geometries (e.g., ellipsoids, cylinders, and square prisms) and ignore the thickness of the myelin sheath. The current work describes a method for generating models using synthetic images. The computations are based on a 3D finite difference (FD) approximation of the diffusion equation. The method was validated with known analytic solutions for diffusion in a cylindrical pore and in a hexagonal array of cylinders. Therefore, it is envisioned that, by exploiting histologic images of neuronal tissues as input model, current method allows investigating the water diffusion behavior inside biological tissues and potentially assessing the status of neural injury and regeneration.

### Conformal elasticity of mechanism-based metamaterials [^9c7263a8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In the simulations (ii), we use three kinds of boundary conditions, dipole, bending and pure shear, by imposing displacement of specific nodes, as described in Fig. 2. We extract the coordinates (position, angle) of all the squares and use these to compute the dilation and shear field (method described in Supplementary Note 1) and to calculate the relative amount of shear, as well as the accuracy of conformal map fits and of the analytic bulk-boundary correspondence (Fig. 3). Simulations are performed for a series of strains at identical material geometry as (i) and separately at linearly small strain across a range of hinge thicknesses ℓ = {0.02, 0.033, 0.055, 0.092, 0.155, 0.258, 0.431, 0.719, 1.199, 2.0} mm.

Experimental protocol

We 3D printed an elongated meta-beam of length 306 mm, width 64 mm and height 40 mm, consisting of a checkerboard of lattice of 48 × 10 squares of side a = 4.8 mm connected by hinges of thickness ℓ = 0.2 mm using a Connex 500 Stratasys 3D printer and the proprietary Stratasys Agilus 30 material (30 Shore A). This material is viscoelastic, its Young's modulus at short times is E = 3.3 MPa and E = 0.6 MPa at long times (see, e.g. Dykstra et al.for a calibration). For imaging purposes, we 3D printed black square-shaped pads (3.6mm) on one edge of the sample (proprietary Stratasys material: Vero Black).

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

2.2 Stimuli

The stimuli were cuboids that differed in their shape (oblongness) and roughness. They were produced by 3D printing (Object30Pro, Stratasys, material VeroClear, nominal resolution 600–1,600 dpi). With regard to shape, the cuboids had the same diagonal length (d = 56.57 mm) and width (w = 30 mm) but differed in the relative length of their sides such that five different levels of oblongness were created (lengths of the shorter/longer side 40.0/40.0, 35.6/44.0, 31.2/47.2, 26.8/49.8, 22.4/51.9 mm; see Figure 1). Stimuli were always presented in the same orientation, that is, with the shorter side facing towards the participant (Figure 1 b). The surface of each cuboid possessed a certain roughness. Roughness was defined as one‐dimensional (1D) square‐wave function with an amplitude of 0.3 mm and was varied on five levels by groove widths of 0.25, 0.34, 0.42, 0.51, or 0.59 mm, respectively. Ridge width always equaled groove width. In every trial, a standard (31.2 mm length for shape, 0.42 mm groove width for roughness) had to be judged against a comparison stimulus (1 of the 5 levels of roughness/shape).

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^35808c57]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Origami offers an avenue to program three-dimensional shapes via scale-independent and non-destructive fabrication. While such programming has focused on the geometry of a tessellation in a single transient state, here we provide a complete description of folding smooth saddle shapes from concentrically pleated squares. When the offset between square creases of the pattern is uniform, it is known as the pleated hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar) origami. Despite its popularity, much remains unknown about the mechanism that produces such aesthetic shapes. We show that the mathematical limit of the elegant shape folded from concentrically pleated squares, with either uniform or non-uniform (e.g. functionally graded, random) offsets, is invariantly a hyperbolic paraboloid. Using our theoretical model, which connects geometry to mechanics, we prove that a folded hypar origami exhibits bistability between two symmetric configurations. Further, we tessellate the hypar origami and harness its bistability to encode multi-stable metasurfaces with programmable non-Euclidean geometries.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

Left atrial and right atrial size measurement — pediatric echocardiography methods are illustrated and described: apical 4‑chamber and 2‑chamber views at ventricular end‑systole show left atrial major‑axis length and planimetered areas, and "Planimetered RA areas or RA volumes calculated from the product of RA area and major-axis length may be better at assessing RA size, though the sample sizes in most studies have been small". It also states that "As with LA volumes, 3D echocardiography may provide a useful means by which to measure RA volumes using the polyhedral surface algorithm". Additionally, "Raw values and indexed values on the basis of BSA in normal adults are available".

Results

Trap arrays and control potentials

Our surface ion trap chip is fabricated in similar manner to that described in ref.and consists of two equilateral triangular trap arrays with side length of ≃40 and ≃80 μm, respectively (Fig. 1a, b), both with a distance of ≃40 μm between the ions and the nearest electrode surface. The shapes of radio-frequency (RF) electrodes of the arrays are optimized by a linear-programming algorithm that yields electrode shapes with low fragmentation, and requires only a single RF-voltage source for operation. To design different and even non-periodic arrays for dedicated trap distances, we can apply the same algorithm to yield globally optimal electrode shapes. Resulting electrode shapes may look significantly different, but will have comparable complexity, spatial extent and the same number of control electrodes per trap site. Therefore, we expect that different arrays will not require different fabrication techniques (Methods). The two arrays are spaced by ≃5 mm on the chip, and only one of them is operated at a given time. Although we achieve similar results in both arrays, the following discussion is focussed on the 80 μm array.

Three-dimensional confinement of 25 Mg + ions is provided by a potential φ RF oscillating at Ω RF from a single RF electrode driven at Ω RF /(2 π) = 48.3 MHz with an approximate peak voltage U RF = 20 V. Setting the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of the array and in the surface plane of the chip, the RF potential features three distinct trap sites at T0 ≃(−46,0,37) μm,… Owing to the electrode symmetry under rotations of ± 2 π /3 around the z -axis, it is often sufficient to consider T0 only, as all our findings apply to T1 and T2 after an appropriate rotation. Further, the RF potential exhibits another trap site at ≃(0,0,81) μm (above the centre of the array); this 'ancillary' trap is used for loading as well as for re-capturing ions that escaped from the other trap sites. We approximate the RF confinement at position r by a pseudopotential, cp. ref. where Q denotes the charge and m the mass of the ion, and E RF (r) is the field amplitude produced by the electrode. Calculations of trapping potentials are based on ref.and utilizing the software package. Equipotential lines of φ ps are shown in Fig. 1c–e.

Ellipsoid fitting for Pt nanoparticle

For analysis of the shape of the Pt nanoparticle, we fitted an ellipsoid to the determined surface atomic structure. To find the closest ellipsoid, the positions of the defined surface atoms were exploited to fit the parameters in the ellipsoid equation. The fitted principal semi-axes in the ellipsoid were determined to be [0.92, 0.36, 0.15], [0.38, −0.92, −0.11], and [−0.10, −0.15, 0.98] (in the lab-coordinates) with corresponding lengths of 20.0, 16.9, and 13.6 Å, respectively.

### Mean-field theory of random close packings of axisymmetric particles [^90ce5be7]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal random packing of non-spherical particles is an open problem with great significance in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields. So far, this search has been performed only empirically on a case-by-case basis, in particular, for shapes like dimers, spherocylinders and ellipsoids of revolution. Here we present a mean-field formalism to estimate the packing density of axisymmetric non-spherical particles. We derive an analytic continuation from the sphere that provides a phase diagram predicting that, for the same coordination number, the density of monodisperse random packings follows the sequence of increasing packing fractions: spheres < oblate ellipsoids < prolate ellipsoids < dimers < spherocylinders. We find the maximal packing densities of 73.1% for spherocylinders and 70.7% for dimers, in good agreement with the largest densities found in simulations. Moreover, we find a packing density of 73.6% for lens-shaped particles, representing the densest random packing of the axisymmetric objects studied so far.

### Evaluation of optimal density weighting for regridding [^788aefb4]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Density weighting is a necessary component of the regridding algorithm for interpolating nonuniformly sampled data points onto a regular grid. Differing concepts of optimality for the density weighting have been proposed previously. The present study reviews some of these concepts and evaluates the accuracy of different techniques by comparison with the image obtained by a computationally intensive least squares minimization. A variant on one of the techniques is proposed that yields the highest accuracy of those studied.

### Combined expansion and STED microscopy reveals altered fingerprints of postsynaptic nanostructure across brain regions in ASD-related SHANK3-deficiency [^38a09aa9]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

First the measurements were selected for analysis. Volume in pixels was converted to nm³ by multiplication with the acquired voxel size (43 × 43 x 120 nm) and normalized to the cubed mean AZ-PSD distance of the respective animal. Similarly, the smoothed mesh surface in pixels was converted to nm² by multiplication with the acquired pixel size (43 × 43 nm) and normalized to the squared mean AZ-PSD distance of the respective animal. The volume ratio was defined as the ratio of the summed volume of parts popping in or out of a fitted ellipsoid and the total volume of a synapse. Additionally, sphericity and five 3D Moments were included in the analysis. 3D Moments are shape descriptors invariant with respect to change of scale, translation and rotation, and describe the variations of the object from the ellipsoid. Finally, objects with volumes below the size of a cuboid defined by an edge-size of twice the theoretical resolution limit of a confocal microscope (2 × 200² × 500 nm) were rejected. The resulting value of 180.3 pixels was rounded to 200 pixels as exclusion threshold.

Regarding surgical interventions for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for PDEMA, NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that visualizing the entire marginal surface of an irregular surgical specimen is critical to PDEMA success. Typically, this visualization is achieved by flattening topographically complex surfaces onto a single plane and sectioning parallel to this plane. Avoid sampling methods such as perpendicular sectioning, also known as "breadloafing", which do not achieve direct visualization of the entire surgical margin and prevent PDEMA.

In the low-pressure (LP) CVD process, an adequate sulfur vapor was conveyed downstream by a flow of Ar (50 sccm) and O 2 (6 sccm). The O 2 carrier was introduced to oxidize the Mo foil for directly releasing chemically active MoO 3− x (x = 2, 3). This intermediate precursor presents relatively low sublimation temperature of about 500 °C, right below the melting point of the soda-lime glass. Notably, this temperature is much lower than that needed for the direct release of Mo atoms from Mo foils (~2600 °C). Generally, MoO 3− x is regarded as active species for the CVD synthesis of MoS 2. As shown in Fig. 1b, at relatively short growth time of 8 min, a 14 × 6 cm 2 uniform, full-covered MoS 2 film is synthesized on the glass substrate at 720 °C by a LPCVD strategy (see the Methods section). After this growth process, deformation of the glass substrate is negligible; however, its surface color changes from transparent to light brown, indicating the formation of MoS 2.

### Creating a library of generalized fourier sampling patterns for irregular 2D regions of support [^ad8490e3]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Multiple-region MRI (mrMRI) represents a generalization of the Shannon sampling theorem to permit sparse k-space sampling whenever the scanned object or its high-contrast edges are confined to multiple known regions. Use of an optimal mrMRI sampling pattern produces an image with root-mean-squared (RMS) noise over the supporting regions equal to the RMS noise in a conventional Fourier image with the same total area of support. Analytical solutions for such sampling patterns have been described previously for all arrangements of two or three (noncollinear) supporting regions. This work describes a robust numerical method for creating a library of optimal and near-optimal mrMRI sampling patterns for more complicated geometries. The average noise amplification over all sampling patterns in the demonstration library was only 4%, with 30% of the sampling patterns resulting in no noise amplification whatsoever.

For cross-sectional area to height ratio, initial studies used > 10 cm²/m as a threshold for intervention due to increased risk of adverse events, and more contemporary reports from the same group have used ≥ 10 cm²/m (rather than > 10 cm²/m) as the threshold predictive of increased risk.

Mapping local fields via printed nanostructures

In addition to the central role of the double-layer flow system, we investigated the map of the local fields with the printed nanostructures for a deeper understanding of the field-defined geometries. The domain of the ions deposited on the PR surface formed a local field around the openings. This local field can be imagined as a cushion that competes with the externally applied constant field to take a semi-circular shape (Fig. 2a). Two adjacent half-circles squeeze the external-field lines into an electric funnelthat forms the guiding path for the charged NPs (Fig. 2a). Here we wished to quantify the correlations between the two fields.

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (2D based formulas, truncated ellipsoid) indicates partial correction for shape distortions and less dependence on geometrical assumptions than linear measurements; however, this approach requires good image quality and properly oriented parasternal short‑axis views without oblique planes and good epicardial definition, uses a cumbersome methodology with higher measurement variability, and is limited by few published normative data and limited prognostic data.

### Single-pixel three-dimensional imaging with time-based depth resolution [^240427aa]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To enhance the range precision beyond the limits imposed by the sampling rate of the system, methods such as parametric deconvolutionand curve fitting can be used. However, often these methods can be computationally intensive, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. Instead we choose to apply cubic spline interpolation to the reconstructed temporal signal at each pixel location, which introduces minimal computational overhead. The depth map of the scene (Fig. 2f) is subsequently determined by finding the maximum in these interpolated signals. In addition, the scene reflectivity (Fig. 2g) can be calculated by averaging the image cube along the longitudinal axis. Utilizing both the depth and reflectivity information, a 3D image of the scene is then reconstructed.

It is worth mentioning that, with the assumption that there is only one surface at each transverse pixel location, our depth estimation (see detail in Methods) works well for scenes that have smooth features, such as the mannequin head and ball, since the reconstructed temporal signals should be slowly varying between sample points. We note that the depth accuracy is limited by the amplitude noise of the data points, over-interpolation only increases the depth precision, but not necessarily the accuracy. In addition, more interpolation adds more processing time, therefore, in our experiments we chose to interpolate by a factor of five times when investigating the static scenes with 20 pulses per pattern (Figs 3, 4, 5), and four times when investigating scenes with motion (Fig. 6), balancing the computational overhead and 3D image quality.

### A refined hemispheric model of normal human aortic valve and root geometry [^dfd67878]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Better understanding of aortic root geometry could improve diagnosis and reconstruction of pathologic aortic valves. In this study, a previous model of hemispheric aortic valve leaflets nested within a cylindrical aorta was refined in humans with normal aortic valves.

Methods

Using 1-mm axial slices, high-resolution computed tomographic angiograms from 10 normal aortic roots were used to generate high-density X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of valve structures using Mathematica software. Three-dimensional least squares regression analyses of leaflet and sinus coordinates were employed to compare multiple geometric models of aortic valve and root geometry. Shapes and dimensions of all root structures were evaluated and compared.

Results

Aortic valve geometry was roughly hemispherical, but the valve base was elliptical (minor-major diameter ratio = .66). Dimensional fits of the leaflet-sinus complexes also were better using ellipsoidal geometry, with taller leaflets than predicted by hemispheres. The commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps was located uniformly at the posterior junction of the base minor diameter and circumference, with the center of the right coronary cusp opposite. The subcommissural post areas flared outward by 5° to 10°, and the volume of the right coronary leaflet-sinus complex was 12.4% and 10.7% larger than the noncoronary cusps and left cusps, respectively.

Conclusions

The normal human aortic valve is an elliptical structure, and ellipsoidal refinements improve representation of leaflet geometry. The left and noncoronary cusps commissure is located posteriorly; the right coronary cusp is located anteriorly. This model could be useful in quantifying pathologic geometry and in engineering devices for aortic valve reconstruction.

### Mapping thickness of nasal septal cartilage [^6dd6fc53]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the thickness of the septal cartilage relating to septal advancement surgery. Fourteen Korean adult cadavers were used. A rectangular coordinate was used, with the x-axis horizontal on the maxillary crest and the y-axis a vertical right angle to the x-axis on the anterior nasal spine. The length and the height of the septal cartilages were divided evenly in 5 dimensions, and the thickness was measured of intersecting points of grating. The mean length and height of the cartilaginous septum was 3.31 ± 0.53 and 2.99 ± 0.47 cm, respectively. The thickness of the septal cartilage varied according to the site (0.74–3.03 mm). The thickest area was the septal base (0% of the septal height) anterior to the vomer (2.19–3.03 mm). The thinnest area (0.74–0. 97 mm) was just above the base area at 20% of the septal height. The anterior-inferior part of the site above the thinnest area was 1.03 to 1.22 mm in thickness and the superior-posterior part was 1.26 to 1.50 mm. The anterior-inferior part was thinner than the superior-posterior one. The thickness map of the nasal septum might be usefully applied in septal surgery, particularly in septal advancement.

Left ventricular mass (LVM) by linear (M‑mode) dimensions — method and key limitations — is described as modeling the left ventricle as a prolate ellipse with a major/minor axis ratio of 2: 1 and converting the myocardial shell volume to mass using the specific gravity of myocardium (1.05 g/ml). There are four principal limitations in the calculation of LVM using linear methods: the "Cube" formula is not accurate when the 2: 1 axis ratio requirement is not met, cubing primary measurements magnifies small errors, these measurements are insensitive to small changes in mass, and they are highly dependent on imaging quality and observer expertise.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^22bca5a4]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Two‑dimensional echocardiography for LVM — methods, validation, and limitations — is summarized: the most commonly used 2D methods are based on the area‑length formula and the truncated ellipsoid model; both were validated in the early 1980s in animal models and by comparing premorbid echocardiograms with measured LV weight at autopsy. In the presence of shape distortions such as post‑myocardial infarction remodelling, the geometric assumptions remain problematic, and the main limitations relate to image quality and the temporal resolution of 2D imaging.

Normalizing aortic root and ascending aortic diameters for body size — The 4.0 cm and 4.5 cm diameter thresholds are intended for patients whose height or body surface area (BSA) is within 1 to 2 standard deviations of the mean, and in those significantly shorter or taller these diameters need to be adjusted downward or upward. In pediatrics, the z-score is routinely used, but multiple BSA formulae and multiple z-score calculators exist, and the z-score is not typically used to report the degree of aortic dilation in adults. For adults, aortic size index (ASI) is defined as aortic diameter (cm)/BSA(m²) and is a better predictor of adverse aortic events than diameter alone with a nomogram stratifying low-, medium-, and high-risk groups; aortic height index (AHI) is defined as aortic diameter (cm)/patient height (m) and was reported to perform at least as well as the ASI and to be simpler to calculate.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^317deddb]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

3.1.2 Simulation (a). The size of

The purpose of this simulation was to examine the accuracy of the mesoscopic Lorentz cavity approximation, Equation (8) through Equations (12) and (13), as a function of the size ofcompared with the size of the magnetic inclusions. Figure 4 gives an overview of the simulation. The coarse‐grained Larmor frequencywas averaged around the center pointof a population of (a1) randomly placed parallel rectangular rods, (a2) randomly placed dots, (a3) long randomly oriented rods and (a4) random sheets arranged in parallel along thedirection. The rods (a1) were made by generating a2D grid with a weighted random number of zeros and ones to vary the volume fraction as. The 2D grid was then repeated along the third dimension to yield agrid with purely 2D Poissonian structural correlations. The random dots (a2) were generated as (a1) but placed randomly on a 3Dgrid with similar volume fractions. Each rod/dot thus had a widthof one grid unit and the rods a length of 400 grid units. The long randomly oriented rods (a3) were made by randomly placing rods with a width of three grid units and length of 800 grid units in a3D grid. The rods were allowed to overlap, and we used periodic boundaries to contain the whole rod. The volume fraction was varied as. The sheets (a4) were made by placing rods of similar dimensions in a2D grid and repeating it along the third dimension to yield agrid with similar volume fractions. These scenarios correspond to systems with long‐range 3D and 2D structural correlations, respectively. 100 different configurations were generated for (a1)–(a4) for each volume fraction. When calculating, the microstructurewas only considered within the mesoscopic region(Figure 4A). The exterior region was instead averaged according to Equation (10). We investigated the dependence of the size and shape ofwhen calculatingin comparison with the true Larmor frequencycalculated with Equation (8) using the magnetic microstructure for the entire region and averaged within the same mesoscopic sphereas(Figure 4B). In addition, we investigated the influence of various shapes for, i.e. a cube, sphere and cylinder, for decomposing the sample into mesoscopic and macroscopic regions in the calculation of. The side lengthofwas varied from four times the width of the rods to half the size of the sample. We also computed the field at the center point, where the microstructure was removed within(Figure 4C). The mean relative error(for (a1)) was then calculated by averaging over the different realizations for each configuration. We also computed the mean squared differenceand compared it with(for (a1)–(a4)).

It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### Six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID) [^56c6047d]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

1. DEFINE AND UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND ITS CAUSES

Our starting point is that a public health problem has already been identified as requiring intervention. Often this results from a needs assessment, for which there are several practical guides, or from a political process such as a manifesto commitment.

Clarifying the problem with stakeholders, using the existing research evidence, is the first step in intervention development. Some health problems are relatively easily defined and measured, such as the prevalence of a readily diagnosed disease, but others have several dimensions and may be perceived differently by different groups. For instance, 'unhealthy housing' could be attributed to poor construction, antisocial behaviour, overcrowding or lack of amenities. Definitions therefore need to be sufficiently clear and detailed to avoid ambiguity or confusion. Is 'the problem' a risk factor for a disease/condition (eg, smoking) or the disease/condition itself (eg, lung cancer)? If the former, it is important to be aware of the factor's importance relative to other risk factors. If this is modest even a successful intervention to change it might be insufficient to change the ultimate outcome.

Once defined one should try to establish how the problem is socially and spatially distributed, including who is currently most/least likely to benefit from an intervention. It is also important to consider what interventions or policies currently exist and why they are not deemed adequate.

Having defined the problem, one needs to understand, as far as possible, what are the immediate (proximal) and underlying (distal) influences that give rise to it. These are often suggested by the distribution of the problem, its history and relationship to the life course. It is only by understanding what shapes and perpetuates the problem (the causal pathways) that one can identify possible ways to intervene. Case study step 1 applies Funnell and Rogers' useful questions for problem analysis to GBV (ref. p. 160). The main influences on the problem can also be classified according to the socioecological model. It can often be helpful to present the various causal pathways affecting the problem diagrammatically: figure 1 attempts to do this for GBV, distinguishing different levels of the socioecological model.

### Ultrafast 3D printing with submicrometer features using electrostatic jet deflection [^6b9a62b4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Additive manufacturing technologies based on layer-by-layer deposition of material ejected from a nozzle provide unmatched versatility but are limited in terms of printing speed and resolution. Electrohydrodynamic jetting uniquely allows generating submicrometer jets that can reach speeds above 1ms -1, but such jets cannot be precisely collected by too slow mechanical stages. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the voltage applied to electrodes located around the jet, its trajectory can be continuously adjusted with lateral accelerations up to 10 6 ms -2. Through electrostatically deflecting the jet, 3D objects with submicrometer features can be printed by stacking nanofibers on top of each other at layer-by-layer frequencies as high as 2000 Hz. The fast jet speed and large layer-by-layer frequencies achieved translate into printing speeds up to 0.5ms -1 in-plane and 0.4mms -1 in the vertical direction, three to four orders of magnitude faster than techniques providing equivalent feature sizes.

### Identifying domains of applicability of machine learning models for materials science [^196a563d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Domains of applicability of three 2d-models of a noisy third-degree polynomial.

Three different models, linear (top), radial basis function (rbf, center), and polynomial (poly, bottom), are shown approximating the same distribution of two independent features x₁ ~ N (0, 2) and x₂ ~ N (0, 2), and the target property, where N (μ, ϵ²) denotes a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation ϵ. Test points are plotted in 3d plots against the prediction surface of the models (color corresponds to absolute error) where the DA is highlighted in gray. The distributions of individual errors for the DA (gray) and globally (black) are shown in the 2d plots of each panel with the mean error (solid) and the 95th percentile (95 perc./dashed) marked by vertical lines. Note that the global error distribution of the linear model has a considerably long tail, which is capped in the image.

### How I read an article that uses machine learning methods [^0f2f5676]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Step 1: Understand the problem being addressed. The first step in reading an ML paper is to understand the problem that the authors are trying to solve and, more importantly, understand the clinical or scientific impact of solving this problem. In other words, if the aim of the study is to solve a clinical problem, how does the answer or the recommendation provided by the algorithm help physicians or researchers in their day-to-day practice, and is this solution mature enough to be implemented in clinical workflows? Major clinical problems in health care can mainly affect either patient outcomes or operations (can I make the process easier and faster for the patient and the health care system?).

Step 2: Assess the quality of the data. The quality of the data used to build the ML model is crucial for the validity of the results. Following are some questions that can be used to evaluate the data:
1 Sample size: Is the size of the training, validation, and test sets enough to build a reproducible and generalizable ML model? Is this size of the data appropriate for the chosen methods (ie, some methods are "data-hungry" and understanding which methods require larger datasets is key)? However, different algorithms require different data types (image, tabular, text, or others) and sizes, and there are no rules of thumb or formulas that can estimate the perfect data.
2 Relevance: Are the data appropriate and relevant to the problem that the model is trying to solve?
3 Accuracy: How are the data collected and annotated (human vs natural language process). How are the data transformed to make it ready for ML use, etc.
4 Consistency: Are the data consistent? Do they have any missing values and how the authors dealt with this?
5 Representativeness: The data should be representative of the population being studied.
6 Balance: The data should be balanced, with roughly equal representation of all relevant classes or groups. However, most health care data are unbalanced. It is critical to understand how the authors dealt with unbalanced data.
7 Bias: To evaluate bias in data, it is important to look at the distribution of certain characteristics, such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status, among the samples in the data set, and how the data were collected. This will help to identify any disparities or overrepresentation of certain groups, which can indicate the presence of bias in the data. It is critical to evaluate bias at this stage because if this is not addressed properly, it could produce a biased model.

### Charting the landscape of priority problems in psychiatry, part 1: classification and diagnosis [^033871c3]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Contemporary psychiatry faces major challenges. Its syndrome-based disease classification is not based on mechanisms and does not guide treatment, which largely depends on trial and error. The development of therapies is hindered by ignorance of potential beneficiary patient subgroups. Neuroscientific and genetics research have yet to affect disease definitions or contribute to clinical decision making. In this challenging setting, what should psychiatric research focus on? In two companion papers, we present a list of problems nominated by clinicians and researchers from different disciplines as candidates for future scientific investigation of mental disorders. These problems are loosely grouped into challenges concerning nosology and diagnosis (this Personal View) and problems related to pathogenesis and aetiology (in the companion Personal View). Motivated by successful examples in other disciplines, particularly the list of Hilbert's problems in mathematics, this subjective and eclectic list of priority problems is intended for psychiatric researchers, helping to re-focus existing research and providing perspectives for future psychiatric science.

### The natural history of the growth of the hand: I. hand area as a percentage of body surface area [^61d2446b]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The use of a patient's own hand as a tool to estimate the area of burn injury is well documented. The area of the palmar surface of one hand has been estimated to be 1 percent of the body surface area. The area of the palmar surface of the hand was measured to test the accuracy of this estimate and then compared with the body surface area as calculated by formulas in common use. This study also sought to determine the natural history of the growth of the hand to permit development of a readily available, bedside means of estimating hand area and body surface area. Bilateral hand tracings were obtained from 800 volunteers ranging in age from 2 to 89 years. The area of each tracing was determined using an integrating planimeter. The height and weight of each individual were measured, and his/her body surface area was calculated. The palmar hand's percentage of body surface area was determined by calculating the quotient for hand area divided by body surface area. Additionally, the width of the hand was measured from the ulnar aspect at the palmar digital crease of the small finger to the point where the thumb rested against the base of the index finger. The length of the hand was measured from the middle of the interstylon to the tip of the middle finger. These two figures were multiplied together to obtain a product which approximated the area of the hand. Based on the most commonly used DuBois formula for calculating body surface area, the area of palmar surface of the hand corresponds to 0.78 ± 0.08 percent of the body surface area in adults. The percentage varies somewhat with age and reaches a maximum of 0.87 ± 0.06 percent in young children. Multiplying the length of the hand by its width overestimates the area of the hand as determined by planimetry by only 2 percent. A patient's own hand may be used as a complementary, readily available template for estimation of burn area or other areas of disease or injury. In adults, the area of tracing of the outline of the hand is 0.78 percent of the body surface area, whereas in children, this number tends to be slightly higher. In the emergency room or on the wards, a simple product of length multiplied by width of the hand will closely approximate the area as determined by planimetry. This method allows a more accurate determination of the area of the palmar surface of the hand than the 1 percent estimate, which may lead to an overestimation of the size of a burn wound in adults.

### Direct strain correlations at the single-atom level in three-dimensional core-shell interface structures [^d373eb44]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

(a) The tomogram was sliced along the fcc [001] direction for each atomic layer, and the 2D local maxima in each slice were identified. Next, the same 3D Gaussian fitting procedure was repeated using the determined 2D local maxima positions from all the atomic layers with various cropped volume sizes (side lengths of 3–7 pixels). The fitted position from the volume size which showed the smallest residual of the fitting was added to the traced atom list if it does not violate the minimum distance constraint of 2.0 Å (Particle 1) or 1.7 Å (Particle 2).

(b) For each atomic layer slice, a 2D atom number density was calculated for each pixel by counting the number of atoms within the distance of 1.9 Å from each pixel. We identified the connected regions where the 2D atom number density becomes 0 and classified them into three different categories: region of artifacts due to imperfect tomogram reconstruction (for the regions whose areas are below 3.03 Å²), region of one-atom candidates (for the regions whose areas are between 3.03 Å² and 5.63 Å²), and region of two-atom candidates (for the regions whose areas are above 5.63 Å²). The criteria for classifying these three cases were determined by estimating the range of area of connected zero density regions from an fcc atomic model with random spatial displacement which gives 22 pm root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the ideal fcc lattice sites. From the fcc model, we randomly removed one or two adjacent atoms and obtained the minimum area (i.e. the classification criteria) of the zero density region by calculating the atom number density as mentioned above. For each one-atom candidate region, an initial fitting point was obtained as the center of each region. For each two-atom candidate region, two initial fitting points were obtained from the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for the Gaussian mixture model. Starting from those initial fitting points, the same Gaussian fitting method with varying volume sizes was applied.

### An exact form for the magnetic field density of States for a dipole [^2c861285]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2001). Low credibility.

We present an analytical form for the density of states for a magnetic dipole in the center of a spherical voxel. This analytic form is then used to evaluate the signal decay as a function of echo time for different volume fractions and susceptibilities. The decay can be considered exponential only in a limited interval of time. Otherwise, it has a quadratic dependence on time for short echo times and an oscillatory decaying behavior for long echo times.
