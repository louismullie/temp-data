## Question

what type of CT for lymphatdenopathy of abdomen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of CT to use for abdominal lymphadenopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indication and how it drives anatomic coverage. Then, I should confirm the contrast requirement and reconcile any exceptions. Next, I will determine optimal phase timing, followed by specifying coverage and technical parameters. After that, I need to consider alternative or complementary modalities, apply disease-specific protocol tweaks, and finish with a concise standard protocol summary including dosing and safety considerations, while continuously self-verifying each step against guideline-level sources like Node-RADS, ASCO, ESMO, EAU/AUA, and ACR criteria.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because indication dictates protocol. For unexplained lymphadenopathy, cancer staging, treatment response, or surveillance, Node-RADS 1.0 emphasizes that baseline and follow-up anatomic coverage must include all regional nodal stations relevant to the primary tumor, and extend to other compartments when metastatic spread is plausible; for example, head and neck cancers require chest and upper abdomen in many cases, and response assessment must cover all initially abnormal nodal sites [^117GCrVn]. I should double-check tumor-specific pathways: colorectal cancer staging typically requires IV contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis; testicular cancer staging requires contrast-enhanced CT chest/abdomen/pelvis; and DLBCL and other lymphomas often warrant whole-body staging with PET/CT and cross-sectional correlation, all of which favor at least chest-abdomen-pelvis coverage when abdominal nodes are a concern [^117Wrbrn] [^114BKAc3] [^111a8syn] [^114YjmzU].

> Now, contrast usage is pivotal; wait, let me verify Node-RADS language. Node-RADS explicitly requires IV contrast for CT to assess the "configuration" categories in an appropriate parenchymal phase, which are essential to characterize necrosis, heterogeneity, margins, and enhancement patterns in nodes; for MRI, contrast is not mandatory due to intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, but for CT, contrast is mandatory for proper nodal assessment [^117GCrVn]. Hold on, I initially thought non-contrast CT is never acceptable; but I should correct myself — ACR acute abdomen pathways allow non-contrast CT when IV contrast cannot be given, especially for nonlocalized acute abdominal pain, though this is a different question than detailed nodal characterization; for nodal evaluation under Node-RADS, non-contrast CT is suboptimal and should be avoided unless there is an absolute contraindication, in which case MRI with gadolinium or tailored PET/MRI is reasonable [^112TdBTm] [^117GCrVn]. I should also note that giving IV contrast improves detection and characterization of urgent and non-urgent findings in ED cohorts, reinforcing the preference for contrast when not contraindicated [^113QejP2].

> Next, I should review contrast phase timing; let me think about the optimal enhancement window. For most abdominal nodal assessments in oncologic imaging, the portal venous phase around 60–70 seconds after injection provides robust nodal and visceral enhancement and satisfies the Node-RADS requirement for an appropriate parenchymal phase; dual-energy studies using acquisitions at 60 seconds also support adequate contrast-to-noise for nodal evaluation in thoracic nodal beds, which is analogous timing for abdominal work [^117GCrVn] [^111FZppY]. But wait, what if the primary dictates multiphasic imaging? For pancreatic cancer, ASCO recommends multiphase CT with arterial/pancreatic and venous phases for staging, and those multiphase datasets can be leveraged for nodal assessment without sacrificing portal venous evaluation; hepatobiliary primaries may also require tailored arterial/portal venous phases depending on institutional protocols [^117GCrVn].

> I will now define anatomic coverage; I need to ensure we neither under- nor over-scan. Minimum coverage for abdominal lymphadenopathy evaluation is abdomen and pelvis from the diaphragm to the inguinal ligaments, with extension to the chest for diseases that commonly involve mediastinal drainage or for systemic malignancies; this includes lymphoma, testicular cancer, and colorectal cancer staging where chest disease affects management and staging accuracy [^117GCrVn] [^114BKAc3] [^114rw2k4] [^117Wrbrn]. Hold on, I should verify lymphoma specifics — FDG PET/CT is routinely used and often superior for nodal staging, but the CT component still benefits from diagnostic-quality contrast for precise anatomic correlation and to identify non–FDG-avid processes, thus justifying comprehensive chest-abdomen-pelvis coverage when staging or restaging lymphomas with abdominal node involvement [^114YjmzU].

> Next, I should optimize technical parameters; I need to ensure small nodes aren't missed. Thin sections at ≤ 3 mm with overlapping reconstructions improve detection of small nodes and are supported by high-quality practice recommendations such as ERS guidance for abdominal imaging in LAM, while Node-RADS gastric cancer validation accepted a 5 mm minimum as the lowest acceptable quality threshold, underscoring that thinner collimation is preferable when feasible [^111M8zBf] [^111vS388]. I should confirm dose management strategies: standard adult kVp is 120 with size-based modulation and iterative reconstruction, adapting for body habitus according to institutional DRLs, and pediatric protocols must be individualized with DRLs and scanner-specific technique charts to keep dose as low as reasonably achievable while preserving diagnostic quality [^11317fFT] [^115LnXwE]. Let me reconsider oral contrast; while it can help bowel–node discrimination in selected scenarios, studies in acute settings show no consistent diagnostic advantage from routine oral contrast when high-quality IV-enhanced CT is performed, so oral contrast is optional and driven by institutional preference and specific clinical questions rather than mandatory for nodal assessment [^1169NqqT].

> I should now consider alternatives and complements; hold on, let me verify the incremental roles. PET/CT enhances accuracy over anatomic imaging alone for nodal staging across many cancers by integrating functional and structural data, altering management in a meaningful subset; however, for oncologic staging, optimizing the CT component — preferably with IV contrast — improves localization and characterization compared with low-dose, nonenhanced transmission CT, particularly when the CT also addresses organ staging in the abdomen and pelvis [^114YjmzU] [^114eTM3E]. In patients with absolute contraindications to iodinated contrast or where radiation minimization is critical, MRI can substitute for CT in many abdominal beds, and Node-RADS allows non-contrast MRI for nodal configuration assessment due to superior soft-tissue contrast; integrated PET/CT plus MRI reading can further improve staging confidence in selected abdominal malignancies [^117GCrVn] [^117Vuh5H].

> But wait, disease context often compels protocol modifications; I will now examine key entities. For lymphoma, baseline staging typically employs whole-body FDG PET/CT complemented by diagnostic-quality CT chest-abdomen-pelvis with IV contrast to map nodal stations and extranodal sites, and thin sections aid in small node detection for correlation and biopsy planning; follow-up should mirror baseline coverage to assess all initially abnormal sites [^114YjmzU] [^117GCrVn]. For testicular germ cell tumors, contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis is standard, with MRI as an alternative when iodinated contrast is contraindicated; retroperitoneal nodes require careful thin-section evaluation given typical drainage patterns [^114BKAc3] [^114rw2k4]. For pancreatic cancer, multiphase thin-slice imaging is required per ASCO, and nodal assessment should be integrated across arterial, pancreatic, and portal venous phases without sacrificing venous-phase evaluation of the liver and nodes [^114wxR1T]. For tuberculosis, contrast-enhanced CT patterns of peripheral enhancement with central low attenuation and occasional calcifications help distinguish TB nodes from lymphoma, and contrast-enhanced MRI can assist in differentiating TB from lymphoma based on enhancement patterns and distribution when CT contrast is not possible [^116Q6TiN] [^116LdrpS]. For lymphangioleiomyomatosis and associated abdominal lesions such as angiomyolipomas or lymphangioleiomyomas, ERS guidance recommends abdominopelvic CT at diagnosis with contiguous ≤ 3 mm sections before and after IV contrast to define lesions and nodal-lymphatic involvement [^111CmzyA] [^111M8zBf].

> Let me synthesize a final standard protocol summary; I should double-check each element against sources. A typical exam for abdominal lymphadenopathy is a contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis, extending to chest if clinically indicated. Administer iodinated IV contrast at 300–370 mg I/mL with a weight-based dose around 1.5–2 mL/kg at 3–4 mL/s, and acquire the portal venous phase at approximately 60–70 seconds to optimize nodal and visceral enhancement; use thin collimation of about 3 mm or thinner with overlapping reconstructions and multiplanar reformats, and tailor kVp/mA with automatic modulation and DRL-informed technique to balance dose and image quality; consider oral contrast optional based on the clinical question, given limited incremental value for nodal characterization when high-quality IV-enhanced images are obtained [^notfound] [^117GCrVn] [^111FZppY] [^11317fFT] [^1169NqqT]. Rationale includes Node-RADS' requirement for IV contrast on CT for nodal configuration assessment, the venous phase's favorable contrast for nodes and organs, and thin sections for small node detection; extend coverage to chest-abdomen-pelvis for systemic diseases such as lymphoma, testicular cancer, and colorectal cancer staging [^117GCrVn] [^114YjmzU] [^114BKAc3] [^114rw2k4] [^117Wrbrn]. If iodinated contrast is absolutely contraindicated, prefer MRI abdomen/pelvis with gadolinium or PET/MRI when available, recognizing Node-RADS permits non-contrast MRI for nodal characterization due to intrinsic soft-tissue contrast, and in testicular cancer the EAU supports MRI as an alternative staging modality when CT is limited [^117GCrVn] [^114BKAc3].

> Finally, I need to ensure quality and safety checks are explicit. I should confirm documentation of the clinical indication and target nodal stations to guarantee appropriate anatomic coverage; verify renal function and allergy risk before contrast, and use institutional DRLs and patient-size–based techniques to optimize radiation dose, especially in younger patients; and when the clinical context is acute abdominal pain rather than nodal characterization, remember that while non-contrast CT may occasionally suffice diagnostically, for lymph node characterization and oncologic staging the evidence and Node-RADS framework support IV contrast as standard of care whenever feasible [^115LnXwE] [^112TdBTm] [^117GCrVn].

---

For abdominal lymphadenopathy, the **preferred CT is a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV iodinated contrast** [^117GCrVn] to optimize nodal detection and characterization. Use **multiphase CT for lymphoma or suspected malignancy** to assess nodal enhancement and necrosis. If IV contrast is contraindicated [^112TdBTm], perform a non-contrast CT, and consider MRI or PET/CT for further evaluation [^114YjmzU]. Use thin slices (≤ 3 mm) [^111M8zBf] and include chest imaging if systemic disease is suspected [^114wxR1T].

## Recommended CT protocol for abdominal lymphadenopathy

### Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT)

- **IV contrast**: Essential for optimal visualization and characterization of lymph nodes, enhancing detection of necrosis, calcification, and vascular involvement.

- **Oral contrast**: Generally not required unless bowel involvement is suspected [^1169NqqT].

- **Phases**: Typically portal venous phase (60–70 seconds post-injection); arterial phase may be added if vascular involvement is suspected [^114eTM3E].

---

### Multiphase CT

Indications for multiphase CT include **lymphoma or suspected malignancy** to assess nodal enhancement patterns, necrosis, and vascular involvement. The **phases** can include arterial, portal venous, and delayed acquisitions, tailored to clinical suspicion.

---

### Non-contrast CT

Indications for non-contrast CT are restricted to patients with **contraindications to IV contrast** (e.g. severe allergy, renal impairment) [^112TdBTm]. Limitations include **reduced sensitivity and specificity** compared with contrast-enhanced studies [^113QejP2].

---

## Technical parameters

- **Slice thickness**: Thin slices (≤ 3 mm) [^111M8zBf] are recommended for optimal spatial resolution and accurate lymph node measurement.

- **Scan coverage**: From diaphragm to symphysis pubis; include chest [^114wxR1T] if systemic disease is suspected [^114BKAc3].

- **Radiation dose**: Use dose optimization techniques (e.g. iterative reconstruction, automatic exposure control) [^115LnXwE] to minimize radiation exposure [^113k1puw].

---

## Clinical indications for CT in abdominal lymphadenopathy

- **Malignancy**: Lymphoma [^115277nd], metastatic disease, primary abdominal malignancies [^117Wrbrn].

- **Infection**: Tuberculosis [^113QpXaY], HIV-associated lymphadenopathy, other infectious etiologies [^111f2S3i].

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Sarcoidosis [^113JiFdT], autoimmune diseases, mesenteric panniculitis [^1145udRh].

- **Unknown etiology**: Unexplained lymphadenopathy requiring further characterization [^113wGzNw].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Radiation exposure is a key concern [^115LnXwE] — especially in **pediatric and pregnant patients** [^115FhGHF] — for whom alternative modalities such as MRI or ultrasound may be preferable. Contrast reactions, including **allergic responses and nephrotoxicity**, can occur; premedication or use of an alternative imaging modality may be necessary. CT specificity is limited and may not definitively distinguish **benign from malignant nodes** [^116KAgic]; biopsy may be required for a definitive diagnosis [^114f5hnX].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

**MRI** is useful when CT or IV contrast is contraindicated and provides excellent soft-tissue contrast [^1154Appr]. **PET/CT** enables metabolic characterization of lymph nodes, particularly in lymphoma and metastatic disease [^114YjmzU]. **Ultrasound** has a limited role in abdominal lymphadenopathy but can aid assessment of superficial nodes and guide biopsy [^113pSD2q].

---

Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the **preferred imaging modality** for evaluating abdominal lymphadenopathy, providing detailed anatomical information and aiding in diagnosis and management [^1152XNY2].

### Introducing the node reporting and data system 1.0 (Node-RADS): A concept for standardized assessment of lymph nodes in cancer [^117GCrVn]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Technical considerations**: Node-RADS is applicable for the interpretation of lymph nodes on CT and MRI. Specific technical imaging acquisition parameters are not a prerequisite, facilitating broad applicability of Node-RADS. The use of contrast material is not mandatory for MRI given the intrinsic high soft tissue contrast. However, the use of contrast material is mandatory for CT scans to assess the "configuration" categories, in an appropriate parenchymal phase after intravenous injection.

For baseline staging, anatomic coverage should include all regional lymph nodes of the primary tumor and, depending on the likelihood for distant metastatic disease, respective body parts (e.g. the chest and upper abdomen (adrenals) for staging HN tumors). For response assessment, anatomic coverage should include all lymph node sites that showed abnormal lymph nodes on baseline imaging.

### Multimodality imaging of indolent B cell lymphoma from diagnosis to transformation: What every radiologist should know [^115277nd]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Differentiating progression of indolent lymphoma from TIL can be challenging, especially in the case of progression from low- to high-grade indolent lymphoma, as there is wide overlap between clinical, histologic, and molecular characteristics of progressed and transformed lymphoma. On imaging, these can be indistinguishable, with similar imaging characteristics. Histologic confirmation should be obtained to differentiate the two entities whenever possible (Fig. 1).

- **Recurrence**: Due to the high recurrence rate of indolent lymphomas, the possibility of recurrence of disease after initial response should always be considered when patients present with increased adenopathy or increased extranodal disease on restaging scans. To differentiate recurrence from HT, the clinical presentation can be helpful: elevated LDH, new B or systemic symptoms are most likely associated with HT. On imaging, diffuse mild increase in size of multiple lymph nodes, as well as areas with only mild increase in FDG-avidity, is most likely to be associated with recurrent indolent lymphoma.

- **Secondary malignancy**: Patients with lymphoma are inherently at risk of secondary tumors due to the status of immunosuppression, and patients with a history of cancer can develop lymphomas. Differentiating HT from tumor progression can be difficult, especially in cases of tumors that tend to metastasize to lymph nodes. Specific imaging features of the primary cancer, as well as concordance between primary tumor growth and nodal progression, or presence of new sites of metastasis, can aid in differentiation.

### Lymph node staging with dual-modality PET/CT: enhancing the diagnostic accuracy in oncology [^114YjmzU]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Lymph node staging according to the TNM criteria is an essential part of tumor evaluation. Several morphological and functional imaging procedures are used complementarily in this setting. Dual-modality PET/CT scanners are able to provide anatomical and functional data sets in a single session with accurate image co-registration. Comparative studies between morphological imaging procedures, such as MRI and CT, with co-registered PET/CT demonstrated significantly better lymph node staging with PET/CT than with anatomical procedures alone, regardless of the staged body compartment (head and neck, thorax, or abdominal area). Based on more accurate staging results, PET/CT was able to alter the patients' therapy in a significant number of studies.

Functional imaging with FDG-PET ([(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-desoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography) demonstrated outstanding results in lymph node staging of different tumor diseases. By adding anatomical information to PET, PET/CT outperforms PET alone when assessing the TNM-stage of different malignant diseases. This paper provides an overview concerning the performance of PET/CT in staging lymph nodes for malignant spread and points out benefits and limitations of this new imaging modality.

### CT imaging of primary pancreatic lymphoma: Experience from three referral centres for pancreatic diseases [^114fEA6z]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Two patients exhibited tumoral necrosis, affecting approximately 20% and 50% of the pancreatic mass lesion, respectively. Enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes were observed in 11 out of 14 cases. Fat stranding in the peri-pancreatic region was present in all patients. The common bile duct was dilated in 6 out of 14 cases, while the main pancreatic duct upstream of the neoplasm was enlarged in 5 out of 14 patients.

- **Quantitative analysis**: Mean neoplasm longest dimension and volume were 8.05 cm and 210.8 cm³. Mean tumour attenuation values were 39.1 HU in the unenhanced scan, 60.6 HU in the pancreatic phase, and 71.4 HU in the venous phase.

A CT scan from a 51-year-old male patient with primary pancreatic lymphoma of histotype diffuse large B-cell (Ki-67 score > 90%) showed a large solid mass in the body-head of the pancreas with a biliary stent present. CT images following contrast medium administration indicated that the arteries and veins were encased but not infiltrated, with the main pancreatic duct not enlarged. An 18 FDG PET-CT fusion image revealed high metabolic activity in the lesion.

### Tuberculosis revisited: Classic imaging findings in childhood [^112rrJhi]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Despite modern technologies and developments, the diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis (TB) still represents a significant challenge. Imaging relies on all radiology modalities, including radiography, fluoroscopy, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The choice of imaging depends on presenting symptoms and the availability of equipment, which is often limited, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Abdominal radiography is often non-specific but may show an abnormal gas pattern, bowel wall thickening, dilatation, or separation of the small bowel loops due to an infiltrative process affecting the mesentery and omentum. In cases of involvement of solid abdominal organs, organomegaly may be detected. Chest radiography should be performed, as approximately 15–25% of cases with abdominal TB have concomitant pulmonary infection.

Abdominal TB presents with a triad of pain, fever, and weight loss, occurring in 54% of patients. Although similar symptoms are seen in other abdominal and gastrointestinal infections, bowel inflammatory disease, and abdominal malignancies, the presence of this triad should always raise a high suspicion of TB, especially in children living in endemic areas and low- and middle-income countries. Abdominal TB may occur in various forms, including TB lymphadenopathy and peritoneal, gastrointestinal, and visceral TB. These are separate entities; however, there is usually a combination of various pathologies in the individual infected patient. Multiple intra-abdominal sites are involved in more than 50% of patients, with a combination of lymphadenopathy and gastrointestinal involvement.

### CT scan for suspected acute abdominal process: impact of combinations of IV, oral, and rectal contrast [^116LNrKS]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on the capability of computed tomography (CT) to accurately diagnose abdominopelvic pathology in acutely ill inpatients suspected of having an acute abdominal process. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal/pelvic CT with varying contrast agent use in hospitalized patients.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of all hospital inpatients from March 1, 2007, to May 31, 2007, who underwent urgent or emergent abdominal/pelvic CT with any combination of contrast: intravenous (IV), oral, rectal, or unenhanced, for a suspected acute abdominal process. Collected data included patient demographics, combination of contrast used, CT diagnosis, time from CT scan to subsequent intervention, type of intervention, and actual diagnosis of the acute abdominal process. The accuracy of CT was compared between enhanced and unenhanced imaging using Fisher's exact test.

- **Results**: A total of 661 patients were identified. IV contrast alone was used in 54.2% of CT scans, with a 92.5% accuracy rate. IV and oral contrast were used in 22.2% of scans, achieving 94.6% accuracy. Unenhanced imaging was performed in 16.2% of cases with 92.5% accuracy, and oral contrast alone was used in 7.0% with 93.5% accuracy. There was no significant difference in correctly diagnosing a suspected acute abdominal process when enhanced CT imaging was compared to unenhanced (p > 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: CT contrast administration in critically ill hospitalized patients is not necessary for an accurate diagnosis of an acute abdominal process.

### Abdominal imaging studies: Comparison of diagnostic accuracies resulting from ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging in the same individual [^1154Appr]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

We retrospectively compared the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies performed on the same individual to determine the relative performance of these modalities in evaluating disease processes arising from different intra-abdominal organ systems. We reviewed all procedure codes accrued by our abdominal imaging section during a 1-year period to ascertain how many patients underwent all three imaging procedures within a 2-week interval at our institution. These cases were further evaluated to determine:

- **Primary organ system of disease involvement**:
	- We identified the main organ system affected by disease.

- **Final diagnosis**:
	- We established the ultimate diagnosis based on imaging findings.

- **Imaging modality providing the most accurate information**:
	- Appropriate medical management was based on imaging findings.

Imaging findings were determined by reviewing diagnostic reports, and medical management decisions were assessed through chart reviews. Out of 5,126 patients investigated for abdominal disease, 2,695 underwent ultrasound, 4,394 underwent CT, and 872 underwent MRI. Among these patients, 26 underwent sequential US, CT, and MRI evaluation within a two-week interval. Clinical management was appropriately directed by US findings in 12 out of 26 cases (46%; 95% CI: 27–67%), CT findings in 16 out of 26 cases (62%; 95% CI: 41–80%), and MRI findings in 24 cases (92%; 95% CI: 75–99%). Significant differences in directing appropriate clinical management were observed when comparing the relative diagnostic accuracies of MRI to US (p = 0.0003) and MRI to CT.

### Abdominal Kikuchi-Fujimoto lymphadenopathy: an uncommon presentation of a rare disease [^1115NDnh]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 34-year-old man presented to our hospital with a 5-day history of progressive abdominal pain and fever. A CT scan identified extensive mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Initial diagnostic tests were inconclusive. Abdominal lymph node biopsy showed histiocytic necrotising lymphadenitis, compatible with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). This benign and self-limiting disease generally resolves following supportive treatment. In this case, remission occurred within 3 weeks of initial presentation. KFD is a very uncommon cause of lymphadenopathy, and selective mesenteric involvement is rare. Definitive diagnosis often requires lymph node biopsy. It is important to exclude more common and serious differential diagnoses associated with mesenteric lymphadenopathy, while maintaining a minimally invasive diagnostic approach before progressing to nodal biopsy.

### "Hot" spots in hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography scanning of the abdomen: Protocols, indications, interpretation, responsibilities, and reimbursements [^111JcWRE]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The introduction of hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanners marks a significant advancement in the field of radiology. However, combining functional imaging with structural imaging has introduced several controversial issues. This review addresses important aspects of hybrid PET/CT, including specific indications and protocols that ensure diagnostic-quality CT scans while minimizing radiation exposure. Additionally, it explores the feasibility, desirability, and timing of administering oral and intravenous contrast.

- **Clinical indications**: The review discusses the clinical indications for hybrid PET/CT compared to PET alone, as well as the purpose of the CT component, whether for diagnosis or as a transmission source.

- **Interpretation logistics**: The logistics of interpreting hybrid PET/CT scans are examined, with a focus on the roles of radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians.

This study reflects on the pertinent medical literature and shares our experiences, highlighting relevant examples from practice.

### Tuberculosis versus lymphoma in the abdominal lymph nodes: a comparative study using contrast-enhanced MRI [^116LdrpS]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the differential characteristics on MRI between tuberculosis and lymphoma in abdominal lymph nodes. We conducted a retrospective analysis for the contour, size, signal intensity, enhancement patterns, and anatomic distribution of lymph nodes in 57 consecutive patients with documented tuberculosis (28 patients; 49.1%) and newly diagnosed, untreated lymphoma (29 patients; 50.9%).

Twenty-four cases (85.7%) in the tuberculosis group were hyperintense on T2-weighted images and either hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted images with respect to the abdominal wall muscle. All cases in the lymphoma group were hyperintense on T2-weighted images and isointense on T1-weighted images with respect to the abdominal wall muscle. Concerning the main anatomic distribution of lymph nodes, the lymph nodes in the lower paraaortic region were more frequently involved in the lymphoma group (48.3%) than in tuberculosis (17.9%, p < 0.05). Moreover, mesenteric lymph nodes were more often involved in tuberculosis (32.1%) than in lymphoma (6.9%, p < 0.05). Tuberculous lymphadenopathy showed predominantly peripheral enhancement, frequently with a multilocular appearance, whereas lymphomatous adenopathy often demonstrated uniform homogeneous enhancement (all p < 0.001).

Contrast-enhanced MRI can be useful in differentiating between these two entities.

### Spectrum of abdominal pathologies detected with CT in long term dialysis patients [^112LoeHC]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

As a consequence of the expanded use of long-term hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatments, and the extended life spans of patients, complications of end-stage renal disease and dialysis treatments are being encountered with increasing frequency. Computed tomography can accurately depict many of the potential complications of end-stage renal disease in patients on dialysis. This article presents the abdominal CT findings of 429 end-stage renal disease patients who are undergoing either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis treatment.

### Diagnostic reference level quantities for adult chest and abdomen-pelvis CT examinations: Correlation with organ doses [^11317fFT]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

It was observed that the significance of CT scanners depends on the anatomic region examined (chest or abdomen-pelvis), patient size discriminator (d or BMI), and OD group (IO, PO, DO, or OO). For chest examinations, only scanners 1 and 2 were significant in SDDE estimation for all cases; for abdomen-pelvis examinations, only scanner 3 was significant. Additionally, for chest examinations, Figure 4 demonstrates that the model is scanner-sensitive, as scanners 1 and 2 are associated with lower organ doses than other scanners. This sensitivity is less evident in abdomen-pelvis examinations (Figure 3), which further demonstrates the model's sensitivity to the exposed body region.

The present work utilized retrospective adult patient databases of typical CT abdomen-pelvis and chest examinations with scanners from three different vendors. Although the patient samples and machine technologies evaluated represent a common clinical scenario, the statistical results must be interpreted cautiously and not generalized. The study serves as a proof-of-concept that the systematic combination of protocol-related information, RSDR results, patient demographics, and an organ-dose estimation tool may assist radiologists and medical physicists in the decision-making process during the optimization of a given clinical task. For example, by examining Figure 3, the institutional team responsible for protocol optimization can observe that scanner 1 is responsible for higher organ doses than scanners 2 and 3 in abdomen-pelvis examinations; these higher doses are not correlated to oversize.

### Integrated versus separate reading of F-18 FDG-PET/CT and MRI for abdominal malignancies - effect on staging outcomes and diagnostic confidence [^117Vuh5H]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal cancer patients increasingly undergo multimodality imaging. This study evaluates the effects of integrated reading of PET/CT and abdominal MRI on staging outcomes and diagnostic confidence compared to "routine" separate reading.

- **Methods**: In total, 201 patients who underwent abdominal MRI and whole-body F-18 FDG-PET/CT within 14 days were retrospectively analyzed. Original MRI and PET/CT reports were retrieved, and reported findings were translated into a 5-point confidence score (1 = definitely benign to 5 = definitely malignant) for 7 standardized regions (primary tumor/regional lymph nodes/distant lymph nodes/liver/lung/bone/peritoneum) per patient. Two-reader teams (radiologist + nuclear medicine physician) then performed integrated reading of the images using the same scoring system.

- **Results**: Integrated reading led to discrepant findings in 59 of 201 (29%) patients, with potential clinical impact in 25 of 201 (12%). Equivocal scores decreased from 5.7% (PET/CT) and 5.4% (MRI) to 3.2% (p = 0.05 and p = 0.14). Compared to the original PET/CT reports, integrated reading led to increased diagnostic confidence in 8.9% versus decreased confidence in 6.6% (p = 0.26). Compared with the original MRI reports, an increase in confidence occurred in 9.6% versus a decrease in 6.9% (p = 0.18). The effect on diagnostic confidence was most pronounced in lymph nodes (p = 0.08 vs. MRI), cervical cancer (p = 0.03 vs. MRI), and disease staging (p = 0.06 vs. PET/CT).

- **Conclusions**: Integrated PET/CT+MRI reading alters staging outcomes in a substantial proportion of cases with potential clinical impact.

### Developing patient-specific dose protocols for a CT scanner and exam using diagnostic reference levels [^115LnXwE]. Pediatric Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of image quality and radiation dose during pediatric CT scanning depends on how effectively one manages the radiographic techniques as a function of the type of exam, the type of CT scanner, and patient size. The CT scanner's display of expected CT dose index volume (CTDIvol) after the projection scan provides the operator with a powerful tool, prior to the patient scan, to identify and manage appropriate CT techniques provided the department has established appropriate diagnostic reference levels (DRLs).

This paper provides a step-by-step process that allows the development of DRLs as a function of the type of exam, actual patient size, and the individual radiation output of each CT scanner in a department. Abdomen, pelvis, thorax, and head scans are addressed, covering patient sizes from newborns to large adults. The method applies to every CT scanner, regardless of vendor, model, or vintage. Adjustments to techniques to manage the impact of iterative reconstruction are covered, along with a method to handle all available voltages other than 120 kV.

This level of management of CT techniques is necessary to properly monitor radiation dose and image quality during pediatric CT scans.

### Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease: A rare but important differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy [^114Bv3uu]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of fevers, cervical lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. A CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed left cervical lymphadenopathy, enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla and groin, and hepatomegaly. A left cervical excisional lymph node biopsy was performed, and the histopathological findings were consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. He was treated with high-dose prednisolone for one week, which was then tapered. Generalized arthralgia and daily episodes of malaise were experienced for two months following the cessation of corticosteroids. The condition lasted four months from the onset of symptoms. This case report highlights the importance of including Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is often mistaken for tuberculosis and lymphoma, and prompt histological diagnosis can prevent unnecessary exposure to the agents used to treat these conditions.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorders, medications, and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns.

Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter.

The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### ESR essentials: characterisation and staging of adnexal masses with MRI and CT-practice recommendations by ESUR [^113Cir2d]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Lymph nodes**: Radiologic reports should include all abnormal LNs, although certain LN locations pose more significant surgical challenges. These include LNs in the para-aortic area above the renal vessels, near the porta hepatis, adjacent to the coeliac axis, within the mesentery, and in the retrocrural area. Cardiophrenic LNs are considered abnormal if they exceed 0.5 cm in the short axis and can be resected when in the anterior position. Inguinal LNs larger than 1.5 cm are also considered abnormal but can be excised even in stage IVB cases.

- **Other localisations**: Other stage IV sites, like splenic parenchymal metastases, can be addressed through splenectomy. However, metastases in liver tissue, lungs, pleura, abdominal wall, or other soft tissues are usually considered not resectable except when limited or isolated.

The main peritoneal locations of disease that should be reported are listed in Figure 5, with typical examples of CT findings. Examples of principal locations of peritoneal carcinomatosis to be reported are shown in the figure.

### Can PET/CT replace separate diagnostic CT for cancer imaging? Optimizing CT protocols for imaging cancers of the chest and abdomen [^114eTM3E]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Stage-adapted treatment in oncology relies on correct tumor staging for patients with malignant diseases. To ensure accurate assessment of the tumor stage in thoracic and abdominal diseases by PET/CT, both CT and PET need to be optimized. In this setting, different malignant diseases require customized imaging protocols. Although in the clinical setting of therapy assessment, PET/CT with integration of low-dose, nonenhanced CT may be sufficient, tumor staging may require a more sophisticated CT protocol.

This review focuses on potential CT protocols for imaging cancers of the chest and abdomen. Examples of CT protocols are presented and discussed for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and interventional liver therapy.

### Development and validation of image quality scoring criteria (IQSC) for pediatric CT: a preliminary study [^111ccJCN]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Subjective image quality for routine abdomen CT

The nine detected lesions on routine abdominal CT included intra-abdominal fluid collections or interloop abscesses (n = 3, Fig. 2), enlarged appendix (n = 1), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (n = 2), acute appendicitis (n = 1), colonic diverticulosis (n = 2), and trace ascites (n = 1). The image quality scores for routine abdomen/pelvis CT exams for all five readers were 3 or 4. No CT exam was scored 1 or 2 by all the five radiologists. The median image quality scores for routine abdomen CT exams for readers were 3 (Table 3). The percentage of frequency of subjective image quality score for the five readers was 60% (score 3) and 40% (score 4). The interobserver agreement among five readers for acceptable vs. sub-optimal image quality was very good (kappa = 1).

Fig. 2: Transverse abdomen CT image of a 14-year-old male (42 kg) acquired at 4.4 mGy. Interloop abscess (arrow) and overall image quality scored optimal (scores 3 or 4) by all readers.

Subjective image quality for kidney stone CT

Thirteen kidney stones (3–5 mm, Fig. 3) and a case of hydronephrosis were detected on kidney stone CT exams. The renal stones detection was unaffected on all five CT exams for all readers. The median image quality scores for kidney stone CT exams for the readers were 3 (Table 3). The interobserver agreement between five readers was very good (0.8–1). The percentage of frequency of subjective image quality score for the five readers was 4% (score 2), 72% (score 3), and 24% (score 4).

### Dual-energy CT can evaluate both hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and lesion vascularity with a single scan at 60 seconds after contrast medium injection [^111FZppY]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether 80-kVp and weighted-average 120-kVp computed tomographic (CT) images scanned at 60 seconds after contrast material injection using a dual-source CT scanner could substitute for conventional 120-kVp images obtained at 30 and 100 seconds.

Eighty-three consecutive patients with suspected lung cancer were enrolled. Images were obtained in dual-energy mode (80 and 140 kVp) at 60 seconds and conventional 120-kVp mode at 30 and 100 seconds after contrast injection. The CT numbers of the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, hilar zone lymph nodes, and pulmonary lesions were measured. Contrasts between the pulmonary artery/pulmonary vein and lymph nodes and beam-hardening artifacts were visually evaluated using five-point and four-point scales, respectively. The degree of enhancement was evaluated on 30-second 120-kVp, 100-second 120-kVp, and 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images.

The mean differences in attenuation between the pulmonary artery/pulmonary vein and lymph nodes on the 30-second 120-kVp, 60-second 80-kVp, and 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images were 184/155, 130/140, and 84/92 Hounsfield units, respectively (all P values < 0.001). The mean contrast scores for the hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes were 4.5/4.7, 3.7/4.2, 3.3/3.6, and 2.4/2.5 for these three and for 100-second 120-kVp images, respectively (all P values < 0.01). The mean artifact scores of the four images were 1.2, 3.4, 3.6, and 4.0, respectively. On 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images, 55 of 60…

### Beyond PET/CT in Hodgkin lymphoma: A comprehensive review of the role of imaging at initial presentation, during follow-up, and for assessment of treatment-related complications [^113pSD2q]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The most typical presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is painless, enlarged superficial lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. Patients with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy may present with respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain. Chest radiography can be performed as the initial investigation in these patients. Chest X-ray provides preliminary information about the involvement of the mediastinum and lungs. Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy at diagnosis is an unfavorable prognostic factor in patients with HL and can be quantified by measuring using the mediastinal mass ratio. The Cotswolds modification of the Ann Arbor staging system defines bulky disease as a mediastinal mass exceeding one third of the internal transverse diameter of the thorax at the T5/6 intervertebral disc level on a posteroanterior chest radiograph.

Ultrasound (US) is often helpful in confirming enlarged nodes and guiding biopsy, particularly cervical lymph nodes, which are the most common nodal group affected in patients with HL. US can also be useful for the evaluation of extranodal sites of involvement in the abdomen (e.g. gallbladder, kidney) and for image-guided biopsy of focal lesions in solid organs such as the liver and spleen.

### Is unenhanced CT sufficient for evaluation of acute abdominal pain [^113QUSmb]. Clinical Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

To determine whether intravenous contrast improves the ability of radiologists to establish the cause of acute abdominal pain after nondiagnostic or normal unenhanced CT:

- **Methods**: Out of 164 consecutive emergency department patients presenting with less than 48 hours of nontraumatic, acute abdominal pain, a confident diagnosis for the cause of pain was made prospectively in 71 out of 164 (43%) patients on these unenhanced scans by the monitoring radiologist. In the other 93 patients, our study sample, intravenous contrast-enhanced CT was obtained. At a later date, retrospectively, two experienced abdominal CT radiologists independently evaluated unenhanced CT scans alone for potential causes of pain and diagnostic confidence level on a 1–3 scale. At least 2 weeks later, intravenous enhanced and unenhanced scans were read side-by-side for the same assessment.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in diagnostic confidence levels comparing unenhanced CT alone (2.59) vs. intravenous enhanced and unenhanced CT together (2.64). Chi-square analysis found no significant difference in finding a cause for pain when intravenous contrast was added compared to the initial unenhanced scan alone.

- **Conclusions**: Intravenous contrast did not significantly improve the ability of CT to establish a cause of abdominal pain following a negative or nondiagnostic unenhanced CT.

### Abdominal ultrasound for diagnosing abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement in HIV-positive individuals [^113QpXaY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Different imaging modalities can be useful to diagnose abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement. Abdominal x-rays are of very limited value but can assist with the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and perforation. CT features include thickening of the peritoneum, omentum, and bowel wall, lymph nodes (especially if these have hypodense centres due to caseous necrosis), and ascites with strands, debris, and fine septations. The excellent soft tissue resolution and multiplanar acquisition of MRI have resulted in it being used to evaluate solid organs and lymphadenopathy. However, CT and especially MRI are expensive and access is very limited in resource-limited settings. Barium studies may be useful for intrinsic bowel abnormalities such as strictures, fistulae, and erosions.

### Disorders of the lymphatic system of the abdomen [^116yjjdG]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The lymphatic system of the abdomen comprises the cisterna chyli, its major and minor lymphatic tributaries, and lymph nodes. Disorders of the lymphatic system of the abdomen are rarely encountered and consist of primary and secondary types. Abdominal lymphangiomas constitute the majority and have characteristic imaging features. Complicated lymphangiomas may pose a diagnostic dilemma. Generalized systemic lymphangiomatosis is a rare condition affecting major organs with a poor prognosis. Retroperitoneal lymphangiectasia in the appropriate setting might predict underlying infection, such as filariasis. Other acquired conditions include iatrogenic or treatment-induced chylocoele. Chylous ascites can be secondary to multiple causes and can be confirmed by biochemical testing and lymphangiogram in appropriate settings.

### Multidetector computed tomography of the acute abdomen in the immunocompromised host: A pictorial review [^113TdkLC]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Immunocompromised patients include those receiving chemotherapy for malignant disease, post-transplant patients, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and those receiving steroids for autoimmune diseases. Advances in transplantation, oncology, and the treatment of AIDS have extended these patients' life expectancies and thereby increased the immunocompromised population. Classical clinical signs of abdominal sepsis may be absent in the immunocompromised host. Consequently, the radiologist is increasingly called on to diagnose specific acute intra-abdominal complications associated with immunodeficiency. This review describes the etiology of the acute abdomen in this heterogeneous group of immunocompromised patients, causes including opportunistic infections, neutropenic enterocolitis, complications of therapy, and opportunistic neoplasms. The typical radiological appearances of these conditions on multidetector computed tomography are illustrated. The challenges and limitations of multidetector computed tomography in diagnosing these conditions are discussed.

### Clinical and radiological features of extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis: a pictorial essay [^113JiFdT]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphatic abnormalities have been described as abdominal manifestations of sarcoidosis, consisting of "lymphadenopathy or increased number of normal-sized nodes"; lymph nodes are generally 1–2 cm in size. In previous studies, abdominal adenopathy was reported in approximately 30% of patients; in these case series, adenopathy was defined as "two or more nodes with a short axis diameter greater than 6 mm".

Enlarged nodes can be observed in different locations: - In the periportal region, close to the liver hilus (Fig. 9), or between the portal vein and vena cava.

- Adjacent to the celiac trunk or pancreas (Fig. 10), or in a paraaortic disposition.

- Around iliac vessels, or in the mesentery. A diffuse abdominal node involvement can also be observed (Fig. 11). Necrosis or calcifications are rare in sarcoidosis.

Fig. 9 A 66-year-old female patient affected by sarcoidosis, involving mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes (histologically proven). An unenhanced abdominal CT image (Fig. 9a) demonstrates enlarged lymph nodes (white arrows) located in the perihepatic region and close to the liver hilus; very small calcifications are recognizable inside these lymph nodes (black arrowheads). A chest CT scan shows mediastinal lymphadenopathy with some punctate calcifications (white arrowhead on Fig. 9b). After contrast administration, both CT and MRI acquisitions show inhomogeneous enhancement of enlarged lymph nodes (white arrowheads on Fig. 9c and d).

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^117NqHXs]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Different types of CT were used in the participating centers, ranging from 4- to 16-slice or more. All patients received intravenous contrast medium; no oral or rectal contrast agents were used. In 16 patients (1.6%), an unenhanced CT was performed due to known renal failure (n = 14) or a known previous reaction to contrast agents (n = 2).

The CT was evaluated in the same standardized way as the ultrasound examinations. Approximately the same general image findings and specific radiological features as observed in ultrasound were assessed for CT and recorded on a digital case record form. The evaluation included image quality, fat infiltration, free fluid, abscess, free intraperitoneal air, and fistulas.

- **Image assessment per organ**: gallbladder, bile duct, liver, pancreas, appendix, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, vascular system, kidneys, and, if appropriate, female genitalia. If no abnormalities were recorded, no further specification was required. In the case of abnormalities, further specification was warranted, and a CT diagnosis was recorded. Comparable to ultrasound, no specific set of criteria per diagnosis was provided to assist observers in assigning their diagnosis.

- **Reference standard**: A final diagnosis was assigned after six months by an independent expert panel, consisting of two experienced gastrointestinal surgeons and an experienced abdominal radiologist.

### Diagnostic performance of node reporting and data system (Node-RADS) for regional lymph node staging of gastric cancer by CT [^111vS388]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Radiological assessment was performed independently and blinded to histopathology by two readers: Reader 1, R.R., a board-certified radiologist with over 10 years of experience in abdominal cross-sectional imaging; and Reader 2, J.J., a radiology resident with 2 years of experience. Minimum quality was defined as contrast-enhanced CT with a slice thickness of at least 5 mm, and all CT images were assessed for sufficient image quality by both radiologists.

Lymph nodes were defined as regional according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association classification. Assessment was performed using Node-RADS 1.0 with scores reflecting the likelihood of lymph node metastases: 1 (very low), 2 (low), 3 (equivocal), 4 (high), and 5 (very high).

In brief, the Node-RADS score encompasses two overarching scoring criteria — "size" and "configuration".

- **Size criterion**: Lymph nodes with a short axis ≥ 10 mm are considered "enlarged", and lymph nodes with any axis ≥ 30 mm are considered "bulk". This is the first step of the assessment and classifies the size in three categories: "normal", "enlarged", or "bulk".

- **Configuration criterion**: This encompasses three categories with several corresponding features and scores:
	- **Texture**: "Homogeneous", 0 point; "heterogeneous", 1 point; "focal necrosis", 2 points; "gross necrosis", 3 points.
	- **Border**: "Smooth", 0 point; "irregular/ill-defined", 1 point.
	- **Shape**: "Any shape with preserved hilum", 0 point; "kidney-bean-like or oval without fatty hilum", 0 point; "spherical without fatty hilum", 1 point.

### Contrast CT scan fails to detect the last heroin packet [^112zaUPw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We report on the comparative utility of the abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and contrast-enhanced plain radiography in one case of a "body packer" who claimed to have passed 50 out of 55 packets before being brought to the Emergency Department by the police for further gastrointestinal decontamination. The presence of retained packets was confirmed by plain radiography. The patient received whole bowel irrigation (WBI) with polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) and passed four more packets. A helical abdominal CT scan with oral contrast was performed to identify any residual packets. A negative CT scan and a reliable patient prompted a subsequent upright abdominal radiograph that showed the last packet in the right lower quadrant. This packet ultimately passed with continued WBI. This case illustrates the failure of CT scan to identify the last packet and suggests that multiple modalities may be necessary to fully confirm a therapeutic endpoint.

### Hepatic tuberculosis: A multimodality imaging review [^114TMGkh]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Figures present imaging findings from various cases.

- **Case 1**: An unenhanced CT of a 65-year-old woman with a history of weight loss shows retroperitoneal nodes with calcification (arrows). Post-contrast CT images reveal small hypodense lesions in both lobes of the liver (dashed arrows). A biopsy from the retroperitoneal nodes indicated metastases from mucinous adenocarcinoma.

- **Case 2**: An axial contrast-enhanced CT of a 55-year-old woman with fever and weight loss exhibits multiple hypodense lesions (arrows) in the right lobe of the liver. A biopsy from the lesions confirmed null cell lymphoma.

- **Case 3**: CT images of a 40-year-old man with known sarcoidosis show subtle hypodense hepatic lesions (dashed arrows) and a heterogeneous appearance of the spleen.

Calcification is not uncommon in long-standing chronic disease. These lesions are more discernible and frequently discovered at this stage, presenting as small nodular foci of calcifications (Fig. 6).

- **Fig. 6**: A middle-aged woman with a history of treated tuberculosis. Axial contrast-enhanced CT images reveal multiple calcified lesions in the liver and spleen consistent with calcified granulomas.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114uqHqG]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), reported in 30–55% of cases. Swollen lymph nodes are usually painless, with a diameter of 1–3 cm, although they can grow as large as 5 cm. In this context, lymphadenopathy may become symptomatic due to compression of adjacent structures (e.g. hydronephrosis due to ureter compression, lower limb edema due to inferior vena cava or iliac vein compression).

Lymphadenopathy is frequently generalized, with the most commonly involved lymph node stations being mediastinal, axillary, intra-abdominal, cervical, and inguinal. It can be documented in IgG4-RD in four main clinical contexts:

- **Incidental findings**: Enlarged lymph nodes are incidentally found in the excision specimen of extranodal tissue demonstrating IgG4-RD features.
- **Diagnostic workup**: Lymphadenopathy may be documented incidentally with physical examination or imaging during the diagnostic workup of extranodal disease.
- **Post-diagnosis development**: Lymphadenopathy may arise weeks to years after the diagnosis of extranodal disease.
- **Initial symptom**: Generalized lymphadenopathy may be the first presenting symptom of IgG4-RD, weeks to years before extranodal disease appears.

Recently, IgG4-RD has been categorized into four clinical phenotypes, based on patterns of clinical presentation. These groups are:

1. Pancreato-hepatobiliary disease (31% of patients)
2. Retroperitoneum and aorta (24%)
3. Head and neck–limited disease (24%)
4. Mikulicz's syndrome with systemic involvement (22%)

Lymphadenopathy is more frequently encountered in group 4, with 67% of patients in this category.

### Why nearly all PET of abdominal and pelvic cancers will be performed as PET/CT [^111SK9CP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical experience at Johns Hopkins and published literature regarding PET/CT applications in the abdomen and pelvis are reviewed, and the strengths and limitations of this evolving technology are summarized. More than 2,700 whole-body PET/CT scans, including the abdomen and pelvis, were performed for clinical indications by our nuclear medicine service from June 2001 through September 2003. Indications for these studies are reviewed, and our clinical impressions of the diagnostic advantages and limitations of PET/CT are reported. Of the over 2,700 whole-body PET/CT scans performed at our institution, over 90% were for known or suspected cancers. Primary abdominopelvic indications were second in frequency to thoracic indications.

In addition, a comprehensive literature search was performed, and key articles related to PET/CT in the abdomen and pelvis were identified, reviewed, and summarized. Under the search term "PET/CT", 142 articles were identified in the National Library of Medicine PubMed database, and a number of general findings are summarized.

PET/CT allows for the accurate localization of foci of radiotracer uptake and their separation from normal structures. In our experience, the method is quantitatively accurate, rapid, and easily implemented, including contrast studies, in clinical practice across a wide range of abdominopelvic indications. Although artifacts can occur from a variety of causes, close attention to protocol details and patient immobilization reduces their frequency. Where systematically studied, PET/CT improves diagnostic accuracy.

### Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^113exk1p]. Annals of Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be associated with various clinical manifestations. Notable symptoms and associations include a palpable abdominal mass, superior vena cava syndrome, splenomegaly, and testicular lump. It may also present alongside Sjögren's disease, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, increased serum LDH, hepatomegaly, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Additional associations include common variable immunodeficiency, fatigue, mediastinal enlargement, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, fever, and general lymphadenopathy. Patients could experience neck masses, night sweats, rheumatoid arthritis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and weight loss as symptoms. DLBCL can also be linked with dyspnea, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, spinal cord compression, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, severe combined immunodeficiency, and HIV infection.

### Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy [^1145udRh]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

We investigated eight CT features of mesenteric panniculitis but were unable to extract all of these from any individual article, indicating that description of CT features was generally poor. Of the nine studies that described whether patients had increased mesenteric density on CT scanning, 556 (90%) of 617 patients displayed this feature. Indeed, eight studies stipulated this feature as an inclusion criterion.

A discrete 'mass' was described in 473 (93%) of the 509 patients in whom this was evaluated. Again, several studies stipulated this feature as an inclusion criterion. Only four (27%) studies documented the dimension of any mass, reporting means of 40 mm (range 20–74 mm), 50 mm (27–108 mm), 95 mm (range 71–152 mm), and 95 mm (standard deviation 19 mm) respectively. Six studies stated whether a hyperattenuating rim appeared to encapsulate the region of mesenteric panniculitis, with this feature being present in 239 (57%) of the 417 patients evaluated. The individual proportion ranged between 35% and 59%.

Given that lymph nodes are a prominent feature of mesenteric panniculitis, the description of nodal imaging characteristics was surprisingly sparse overall. Some studies described 'bulky lymphadenopathy' but did not define the nodal diameter or other characteristics necessary to satisfy this definition. Others defined lymphadenopathy as a diameter greater than 1 cm and noted the proportion of patients exceeding this threshold but provided no other details; for example, the mean diameter and range of nodal size for these patients.

### Painful enlarging umbilical nodule with cyclical swelling [^113dwNAb]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: Which test would be most diagnostic?

	- A. Abdominal ultrasound
	- B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
	- C. Laparoscopic evaluation
	- D. Biopsy of the nodule
	- E. MRI of the abdomen

- **Answers**:
	- A. Abdominal ultrasound – Incorrect. While abdominal ultrasound can be used to diagnose and screen for complications of an umbilical hernia, it would not be diagnostic for umbilical endometriosis.

	- B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis – Incorrect. Umbilical endometriosis cannot be diagnosed on radiographic appearance alone. An abdominopelvic CT is necessary in the workup of a Sister Mary Joseph nodule to delineate the source and extent of metastatic malignancy.

	- C. Laparoscopic evaluation – Incorrect. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing pelvic endometriosis but does not confirm cutaneous endometriosis. While many patients with primary umbilical endometriosis have concomitant pelvic endometriosis, the literature reveals patients with umbilical endometriosis without pelvic endometriosis.

	- D. Biopsy of the nodule – Correct. Biopsy exhibits an acanthotic epidermis overlying ectatic glands lined by columnar-type epithelium and surrounded by endometrial-type stroma and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (Fig 2). Biopsy should be performed when cutaneous endometriosis is suspected due to the potential for malignant transformation. No malignant cells were detected in this case.

	- E. MRI of the abdomen – Incorrect. Magnetic resonance imaging cannot diagnose cutaneous endometriosis since radiographic findings are not diagnostic. MRI can be a useful tool for evaluating the depth of invasion.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute nonlocalized abdominal pain [^1158fzNi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intra-abdominal abscess, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate for postoperative abscesses, leaks, and hemorrhage in postoperative patients with nonlocalized abdominal pain and fever.

### Acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic impact of immediate CT scanning [^113uX89N]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common diagnostic problem. This study aimed to evaluate the routine use of contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning early in the diagnostic process.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted on 2,222 patients with acute abdominal pain who underwent contrast-enhanced CT scanning within 24 hours after admission. The diagnoses obtained were compared with the final diagnoses after one month.

- **Results**: After CT scanning, the following diagnoses were suggested as the primary cause of the abdominal pain: nonspecific abdominal pain 984 (44.3%), appendicitis 354 (15.9%), bowel obstruction 190 (8.6%), diverticulitis 182 (8.2%), gastrointestinal perforation 52 (2.3%), gallstone disease 64 (2.9%), pancreatitis 72 (3.2%), inflammatory bowel disease 13 (0.6%), intra-abdominal malignancy 34 (1.5%), vascular disease (including one completely cured patient with paradoxical embolization in the superior mesenteric artery) 33 (1.5%), urological 131 (5.9%), gynecological 54 (2.4%), and miscellaneous 31 (1.4%). In 28 cases, a conclusive CT examination could not be carried out. The suggested diagnoses were correct in 2,151 cases (96.8%). In 16 cases (0.7%), an incorrect diagnosis was reported, leading to 7 unnecessary laparotomies. False negative reports were obtained in 27 cases (1.2%). After CT examination, 500 patients could be discharged immediately.

- **Conclusions**: Contrast-enhanced CT scanning results in superior diagnostic precision in patients with acute abdominal pain. The present work supports the strategy to include this examination early in the routine diagnostic process.

### A national survey on radiation dose in CT in the Netherlands [^113k1puw]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Our survey design is most comparable to the German survey by Brix et al. The doses are lower than in that particular survey for almost all protocols. Compared to the data published by Shrimpton et al. and Wall et al. from the UK, which is one of the countries with the lowest CT doses worldwide, CT doses in the Netherlands are very similar.

It should be noted that we used the published E/DLP conversion factors derived using the ICRP-103 weighting factors. Use of ICRP-60 factors would change the results, but the level of change depends on the specific protocol. For equal DLP, head CT protocols would result in a 16% lower effective dose, neck CT protocols in a 12% higher effective dose, thorax CT protocols in a 7% lower effective dose, abdomen CT protocols in an unchanged dose, and pelvic CT protocols in a 30% higher dose (abdomen-pelvis 14% higher).

The similarity in the data of this survey compared to its predecessor indicates, however, that during that period, the more liberal use of CT and expansion of CT indications have been balanced with newer technology for dose optimization, such as volumetric tube modulation and interactive collimation to reduce overranging.

Only a few hospitals in this small sample exceed the DLP set as the reference dose level for CT abdomen, but more than 25% exceed the level set for CT pulmonary angiography. An integral part of this survey was feedback at the protocol level as a counterattack against this variability and to lower doses nationwide. The best management strategy for this feedback will be a topic for future study.

### Detection of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes by 16-row MDCT: Is contrast material needed [^115WAP1Z]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

To retrospectively evaluate whether contrast administration is necessary in the detection of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes when thin slice axial and coronal MDCT images are used, the following study was conducted:

- **Materials and method**: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board; informed consent was not required. Thirty-five patients who needed a chest CT (0.75 mm x 16) for various reasons were included. Four different image sets were reconstructed for each patient: non-enhanced axial (N-Ax), non-enhanced coronal MPR (N-Co), enhanced axial (E-Ax), and enhanced coronal MPR (E-Co). All images were 1 mm thick and interval. Two board-certified chest radiologists independently evaluated whether a lymph node with a short diameter larger than 5 mm existed in each nodal station of the mediastinum and hilum. Two different board-certified chest radiologists assessed all four image sets together and established a reference standard by consensus. Interobserver agreement between the two readers was assessed by kappa statistics. Accuracy was calculated for each image set and compared using McNemar's test.

- **Results**: A total of 211 nodal stations, including 113 mediastinal and 98 hilar, were defined as present to establish the reference standard. Except for N-Ax, the kappa values were moderate to substantial (0.53–0.81). The accuracy for hilar node detection was significantly higher for the contrast-enhanced images in both the axial (p < 0.001) and coronal (p < 0.01) data sets. The addition of contrast material did not significantly increase accuracy for the detection of mediastinal nodes.

### Investigation of a unilateral pleural effusion: What CT scan coverage is optimal [^112Tv6do]. Thorax (2020). Low credibility.

Use of thoracic CT for patients presenting with a unilateral pleural effusion is well established. However, there is no consensus regarding the inclusion of the entire abdomen and pelvis in the initial imaging protocol. In this prospective UK-based study, 249 patients presenting with a unilateral effusion had a CT thorax, abdomen, and pelvis performed. The prevalence of malignancy on thoracic CT was 56% (140/249). Clinically significant findings below the diaphragm were identified in 59 patients (24%). Integrating this approach into standard practice allows more rapid identification of the primary malignancy, upstaging lesions, or alternative sites for biopsy.

### Improved assessment of mediastinal and pulmonary pathologies in combined staging CT examinations using a fast-speed acquisition dual-source CT protocol [^1126foDm]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the feasibility of fast Dual-Source CT (DSCT) and to evaluate its clinical utility in chest/abdomen/pelvis staging CT studies, we conducted a study involving 45 cancer patients. Each patient underwent two follow-up combined chest/abdomen/pelvis staging CT examinations, with the maximal difference in tube potential set at ± 10 kV. The first scan utilized our standard protocol (fixed pitch 0.6), while the second employed a novel fast-speed DSCT protocol (fixed pitch 1.55). Effective doses (ED) were calculated, noise measurements performed, and scan times compared. Motion artifacts were evaluated, and diagnostic confidence was assessed through consensus reading.

The results showed that ED for standard and fast-speed scans were 9.1 (7.0–11.1) mSv and 9.2 (7.4–12.8) mSv, respectively (P = 0.075). Image noise was either comparable (abdomen, all P > 0.05) or reduced in fast-speed CTs (trachea, P = 0.001; ascending aorta, P < 0.001). Motion artifacts in the heart and ascending aorta (all P < 0.001) and breathing artifacts (P < 0.031) were reduced in fast DSCT. The diagnostic confidence for evaluating mediastinal (P < 0.001) and pulmonary (P = 0.008) pathologies improved with fast DSCT.

Fast DSCT allows for chest/abdomen/pelvis staging CT examinations to be performed within 2 seconds of scan time and eliminates relevant intrathoracic motion and breathing artifacts. Consequently, mediastinal and pulmonary pathologies can be assessed with high diagnostic confidence while maintaining excellent abdominal image quality.

### Tuberculosis revisited: Classic imaging findings in childhood [^111f2S3i]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is the most common manifestation of abdominal tuberculosis (TB) and is often caused by the ingestion of infected food. It primarily affects the lymph nodes in the mesentery and omentum of the epigastrium, at the porta hepatis, along the coeliac axis, and around the pancreas. There are various patterns of TB lymphadenopathy, with multiple mildly enlarged lymph nodes located in clusters being the most common. Central necrosis and peripheral enhancement complete the features of infection (Fig. 39).

Fig. 39: A 9-year-old boy with ileocecal tuberculosis. Axial (a) and coronal (b) contrast-enhanced computed tomography images show circumferential mural thickening involving the caecum and terminal ileum. Enlarged calcified lymph nodes are also seen on the coronal image (arrow).

Peritoneal involvement is usually divided into three types, depending on the most dominant pathological process. However, all processes are often present concomitantly, with a dynamic and changing clinical and pathological picture. The wet ascitic type is characterized by a large volume of free or loculated fluid of high density (due to increased protein levels) and prominent peritoneal enhancement (Fig. 40). The dry plastic type is characterized by a fibrous peritoneal response with nodules in the peritoneum and the formation of adhesions (Fig. 41). In the fixed fibrotic type, disease affecting the omentum and mesentery extends into the bowel serosa, with features of matted bowel loops on imaging. Omental masses and loculated ascites are often present.

### Current concepts in lymph node imaging [^116KAgic]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The accurate identification and characterization of lymph nodes by imaging have important therapeutic and prognostic significance in patients with newly diagnosed cancers. The presence of nodal metastases limits therapeutic options and generally indicates a worse prognosis in these patients. Thus, it becomes crucial to have this information before commencing therapy.

Cross-sectional imaging modalities rely on insensitive size and morphologic criteria, lacking the desired accuracy for characterizing lymph nodes. This is mainly because metastases can be present in non-enlarged lymph nodes, and not all enlarged nodes are malignant. PET has overcome some of these limitations but is constrained by resolution limits for small nodal metastases, which has fueled the development of targeted techniques for nodal imaging and characterization as outlined in this article.

In the past few years, studies have shown that these newer imaging techniques can bridge some of the limitations of existing imaging for nodal characterization and thereby provide the much-needed staging information before the initiation of therapy.

### Efficacy of noncontrast computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis for evaluating nontraumatic acute abdominal pain in the emergency department [^114efHNL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) clarity has significantly improved since its introduction in the early 1980s. This advancement has led to uncertainty regarding the utility and benefit of contrast material for image quality of the abdomen and pelvis, which remains minimally studied.

- **Objectives**: This study sought to assess the efficacy of a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. It focused on evaluating patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute nontraumatic abdominal pain by following them for 7 days and observing for signs and symptoms of clinically significant acute emergent pathology.

- **Methods**: We enrolled a prospective observational convenience sample of patients, following them for 7 days. These patients received a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in the ED for acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. The primary outcome, defined as a failure, was abdominal surgery or death as the result of an intra-abdominal process not found on the original noncontrast CT scan. Another indicator of failure was a subsequent contrasted CT scan revealing a finding that could explain the original complaint of abdominal pain that was not seen on the initial noncontrast CT during the 7-day observation.

- **Results**: Seventy-two patients were enrolled in the study. The incidence of failure was 0% (0/72). Of the patients, 46% (33/72) had a negative CT scan, while 54% (39/72) had a positive CT scan. Additionally, 57% (41/72) were admitted, and 43% (31/72) were discharged. Abdominal surgery was performed on 11% (8/72) of patients, and a repeat contrasted CT scan was conducted on 4% (3/72).

- **Conclusions**: With specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis is a reliable diagnostic tool for patients presenting with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain in the emergency department.

### Are facilities following best practices of pediatric abdominal CT scans [^115FhGHF]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Established guidelines for pediatric abdominal CT scans include reduced radiation dosage to minimize cancer risk and the use of intravenous (IV) contrast to obtain the highest-quality diagnostic images. We aim to determine if these practices are implemented at nonpediatric facilities that transfer children to a pediatric facility.

- **Methods**: Children transferred to a tertiary pediatric facility over a 16-month period with abdominal CT scans performed for evaluation of possible appendicitis were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, diagnosis, radiation dosage, CT contrast use, and scan quality. If CT scans were repeated, the radiation dosage between facilities was compared using the Student t-test.

- **Results**: Ninety-one consecutive children transferred from 29 different facilities had retrievable CT scan images and clinical information. Half of the CT scans from transferring institutions used IV contrast. Due to poor quality or inconclusive CT scans, 19 patients required a change in management. Children received significantly less radiation at our institution compared to the referring adult facility for the same body area scanned on the same child (9.7 mSv versus 19.9 mSv, P = 0.0079).

- **Conclusion**: Pediatric facilities may be using less radiation per CT scan due to heightened awareness of radiation risks and specific pediatric CT scanning protocols. The benefits of IV contrast for the diagnostic yield of pediatric CT scans should be considered to obtain the best possible image and to prevent additional imaging. Every facility performing pediatric CT scans should minimize radiation exposure while maintaining image quality.

### MR evaluation of normal retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes [^115VPV3Y]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

To establish guidelines for normal retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph node size at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by correlation with computed tomographic (CT) and lymphangiographic (LAG) data, twelve patients previously studied with pre- and post-LAG CT to determine normal pelvic lymph node size were examined with MRI. All were on surveillance for stage I testicular tumour (minimum follow-up 10 years). Three observers recorded blind the site, size, and number of nodes in the retroperitoneum and pelvis at 11 sites, and the results were validated with previous CT imaging.

Initially, eight hundred and fifteen nodes in 12 patients were visible on the MRI, and a further 44 nodes were identified after comparison with post-LAG CT. More nodes were seen on MRI than on CT. The 95th centile values for maximum short axis diameter (MSAD) of pelvic lymph nodes were common iliac and obturator 4 mm, external and internal iliac 5 mm, and hypogastric 6 mm. In the retroperitoneum, the 95th centile MSAD values were retrocrural, high left para-aortic, paracaval, and interaortocaval 3 mm, post-caval 4 mm, and low left para-aortic 5 mm.

MRI criteria for normal retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph node size are defined. Adoption of these recommendations may improve the sensitivity of MRI for the detection of nodal metastases.

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis: an old but resurgent problem [^116Q6TiN]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Abdominal tuberculosis can develop through direct involvement via ingestion of infected lung secretions, infected unpasteurized dairy products, or infected undercooked meats, or during or after primary lung infection by spreading lymphatically or hematogenously from a focus elsewhere in the body. TB can affect all abdominal organs and tissues. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific and depend on the organ involved, the extent of the affected site, and the duration of the disease (acute, chronic, or acute upon chronic). In general, clinical features may include fever (40–70%), pain (80–95%), weight loss (40–90%), ascites, diarrhea, anorexia, malaise, and bowel obstruction.

- **Abdominal lymphadenopathy**: Abdominal lymphadenopathy is the most common abdominal TB involvement, seen in 55–66% of patients. CT imaging is observed as group-forming, round-shaped, and centrally hypodense lymph nodes with and without calcification.

		- Fig. 23: Transverse abdomen CT image (a) of a 17-year-old female with known TB. Coarse calcifications in the liver parenchyma suggestive of TB sequelae are noted. Coronal reformatted CT image of the same patient (b) reveals multiple lymphadenopathies with peripheral calcifications.

### Efficacy of laparoscopic mesenteric/retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy [^114f5hnX]. Surgical Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy identified incidentally during computed tomography (CT) mandates a tissue diagnosis. When percutaneous techniques are not possible, surgical tissue diagnosis becomes necessary. Laparotomy is the gold standard; however, a laparoscopic approach offers many potential benefits.

- **Methods**: This institutional review board (IRB)-approved study evaluated all patients undergoing laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy from 2001 to 2007 at the Cleveland Clinic. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed for age, sex, pathologic diagnosis, conversion to laparotomy, and perioperative complications.

- **Results**: A total of 30 cases were reviewed. In this group, 67% were males and 33% were female; the mean age was 48 years. Ten patients underwent mesenteric lymph node sampling, and 20 (67%) underwent retroperitoneal tumor resection. There were four (17%) conversions and no complications. Lymphoma was the most common pathologic finding.

- **Conclusion**: Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is a safe, effective alternative to open surgical biopsy.

### Diagnostic reference level quantities for adult chest and abdomen-pelvis CT examinations: correlation with organ doses [^116V7h2w]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Future improvements, considering clinical indications, may also improve the applicability of the method. This approach is intrinsically limited by the reduced number of machines and protocols included in the real-data evaluation. In particular, the large variability of TCM strategies and local adoption of different iterative reconstruction algorithms will always result in machine-cohort-protocol dependence. However, these limitations do not reduce the applicability of the method to other clinically relevant situations. Special care must be taken when analyzing the results in terms of organ dose groups, as partial irradiation may introduce bias, particularly in the case of the esophagus, considered a peripheral organ in chest examinations.

### What is the clinical importance of incidental findings on staging CT scans in patients with sarcoma [^11381eAP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Low credibility.

Baseline staging CT scans are performed on nearly every patient after the diagnosis of a sarcoma to evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease. These scans often identify abnormalities that may or may not be related to the known malignancy. Despite the high frequency of incidental findings, there is little guidance for clinicians faced with assessing these radiographic abnormalities. The interpretation of incidental findings is important because it may influence decisions regarding surveillance frequency, prognostic estimation, and surgical and medical intervention.

- **Questions/purposes**: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of abnormal findings and indeterminate nodules on staging CT scans; the natural history of indeterminate nodules identified at the time of sarcoma diagnosis; and the factors associated with indeterminate nodules representing true metastatic disease.

- **Methods**: Between September 2010 and February 2016, we treated 233 patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Of those, 227 (97%) had a staging CT scan of the chest or chest/abdomen/pelvis performed within 2 months of diagnosis. To be eligible for this retrospective study, a patient had to have a minimum of 6 months of radiographic follow-up after that initial CT scan. A total of 36 (16%) were lost to follow-up or did not have radiographic surveillance at least 6 months later, and 48 (21%) were excluded for other prespecified reasons, leaving 149 patients for evaluation. We recorded all abnormal findings listed in the official radiology CT report of the lung, bone…

### CT for acute nontraumatic abdominal pain-is oral contrast really required [^1169NqqT]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

This study aims to compare the diagnostic performance of abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed with and without oral contrast in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute nontraumatic abdominal pain.

- **Materials and methods**: Between December 2013 and December 2014, 348 adult patients presenting to the ED of a large tertiary medical center with nontraumatic abdominal pain were evaluated. Exclusion criteria for the study were a history of inflammatory bowel disease, recent abdominal operation, and suspected renal colic, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, or intestinal obstruction. All patients underwent intravenous contrast-enhanced abdominal CT on a Philips Brilliance 64-slice scanner using a routine abdomen protocol.

The study group included 174 patients who underwent abdominal CT scanning without oral contrast, recruited using convenience sampling. A control group of 174 patients was matched to the cohort group's gender and age and underwent abdominal CT with oral contrast material during the same time period. The patients' medical records were reviewed for various clinical findings and for the final clinical diagnosis.

The CT exams were initially reviewed by a senior attending radiologist to determine the exams' technical adequacy and to decide whether an additional scan with oral contrast was required. Two senior radiologists, blinded to the clinical diagnosis, later performed consensus reading to determine the contribution of oral contrast administration to the radiologists' diagnostic confidence and its influence on the diagnostic outcomes.

### Abdominal ultrasound for diagnosing abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement in HIV-positive individuals [^1176b5dZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

An estimated 14% of the 6.4 million incident tuberculosis cases in 2017 were extrapulmonary tuberculosis [WHO 2018]. In people with HIV‐associated tuberculosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis accounts for up to 50% of all tuberculosis cases [Sharma 2004b; Kingkaew 2009; Namme 2013] and is often disseminated, meaning two or more non‐contiguous sites are simultaneously infected [Sharma 2005]. Any anatomical site can be involved, but the most common sites are the lymph nodes, pleura, meninges, and the abdominal cavity [Sharma 2005].

Many terms are used in the literature to describe tuberculosis in the abdominal cavity. For the purposes of this Cochrane Review, we use the terms abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement, excluding genitourinary tuberculosis. Many abdominal structures can be affected in abdominal tuberculosis or disseminated tuberculosis with abdominal involvement, including the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, omentum, mesentery, intra‐abdominal lymph nodes, and solid organs such as the liver, spleen, and pancreas [Sharma 2004b]. People often present with non‐specific symptoms and signs, and a high index of suspicion is therefore needed for early diagnosis and timely management. It mimics a large number of medical and surgical conditions, including malignant neoplasms, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic liver disease, and other gastrointestinal infections [Jadvar 1997].

### Effect of intravenous contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis on detection of urgent and non-urgent pathology: Can repeat CT within 72 hours be avoided [^113QejP2]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine if administering intravenous (IV) contrast for a CT abdomen and pelvis (CT AP) improves detection of urgent and clinically important non-urgent pathology in patients with urgent clinical symptoms. The study compared these results to patients who did not receive IV contrast. Additionally, it aimed to assess whether repeat CT exams on the same patient within 72 hours were of low diagnostic benefit if the first CT was performed with IV contrast.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 400 consecutive patients who had CT AP examinations repeated within 72 hours. For each patient, demographic data, reason for examination, examination time stamps, and examination technique were documented. CT AP radiology reports were reviewed, and both urgent and non-urgent pathology were extracted.

- **Results**: Of 400 patients, 63% had their initial CT AP without contrast. Administration of IV contrast for the first CT AP was associated with increased detection of urgent findings compared with non-contrast CT (p = 0.004). A contrast-enhanced CT AP following an initial non-contrast CT AP examination better characterized both urgent (p = 0.002) and non-urgent findings (p < 0.001). Adherence to American College of Radiology (ACR) appropriateness criteria for IV contrast administration was associated with increased detection of urgent pathology on the first CT (p = 0.02), and the second CT was more likely to be performed with IV contrast if recommended by the radiologist reading the first CT (p = 0.0006).

- **Conclusion**: In the absence of contraindications, it is encouraged that urgent care physicians preferentially order IV contrast-enhanced CT AP examinations in adherence with ACR appropriateness criteria.
