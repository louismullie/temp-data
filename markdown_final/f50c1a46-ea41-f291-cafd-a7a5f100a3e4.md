## Question

how long is ppd positive for after treatment for latent tb

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a PPD (tuberculin skin test) remains positive after treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the PPD actually measures and whether it detects live bacteria. Then, I should verify how treatment modifies the immune response and whether sterilization changes test results. Next, I will review direct evidence on TST persistence after LTBI therapy. After that, I should consider whether IGRA behaves differently and why. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats about interpretation and when retesting is reasonable.

> Let me first confirm what the PPD measures, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating infection with immunologic memory. The TST detects a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to purified protein derivative, reflecting sensitization of T lymphocytes to mycobacterial antigens; it does not distinguish current from past infection and can remain positive long after bacteria are cleared, which is a key limitation clinicians must remember [^111FHv9q] [^1132KgpC].

> Wait, let me verify the implication of that for treated LTBI. Since TST reflects immunologic memory rather than viable bacilli, effective treatment that sterilizes LTBI does not erase a positive TST; the test can stay positive for years or even indefinitely, even though the risk of progression to active TB has been substantially reduced by therapy [^111yG9V5] [^116vGSZY].

> I will now examine direct evidence on persistence after treatment. In a classic isoniazid prophylaxis trial, individuals with positive TST remained TST positive up to nine years after completing one year of isoniazid, despite a 60–70% reduction in active TB incidence, demonstrating that immunoreactivity outlasts elimination of infection by at least a decade [^116vGSZY]. Similarly, cohorts of healthcare workers and naval personnel showed that those with long-standing TST positivity remained positive after a year of isoniazid, whereas recent converters were more likely to revert, reinforcing that durable memory responses persist after treatment [^1132KgpC].

> Hold on, I should verify whether IGRA behaves the same way, because clinicians often ask if blood tests "clear" after therapy. IGRA responses also commonly persist after effective LTBI treatment; serial IGRA positivity often does not convert to negative after therapy, and guidelines caution against using IGRA to monitor treatment response for this reason, mirroring the TST limitation in this context [^114rYSDH] [^114Anz6N].

> Let me consider the clinical implications so I don't jump to conclusions. A persistent positive PPD after LTBI treatment should not be interpreted as treatment failure; it reflects immunologic memory and does not mandate retreatment or repeated testing in the absence of new risk factors or symptoms. Instead, clinicians should document the prior treatment and avoid serial TST/IGRA unless there is a new exposure or evolving immunosuppression that changes risk [^114Anz6N] [^116vGSZY].

> But wait, what if the patient is being retested for occupational health or pre-immunosuppression screening? I should double-check guidance here. In patients with a documented history of adequately treated LTBI, routine repeat TST or IGRA is generally not recommended; if testing is required by policy, a positive result should be interpreted in light of the prior treatment and clinical context, and alternative strategies (such as symptom screening and chest radiography when indicated) may be used to reassess risk rather than relying on immunologic tests that will likely remain positive [^111yG9V5].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. After effective treatment for latent TB infection, the PPD skin test commonly remains positive for years and may be lifelong because it measures durable T-cell memory; it does not track live bacilli and therefore should not be used to judge treatment efficacy or to guide retreatment decisions in the absence of new clinical information [^114Anz6N] [^116vGSZY] [^111tHEJv].

---

A PPD skin test can remain positive for years or even **lifelong** after successful treatment for latent TB, because it reflects persistent immune memory rather than active infection [^114Anz6N] [^116vGSZY]. The test **should not be used to monitor treatment response** or to decide retreatment; once LTBI is treated, further PPD testing is not recommended unless there is new exposure or changing risk [^114Anz6N]. IGRA may revert after treatment in some cases, but it is not reliable for monitoring either, so clinical judgment and risk assessment should guide follow-up [^111fCgy9].

---

## Persistence of PPD positivity after treatment

- **Immunological memory**: PPD positivity reflects a durable T-cell memory response that persists after bacterial clearance, so it often remains positive for years or decades [^114Anz6N] [^116vGSZY].

- **Clinical evidence**: Large trials and cohorts show that many patients remain PPD positive years after completing isoniazid therapy, including 9+ years in some series [^116vGSZY] [^111tHEJv].

- **Duration variability**: The persistence varies by individual and is influenced by age, immune status, and timing of infection; recent converters may revert sooner than those with long-standing positivity [^111tHEJv].

---

## Clinical implications of persistent PPD positivity

- **Not an indicator of active infection**: Persistent positivity does not mean ongoing infection or treatment failure; it reflects immunologic memory only [^114Anz6N] [^116vGSZY].

- **Not for treatment monitoring**: PPD should not be used to assess treatment response or to decide on retreatment [^114Anz6N].

- **Clinical management**: Once LTBI is adequately treated, further PPD testing is generally unnecessary unless new exposure occurs or risk changes [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)

IGRAs measure IFN-γ responses to TB-specific antigens and are more specific than PPD, but they **can also remain positive after treatment** and are not recommended for monitoring therapy [^111fCgy9] [^114Anz6N]. Like PPD, IGRA results reflect immunologic memory rather than active infection, so they should not be used to judge treatment success [^114Anz6N].

---

## Factors influencing persistence of PPD positivity

Several factors influence how long PPD remains positive after treatment:

| **Factor** | **Influence on ppd persistence** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger patients may revert faster than older patients |
| Immune status | Immunocompromised patients may have altered responses |
| Timing of infection | Recent converters may revert sooner than long-standing positives |
| Treatment regimen | Shorter rifamycin-based regimens may be associated with faster reversion in some studies |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that **PPD should not be used to monitor LTBI treatment**; instead, clinicians should rely on adherence confirmation, absence of new exposures, and clinical assessment [^114Anz6N]. Routine repeat PPD testing after completed therapy is not recommended unless new risk factors or exposures arise [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Persistence**: PPD can remain positive for years or lifelong after successful LTBI treatment due to immunologic memory [^114Anz6N] [^116vGSZY].

- **Not for monitoring**: PPD should not be used to assess treatment response or guide retreatment decisions [^114Anz6N].

- **Clinical judgment**: Management should be based on adherence, exposure risk, and clinical assessment, not serial PPD results [^notfound].

- **IGRA**: IGRA may revert in some cases but is not reliable for monitoring treatment either [^111fCgy9].

A PPD skin test can remain positive for years or lifelong after successful LTBI treatment because it reflects durable immune memory; it should not be used to monitor treatment, and clinical judgment should guide follow-up.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^116hhuQV]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of latent M. tuberculosis infection

Despite the fact that control and management of TB in many low TB incidence countries is centered around the identification and subsequent treatment of individuals latently infected with M. tuberculosis (LTBI), actual identification of LTBI in human subjects is presently not feasible. The current diagnostic tests (such as the tuberculin skin test or more recently developed T cell-based assays) are only designed to measure the adaptive immune response of the host exposed to M. tuberculosis, typically six to eight weeks after exposure to the bacilli.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) measures cell-mediated immunity in the form of a DTH response to a complex cocktail of > 200 M. tuberculosis antigens, known as purified protein derivative (PPD) and the test result is usually read as induration (in mm) recorded 48 to 72 hours after intradermal injection of PPD. The criteria for a positive TST vary considerably and depend on the inoculum and type of PPD preparation used in the test. In the United States, 5 tuberculin units (TUs) are generally used and the induration of ≥ 5 mm in HIV-seropositive or organ transplant recipient or in a person in contact with a known case of active TB is considered as positive. However, in foreign-born persons originating from high TB incidence countries or persons at higher risk of exposure to M. tuberculosis (such as health care professionals), induration of ≥ 10 mm is regarded as positive TST. In most European countries, 2 TUs are used and the induration of ≥ 10 mm in immunocompetent adults is considered as positive. In the United Kingdom, 10 TUs are used and the induration of 5–15 mm in BCG unvaccinated and ≥ 15 mm in BCG vaccinated immunocompetent adults is considered as positive. Skin test reaction over 20 mm is usually due to active disease; however, a negative skin test in an active TB patient may also result from anergy or incorrect administration of the test or improper storage of the test reagents, thus compromising the sensitivity of the test. Skin testing is most suitable for detecting M. tuberculosis infection in developing countries where > 80% of the global TB cases occur, as it does not require extensive laboratory facilities and health care workers are already familiar with administering and reading skin tests. However, TST has several inherent problems as the antigens present in PPD are also present in the vaccine strain M. bovis BCG and several environmental mycobacteria. Hence, TST has lower specificity as the test can not differentiate between infection with M. tuberculosis, prior vaccination with M. bovis BCG or sensitization with environmental mycobacteria. Furthermore, sensitivity of TST is limited in immunocompromised individuals due to anergy. These factors have compromised the sensitivity and specificity of tuberculin skin test for the diagnosis of LTBI.

### Extent and effects of recurrent shortages of purified-protein derivative tuberculin skin test antigen solutions-United States, 2013 [^111CkVmQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Two kinds of immunologic tests are used for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: TSTs * and interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) blood tests. The indications for using these tests are the same, although one or the other test is preferred for certain populations (e.g. TST is preferred for children aged < 5 years). These preferences could play a role in setting priorities when one of the methods is unavailable. Together, these tests are the only means for detecting latent M. tuberculosis infection, and they contribute to diagnosing active TB disease. When findings such as chest radiography and mycobacterial cultures are sufficient for confirming or excluding the diagnosis of TB disease, the results from TST or IGRA might be unnecessary. However, most TB cases in the United States are diagnosed with an array of diagnostic findings, including results from TST or IGRA. When TB disease is strongly suspected, specific treatment should be started, regardless of results from these tests.

### The meta-analysis for ideal cytokines to distinguish the latent and active TB infection [^117WbWnJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is still an urgent public health threat and a leading cause of death in spite of worldwide application of vaccination. It has been estimated that approximately a fourth of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The majority of infected individuals are able to control the infection and remain asymptomatic, establishing a state of latent TB infection (LTBI). But approximately 5 to 10% LTBI patients develop into active TB due to reactivation and resuscitation of dormant bacilli indicating that persons with LTBI are the largest reservoir of infectious source after activation. Thus, the development of rapid and accurate new diagnostic methods that can detect Mtb infection, especially distinguish between active TB and LTBI, is essential for intensifying the fight against TB and implementing the End TB Strategy.

Diagnosis of TB status is challenging due to its diverse clinical forms and outcomes. Current active TB diagnosis relies on microbiologic detection of the pathogen, radiological imaging or clinical manifestations. Measurement of host immune responses, like the tuberculin skin test (TST) that is the intracutaneous injection of purified protein derivative (PPD) into the forearm, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs) including the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) assay and T-SPOT.TB test, remains the common diagnosis for TB infection. However, the TST bears limited specificity due to fail in identifying non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) as well as Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination. Although the T-cell-based IGRAs have higher specificity than the traditional TST, they remain relatively insensitive and considerable indetermining results especially in immunocompromised individuals and young children. Another significant limitation of both TST and IGRAs is unable to distinguish between active TB and LTBI, and this greatly hampers the early treatment and control of TB. Consequently, an immunodiagnostic test to discriminate the infection statues is urgent required and would be a major advance for clinical care.

### Isinfection life long? [^114Anz6N]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Key messages

Two billion people worldwide are thought to be asymptomatically (latently) infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and at risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB)
The prevalence of latent TB infection is inferred from tests that detect immunoreactivity to mycobacterial antigens rather than live bacteria and from mathematical modelling
Longitudinal studies and clinical trials show that this TB immunoreactivity can persist after curative treatment
Most people with TB immunoreactivity do not develop active TB upon immunosuppression, suggesting that they have cleared their infection while retaining immunological memory to it
TB immunoreactivity cannot distinguish cleared from persistent infection, emphasising the urgent need for tests that can identify people with asymptomatic infections

A critical component of the World Health Organization's End TB strategy is the prevention of active tuberculosis (TB) by treating people with latent TB infection. This requires knowledge of who is latently or asymptomatically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As there are no direct tests for asymptomatic infection, it is inferred from the presence of TB immunoreactivity, determined by either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). The use of immunoreactivity as a proxy for infection is based on the assumption that those testing positive harbour live bacteria, which might be quiescent now but can spring to activity to cause disease later, especially if the host becomes immunocompromised.

Is this assumption valid? Knowing this would be useful for several interested parties — public health officials, TB researchers, people showing TB immunoreactivity, and doctors. We tested the assumption that TB immunoreactivity equals persistent infection by analysing the natural history of TB immunoreactivity in people given preventive treatment and of active TB in immunoreactive people with various forms of severe immunosuppression.

### Evaluation of the effect of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection on quantiFERON-TB gold assay results [^111fCgy9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the utility of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay for monitoring latent tuberculosis treatment efficacy, the assay was performed serially for healthcare workers receiving isoniazid therapy. After 9 months of isoniazid therapy, all of these healthcare workers remained QuantiFERON-TB Gold positive, and cellular proliferation assays revealed persistently strong purified protein derivative responses. These results do not support the use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay to monitor therapy.

### National shortage of purified-protein derivative tuberculin products [^113ojjSV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Tubersol, a product of Sanofi Pasteur Limited, is in short supply nationwide until at least the end of May 2013. Tubersol is one of two purified-protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin products licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The manufacturer has notified CDC that 50-dose vials of Tubersol will remain unavailable until the end of May 2013 and that supplies of 10-dose vials are still being reestablished: the product is available only by contacting Sanofi directly (ator telephone, 800-822-2463). JHP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, the manufacturer of Aplisol, the other PPD tuberculin product licensed by FDA, has notified FDA that the product is available in restricted quantity. Acute local shortages of Aplisol also have been reported to CDC by TB control officials, as health-care providers switch from Tubersol to Aplisol. The shortages of Aplisol probably will diminish as Tubersol supplies are restored to their preshortage availability in the normal distribution networks. This report advises public health officials, clinicians, and workers in occupational health and infection control about how to adapt to the shortage.

Two kinds of immunologic methods are used for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) blood tests. The indications for use of these tests are the same, although one or the other method is preferred for certain populations, and this could play a role in setting priorities when one of the methods is unavailable. Together, these tests are the only means for detecting latent M. tuberculosis infection, and they contribute to diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) disease. When findings such as chest radiography, nucleic acid amplification test of sputum, and/or mycobacterial cultures are sufficient for confirming or excluding TB, the results from a TST or an IGRA blood test might not be needed. A negative TST or IGRA result does not exclude the possibility of TB infection because some persons can have a compromised ability to react to tests for TB infection. However, most persons diagnosed with TB in the United States have had a positive TST or IGRA blood test that has contributed to that diagnosis. When TB disease is strongly suspected, specific treatment should be started regardless of results of a TST or an IGRA blood test.

### Recent advances in testing for latent TB [^114FyxKQ]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

After more than a century of relying on skin testing for the diagnosis of latent TB infection, clinicians now have access to blood-based diagnostics in the form of interferon γ release assays (IGRAs). These tests are generally associated with higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of latent TB infection. This article reviews the indications for testing and treatment of latent TB infection in the overall context of a TB control program and describes how IGRAs might be used in specific clinical settings and populations, including people having close contact with an active case of TB, the foreign born, and health-care workers.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115WVym7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests for LTBI — two types are used in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires intradermal purified protein derivative with interpretation 48 to 72 hours later, whereas the IGRA uses a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response with laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. FDA-approved IGRAs include T-SPOT.TB, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and QuantiFERON-Gold Plus; patients tested with an IGRA do not need to return for interpretation, and testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination because IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine and for persons who may be unlikely to return. Diagnosis of LTBI is based on further clinical assessment and ruling out active tuberculosis by medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and other laboratory tests.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: fruitful or futile? [^114QBWPo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) constitutes part of the TB disease spectrum. The diagnosis and treatment of LTBI is important, as global eradication targets will not be attainable without treating LTBI. These considerations also apply to drug-resistant TB, which threatens to derail control efforts. The World Health Organization has recently recommended that close contacts of index cases of TB, even in TB endemic countries, should be considered for LTBI treatment (even if they are HIV-uninfected or not children). However, the diagnosis of LTBI is challenging. Unlike with active TB, in humans there is no microbiological or histopathological reference standard for LTBI, and one can only infer the potential presence of LTBI using immunodiagnostic tests, which enumerate the magnitude of relatively antigen-specific T-helper cell type 1 effect or T-cell responses. However, it is epidemiologically well-recognized that only a small proportion of individuals with presumed LTBI (∼5–10%) will progress to active TB over a lifetime. Thus, the more important public health question is whether, and how, we can accurately target treatment by identifying individuals who are most likely to progress to active TB. This state is broadly defined as "incipient TB" and is characterized by a lack of TB-related symptoms and appropriate chest radiographic abnormalities at the time of testing, as well as lack of any microbiological evidence of active TB, but a high likelihood of progression to active TB in the short-term, with the potential for perpetuating the transmission cycle. The duration from initial exposure to incipient TB or active disease is variable and will depend on several host, mycobacterial, and environmental factors. Epidemiological data suggest that of those infected, ∼5% will progress to active TB over the course of a 5-year period, with the highest risk being within the first 2 years of exposure. Biomarkers to identify incipient TB has remained one of the "Holy Grails" of TB research.

Biologic therapy — tuberculosis (TB) monitoring for pediatric psoriasis includes baseline testing and risk-based ongoing screening. Pretreatment testing for latent TB with purified protein derivative (PPD), T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold is advised; yearly testing for latent TB "should be done in patients at high risk", while "for patients who are not at high risk, screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist", and "this screening is particularly important for patients who are taking TNF-α inhibitors". The result of the QuantiFERON Gold test "can remain positive after treatment of latent TB", and "an annual chest radiograph may be considered at the discretion of the treating dermatologist"; this table is "expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations".

### Dual skin testing for latent tuberculosis infection: a decision analysis [^112i9xHL]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data indicate that 10- to 14-mm Mycobacterium tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) reactions are often due to prior infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria. Therefore, use of a 10-mm cutpoint to define latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) results in false-positive diagnoses and unnecessary treatment for LTBI. A second skin test, Mycobacterium avium sensitin (MAS), has been shown to accurately identify false-positive PPD results.

Objective

To compare the costs and accuracy of a single skin-test strategy (SST) with PPD alone with a dual skin-test strategy (DST) where 10- to 14-mm PPD results are also tested with MAS.

Methods

A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate the two strategies. The model accounted for the costs of skin testing, the costs of LTBI treatment, the costs of undetected LTBI, and the sensitivity and specificity of each strategy.

Results

We estimated that DST saved US dollars 3 per subject tested compared to SST. Savings were due to a reduction in false-positive PPD results and consequent reduction in unnecessary treatment for LTBI of > 60%. The DST strategy was associated with a minimal increase in undetected LTBI (6% vs 7%). Results were stable for a broad range of parameter values.

Conclusions

DST is a promising approach to improving the specificity of LTBI testing when a 10-mm PPD cutpoint is used and would reduce costs and unnecessary drug treatment.

### Reminder systems to improve patient adherence to tuberculosis clinic appointments for diagnosis and treatment [^115MswWm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spreads from person to person through inhalation of droplets nuclei. As a cause of human suffering, death, and impoverishment, TB ranks among the leading infectious diseases. In 2012, there were an estimated 8.6 million incident cases of TB and 1.3 million TB‐related deaths worldwide (WHO 2013).

In some settings, groups of people considered to be at high risk may be screened for latent TB infection using Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) tests (also known as tuberculin skin tests), such as the Mantoux or Heaf tests, or the more recently developed interferon‐gamma blood tests. PPD tests involve injecting a protein derivative of the M. tuberculosis bacillus into the skin, waiting 48 to 72 hours, and then measuring any localized swelling (or induration) of the skin around the injection site. People with positive results may then undergo further tests to detect or exclude active TB. Latent TB is treated for up to 12 months with antituberculous drugs to clear the latent infection and prevent the development of active disease; termed 'TB prophylaxis'.

The standard method for diagnosing active pulmonary TB (PTB) is sputum microscopy and culture, where people provide two or three sputum samples, including an early morning sample, collected on separate occasions. Patients are advised to return to the clinic to receive the results, and those with positive results are then referred for treatment. More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also recommended the use of a rapid molecular diagnostic test, known as Xpert® MTB/RIF, which can provide results within two hours (WHO 2011; Steingart 2014).

Treatment for active TB requires patients to take multiple medications for at least six months. The standard regimen currently recommended by the WHO includes four drugs for two months (the intensive phase), followed by two drugs for four months (the consolidation phase) (WHO 2003a).

Poor adherence to antituberculous treatment may lead to treatment failure and relapse (Ormerod 1991), drug resistance (Weis 1994; Mitchison 1998), and prolonged and expensive therapy that is less likely to be successful than the treatment of drug‐susceptible TB (Goble 1993). Poor adherence also results in increased transmission rates of the tubercle bacilli, morbidity, and cost to the TB control programmes (Johansson 1999).

### American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America: controlling tuberculosis in the United States [^11443SfC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Primary prophylaxis during the window period for high‑risk tuberculosis contacts — because tuberculin skin test results might take 8 to 10 weeks to become positive after infection, a second test should be placed 8 to 12 weeks after the last exposure, and during the 8- to 12-week window period contacts with initially negative tests should receive treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) after TB disease is ruled out if they are (1) contacts younger than 5 years (with highest priority given to those younger than 3 years) and (2) contacts with HIV infection or who are otherwise immunocompromised. If the second skin test result is negative (< 5 mm), the contact is immunocompetent and no longer exposed, treatment for LTBI may be discontinued and further follow-up is unnecessary. If the second skin test is negative but the contact is immunocompromised, a course of therapy for LTBI should be completed. If the second skin test result is negative but the person remains in close contact with an infectious patient, treatment for LTBI should be continued if the contact is younger than 5 years, aged 5 to 15 years at the clinician's discretion, or HIV‑seropositive or otherwise immunocompromised.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^113BsXit]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In the United States, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) affects between 10 and 15 million people, of whom 10% may develop active tuberculosis disease. People at increased risk for tuberculosis reactivation include recent immigrants from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis, children younger than age 5, people who have been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the past 2 years, or people with immunosuppression for a variety of reasons. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of LTBI are critical for controlling and eventually eliminating tuberculosis as a public health problem. Although the tuberculin skin test is the traditional diagnostic measure for LTBI, reduced specificity has promoted the development and utilization of the interferon-γ release assays as an in vitro blood test with specific antigens to M. tuberculosis (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test and the T.SPOT-TB test are commercially available). Despite the rise of the new diagnostic tests, however, there is still no gold standard for diagnosing LTBI, and epidemiologic risks and comorbidities need to be taken into account before initiating therapy. Current diagnostic tests combined with recommended treatment regimens are valuable tools that, when used correctly, promise to hurry the elimination of tuberculosis.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of nephrotic syndrome in children [^112aNPyK]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) rationale — therapy duration, resistance, and timing around transplantation: Therapy for active TB involves a multidrug regimen for at least 6 months with longer durations for more complex disease, and multidrug resistant TB makes up approximately 2–5% of cases with resistance rates in some areas exceeding 20%. The World Health Organization recommends at least 20 months of treatment for multidrug resistant TB, with cure rates for multidrug resistant-TB only 65%. Studies have shown that transplantation can successfully occur after 3–6 months of therapy for active TB with completion of therapy in the post-transplant setting, with documentation of culture-negative status and clinical and radiologic improvement. Latent TB is widespread, estimated to affect 1 in 4 people, and post-transplant there is a 20–55 fold increase in risk of TB reactivation; in many non-endemic countries (< 20 cases per 100,000 population annually) screening and subsequent treatment for latent TB are recommended. Screening can be performed using either purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test or an interferon-gamma release assay as well as a chest radiograph, and it should be repeated annually if there is ongoing risk of exposure while awaiting transplantation. There is no consensus on the duration of latent TB treatment needed before transplantation; however, once the patient is clinically tolerating therapy, transplantation can be performed, and because most reactivation occurs within the first year post-transplant, therapy for latent TB should be instituted no later than 1–2 weeks post-transplant if not started pre-transplant.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis [^1146GSZA]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

According to current recommendations, tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assays can be considered interchangeable, and tuberculin skin test should not replace interferon-gamma release assays for LTBI diagnosis in low- and middle-income settings. Both tests are limited by the inability to predict the risk of reactivation and cannot distinguish between latent infection and active disease. In case of a positive result to any of them, active TB must be reasonably ruled out before starting LTBI treatment, which is essential to avoid the selection of drug resistances. A 6-month course of daily isoniazid is the only currently recommended option for treatment in resource-limited settings, with life-long administration encouraged among people living with HIV in high TB transmission areas. Alternative therapeutic regimens can be considered in high-income countries for patients other than children and HIV-positive individuals (Tables 3 and 4).

Tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative [PPD]) interpretation — population-prevalence–dependent cutoffs and reading window: Widespread use of the intermediate strength of PPD (5) tuberculin units has demonstrated that reactors can be separated from nonreactors by diameters of 10 mm or greater of induration if the prevalence of active infection in the tested population at large is 10% or more, whereas the cutoff value is 15 mm or more when there is a lower prevalence of latent tuberculosis in the general population; tuberculin skin test readings up to 168 hours after application may still be reliable.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1155sRUQ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and test characteristics: Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires trained personnel to administer intradermal purified protein derivative and interpret the response 48 to 72 hours later. The IGRA requires a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response to specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination, as IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine, and for persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation.

### Factoring prior treatment into tuberculosis infection prevalence estimates, United States, 2011–2012 [^1132KgpC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, although tuberculosis (TB) incidence is at historic lows, the average annual rate of decline has slowed to 2%. To achieve TB elimination by 2100, sustained annual declines of twice that magnitude are needed. Most new cases of TB in the United States result from progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections acquired years earlier. TB elimination requires scaling up treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active TB. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2012 determined that ≈5% of the US population had LTBI on the basis of positivity of a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA). However, these TB test results may remain positive even after a patient has received effective treatment for active TB or LTBI. Specifically, the TST is widely believed to remain positive for life; whether the IGRA blood test remains positive is still undetermined. To better estimate the number of persons in the United States who are candidates for LTBI treatment, we refined the NHANES-based estimate of the national LTBI prevalence by excluding from analysis persons who reported having received prior treatment for active TB or LTBI.

### The risk of falsely declaring noninferiority of novel latent tuberculosis treatment in large trials [^115JSm7S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors examined the impact of LTBI prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity of currently available proxy tests for LTBI, and the choice of noninferiority margins and other parameters on the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials. There is much debate about what constitutes "true" latent infection. A particular concern in noninferiority trials relates to the specificity of a test for LTBI and the prevalence of true LTBI in the study population.

A low prevalence of LTBI would mean that many individuals in the trial are not infected, which increases the risk of falsely declaring noninferiority. This modeling analysis suggests that without testing for LTBI, that risk is substantial when the LTBI prevalence is below 45%. When LTBI prevalence is less than 45%, it is still better to "enrich" the trial population for LTBI by enrollment based on LTBI tests. However, as the low specificity of the LTBI test would again result in low prevalence, more specific tests, such as IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs), should be used. Indeed, more broadly, the authors conclude that noninferiority trials evaluating regimens for treating LTBI should enroll participants based on IGRAs rather than on the PPD tuberculin skin test (TST), to decrease the risk of misclassifying ineffective regimens as noninferior. The conclusion that IGRAs are better than TSTs was predetermined by the assumption that the TST has a considerably lower specificity (59–70% for TSTs vs. 93–99% for IGRAs) in "standard practice" than IGRAs. These specificity estimates are derived from studies that used a TST cutoff of 5 mm for children and HIV-infected individuals in accordance with CDC recommendations — a sensible public health decision to ensure that few cases of LTBI are missed by maximizing sensitivity at the expense of specificity. However, trials do not have to use standard TST cutoffs. Previous studies suggested that it is possible to achieve very high specificity levels with the TST using higher thresholds. Indeed, at cutoffs of ≥ 15 mm, the TST's ability to predict subsequent TB is similar to that of IGRAs.

Tuberculosis contact evaluation — contacts with a negative tuberculin skin test should be retested approximately 8 to 12 weeks after the first test unless the initial test was performed more than 8 weeks after the last exposure. Every 3 months, all contacts with negative skin test results who remain in close contact with an infectious patient should receive a repeat tuberculin skin test, and if symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) disease are present, a chest radiograph. A contact whose repeated test is positive (≥ 5 mm) should receive a chest radiograph; if the radiograph is normal, the contact should be evaluated for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and if it is abnormal, the patient should be evaluated for TB disease or other causes.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^114g4p63]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) — six or nine months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; 6 months daily is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally for HIV-positive adults and children of all ages, and 9 months daily is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIV-negative and HIV-positive. Isoniazid reduces the risk for developing TB disease in persons with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and can cause hepatotoxicity with discontinuation because of adverse effects, which are more common in adults than children. In HIV-positive persons who have a negative TST, anergy, or an unknown TST in settings with low TB incidence, the benefit of isoniazid is uncertain. Among HIV-positive persons living in areas with a high TB incidence, isoniazid is complementary to antiretroviral therapy, and Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that isoniazid plus antiretroviral therapy decreased the incidence of TB disease to a greater extent than either isoniazid alone or antiretroviral therapy alone; potential disadvantages include long duration, hepatotoxicity, and low treatment completion rates.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cAjfU]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Testing people for latent tuberculosis infection and providing effective treatment is critical to elimination of the disease. Deciding to test for latent infection depends on both the probability of infection and the risk for progression to active disease. As part of the assessment for latent tuberculosis infection, the tuberculin skin test (TST) or commercially available interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; T-SPOT. TB or QuantiFERON-TB (QFT)), or both, are commonly used. The TST and IGRA rely on an adaptive immune response to tuberculosis antigens. The TST involves an injection of non-specific tuberculosis antigens, which induces a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction that can be measured in infected individuals, whereas IGRAs are blood tests that measure interferon γ produced by lymphocytes in whole blood in the presence of tuberculosis specific antigens. In the presence of a positive test result for latent infection, treatment depends on a careful consideration of the benefits and risks. These primarily include the benefit of reducing an individual's probability of developing tuberculosis and the risk of treatment related side effects, which are substantial with current treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection.

### IFN-γ-independent immune markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure [^112RhCj2]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Main

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Exposure to Mtb leads to a spectrum of outcomes, including primary progressive disease and latent Mtb infection (LTBI). A diagnosis of LTBI is based on evidence of immune sensitization to Mtb antigens and the absence of clinical symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) or direct microbiologic evidence of disease. The clinical standards that establish evidence of Mtb exposure and infection include the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA). TST measures a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to purified protein derivative (PPD) from Mtb. The IGRA was developed to distinguish between bacille Calmette–Guèrin (BCG) vaccination and Mtb infection via the ex vivo measurement of T cell-produced IFN-γ to peptides from the Mtb proteins ESAT6 and CFP10.

A subset of healthy, immunocompetent individuals remain TST and IGRA negative despite persistent, high levels of exposure to Mtb. Highly Mtb -exposed but persistently TST and IGRA negative individuals have been described among healthcare workers, household contacts of patients with TB – and gold miners living and working in close quarters with individuals with active disease. These individuals have been dubbed 'resisters' related to their persistent ability to remain TST and IGRA negative. Initial studies seeking to define why these individuals continue to remain TST/IGRA negative despite high Mtb exposure identified two associated chromosomal loci. In addition, differences in transcriptional responses to Mtb infection were found in blood monocytes from these individuals compared with individuals who develop a positive TST after similar mycobacterial exposure. These innate signatures point to potentially unique, first-response immunity to Mtb. From the adaptive immune perspective, the persistent lack of TST and IGRA reactivity has been interpreted as suggesting that these individuals are uninfected despite long-term close-contact exposure. Another explanation could, however, be that the 'resister' phenotype reflects an alternative immune response to Mtb exposure and/or infection.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: fruitful or futile? [^111BEYz9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another broader issue raised by this study is the ambiguous and confusing interpretation of IGRA readouts. On the one hand, positive IGRA responses are often interpreted as a marker of LTBI, and hence "protection", given that ∼95% never progress to active disease, and serial IGRA responses often decrease during the course of successful TB treatment. In contrast, the work of Gupta and others suggests that IGRAs are a biomarker of incipient TB, and hence TB risk. Which is it, protection or risk? The answer is both, depending on the clinical context. Thus, the conundrum can be resolved by recognizing that TB is a spectrum of infection, which is a dynamic interplay between host and pathogen at the level of the granuloma, and this may change over time, reflecting time point–specific host immunity and mycobacterial disease burden (and hence changing levels of TB-specific effector T cells in blood). A temporal compartment-specific effect may also influence interpretation as a result of translocation of antigen-specific T cells from the blood to the disease site (e.g. the lung). Thus, serial measurements may often be required to determine whether IGRA responses are stable, increase in magnitude over time (conversion), or reduce in magnitude over time (reversion), possibly suggesting clearance of infection. This concept has been well outlined in a recent review. Thus, IGRA readouts can be a marker of protection or susceptibility depending on the context. This will explain why patients with stable, persistently positive IGRA responses remain asymptomatic and do not progress to active TB over many years, whereas those with increasing IFNγ-specific spot-forming units and/or responses progress to active TB, and others may revert to presumably clear their infection. Thus, selecting vaccine candidates simply on their ability to induce or drive antigen-specific IFN-y responses is counterintuitive; rather, selection based on preventing sustained conversion seems more logical and is an approach that has recently been used.

For now, the findings of Gupta and colleagues are clinically useful and point us in the right direction. The bottom line is that better biomarkers of incipient TB are required, and nascent biomarker signatures require urgent prospective clinical validation. It is hoped that these resource-intensive and challenging prospective validation studies (e.g. the CORTIS [The Correlate of Risk Targeted Intervention Study] study) will be fruitful rather than futile, as TB remains the foremost infectious disease killer globally.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rUEZa]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

In this meta-analysis we followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.

Search strategy and selection criteria

Because an earlier reviewincluding studies from 1949 to 2003 examining risk for progression to active tuberculosis disease indicated that older studies might be confounded by previously healed tuberculosisor by high levels of ongoing transmission, we limited our search to studies indexed from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019 in Medline, Embase, or the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials. We restricted the search to studies conducted in humans and published in English or French (see supplementary tables S1 to S3 for search strategies). Two reviewers (JRC and NW) independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full texts and resolved disagreements with a third reviewer (DM). The reference lists of selected full texts and identified systematic reviews were reviewed for additional studies.

We included clinical trials and retrospective or prospective cohort studies in which more than 50% of participants were recruited from 1990 onwards. Included studies reported TST results at internationally accepted cut points for indurations (≥ 5 mm, ≥ 10 mm, or ≥ 15 mm) or used commercially available assays (QFT-Gold, QFT-Gold-In-Tube (QIAGEN, Netherlands) or T-SPOT. TB (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and reported positive results using the manufacturers' recommended cut points. Studies also had to have a mean or median follow-up of at least 12 months and include at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive for latent tuberculosis infection. We included studies of HIV uninfected general populations and populations at increased risk of tuberculosis, using a broad definition of increased risk (see supplementary S1 for populations selected a priori for inclusion, and methods for classification). We excluded studies that investigated only TST converters, TST boosters, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or other experimental vaccinated populations, or participants who previously tested positive. To avoid confounding the interpretation of risk estimates, we further excluded studies of people living with HIV in countries with a tuberculosis incidence of more than 100 cases per 100 000 people owing to the high likelihood of reinfection, as well as studies conducted in countries with a general population prevalence of HIV of more than 5% where authors did not explicitly exclude, or report separately, people living with HIV. In our primary analysis, to minimise selection and publication bias, we further limited included groups to those where at least 100 participants were tested and untreated.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Tubersol) [^114xzELY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TUBERSOL Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (Mantoux), is indicated to aid diagnosis of tuberculosis infection (TB) in persons at increased risk of developing active disease.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published guidelines regarding populations that would benefit from tuberculin skin testing (TST). Current recommendations can be accessed at: http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing.htm.

Previous BCG vaccination is not a contraindication to tuberculin testing. The skin-test results of BCG vaccinated persons can be used to support or exclude the diagnosis of TB infection. However, an FDA-approved interferon gamma release assay is preferred over tuberculin skin test for persons 5 years of age and older who were previously vaccinated with BCG. (8)

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^111UoYER]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

A major problem associated with IGRAs is the occurrence of indeterminate results that seem to arise mostly due to cellular immune suppression and occur more frequently with the ELISA-based method than with ELISPOT test or discordant results if both, TST and a blood test are performed. This is further compounded by the differences that exist in the manner in which these tests are applied for the detection of latently infected individuals in different settings. In the United States and few other countries, national guidelines advocate up-front use of a blood test (IGRA) as a direct replacement for TST in all groups of subjects. Due to higher sensitivity of IGRAs, it is likely that some individuals who are positive for a blood test but who may have been TST negative (if the test was performed) are unnecessarily treated. On the contrary, in the United Kingdom and other European countries, initial screening is performed with TST except in individuals in whom TST is unreliable (young children, HIV-seropositive and other immunosuppressed individuals). For the latter grouping and for TST-positive individuals at higher risk of developing active disease, a blood test is recommended for confirmation of a presumed infection. Thus, it is also probable that a TST-negative subject who may have been IGRA positive will not be identified as having LTBI and will, therefore, not receive treatment. Consequently this apoproach, though supposedly more economical, may result in undertreatment of some individuals with LTBI. A discordant result (TST negative but IGRA positive) in an immunocompetent individual should be repeated after 3 months and should be treated for LTBI if IGRA still remains positive (a negative IGRA on repeat testing may signify a transient M. tuberculosis infection that was quickly cleared). However, a similar result in an immunocompromised individual should be carefully evaluated as in this setting, any positive result may be significant.

IL-23 inhibitors — ongoing monitoring parameters include periodic history and physical examination, including screening for nonmelanoma skin cancer, and screening for adverse effects, hepatitis B and C screening, and evaluation for infections. Yearly testing for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold) should be done in patients at high risk, whereas for patients who are not at high risk screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist; the result of the QuantiFERON Gold test can remain positive after treatment of latent TB and caution should be exercised when using the QuantiFERON Gold test. An annual chest radiograph may be considered at the discretion of the treating dermatologist. Follow-up visits can be scheduled from quarterly to twice yearly on the basis of time of treatment, response, and tolerability of medication.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113FJ4gW]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the annual rate of tuberculosis development after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay result (IGRA), or both, among untreated populations with characteristics believed to increase the risk of tuberculosis (at risk populations).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed.

Eligibility criteria and data analysis

Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 12 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models.

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who tested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test result for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups.

Results

122 of 5166 identified studies were included. In three general population studies, the incidence of tuberculosis among 33 811 participants with a TST induration of ≥ 10 mm was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 116 197 positive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in 19 different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts, the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a positive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis, transplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests.

Conclusions

The incidence of tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat for latent tuberculosis infection.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xjvCU]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Results

Overall, 5166 unique citations were identified. After screening of titles and abstracts, 505 remained for full text assessment, of which 122 studies were included. Of these, 102 studies reported results with TST, 71 with IGRA, and 51 with both (see supplementary figure 1). Among the 102 studies using TST, 70 (69%) explicitly stated the TST method used; of these, 69 (99%) used the Mantoux method and one (1%) used the Heaf method while reporting Mantoux equivalent measurements. Additionally, 78 (76%) studies reported the type and dose of tuberculin used; of these, 69 (88%) used two tuberculin units of RT23 or five tuberculin units of purified protein derivative. According to quality assessment, the most commonly detected sources of bias in studies were follow-up (n = 89; 73%) and selection (n = 72; 59%); only eight (7%) studies had no detected source of bias, and 47 (39%) studies were graded as low quality. In 52 studies (43%), at least 20% of participants were excluded because of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection. The median year of study start was 2006, 79 (65%) studies were prospective cohort studies, 87 (71%) took place in high income countries, and 104 (85%) took place in countries with an annual tuberculosis incidence of less than 100 per 100 000 population (see supplementary table S6).

Three studies of 33 811 people with a TST induration of ≥ 10 mm from HIV uninfected general population samples were included, and 120 studies evaluated 19 different at risk populations, comprising 269 distinct cohorts with 116 197 people. Across these studies, 32 507 people (48 studies, 61 cohorts), 49 482 people (59 studies, 71 cohorts), and 14 477 people (15 studies, 20 cohorts) had a positive TST result at cut points of 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm, respectively, whereas 10 811 people (44 studies, 55 cohorts) and 2564 people (18 studies, 21 cohorts) had a positive result for QFT-Gold or QFT-Gold-In-Tube and T-SPOT. TB, respectively. In total, 6356 people (20 studies, 41 cohorts) were tested using both a TST and an IGRA and had concordant positive or discordant positive results. Supplementary tables S7 to S9 report individual study characteristics and outcomes.

### Frequency of abnormal findings on chest radiograph after positive PPD in children and adolescents in an urban setting in the United States [^115R2r6G]. Clinical Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chest radiographs (CXR) for tuberculosis (TB) screening in children are valuable in high-burden settings. However, less certain in low prevalence contexts. In the United States, positive PPD is sufficient to treat for "latent" TB, or TB infection in asymptomatic patients.

Objective

We sought to determine frequency of abnormal CXR findings after a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test at a tertiary pediatric center in the United States.

Method

A retrospective evaluation was conducted of patients (0–18 years) with a CXR after a positive PPD (e.g., known exposure, employment, migratory requirements or before immunosuppression) between 2011 and 2021. Clinical information, demographics, and reason for PPD were recorded from health record. CXRs were evaluated using initial report and by a pediatric radiologist with special interest in TB and 8 years of experience.

Result

Of 485 patients, median [interquartile range (IQR)] age 8.5[3.3–14.4], abnormal CXRs were described in 5 (1%). Most common reasons for PPD included: close contact with someone with TB or with high risk for TB. Most patients 373 (76.9%) received treatment for latent TB, and 111 (22.9%) no treatment. One patient (0.2%) received treatment for active disease. Radiographic findings included isolated lymphadenopathy (n = 2), consolidation (n = 1), pleural fluid/thickening (n = 1) and a patient with lymphadenopathy and a calcified nodule (n = 1).

Conclusion

In our experience, prevalence of chest radiographs findings for patients with positive PPD was very low. Moreover, no cases of severe disease were seen and those with abnormal findings would not merit treatment change under current WHO guidelines.

### Revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis [^111tHEJv]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What does the presence of TB immunoreactivity really mean?

In light of the findings that the risk of TB drops precipitously after the first couple of years and continues to drop further, we revisited the assertion that a quarter of the world's population is latently infected with M tuberculosis. This statistic is derived from the finding that about a quarter of the world's population exhibits immunoreactivity to TB, as shown by a positive TST or interferon gamma release assay (box 1).

The basis of adaptive immunity is that a memory response does not require the inciting pathogen to remain present. Therefore, TB reactivity must encompass both current and past infections. But is there evidence that TB reactivity persists after M tuberculosis is cleared? Several papers suggest so. Atuk and Hunt examined persistence of TST positivity at the end of one year of isoniazid treatment of asymptomatic, TST positive hospital employees. Among recent converters (less than one year), only five of 20 people remained TST positive to the same extent; the rest became TST negative or positive to a smaller extent. By contrast, all 17 people who had been asymptomatically TST positive for more than a year remained so after the year of isoniazid treatment. A study in naval officers had virtually identical findings. Almost all people who had been TST positive for only a few weeks at the start of isoniazid treatment reverted within three months; all who had been positive for more than one year remained positive at the end of the year's treatment. These findings are consistent with TB immunoreactivity being retained well after infection is cleared. The more stable immunoreactivity of people with long term TST positivity is consistent with immunological memory being more robust and long lasting when the infection lingered longer before being cleared. This conclusion is corroborated by a study that looked for TST reversion after treatment of active TB, in which TST positivity was retained in all 38 patients even though they had completed a treatment regimen associated with < 3% recurrence at five years.

Together, these studies indicate that the reported burden of latent TB infection is overestimated, as it reflects immunoreactivity to either past or present infection. Not only are most TST positive people not at higher risk of TB, but multiple studies have shown that they may be protected against TB disease on subsequent exposure to infection (supplementary figure 3).

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

In the United States, the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and active disease varies for different segments of the population; however, the risk for M. tuberculosis infection in the overall population is low. Tuberculosis (TB) case rates declined steadily for decades in the United States. However, in 1985 the TB case rate stabilized and subsequently increased through 1992, accompanied by a 14% increase in the TB mortality rate in 1988. This has been attributed to several complex social and medical factors, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, the occurrence of TB in foreign-born persons from countries that have a high prevalence of TB, the emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB, and the transmission of M. tuberculosis in congregate settings (e.g., health-care facilities, correctional facilities, drug-treatment centers, and homeless shelters). Because the overall risk of acquiring M. tuberculosis is low for the total U.S. population, the primary strategy for preventing and controlling TB in the United States is to minimize the risk of transmission by the early identification and treatment of patients who have active infectious TB, finding and screening persons who have been in contact with active infectious TB patients and screening high risk populations.

Tuberculin PPD is indicated as an aid in the detection of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis .3,4After a person becomes infected with mycobacteria, T lymphocytes proliferate and become sensitized. These sensitized T cells enter the bloodstream and circulate for months or years. This sensitization process occurs principally in the regional lymph nodes and may take 2–10 weeks to develop following infection. Once acquired, tuberculin sensitivity tends to persist, although it often wanes with time and advancing age. The injection of tuberculin into the skin stimulates the lymphocytes and activates the series of events leading to a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. This response is called "delayed" because the reaction becomes evident hours after injection. Dermal reactivity involves vasodilation, edema, and the infiltration of lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes, and neutrophils into the site of antigen injection. Antigen-specific T lymphocytes proliferate and release lymphokines, which mediate the accumulation of other cells at the site. The area of induration reflects DTH activity.5In most tuberculin-sensitive individuals, the delayed hypersensitivity reaction is evident 5–6 hours after administration of a tuberculin skin test and is maximal 48–72 hours. In geriatric patients or in patients receiving a tuberculin skin test for the first time, the reaction may develop more slowly and may not be maximal until after 72 hours.6,7Because their immune systems are immature, many neonates and infants < 6 weeks of age, who are infected with M. tuberculosis, do not react at all to tuberculin tests.5

### Detection and management of latent tuberculosis in liver transplant patients [^115Xu7rA]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The optimal means for detecting and managing liver transplantation (LT) patients with latent tuberculosis (TB) are not well defined. Our study aims were to (1) determine the frequency and risk factors of latent TB in a large cohort of consecutive adult LT candidates and (2) determine the safety and efficacy of isoniazid treatment in LT recipients with latent TB. A review of patients assessed for latent TB by skin testing using purified protein derivative (PPD; January 2004 to September 2008) or with the interferon-γ release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT; March 2008 to October 2009) was undertaken. The baseline clinical features and outcomes of subjects with latent TB and subjects without latent TB were compared. Twenty-five of 420 subjects (6.0%) were positive for PPD. In comparison, 11 of 119 subjects (9.2%) had a positive QFT assay, and 15 others (13%) had indeterminate results. Both PPD-positive and QFT-positive subjects were less likely to be Caucasian than subjects without latent TB (p < 0.001). The 3-year survival rate of the 25 LT recipients with latent TB was similar to that of the 296 LT recipients without latent TB (78.7% versus 74.6%, P = 0.58). Fifteen of the 25 latent TB patients received isoniazid at a mean of 0.67 months after LT. Although isoniazid was discontinued in 8 subjects because of possible side effects, none of the 25 latent TB patients developed TB reactivation after transplantation with a mean follow-up of 33 months. In conclusion, both QFT testing and PPD testing demonstrate similar rates of detecting latent TB infection in American LT candidates, but QFT testing also leads to a moderate rate of indeterminate test results. Early isoniazid chemoprophylaxis after LT is poorly tolerated and is frequently discontinued.

### The incidence of tuberculosis in patients treated with certolizumab pegol across indications: impact of baseline skin test results, more stringent screening criteria and geographic region [^1177yxKk]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We report the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) across certolizumab pegol (CZP) clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), before and after the introduction of stricter TB screening.

Methods

TB incidence rates (IRs) were assessed and stratified according to screening guidelines used at the time of CZP trials. Before 2007 (original trials), purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test positivity varied according to local standards (induration ≥ 5 up to ≥ 20 mm). Since 2007, all CZP trial protocols have been amended, including trials spanning (intermediate) and initiated after 2007 (current), mandating that any patient with PPD ≥ 5 mm receives treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI). All cases of suspected TB or PPD ≥ 5 mm, in pooled data from 5402 CZP patients across all CZP trials up to 2012, underwent blinded central review by independent experts.

Results

44 TB cases were confirmed in pooled CZP RA trials (IR 0.47/100PY, patient-years) with no cases in Japanese RA trials (J-RAPID, HIKARI). Single TB cases were confirmed in psoriasis and axSpA trials (RAPID-axSpA), and no cases in the PsA trial (RAPID-PsA). IR of TB was 0.51/100PY across original or intermediate RA trials and 0.18/100PY in current trials. The majority of TB cases in RA occurred in Eastern (IR 1.02/100PY) and Central Europe (IR 0.58/100PY). Of 242/370 PPD ≥ 5 mm patients who received 9 months isoniazid (INH) treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI), none developed TB, versus 7.8% of 128 untreated PPD ≥ 5 mm patients.

Conclusions

Implementation of more stringent LTBI screening, plus treatment for LTBI, reduced the IR of TB, even when INH was administered after starting CZP therapy.

### Highly multiplexed proteomic analysis of quantiferon supernatants to identify biomarkers of latent tuberculosis infection [^112TfQYu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, with an estimated 2 billion people infected withworldwide. From this large reservoir, millions of people develop TB disease, and 10.4 million TB incident cases were reported in 2015. Proper and accurate identification and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) can reduce substantially the risk of developing TB and is a major focus of TB control in the United States and in TB programs around the world.

There is no gold standard available for diagnosing LTBI. Hence, there is no way to firmly determine the sensitivity and specificity of tests designed to detect TB infection. Three tests are currently commercially available to diagnose TB infection, including two interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs; T-SPOT and QFT-GIT) and the tuberculin skin test (TST). The TST measures cell-mediated immunity in the form of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the most commonly used purified protein derivative (PPD) of. Until the commercial IGRAs were available, the TST was the only test for diagnosing LTBI but with several well-described limitations, for example, the need for two visits, the subjective quality of the results, the low sensitivity for active TB, and the occurrence of false-positive results due to prior BCG vaccination or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection. The IGRAs were developed to overcome many of these limitations. They require a single blood draw and assess the cell-mediated immune response by measuring IFN-γ produced after an incubation with TB-specific antigens, but these tests also have their limitations, including a low predictive value for identifying patients with the greatest immediate risk for developing active TB. Furthermore, IGRAs have high rates of false-positive results in some lower-risk, non-BCG vaccinated populations, and various sources of variability can impact the reproducibility. The need for better TB diagnostic tests is recognized as an important component for improving global TB control and prevention.

### Predictive performance of interferon-gamma release assays and the tuberculin skin test for incident tuberculosis: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^115EfvQA]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive treatment in populations who are at risk for the development of tuberculosis (TB). Individuals who are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis without clinical manifestation, known as latent TB infection, are at risk for the development of TB. Two types of indirect diagnostics are recommended to detect individuals who might benefit from TB preventive treatment: purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA). In both, a simple dichotomization to positive and negative denotes probable infection or not, respectively. None are considered "gold standard tests for TB infection" since they measure immune sensitization to mycobacterial antigens and, consequently, they cannot differentiate current TB infection from past infection, as well as infection from disease.TST also lacks specificity for TB infection owing to cross-reactivity among individuals vaccinated with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette−Guérin vaccines (BCG) or infected by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). IGRA, including T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold in tube (QFT-GIT) or Plus (QFT-Plus), use M. tuberculosis -specific antigens, ESAT-6 and CFP-10. Thus, they are not affected by BCG or most NTM (other than Mycobacterium kansasii, marinum and szulgai) and are expected to increase the diagnostic specificity.

In head-to-head comparisons, previous meta-analyses using aggregated data suggest IGRA's increased specificity does not appear to confer greater prognostic ability to predict individuals who will progress from infection to disease than the TST. Despite IGRA's higher relative risk estimates for incident TB, confidence intervals were imprecise and overlapped. In addition, the higher relative risk estimates of IGRA was driven by studies with a high risk of incorporation where these were conducted in low-incidence resource-rich countries that had widely adopted the test and used positive IGRA results to trigger investigations of active TB only in test positives. These findings underpinned the initial policy on the use of IGRA for prediction of TB in low TB incidence countries, and later updates were used to inform global policy that recommends the use of either test interchangeably in all settings regardless of the background TB incidence.

### Clinical testing guidance for tuberculosis: tuberculin skin… [^113EzSF4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

M. tuberculosis growing in specialized media under standardized conditions. PPD is diluted to standard concentration and potency in FDA-approved testing solutions. It takes 2 to 8 weeks after initial infection with TB bacteria for the immune system to be able to react to PPD and for the infection to be detected by the TB skin test. For Everyone: Testing for Tuberculosis: Skin Test. Two-step testing
- If the first TB skin test result is negative, a second TB skin test should be done 1 to 3 weeks later.
- If the second TB skin test result is positive, it is probably a boosted reaction.
- Based on this second test result, the person should be classified as previously infected. This would not be considered a skin test conversion or a new TB infection.
- However, the patient is a candidate for treatment for latent TB infection.
- Based on this second test result, the person should be classified as previously infected.

This would not be considered a skin test conversion or a new TB infection.
- If the second skin test result is negative, the baseline result is negative, and the person would be classified as uninfected. If an incorrect dose of PPD tuberculin solution is administered during a TB skin test, or if the injection is too deep and does not form a wheal, the person administering the tuberculin should report the incident following the established policies and procedures of the facility or institution in which the incorrect dosage occurred. An incorrect dose or administration of tuberculin invalidates the TB skin test. The test must be repeated, with the new site being at least 2 inches from the previous site. What to do with test results A person with a positive result from a TB skin test or symptoms of TB disease should be evaluated for TB disease.

This includes performing:

- A chest radiograph and
- Appropriate bacteriologic examinations of sputum specimens If latent TB infection is diagnosed, short and convenient treatment regimens are available. Treatment for latent TB infection is 90% effective for preventing the development of TB disease. It is important to note that a negative TB skin test results does not exclude the diagnosis of TB disease, especially for patients with severe TB illness or HIV.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QinqH]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

In our secondary analysis of incidence rate ratios among contacts being tested with both a TST and an IGRA, we found that among this high risk population, incidence rate ratios were high for both concordant positive and discordant positive groups, when compared with the concordant negative group. This implies that in the presence of a single negative test result for latent tuberculosis infection in a high risk person, there might be value in performing a second test. Whether to use TST or IGRA first is, however, unclear, as the direct comparison of these tests was not an objective of this meta-analysis. This question was assessed recently, but with inconsistent results.

Strengths and limitations of this review

Our meta-analysis has key strengths. In our literature search we maximised sensitivity, and to further enhance sensitivity we applied loose criteria for citations to qualify for full text review. Using generalised linear mixed models to perform random effects meta-analysis reduced biases that would be introduced through other methods of pooling, such as inverse variance, that require zero cell corrections. Finally, we estimated several effect measures that policymakers and providers might use when determining whether to test, treat, or test and treat people for latent tuberculosis infection.

This meta-analysis has some limitations. Many studies used passive follow-up for detection of active tuberculosis and were of low quality; factors which we found to be associated with lower observed rates of active tuberculosis. Some studies included people who previously had tuberculosis. In such studies, however, these participants were most often a minority of the included population, and tuberculosis rates did not differ between studies with and without people who previously had tuberculosis. Publication bias was not statistically assessed but cannot be excluded. The included studies in this review were published from 1990 to 2019. The risk of tuberculosis over this period might be variable owing to changes in health systems and population health, among others, resulting in higher tuberculosis rates being observed in studies conducted earlier in this period. However, we did not identify a consistent difference in tuberculosis risk between studies conducted before and studies conducted after 2006. In studies using a TST, rounding of induration measurements might introduce bias, but since this is a common issue in clinical practice, we do not think it affects the generalisability of our results. Most included studies were conducted in settings with a tuberculosis incidence of less than 100 per 100 000 population, potentially restricting generalisability of our results to settings with a low incidence of tuberculosis and low risk of reinfection.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^116D1d7L]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — recommendations and key rationale: We suggest that TB prophylaxis and treatment regimens be the same in KTRs as would be used in the local general population who require therapy. (2D). Consider substituting rifabutin for rifampin to minimize interactions with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi). (Not Graded). KTRs are at increased risk of developing disease due to TB, and those with latent TB identified by a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test or a history of TB disease without adequate treatment are at highest risk of developing clinical TB after transplantation and are therefore good candidates for chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid. Treatment of TB in KTRs has been shown to respond to standard antimycobacterial therapy. Because use of rifampin is associated with numerous drug–drug interactions through activation of the CYP3A4 pathway that can affect drug levels for CNIs as well as mTORi, rifabutin achieves similar therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the potential for drug–drug interactions.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114LRA6Q]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Epidemiology and natural history context for LTBI and TB: TB disproportionately affects Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander persons. LTBI is an infection with M tuberculosis in which the bacteria are alive but contained by the immune system; persons with LTBI have no apparent symptoms, do not feel sick, cannot spread TB to others, and usually have a positive TB skin test result or positive TB blood test reaction. Active TB or TB disease is an illness in which TB bacteria are multiplying and attacking a part of the body, usually the lungs, may be symptomatic, and may be infectious. Approximately 30% of persons exposed to M tuberculosis will develop LTBI and, if left untreated, approximately 5% to 10% of healthy, immunocompetent persons will progress to having active TB disease.

### Safety of etanercept in patients at high risk for mycobacterial tuberculosis infections [^113w65KT]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The magnitude of the risk of reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) on use of etanercept, especially in patients with positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test, has not been assessed. We evaluated the risk of developing active TB among PPD-positive patients treated with etanercept.

Methods

All patients with a positive PPD test, as defined by American Thoracic Society guidelines, who received etanercept at Cook County Hospital from 2001 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary endpoint was the development of active TB either while receiving or after completing etanercept therapy.

Results

Four hundred eighty-seven patients received etanercept, of whom 84 were PPD-positive and constituted the primary cohort. The cohort was composed largely of patients who were at high risk for development of active TB: born in endemic area (80%), ethnic/racial minorities (51 Hispanic, 16 African American, and 8 Asian), and low socioeconomic status (66, 78.57%). Overall etanercept exposure was a mean of 24.6 months (range 3 to 60 mo), with 196 patient-years of etanercept exposure in PPD-positive individuals. Indications for etanercept use included rheumatoid arthritis 58 (69%), ankylosing spondylitis 11 (13%), psoriatic arthritis 13 (15.5%), juvenile inflammatory arthritis 1 (1.2%), and vasculitis 1 (1.2%). Of the 80 subjects, 74 received treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) prior to initiating etanercept. A comprehensive review of these patients' medical records failed to reveal any active TB infection.

Conclusion

This systematic analysis suggests that the risk of reactivation of LTBI during etanercept therapy is low in appropriately treated individuals.

### Role of dormancy survival regulator and resuscitation-promoting factors antigens in differentiating between active and latent tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114krsTV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

An important characteristic of Mtb is its ability to persist for long time in host in asymptomatic form as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) without being affected by fully functional immune system. It is estimated that about a quarter of the world population has LTBI. Approximately 5–15% of individuals with LTBI develop active TB within two to five years whereas in rest of individuals immune system either eliminates the infection or a persistent immune response prevents active TB from appearing. Individuals with HIV infection, cancer, coronavirus disease, or diabetes, as well as those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or kidney transplant, infants, and smokers are at a higher risk of transformation of LTBI to active TB. Such data emphasize the need to focus on LTBI diagnosis for devising fruitful TB control strategies.

Currently, WHO recommends tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for the diagnosis of LTBI. In TST, a subcutaneous injection of old tuberculin or purified protein derivative is performed to examine immune response against the antigen. An induration reaction of > 15 mm within 48–72 h indicates past or current infection. However, TST is constrained by its inability to differentiate between LTBI and active TB, cross reactivity with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and false positivity with BCG vaccine. Newly developed methods such as the Diaskintest, C-Tb skin test, and EC test attempt to address the false-positivity of TST for BCG and NTM. Diaskintest, developed by Generium, Russia, is an intradermal injection of a recombinant protein obtained from genetically modified Escherichia coli (E. coli). The presence of redness or induration indicates reaction which is examined 48–72 h after injection. C-Tb is also a dermal test based on Mtb ESAT-6 and CFP10 antigens (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) whereas the EC test uses a fusion protein recombinant of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 E. coli antigens (Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Company, China). Furthermore, IGRAs such as the T-cell spot of TB assay (T-SPOT-TB), QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, QuantiFERON-TB Gold-Plus, LIASON QuantiFERON-TB Gold, and LIOFeron TB/LTBI are modern methods which attempt to overcome some of the drawbacks of TST. However, none of these tests can differentiate between LTBI and active TB.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection spectrum and latent tuberculosis infection definitions: Persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have a broad array of presentations, ranging from those with clinical, radiographic, and microbiological evidence of tuberculosis (TB disease) to those who are infected with Mtb but have no clinical evidence of TB disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Individuals with LTBI who have been recently exposed have an increased risk of developing TB, whereas those with remote exposure have less risk over time unless they develop a condition that impairs immunity. Operationally, recent exposure can be defined either epidemiologically (ie, as might occur in the setting of the household of an infectious case or occupational exposure) or immunologically (ie, conversion of a tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay [IGRA] from negative to positive).

### Time for a change? Updated guidelines using interferon gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculosis infection in the office setting [^112SqSxk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitors and other systemic medications increases the risk of reactivating a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Therefore, screening for latent TB infection is important in dermatology patients eligible for treatment with these medications. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) has its limitations, it has been the standard choice for diagnosis of latent TB infection. Since the development of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), the role of the TST has been re-evaluated and IGRAs have increasingly been incorporated into national guidelines. Although there are situations when either test may be performed, in individuals who have received a BCG vaccination and in those who are unlikely to return for a TST reading, IGRAs may be particularly helpful in distinguishing patients at risk for TB. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both the TST and the IGRA and presents a summary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 guidelines for using IGRAs.

Latent tuberculosis infection — risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (< 2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children < 5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111eLzE4]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Secondary analysis

In stratified, secondary analyses the method and duration of follow-up, country level incidence of tuberculosis, and study quality seemed to influence the incidence rate of tuberculosis across numerous populations (see supplementary tables S10 to S13). The design of the study, time when the study was conducted, country level income, method of tuberculosis diagnosis, proportion of people excluded who received treatment for latent tuberculosis infection, and country policy on BCG vaccination did not seem to have consistent effects on tuberculosis incidence rates (see supplementary tables S14 to S19).

Risk of tuberculosis with concordant and discordant TST and IGRA results could be estimated using six studies among contacts that reported results from concurrent dual testing. The incidence rate ratio for tuberculosis was 19.1 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 127.3) among participants with positive results for both tests compared with those with negative results for both tests (table 4). Pooled tuberculosis rates per 1000 person years were high in those with dual positive test results (range 30.6–43.1), compared with estimated rates in those with discordant positive test results (6.2–16.5) and in those with dual negative test results (2.6–3.1). In all the other at risk populations, few studies reported results of concurrent dual testing (see supplementary table S21 for results).

### An update on the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection [^113rdoJp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Targeted testing and treatment of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection at increased risk of progression to active disease is a key element of tuberculosis control. This strategy is limited by the poor specificity of the tuberculin skin test in populations vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin and its low sensitivity in immunosuppressed persons, who are at highest risk of progression. Two blood tests (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold), based on detection of IFN-gamma released by T cells in response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens, may offer an improvement on the skin test. However, validation is challenging due to the lack of a diagnostic gold standard. This critical appraisal of published evidence summarizes the diagnostic accuracy of the new tests. The blood tests have operational advantages over the skin test because no return visit is required, results are available by the next day, and repeated testing does not cause boosting. Both tests are significantly more specific than the skin test in populations vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. The data suggest that T-SPOT.TB may be more sensitive than the skin test. Data in groups at high risk of progression to disease are scarce, and more research is needed in these populations, but it is clear that T-SPOT.TB performs better than the skin test in young children and HIV-infected people with active tuberculosis. Incorporation of these tests into programs for targeted testing of latent tuberculosis infection will reduce false-positive and false-negative results inherent in tuberculin testing, equipping clinicians with more accurate tools for tuberculosis control and elimination in the 21st century.

### Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children [^112BAmtT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Alternative test(s)

Two types of immunological tests excluded from this review are the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). Both methods are dependent on the cellular immune response to M tuberculosis antigens in individuals previously exposed to the organism, and neither can distinguish between latent tuberculosis infection and active tuberculosis disease (Pai 2014). Further, neither method is sensitive enough to serve as a rule out test for tuberculosis disease in children, but is mainly used to confirm tuberculosis infection and to support clinical decision making; with full consideration of all the stated caveats. The TST has been in clinical use for over a century and involves intradermal injection of M tuberculosis purified protein derivative. Drawbacks to the TST include the need for a second clinical encounter 48 to 72 hours after placement for result interpretation, inter‐reader variability, a tendency for previous bacillus Calmette‐Guerin vaccination to result in false‐positive results, and a tendency for false‐negative results in immunosuppressed individuals or due to anergy in individuals with active disease (Pai 2014).

### Latent tuberculosis in HIV positive, diagnosed by the M. tuberculosis specific interferon-gamma test [^116y1Ero]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of previously treated TB had a high rate of positive QFT-IT test results(19%). The rate was highest in patients with recent TB compared to patients with TB many years ago suggesting that the QFT-IT test response may diminish over time. There is an ongoing debate whether it is possible to monitor the effect of chemotherapy treatment using INF-γ based tests, but the present study and previous reports, indicate M. tuberculosis -specific responses can be retained for many years after treatment. Whether this reflects differences in long term memory immunity or insufficient treatment leading to persistent or latent infection is unknown.

There is a relevant concern that the performance of the QFT-IT test, in line with the TST, could be impaired by low sensitivity in patients with advanced immunodeficiency. The PHA control serves as a surrogate marker for anergy as well as a quality control of the assay. In patients with a CD4-cell count < 100 cells/μL, we found a higher proportion of indeterminate test results (24% vs 2.8%) due to low PHA response and there was a significant correlation between CD4-cell count and PHA induced IFN-γ release. These findings support the hypothesis that the performance of the IFN-γ based tests is impaired in patients with advanced immunosuppression. In vivo and in vitro anergy in HIV positive individuals is well recognized and the reduced antigen response correlates proportionally with CD4-cell count and is reversible during antiretroviral treatment. Fisk and colleagues found that a CD4-cell count < 100 cells/μL, was the critical level associated with skin test anergy. Limited data are available on the performance of the IFN-γ test in HIV positive individuals. Converse and colleagues found, using the 1 st generation QuantiFERON ® test based on tuberculin PPD, a reduced rate of responders and a lower mean IFN-γ response in HIV positive individuals with a low CD4-cell count (< 200 cells/μL). Other studies have used the ELISPOT test based on ESAT-6 and CFP-10 and found that the number of responders as well as the mean IFN-γ response was reduced in HIV positive individuals. However neither CD4-cell count or AIDS diagnosis, were available in either study. A small study including 29 HIV positive patients surprisingly concluded that there was no impact of a low CD4-cell count on the performance of the IFN-γ response in an ELISPOT assay. However, based on our findings and the numerous reports demonstrating reduced T-cell function in HIV patients it is most likely that the M. tuberculosis specific IFN-γ responses are impaired in patients with advanced immunosuppression in both ELISPOT and whole blood assays.

### Meta-analysis: new tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only test for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, but 2 ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

Purpose

To estimate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed persons.

Data Sources

The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

Study Selection

Studies had evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-h) incubation times. Reference standards had to be clearly defined without knowledge of test results. DATA EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

Data Synthesis

When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test distinguishes active TB from latent TB. Sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in persons who were categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for QFT and for Elispot, respectively. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in 3 studies of immune-compromised samples. Discordant tuberculin skin test and IGRA reactions were frequent and largely unexplained, although some may be related to varied definitions of positive test results. Reversion of IGRA results from positive to negative was common in 2 studies in which it was assessed.

Limitations

Most studies used cross-sectional designs with the inherent limitation of no gold standard for latent TB infection, and most involved small samples with a widely varying likelihood of true-positive and false-positive test results. There is insufficient evidence on IGRA performance in children, immune-compromised persons, and the elderly.

Conclusions

New IGRAs show considerable promise and have excellent specificity. Additional studies are needed to better define their performance in high-risk populations and in serial testing. Longitudinal studies are needed to define the predictive value of IGRAs.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Tubersol) [^1173i3Zn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of the Test

The skin test should be read by a trained health professional 48 to 72 hours after administration of TUBERSOL. Skin test sensitivity is indicated by induration only; redness should not be measured.

Measure the diameter of induration transversely to the long axis of the forearm and record the measurement in millimeters (including 0 mm). (7) The tip of a ballpoint pen, gently pushed at a 45° angle toward the site of injection, will stop at the edge of induration.

Also record presence and size (if present) of necrosis and edema, although these are not used in the interpretation of the test.

Positive Reactions

Tuberculin reactivity may indicate latent infection, prior infection and/or disease with M. tuberculosis and does not necessarily indicate the presence of active tuberculous disease. Persons showing positive tuberculin reactions should be considered positive by current public health guidelines and referred for further medical evaluation. (7)(9) The repeated testing of uninfected persons does not sensitize them to TUBERSOL. (6)(7)(9)

The significance of induration measurements in diagnosing latent TB infection must be considered in terms of the patient's history and the risk of developing active TB disease as indicated in Table 1. (9)

A TST conversion is defined as an increase of ≥ 10 mm of induration within a 2-year period, regardless of age. (9)

The possibility should be considered that the skin test sensitivity may also be due to a previous contact with atypical mycobacteria or previous BCG vaccination. (7)(9)

Negative Reactions

An individual who does not show a positive reaction to 5 TU on the first test, but is suspected of being TB positive, may be retested with 5 TU. (See Booster Effect and Two-Step Testing .) Any individual who does not show a positive reaction to an initial injection of 5 TU, or a second test with 5 TU may be considered as tuberculin negative.

False Positive Reactions

False positive tuberculin reactions can occur in individuals who have been infected with other mycobacteria, including vaccination with BCG. (7) However, a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection and the use of preventive therapy should be considered for any BCG-vaccinated person who has a positive TST reaction, especially if the person has been, or is, at increased risk of acquiring TB infection. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE .) (13)(14)

### Isinfection life long? [^116vGSZY]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Immunoreactivity does not reflect continued infection

For TB immunoreactivity to be a reliable proxy for persistent TB infection, it must track faithfully with infection. This means that people whose infection is cured should become non-reactive. Multiple studies show that this is not the case. The large US isoniazid chemoprophylaxis trial conducted between 1956 and 1966 showed that treatment of people with TB immunoreactivity (TST results ≥ 10 mm) for one year lowered the incidence of active TB by 60–70% over the next nine years (fig 1A). Yet the treated people remained positive on TST up to nine years after treatment (fig 1B), showing that TB immunoreactivity can outlast elimination of infection by at least nine years.

A) Efficacy of one year of isoniazid prophylaxis (n = 9382) versus placebo (n = 9140) over a 10 year observation period, including the year of treatment, for residents of US mental institutions.

Figure 5
PPD status of CZP-treated patients with RA in the pooled RA safety database (N = 4049) at baseline and TB incidence by INH treatment. †One patient who developed TB started INH treatment 393 days after the first CZP dose was administered. INH was administered from 517 to 251 days before TB was diagnosed. CZP, certolizumab pegol; PPD, purified protein derivative; INH, isoniazid; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; TB, tuberculosis.

A total of 3278 patients had a PPD < 5 mm and were considered PPD negative; the remaining 401 patients had no PPD test values recorded. Among patients with baseline PPD < 5 mm, INH treatment (typically administered postbaseline) had little impact on TB incidence; 1/126 INH-treated patients (0.8%) versus 31/3152 non-INH-treated patients (1.0%) developed TB (figure 5). INH treatment of the PPD negative patient who went on to develop TB was initiated following a positive routine QuantiFERON test, performed 393 days after starting CZP treatment, and TB was reported 517 days later. The average time to TB onset in the 32 patients with PPD < 5 mm at baseline was ∼1.5 years after the first dose of CZP, the long latency suggestive of a new TB infection rather than LTBI reactivation. The majority of cases (22/32) were diagnosed as isolated pulmonary TB (table 1). Onset of TB in the two patients with RA with unknown PPD value occurred 142 and 200 days after the first dose of CZP; one patient had a history of positive PPD tests and was treated with INH for 141 days prior to administration of CZP, suggesting reactivation of LTBI.

### Treatment for latent tuberculosis infection… [^112tSutD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points People with latent tuberculosis infection can be treated to prevent TB disease. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens. Overview Finding and treating people with latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease. Treatment for latent TB infection prevents TB disease. For Everyone: Treating Inactive Tuberculosis. Treatment Considerations for Latent TB infection People with latent TB infection should be treated to prevent the development of TB disease. Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U. S. TB cases. Do not start latent TB infection treatment until TB disease is excluded.

People with known risk factors for developing TB disease and have a positive TB blood test result, or a tuberculin skin test result should be given high priority for latent TB infection treatment. Treatment Recommendations Health care providers may consider several recommended regimens for the treatment of latent TB infection. Treatment can take three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the regimen. Regimens use one or more of the following drugs:

- Isoniazid
- Rifapentine
- Rifampin. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens over 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy. Short-course regimens are effective, safe, and have higher completion rates than longer regimens.

Treatment for latent TB infection can be administered by directly observed therapy or by self-administered therapy. Isoniazid monotherapy regimens Regimens of six to nine months of isoniazid monotherapy are alternative, effective latent TB infection treatment regimens if a short-course treatment regimen is not an option. Although effective, 6H and 9H have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than most short-course treatment regimens. People can be treated daily or twice weekly with isonaizid. Patients being treated twice weekly should receive directly observed therapy.

Evidence supports the association of tuberculosis (TB) with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. There seem to be differential risks of TB with the currently available inhibitors.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection? [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionised LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

Objectives

With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence-base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis these include: prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

Methodological Approach

On-going large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the current uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

Conclusions and Impact

Current and planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence-base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of current IGRAs in the near future.

Tuberculin and delayed-type hypersensitivity testing — Although the standardized PPD antigen has been used for many years as a predictor of active or latent tuberculosis infection, confounders have affected diagnostic accuracy; the gross appearance of a late-phase cutaneous response and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions may not be completely distinguishable except that the latter are more characterized by prolonged induration; neither anergy nor tuberculin testing obviates the need for microbiologic evaluation when there is a suspicion of active tuberculosis or fungal infections; although systemic corticosteroid therapy will render delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test results uninterpretable, 28 days of treatment with high-dose inhaled fluticasone (220 µg, 2 puffs twice a day) did not suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity to PPD in healthy volunteers; several new in vitro assays (interferon-γ and polymerase chain reaction) appear to be more reliable in predicting active tuberculosis in BCG-vaccinated persons or when cross-sensitivity to atypical mycobacteria may coexist; immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported after tuberculin skin tests.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Aplisol) [^111WSgkz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Booster Effect and Two-Step Testing

Infection of an individual with tubercle bacilli or other mycobacteria or BCG vaccination results in a delayed hypersensitivity response to tuberculin which is demonstrated by the skin test. The delayed hypersensitivity response may gradually wane over a period of years. If a person receives a tuberculin test at this time, a significant reaction may not be detected. However, the stimulus of the test may boost or increase the size of the reaction to a second test, sometimes causing an apparent conversion or development of sensitivity. This booster effect can be seen on a second test done one week after the initial stimulating test and can persist for a year, and perhaps longer. When routine periodic tuberculin testing of adults is done, initially two-stage testing should be considered to minimize the likelihood of interpreting a boosted reaction as a conversion.7,15,16

In this testing method, persons who have a negative initial skin test undergo a second tuberculin skin test 1–3 weeks after the first. Both tests should be read and recorded at 48 to 72 hours. Those individuals with a positive reaction on the second test should be considered to be previously infected, and those with a negative reaction on the second test should be considered uninfected. In these uninfected persons, a positive result on any future skin test should be interpreted as a skin test conversion.7

### Etanercept therapy in patients with a positive tuberculin skin test [^112aGkDH]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Etanercept (Enbrel), a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonist, is commonly used for the treatment of a variety of rheumatic diseases. Tuberculosis (TB) infections have been associated with chronic TNF-alpha blocking therapy, and there is concern that such therapy may predispose patients to TB reactivation. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the frequency of latent TB reactivation among patients treated with etanercept.

Methods

All patients with either a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) for TB or a previous history of therapy for latent TB infection (LTBI) who were prescribed etanercept in the division of rheumatology at John H. Stroger Jr Hospital of Cook County prior to November 2005 were enrolled in this study. A retrospective chart review was performed looking for evidence of active TB infection during etanercept treatment.

Results

Forty-eight patients with a positive PPD were treated with etanercept, and followed for an aggregate of 818 patient-months of etanercept exposure, with a mean follow-up period of 17 months (range 5 to 48 months); all patients had at least one follow-up visit. Forty-four patients (92%) were fully or partially treated with LTBI therapy prior to initiation of etanercept. Chest roentgenograms were available for review in 43 patients, ten of which had evidence of old granulomatous disease. No cases of active TB were described during the study period.

Conclusions

In this small retrospective analysis, none of the 48 patients with positive PPDs who were treated with etanercept for average of 17 months developed active TB.

### Tuberculosis infection in children and adolescents: testing and treatment [^111Vy2N2]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Tuberculin skin test (TST) performance in children — limitations and predictive value: Hypersensitivity to antigens in the purified protein derivative (PPD) that are also present in M bovis-BCG creates a false-positive TST result, and false-negative TST results can occur in children who are immunosuppressed by disease or treatments. Among foreign-born children younger than 5 years, most of whom had received a BCG vaccine, the positive predictive value of the TST for TBI was 10%, meaning that 90% of positive results were presumably falsely positive. The test has poor sensitivity in immunocompromised children, who have the greatest risk of progression to TB disease, and because of these limitations, some experts have called for the "retirement" of the TST in favor of the IGRA.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^114K7MBQ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Take-home messages

- Testing for and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) should be targeted to high risk groups who are at increased risk of progression to active tuberculosis.
- Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a key cytokine in protective host immunity against M. tuberculosis infection. The risk of incident tuberculosis (TB) in patients latently infected with M. tuberculosis increases substantially, from 4 to 5 fold over baseline in the case of infliximab, after initiation of anti-TNF therapy.
- TST is an inadequate tool for screening patients for LTBI before commencing anti-TNFα agents because of poor specificity in BCG-vaccinated individuals and poor sensitivity in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) on conventional immunosuppressants e.g. methotrexate and steroids.
- T-cell interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) detect interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released ex vivo from pre-sensitised M. tuberculosis -specific T cells in response to selected proteins which, unlike PPD, are highly specific for M. tuberculosis. Extensive published literature suggests that IGRA are a more specific and probably a more sensitive test for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection than the TST in immunocompetent persons.
- The limited available published data in patients with IMID on disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) who are candidates for TNF blockade shows that IGRA results agree poorly with TST results and are more closely associated with the presence of risk factors for LTBI than TST, suggesting that IGRAs maintain diagnostic sensitivity for LTBI better than TST in this key population. However, preliminary data suggests that in patients who are already on anti-TNF treatment the IFN-γ response is significantly reduced and negative IGRA results should therefore not be interpreted as implying absence of infection.
- IGRAs are a promising adjunct for screening patients with IMID prior to TNF blockade, but more data are required to validate their precise role in this setting.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^112AckiA]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

2 Current clinical practice

In the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosis of LTBI, current clinical management of patients with IMID requiring anti-TNF therapy involves checking for a history of untreated or partially treated TB, risk-stratification for exposure to cases of active TB, evidence of residual changes indicative of prior TB infection on a chest radiograph and a tuberculin skin test (TST).

The TST is a measure of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to intradermal inoculation of purified protein derivative (PPD), a crude mixture of more than 200 M. tuberculosis proteins. Because antigens within PPD are also found in other mycobacteria, the TST suffers from poor specificity in bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated persons. Moreover, the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test used to diagnose LTBI is compromised in patients on immunosuppressive therapy with a high rate of false-negative TST test results. For example, in a Peruvian study, the size of the TST response was significantly lower and the proportion negative (i.e. < 5 mm) to TST was significantly higher in patients with RA compared to healthy immunocompetent controls (median size PPD induration 4.5 vs 11.5 mm P < 0.01; 79/112 (70.6%) vs 25/96 (26%) P < 0.01, respectively). Logistical hurdles, including the need for a return visit to read the result of this in vivo test and operator variability in inoculation and reading of the result, also limit the effective use of TST.

Thus because almost all patients awaiting initiation of anti-TNF therapy are on immunosuppressive therapy, the TST is not an appropriate test to screen for LTBI in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. This concern around the interpretation of the TST in patients on disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is reflected in British Thoracic Society guidelines from 2005 that recommended replacing TST with an individual risk–benefit calculation in patients with a normal chest radiograph balancing the population risk of LTBI in different groups based on age and ethnicity with the risk of serious hepatotoxicity secondary to isoniazid therapy.

- low or intermediate risk of disease progression

- it has been decided that testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted

- history of BCG vaccination or it is expected that the individual is unlikely to return to have the TST read.

Background

Use of an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay or tuberculin skin test for detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection is controversial. For both types of test, we assessed their predictive value for the progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease, the targeting value of preventive treatment, and the necessity of dual testing.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with no start date or language restrictions, on Oct 18, 2019, using the keywords ("latent tuberculosis" OR "latent tuberculosis infection" OR "LTBI") AND ("interferon gamma release assays" OR "Interferon-gamma Release Test" OR "IGRA" OR "QuantiFERON®-TB in tube" OR "QFT" OR "T-SPOT.TB") AND ("tuberculin skin test" OR "tuberculin test" OR "Mantoux test" OR "TST"). We included articles that used a cohort study design; included information that individuals with latent tuberculosis infection detected by IFN-γ release assay, tuberculin skin test, or both, progressed to active tuberculosis; reported information about treatment; and were limited to high-risk populations. We excluded studies that included patients with active or suspected tuberculosis at baseline, evaluated a non-commercial IFN-γ release assay, and had follow-up of less than 1 year. We extracted study details (study design, population investigated, tests used, follow-up period) and the number of individuals observed at baseline, who progressed to active tuberculosis, and who were treated. We then calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) for disease progression, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of IFN-γ release assay versus tuberculin skin test.

Findings

We identified 1823 potentially eligible studies after exclusion of duplicates, of which 256 were eligible for full-text screening. From this screening, 40 studies (50592 individuals in 41 cohorts) were identified as eligible and included in our meta-analysis. Pooled RR for the rate of disease progression in untreated individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay versus those were negative was 9.35 (95% CI 6.48–13.49) compared with 4.24 (3.30–5.46) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled PPV for IFN-γ release assay was 4.5% (95% CI 3.3–5.8) compared with 2.3% (1.5–3.1) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled NPV for IFN-γ release assay was 99.7% (99.5–99.8) compared with 99.3% (99.0–99.5) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals positive by IFN-γ release assay who were untreated versus those who were treated was 3.09 (95% CI 2.08–4.60) compared with 1.11 (0.69–1.79) for the same populations who were positive by tuberculin skin test. Pooled proportion of disease progression for individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test was 6.1 (95% CI 2.3–11.5). Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test who were untreated versus those who were treated was 7.84 (95% CI 4.44–13.83).

Interpretation

IFN-γ release assays have a better predictive ability than tuberculin skin tests. Individuals who are positive by IFN-γ release assay might benefit from preventive treatment, but those who are positive by tuberculin skin test probably will not. Dual testing might improve detection, but further confirmation is needed.

Pediatric psoriasis — baseline and follow-up monitoring during biologic therapy includes testing for latent tuberculosis by purified protein derivative test (PPD) or interferon-gamma release assay, especially in high-risk geographic locations. Repeat testing for tuberculosis annually during the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is recommended (expert opinion), but its value for other biologics is currently unclear, and children with a positive tuberculosis test result should be referred for consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Hepatitis and HIV screening in children should be performed based on the presence of relevant risk factors, and baseline and repeated history and physical examination are recommended during treatment, especially to monitor for infection, with the frequency individualized and ranging from every 3 months to annually. No additional laboratory monitoring is required for children receiving biologic therapy but should be individualized based on specific clinical context.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — cautions and limitations: While both IGRA and TST provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to treatment for LTBI; a large (> 15 mm) TST reaction is more likely to reflect infection, measurement variability exists for IFN-γ tests (the FDA accepts a variance of 11%), there are insufficient data for quantitative interpretation of IGRAs beyond FDA cut-points, results near the cut-point are less reliable, and the results of IFN-γ testing should be reported quantitatively; discordance between TST and IGRA is common and in low-risk populations discordant tests are likely to be false positives.

Prophylaxis for tuberculosis among diabetics

The American Thoracic Society has recommended performing tuberculin skin test (TST) with purified protein derivative (PPD) for all diabetic patients. If the induration is 10 mm or more, prophylactic treatment with isoniazid is recommended for 6 to 12 months, unless the patient has had a history of tuberculosis. Some authors have questioned the actual benefit of this recommendation. Of note, the prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection among diabetics is high and the sensitivity of TST may be reduced.

Only two studies have investigated the advantage of TB prophylaxis among diabetics. The first was conducted in Germany in the 1950s where post treatment prophylaxis with isoniazid for 6–24 months after completion of a full course of treatment for active TB had been evaluated in diabetic patients. Recurrence rates were lower in the intervention group. In a second study conducted in Russia in the 1960s, administration of an analogue of isoniazid for diabetics lowered the incidence of TB compared to controls by 2 to 3 times. Both studies were problematic due to the absence of randomization and the lack of details regarding the interventions. Therefore, the true effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis in diabetic patients has remained unknown and only through a randomized controlled trial can it be properly addressed. However, conducting of such studies is expensive. Furthermore, the experience with regards to people living with HIV have showed poor patient compliance, despite proven efficacy. Therefore, this research is not high priority because it is unlikely to change current policy and practice.

In brief, there is not sufficient evidence to support any preventive therapy for diabetics with latent TB infection. However, preventive therapy may be considered for certain high risk groups such as diabetics who have a close TB contact.

### The meta-analysis for ideal cytokines to distinguish the latent and active TB infection [^111JXb5V]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Characteristics and quality of included studies

Overall, the selected 14 studies included 982 subjects, comprising 526 active TB and 456 LTBI patients for this meta-analysis. Diagnosis of active TB and LTBI in all studies was based upon bacteriology, clinical and radiology evidence, IGRAs and/or TST, which are considered "clinical diagnosis standard". The cytokine detection methods included enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Luminex, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Among these studies, 4 were performed in high TB incidence countries. The cytokine production was stimulated with different antigens, 2 studies with L-alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH) in addition to Mtb -specific antigens (early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6), culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10), and TB7.7 antigens), 1 study with either Mtb -specific antigens or purified protein derivative (PPD), and the other one by AlaDH only. The rest of studies used Mtb -specific antigens only. The summary of included studies was shown in Table 1. Further, on the basis of patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow and timing, the risk of bias and applicability concerns were assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool. It was found that most studies had low risk of bias and an acceptable level of applicability. The result was presented in Fig. 2.

High-risk Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection — committee practice when initial testing is negative is described as follows: many committee members acknowledged that they perform a second test in clinical practice if patients at high risk for progression test negative, specifically performing a tuberculin skin test (TST) if an initial interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is negative or an IGRA if an initial TST is negative, and if the second test is positive, they consider this evidence for infection with Mtb; this approach aims to increase sensitivity, is not based upon empirical evidence, and may be an acceptable trade off when the consequences of missing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are judged higher than those of a false-positive result.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^115BARGt]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

The performance of both QFT-G-IT and T-SPOT.TB tests have been evaluated extensively with/without head-to-head comparison with TST and several systematic reviews are available for their performance in different settings. Similar to TST, a major limitation of both IGRAs is their inability to distinguish LTBI from active TB disease. This may be particularly important in high TB incidence countries in which latent infection is widespread and reinfection happens frequently and in immunocompromised individuals (such HIV-seropositive subjects) and children due to subclinical disease presentation. However, IGRAs have better specificity (higher that TST) as they are not affected by prior BCG vaccination since the antigens used in these assays are not present in M. bovis BCG and cross reactivity with environmental mycobacteria is less likely. Furthermore, based on limited data in immunocompromised individuals, the sensitivity of IGRAs, particularly for T-SPOT.TB, is also higher than TST. However, the clinical performance of these tests has been variable in different settings around the globe due to differences in spectrum and severity of TB cases and proportion of HIV-coinfected individuals included in various studies.

In low TB incidence countries, screening for LTBI aims to identify individuals at higher risk of progression from latent infection to active TB disease. These include all recently infected individuals (close contacts of active pulmonary TB index case), recent immigrants from high TB incidence countries and persons with suppressed (such as HIV coinfected) or immature (such as very young children) cellular immune systems. Previous data on natural history of TB suggest that after exposure to M. tuberculosis, 5–10% of infected individuals develop active TB disease within the first 2 years of initial infection. In people with a robust immune system, another 5–10% individuals develop active disease during the remainder of their lives while in immunocompromised individuals, the risk is much higher. Thus, diagnosis and treatment of LTBI will be most effective if it is specifically directed to those individuals with the highest risk of progression from LTBI to active disease such as recently exposed individuals, young children and HIV-infected and other immunocompromised subjects.

Testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) — IGRA suggested in other individuals 5 years or older: We suggest performing an IGRA rather than a TST in all other individuals 5 years or older who are likely to be infected with Mtb, who have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, and in whom it has been decided that testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Latent tuberculosis in HIV positive, diagnosed by the M. tuberculosis specific interferon-gamma test [^112xcWKY]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is the most prevalent disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and the majority of the people at risk of HIV and TB are living in Sub Sahara Africa. The risk of developing active TB in HIV positive individuals is increased many fold even when antiretroviral chemotherapy is given and the incidence of TB is increasing in regions where HIV is prevalent. To prevent further spread of TB, intensified efforts are needed such as active case finding, and reducing the risk of reactivating TB in persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), through prophylactic and antiretroviral treatment.

Diagnosis of early sputum negative tuberculosis and LTBI has been hampered by low performance of the tools currently available. The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) based on Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) has been the most important tool for the detection of LTBI for almost a century. The main drawback of the TST is the lack of specificity due to cross reactivity with proteins present in other mycobacteria such as the Bacille Calmette Guèrin (BCG) vaccine strain, M. avium complex organisms, and other non tuberculous mycobacteria. In addition, the sensitivity of the TST is reduced in HIV positive patients.

Identification of 3 M. tuberculosis specific antigens, ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB 7.7, has led to the development of a whole new generation of M. tuberculosis specific diagnostic tests. ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB 7.7 are contained within the regions of the mycobacterial genome which are absent from M. bovis BCG, M. avium and most other non-tuberculosis mycobacteria. The M. tuberculosis specific tests are based on the stimulation of sensitized T-lymphocytes followed by measurement of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by either enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) or enzyme linked immunospot assay. The latest improvement within this technology is the QuantiFERON ® TB-Gold In-Tube test (Cellestis, Australia), in which whole blood is drawn directly into vacutainer tubes precoated with antigens ready for incubation (QFT-IT test).

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^112a9no8]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

The current cumulative evidence (summarized in several reviews and meta-analyses) suggest that the performance of the two (ELISA-based and ELISPOT-based) formats of IGRAs are nearly comparable in predicting development of active disease in immunocompetent individuals. However, the agreement between IGRAs and TST is generally poor due to false-positive TST results in BCG vaccinated subjects. The clinical relevance of a positive TST result is usually poor (i.e. unable to predict which patients will develop active TB disease in the near future) and sensitivity as well as specificity are influenced by the different cut-off values used in different settings. However, the value of negative TST result in predicting no further development of active disease in human subjects presumably exposed to M. tuberculosis is fairly high (negative predictive value). On the other hand, the predictive value of positive IGRA results for the development of active TB is usually better than that of TST while the predictive value of a negative result is very high in immunocompetent individuals, particularly if the TST is also negative. The TST is often negative in immunocompromised individuals and its performance is also influenced by the immunosuppressing conditions while the sensitivity of IGRAs is generally better than TST and the experimental conditions (particularly in T-SPOT.TB assay) can be easily adjusted for testing immunocompromised individuals.

### Metabolite changes in blood predict the onset of tuberculosis [^115zD1WQ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2017, 10 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease and 1.6 million deaths due to TB were recorded globally, making it the deadliest infectious disease on Earth. A quarter of the world's population is estimated to be latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and of these, less than 10% will develop active TB disease during their lifetime. Notably, the risk of TB incidence is 10-fold higher in individuals within the first year after infection.

Novel, cost-effective tools for control of TB must include not only new and improved drugs and vaccines, but also assays for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of TB. Defining biomarkers for risk of disease coupled with early and accurate TB diagnosis will enable strategies for prevention and early treatment to prevent progression to advanced disease pathology as well as transmission. Moreover, identifying infected people at high risk of developing TB will facilitate targeted enrollment into drug trials and post-exposure vaccine trials, thus profoundly reducing the number of study participants and trial costs and duration.

Until recently, the only measurable biomarkers associated with increased risk of developing TB were positive TST or IGRA test results. However, these tests have poor specificity for identifying incident TB as over 95% of HIV-negative and ~70% of HIV-positive individuals with TST/IGRA positivity never progress to active TB disease. Mass preventive therapy based on IGRA/TST screening in TB endemic countries would therefore require treatment of 50–80% of the population. This translates to treatment of an estimated 85 people with latent TB to prevent a single case of active TB according to currently available IGRA tests, thus putting many healthy individuals at unnecessary risk of adverse events. Such a strategy would neither be cost-effective nor feasible and would not prevent re-infection in high-incidence situations. This was demonstrated by the Thibela trial which enrolled South African mine workers in a setting with an 89% prevalence of latent MTB infectionbut mass isoniazid preventive therapy did not reduce TB incidence.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of study participants (n = 368 097)

A total of 1446 tuberculosis cases were identified in the entire cohort during the study period (figure 1), giving an incidence of 88 cases (95% CI 83–92) per 100 000 person-years in a total follow-up time of 1 638 236 person-years, with a median follow-up time of 3.9 years (IQR 2.29–6.60) per person. In individuals who had IGRA testing, 166 tuberculosis cases were identified (incidence 204 cases [95% CI 176–238] per 100 000 person-years, and among individuals without IGRA testing, 1280 cases were identified (incidence 82 cases [95% CI 77–86] per 100 000 person-years (figure 1, table 2). The unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that individuals who received an IGRA test had an increased risk of tuberculosis diagnosis compared with those who had no IGRA test (figure 2); however, the curves converged showing that the increased risk was not sustained as time accrued, indicating that the hazard of tuberculosis diagnosis is not proportional — ie, the HR changes over time. For this reason, we estimated the overall effect (ie, the average effect during the overall follow-up time) of LTBI testing and treatment over time allowing for a time-varying effect. This analysis showed that overall LTBI testing and treatment is associated with lower risk of tuberculosis diagnosis compared with no testing (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.63–0.91]; table 2). A stratified analysis showed that the intervention was associated with higher risk of tuberculosis diagnosis during the first 6 months of follow-up (9.93 [7.63–12.9]), but after 6 months, the intervention was associated with a significantly lower risk (0.57 [0.41–0.79]; table 2). Of the 1446 tuberculosis cases, 234 were diagnosed during the first 6 months: 124 cases among individuals with IGRA testing (incidence 4.65 cases [95% CI 3.90–5.54] per one person-year) and 110 cases among individuals without testing (incidence 2.59 cases [95% CI 2.15–3.13] per one person-year). 1212 tuberculosis cases were diagnosed subsequently: 42 in individuals with IGRA testing (incidence 51.8 cases [95% CI 38.3–70.1] per 100 000 person-years) and 1170 cases among individuals without testing (incidence 75.1 cases [95% CI 70.9–79.5] per 100 000 person-years; table 2).

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion? [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations. The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed: (i) two-step approach of tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals); (ii) Either TST or IGRA, but not both; (iii) IGRA and TST together (to increase sensitivity); and (iv) IGRA only, replacing the TST. Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the current guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interests. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

14.2 Latent Tuberculosis Infection

A multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial compared the effectiveness of 12 weekly doses of PRIFTIN in combination with isoniazid (3RPT/INH arm) administered by directly observed therapy to 9 months of self-administered daily isoniazid (9INH arm). The trial enrolled patients two years of age or older with positive tuberculin skin test and at high risk for progression to tuberculosis disease. Enrolled patients included those having close contact with a patient with active tuberculosis disease, recent (within two years) conversion to a positive tuberculin skin test, HIV-infection, or fibrosis on chest radiograph. PRIFTIN was dosed by weight, for a maximum of 900 mg weekly. Isoniazid mg/kg dose was determined by age, for a maximum of 900 mg weekly in the 3RPT/INH arm and 300 mg daily in the 9INH arm [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

The outcome measure was the development of active tuberculosis disease, defined as culture-confirmed tuberculosis in adults and culture-confirmed or clinical tuberculosis in children less than 18 years of age, at 33 months after trial enrollment. Patients who were found after enrollment to be ineligible because they had active tuberculosis disease, were contacts of a source case with culture-negative or drug-resistant tuberculosis disease cases or no information regarding susceptibility of M. tuberculosis, and young children lacking a positive TST on initial and repeat testing were excluded from the analysis.

Active tuberculosis disease developed in 5 of 3074 randomized patients in the 3RPT/INH group (0.16%) versus 10 of 3074 patients in 9INH group (0.32%), for a difference in cumulative rates of 0.17%, 95% CI (-0.43, 0.09) (Table 10).

The proportion of patients completing treatment was 81.2% in the 3RPT/INH group and 68.3% in the 9INH group for a difference (3RPT/INH-9INH) of 12.8% 95% CI (10.7, 15.0).

In the 9INH treatment group, two of the thirteen culture-confirmed cases were found to be isoniazid-monoresistant. In the 3RPT/INH treatment group, one of the seven cases was rifampin-resistant, isoniazid-susceptible M. bovis infection.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing in low-risk individuals — Recommendation 3a and contextual guidance: guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection, and the committee concurs, though such testing may be obliged by law or credentialing bodies; when testing is performed in individuals 5 years or older who are unlikely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the panel notes that IGRA testing is more specific than TST testing and equally or more sensitive than TST testing, and that false-positive results are frequent among such individuals; accordingly, Recommendation 3a states, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older who are unlikely to be infected with Mtb but who undergo testing for LTBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), with the text noting there is an acceptable alternative in settings where an IGRA is unavailable, too costly, or too burdensome.
