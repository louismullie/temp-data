## Question

What are the latest clinical guidelines for migraine management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest clinical guidelines for migraine management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guidelines are truly the most recent and authoritative. Then, I should verify the scope and target populations covered by each guideline. Next, I will extract and reconcile acute treatment recommendations, followed by preventive treatment recommendations. After that, I need to check special populations and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and controversies, ensuring I cite only figures that appear in the references and double-check any claims that seem uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the most current and influential guidelines. The 2023 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Headache is the most comprehensive, multidisciplinary update and explicitly expands acute and preventive options, including CGRP-targeted therapies and neuromodulation, and it updates 52 recommendations from the 2020 version, which makes it a primary anchor for U.S. practice [^26f3ef67] [^309bf736]. The 2024 International Headache Society Global Practice Recommendations provide practical, tiered guidance for acute pharmacotherapy across resource settings, which is valuable for global applicability and standardization [^43ca56e7]. The 2025 ACP guideline focuses on pharmacologic prevention in episodic migraine and uses GRADE to rate evidence and recommendations, which complements the acute-care emphasis of VA/DoD and IHS [^e613a595]. The 2021 European ten-step consensus remains a high-credibility framework for integrated diagnosis and management and is frequently referenced for stepwise care principles [^822c6692].

> Wait, let me verify the scope and populations so I don't overgeneralize. VA/DoD covers episodic and chronic migraine, tension-type headache, and cluster headache, and it addresses special populations including pregnancy and pediatrics, though some recommendations are weaker due to limited evidence [^26f3ef67]. IHS 2024 focuses on acute pharmacologic treatment with optimal versus essential tiers for varying access to medications [^43ca56e7]. ACP 2025 restricts itself to episodic migraine prevention in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings, explicitly excluding chronic migraine and cluster headache, which limits its direct applicability to chronic disease [^7628ee96]. The European ten-step consensus spans diagnosis, acute and preventive strategies, and special populations, providing a holistic framework rather than a drug-only guideline [^822c6692].

> I will now examine acute treatment recommendations, starting with first-line options. NSAIDs and simple analgesics remain foundational: ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, and acetaminophen are suggested for acute migraine, with VA/DoD recommending these as first-line options and AAFP similarly endorsing NSAIDs for mild-to-moderate attacks and triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks [^63baf434] [^ed8a594a] [^efb65278] [^73986a53]. Hold on, I should verify timing advice; treating early in the attack, when pain is mild, improves outcomes, and this principle is consistently emphasized across high-quality sources and trial design guidance, reinforcing clinical practice to treat promptly rather than waiting for escalation [^822c6692] [^c9e5e877].

> Next, I should review triptans and their placement. Triptans are first-line for moderate-to-severe migraine or when NSAIDs are inadequate, and if one triptan fails, guidelines support trying a different triptan before declaring class failure, which aligns with both AAFP and AAN/AHS pediatric guidance extrapolated to adults in practice [^73986a53] [^9df4bf9d] [^698118d0]. I need to ensure I note contraindications; triptans should be avoided in patients with ischemic vascular disease or significant cardiac risk, and this is consistently emphasized in pediatric and general safety contexts [^d0d74505].

> Let me consider the newer classes. Gepants (rimegepant, ubrogepant) are reasonable options for patients who do not respond to or cannot take triptans, and VA/DoD suggests considering them for acute treatment, while AAFP positions them as third-line after triptans and NSAIDs, reflecting cost and tolerability trade-offs [^04308b13] [^b5b51b52]. Lasmiditan, a 5-HT1F agonist, is effective but associated with driving impairment and sedation; a recent network meta-analysis suggests reserving it as a third-line option after generic triptans and NSAIDs, which fits a cautious, shared decision-making approach [^6f167abd].

> I should double-check combination strategies. ACP suggests adding a triptan to NSAID or acetaminophen for moderate-to-severe attacks that fail monotherapy, which operationalizes escalation while preserving safety and cost considerations, and this aligns with broader principles of stepped acute care [^3fd32078] [^6a9e0d9f]. But wait, what about butalbital and opioids; I need to ensure I state this clearly: avoid butalbital-containing compounds and opioids for routine acute treatment due to medication overuse risk and limited benefit, reserving them only for exceptional refractory scenarios, which is a strong, consistent theme across contemporary guidelines [^526c6452] [^fab8a8ba].

> Now, I will examine preventive treatment, and I should confirm the threshold for initiation. There is no universally accepted numeric threshold for starting prevention; clinicians should consider prevention when migraine is frequent, disabling, or impairs quality of life despite adequate acute therapy, and ACP emphasizes shared decision-making that incorporates benefits, harms, costs, comorbidities, and patient preferences, which operationalizes individualized care [^d9fc1415] [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to episodic migraine; yes, ACP's scope is episodic migraine, whereas chronic migraine management follows different evidence bases and often includes onabotulinumtoxinA, which is not covered by ACP here [^7628ee96].

> Let me think about first-line preventive classes and the strength of evidence. Beta-blockers, anticonvulsants such as topiramate, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies are commonly used, with VA/DoD suggesting valproate, memantine, and atogepant for episodic prevention, while noting that comparative effectiveness across preventives is limited and decisions should be individualized [^2b09611b] [^12a0c255]. I should confirm the stance on gabapentin; VA/DoD recommends against gabapentin for episodic migraine prevention due to lack of efficacy, which is a key update clinicians should incorporate [^924135a4]. The ACP guideline, given its low-certainty evidence base, issues conditional recommendations for monotherapy selection and emphasizes iterative trials and switching if not tolerated or ineffective, reinforcing a pragmatic, patient-centered approach [^e613a595].

> I need to check special populations, starting with pregnancy and lactation. Migraine prevalence peaks in women of childbearing age, and management must balance maternal benefit with teratogenic risk; valproate is absolutely contraindicated in women with childbearing potential, and data on CGRP monoclonal antibodies and gepants in pregnancy remain limited, so nonpharmacologic strategies and agents with established reproductive safety profiles are preferred when possible [^7a0f0aa3] [^62628b0b]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline endorses CGRP mAbs in pregnancy; I should confirm that none provide a strong endorsement, and indeed, most call for caution and shared decision-making given the paucity of safety data [^7a0f0aa3].

> Next, I should review pediatrics and adolescents. For acute treatment, ibuprofen or naproxen are first-line, with triptans considered in adolescents and those with moderate-to-severe attacks; if oral therapy fails or nausea/vomiting limit absorption, nonoral routes can be considered, and if one triptan fails, switching to another is reasonable [^5a870b2d] [^b8bc6329] [^3bdbd901]. I need to ensure medication overuse counseling is explicit: limit ibuprofen or acetaminophen to no more than 14 days per month, triptans to no more than 9 days per month, and total acute medications to no more than 9 days per month to avoid medication overuse headache, which is a critical pediatric safety message [^4b8f3388]. For prevention, evidence is limited; shared decision-making about short trials of preventives is advised, and screening for mood and anxiety comorbidity is recommended because it affects outcomes and persistence [^81ac77fd] [^ce9c4b53].

> I should confirm chronic migraine specifics. Chronic migraine is defined as headache on 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months, with at least 8 days having migraine features, and onabotulinumtoxinA is recommended for prevention in chronic migraine, whereas it is not recommended for episodic migraine, which is an important distinction clinicians often miss [^5bdede79] [^2b09611b]. Let me verify whether VA/DoD mentions eptinezumab; yes, it suggests intravenous eptinezumab for episodic or chronic migraine prevention, reflecting expanding options but still within an individualized, evidence-aware framework [^ca74be6e].

> Hold on, I should verify nonpharmacologic and neuromodulation guidance. Behavioral therapies, lifestyle modification, and trigger management are consistently recommended as adjuncts, and neuromodulation devices are increasingly recognized, though access and evidence vary; VA/DoD incorporates these into a comprehensive plan, and the European ten-step consensus emphasizes patient education and biobehavioral strategies to improve adherence and outcomes [^26f3ef67] [^822c6692]. I need to ensure I don't overstate device efficacy; while promising, many device recommendations remain conditional and should be framed within shared decision-making and local availability [^26f3ef67].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while staying faithful to the evidence. For acute treatment, start with NSAIDs or acetaminophen early in the attack; escalate to a triptan if moderate-to-severe or if NSAIDs are inadequate; if triptans are contraindicated or not tolerated, consider a gepant; if monotherapy fails, combine a triptan with NSAID or acetaminophen; throughout, avoid butalbital and opioids, and monitor for medication overuse, adjusting the plan based on response and patient preference [^63baf434] [^73986a53] [^3fd32078] [^526c6452]. For prevention, consider initiation when migraine is frequent or disabling despite adequate acute therapy; select from beta-blockers, topiramate, or CGRP monoclonal antibodies or gepants, tailoring to comorbidities, contraindications, cost, and patient values; if one preventive fails, switch to another class rather than prematurely combining, and reassess periodically for efficacy and tolerability [^d9fc1415] [^2b09611b] [^e613a595].

> But wait, what about evidence quality and controversies. I should double-check the strength of recommendations. Many preventive recommendations, including ACP's, are conditional and based on low-certainty evidence, which means shared decision-making and iterative trials are essential, and clinicians should communicate uncertainty transparently with patients [^e613a595]. The VA/DoD explicitly states there is insufficient evidence to rank one preventive over another, reinforcing individualized selection and monitoring rather than a rigid hierarchy [^12a0c255]. For acute therapy, while triptans generally perform best in network meta-analyses, cost, access, and safety constraints justify a stepped approach and the inclusion of gepants and carefully selected combinations, which should be discussed in the context of patient goals and constraints [^6f167abd].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed medication overuse and long-term monitoring. All guidelines converge on limiting acute medication frequency to prevent medication overuse headache, with pediatric-specific caps and general principles of using the lowest effective dose and reassessing monthly use patterns, which should be built into routine follow-up and education [^4b8f3388] [^fab8a8ba]. I should confirm that follow-up plans include tracking headache days, acute medication days, disability, and quality of life, and that patients are counseled to treat early, avoid opioids and butalbital, and escalate therapy promptly when attacks are not controlled, aligning with best-practice stepwise care [^822c6692] [^526c6452].

---

The latest migraine guidelines emphasize **individualized, stepwise care** with acute treatment first-line for attacks and preventive therapy for frequent or disabling migraine [^822c6692]. For acute attacks, use **NSAIDs or acetaminophen for mild pain** [^efb65278] and **triptans for moderate-to-severe pain** [^73986a53]; consider gepants or ditans if triptans are contraindicated or ineffective [^b5b51b52] [^6f167abd]. Preventive therapy is indicated for **≥ 4 monthly migraine days** or significant disability, with options including beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, CGRP monoclonal antibodies, or gepants; choose based on comorbidities, contraindications, and patient preference [^notfound] [^notfound]. Avoid opioids and butalbital except in rare refractory cases [^526c6452], and monitor for medication overuse headache [^4b8f3388]. Nonpharmacologic strategies such as lifestyle modification, behavioral therapies, and neuromodulation are recommended adjuncts [^1298b702] [^8487ca64].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and classification

The ICHD-3 criteria remain the **gold standard** for diagnosing migraine and its subtypes, including migraine without aura, migraine with aura, chronic migraine, and medication-overuse headache [^e79cbe44]. Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide appropriate treatment selection and monitoring [^ad867d09].

---

## Acute treatment recommendations

### First-line acute treatments

- **NSAIDs and acetaminophen**: Recommended for mild-to-moderate migraine attacks [^efb65278]. Ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, and acetaminophen are effective options [^c374998b].

- **Triptans**: First-line therapy for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks or when NSAIDs are ineffective [^73986a53]. Sumatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, and frovatriptan are recommended [^notfound].

- **Combination therapy**: Triptans combined with NSAIDs (e.g. sumatriptan-naproxen) may improve efficacy and reduce recurrence [^3fd32078].

---

### Second-line and alternative acute treatments

- **Gepants**: Rimegepant and ubrogepant are recommended for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to triptans [^b5b51b52] [^04308b13].

- **Ditans**: Lasmiditan is a non-vasoconstrictive option for patients with cardiovascular risk factors or contraindications to triptans [^6f167abd].

- **Antiemetics**: Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are recommended for severe nausea or vomiting associated with migraine attacks.

---

### Treatments to avoid

Avoid **opioids and butalbital-containing medications** except in rare refractory cases due to the risk of medication overuse headache and dependence [^526c6452] [^fab8a8ba].

---

## Preventive treatment recommendations

Preventive therapy is indicated for patients with **frequent migraine attacks (≥ 4 days per month)** or significant disability despite acute treatment [^d9fc1415].

---

### First-line preventive options

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Propranolol, metoprolol, timolol | - Effective in reducing migraine frequency <br/> - Contraindicated in asthma, bradycardia, and certain cardiovascular conditions |
| Anticonvulsants | Topiramate, valproate | - Effective in reducing migraine frequency <br/> - Valproate contraindicated in women of childbearing potential |
| CGRP monoclonal antibodies | Erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab | - Highly effective in reducing migraine frequency <br/> - Well-tolerated with minimal side effects [^notfound] |
| Gepants | Atogepant, rimegepant | - Effective in preventing episodic migraine <br/> - Oral administration and favorable safety profile [^notfound] |

---

### Second-line and adjunctive therapies

Second-line options include **onabotulinumtoxinA** for chronic migraine (≥ 15 headache days per month) [^2b09611b] and **neuromodulation devices** such as non-invasive vagus nerve stimulators, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and external trigeminal nerve stimulators as adjunctive options [^1298b702].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Acetaminophen is preferred for acute treatment. Avoid valproate, topiramate, and triptans when possible. Magnesium and non-pharmacologic therapies are recommended [^notfound].

- **Pediatrics**: NSAIDs and triptans (almotriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan) are effective for acute treatment. Preventive therapy is reserved for frequent or disabling attacks [^5a870b2d] [^81ac77fd].

- **Elderly**: Use caution with triptans and anticonvulsants due to cardiovascular and cognitive risks. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are preferred first-line options [^notfound].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic therapies are recommended as adjuncts to pharmacologic treatment, including **lifestyle modifications** — regular sleep, hydration, diet, exercise, and stress management [^d550e86e] — and **behavioral therapies** such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and mindfulness-based interventions [^1298b702]. Neuromodulation devices are also options for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to medications [^1298b702].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess treatment efficacy, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust therapy. Patients should maintain a **headache diary** to track attack frequency, severity, and medication use [^0ecd48a6].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Recent advances include **CGRP-targeted therapies**, with ongoing research into novel mechanisms and delivery systems, and **personalized medicine** efforts to tailor treatment based on genetic, biomarker, and phenotypic characteristics [^1298b702].

---

The latest migraine guidelines emphasize **individualized, stepwise care**, with acute treatment for attacks and preventive therapy for frequent or disabling migraine. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and triptans remain first-line acute options, while beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and gepants are preventive options. Nonpharmacologic strategies and careful monitoring are essential, and opioids and butalbital should be avoided.

### International headache society global practice recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine [^43ca56e7]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In an effort to improve migraine management around the world, the International Headache Society (IHS) has here developed a list of practical recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine. The recommendations are categorized into optimal and essential, in order to provide treatment options for all possible settings, including those with limited access to migraine medications.

Methods

An IHS steering committee developed a list of clinical questions based on practical issues in the management of migraine. A selected group of international senior and junior headache experts developed the recommendations, following expert consensus and the review of available national and international headache guidelines and guidance documents. Following the initial search, a bibliography of twenty-one national and international guidelines was created and reviewed by the working group.

Results

A total of seventeen questions addressing different aspects of acute migraine treatment have been outlined. For each of them we provide an optimal recommendation, to be used whenever possible, and an essential recommendation to be used when the optimal level cannot be attained.

Conclusion

Adoption of these international recommendations will improve the quality of acute migraine treatment around the world, even where pharmacological options remain limited.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^822c6692]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of current literature, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology. In this Consensus Statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

### Migraine: integrated approaches to clinical management and emerging treatments [^1298b702]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Migraine is a highly disabling neurological disorder that directly affects more than 1 billion individuals worldwide. Available treatment options differ between countries and include acute, preventive, and non-pharmacological therapies. Because of major progress in the understanding of migraine pathogenesis, novel mechanism-based medications have emerged and expanded the armamentarium of treatments. We provide a comprehensive overview of the current standard of care that will enable informed clinical management. First, we discuss the efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile of various pharmacological therapies for acute and preventive treatment of migraine. Second, we review the current knowledge on non-pharmacological therapies, such as neuromodulation and biobehavioural approaches, which can be used for a multidisciplinary approach to clinical management. Third, we emphasise that any effective treatment strategy starts with building a therapeutic plan tailored to individual clinical characteristics, preferences, and needs. Finally, we explore the outlook of emerging mechanism-based treatments that could address unmet challenges in clinical management of migraine.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^0f4633cc]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

The quality of clinical trials is an essential part of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Scientific and clinical developments in headache medicine led to second and third editions in 2000 and 2012, respectively. The current, fourth edition of the Guidelines retains the structure and much content from previous editions. However, it also incorporates evidence from clinical trials published after the third edition as well as feedback from meetings with regulators, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and patient associations. Its final form reflects the collective expertise and judgement of the Committee. These updated recommendations and commentary are intended to meet the Society's continuing objective of providing a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the conduct and reporting of randomised controlled trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^66db958e]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Individualized therapy

Multiple effective acute and preventive therapies are available for migraine. When selecting from these therapies, the objective is that each patient receives the therapy that provides the best personal outcome. Unfortunately, no a priori basis for selection currently exists, at least for acute therapy. Optimal individualized therapy is therefore currently best achieved with a stepped care approach, set out in detail in Step 4.

Recommendations

Provide every patient with a full explanation of migraine as a disease and of the principles of its management.
Consider predisposing and trigger factors, but keep in mind that true trigger factors are often self-evident.
Adhere to the principles of stepped care to achieve optimal individualized therapy (see Step 4).

### French guidelines for the diagnosis and management of migraine in adults and children [^94aefd28]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The French Recommendations for Clinical Practice: Diagnosis and Therapy of Migraine are guidelines concerning the overall management of patients with migraine, including diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and assessment of disability.

Objective

This article summarizes the guidelines as they apply to adults and children, and proposes future direction for steps toward optimal treatment of migraine in patients in France.

Methods

The recommendations were categorized into 3 levels of proof (A-C) according to the National Agency for Accreditation and Evaluation in Health (ANAES) methodology and were based on a professional consensus reached among members of the Working Group and the Guidelines Review Group of the ANAES.

Results

The International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine should be used in routine clinical practice. Recommended agents for the treatment of migraine in adults include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) monotherapy or in combination with metoclopramide, acetaminophen monotherapy, triptans, ergotamine tartrate, and dihydroergotamine mesylate. Patients should use the medication as early as possible after the onset of migraine headache. For migraine prophylaxis in adults, the following can be used: propranolol, metoprolol, oxetorone, or amitriptyline as first-line treatment, and pizotifen, flunarizine, valproate sodium, or topiramate as second-line treatment. Migraine in children can be distinguished from that in adults by shorter duration (2–48 hours in children aged < 15 years), more frequent bilateral localization, frequent predominant gastrointestinal disturbances, and frequent pallor hailing the onset of the attack. The following drugs are recommended in children and adolescents: ibuprofen in children aged > 6 months, diclofenac in children weighing > 16 kg, naproxen in children aged > 6 years or weighing > 25 kg, ASA alone or in combination with metoclopramide, acetaminophen alone or in combination with metoclopramide, and ergotamine tartrate in children aged > 10 years.

Conclusions

These guidelines are intended to help general practitioners to manage migraine patients according to the rules of evidence-based medicine.

Migraine affects about 1 billion people worldwide, and up to 15% of adults in the United States have migraine attacks in any given year. Migraine is associated with substantial adverse socioeconomic and personal effects. It is the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide for all ages and the leading cause in women aged 15 to 49 years. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the likelihood of unnecessary investigations and suboptimal management. This article advises clinicians about diagnosing migraine, ruling out secondary headache disorders, developing acute and preventive treatment plans, and deciding when to refer the patient to a specialist.

Introduction

Migraine is a highly disabling primary headache disorder with a 1-year prevalence of ~15% in the general population. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, migraine is the second most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide and is responsible for more disability than all other neurological disorders combined.

Migraine manifests clinically as recurrent attacks of headache with a range of accompanying symptoms. In approximately one third of individuals with migraine, headache is sometimes or always preceded or accompanied by transient neurological disturbances, referred to as migraine aura. Furthermore, a minority of those affected develop chronic migraine, in which attacks become highly frequent. The pathogenesis of migraine is widely believed to involve peripheral and central activation of the trigeminovascular system, and cortical spreading depression is thought to be the underlying neurophysiological substrate of migraine aura. However, much remains unknown about specific pathogenic processes and few mechanism-based treatment options currently exist.

Treatments for migraine include acute and preventive medications and a range of non-pharmacological therapies. Despite these treatment options and the comprehensive diagnostic criteria, clinical care remains suboptimal — misdiagnosis and under-treatment of migraine are substantial public health challenges. Population-based data from Europe indicate that preventive medication for migraine is used by only 2–14% of eligible individuals, an alarming finding that calls for global action. A comprehensive approach is needed to facilitate accurate diagnosis and evidence-based management.

In this Consensus Statement, we provide a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine (Fig. 1). Development of this approach was initiated by the Danish Headache Society, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation (EHF) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN). The aim of the approach is to support care and clinical decision-making by primary care practitioners, neurologists and headache specialists alike.

Background Quality clinical trials form an essential part of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for Controlled Trials of Drugs in Migraine. In 2008, the Committee published the first specific guidelines on chronic migraine. Subsequent advances in drug, device, and biologicals development, as well as novel trial designs, have created a need for a revision of the chronic migraine guidelines. Objective The present update is intended to optimize the design of controlled trials of preventive treatment of chronic migraine in adults, and its recommendations do not apply to trials in children or adolescents.

### Have the IHSbeen followed? Laying the ground for the 4th edition [^cd918c01]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Headache Society (IHS) has published four editions of Guidelines for acute clinical trials in migraine in the past 28 years. This continuous update process has been driven by the increasing amount of scientific data in the field of migraine and by the need to continuously improve the quality of trials.

Objectives

To illustrate: i) the results of the analysis on the adherence of published trials to the 3rd edition published in 2012, in order to identify the critical areas that needed to be addressed in the 4th edition and ii) the changes introduced in this latter edition for improving adherence and methodology robustness.

Methods

We searched and reviewed all controlled trials on acute treatment of migraine published in the period 2012–2018 and we assessed their adherence to the 3rd edition of the IHS Guidelines using a score system based on the most important recommendations. Afterwards, we compared the two editions of the Guidelines and assessed the changes between them.

Results

We included data from 24 controlled clinical trials. Most trials had a randomized double-blind controlled (RDB) design, while a minority (16.7%) were non-randomized double-blind trials. Less than half (44.6%) of the RDB trials used the recommended "pain-free at 2 hours" endpoint as the primary efficacy measure. Trial design and evaluation of results were the areas that diverged the most from the recommendations.

Conclusion

Adherence to IHS guidelines for clinical trials has been suboptimal so far. The new edition has been adapted and optimized to facilitate uptake and strengthen the quality of evidence.

### Quality appraisal of existing guidelines for the management of headache disorders by the AGREE II's method [^a162f28f]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the quality of existing clinical practice guidelines for headache management and their main recommendations.

Background

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been developed to support the clinical decision-making. However, to achieve this goal, the quality of these guidelines must be ensured.

Methods

A systematic search for clinical practice guidelines for headache management was conducted in the PubMed database, in websites of known guideline developers and in websites of known headache associations. The quality appraisal was performed through the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II method.

Results

Twelve guidelines were evaluated. The domains of rigor of development, applicability, and editorial independence, which most influence the overall quality of guidelines, had the lowest average scores and the highest standard deviation rates (61% ± 23; 37% ± 20; 53% ± 31). The main recommendations regarding medication use for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache and migraine in adult patients consisted of paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in all guidelines.

Conclusions

The statistical results indicate that the appraised guidelines have room for both individual and collective improvement. In addition, there is a well-established medication recommendation pattern among all guidelines evaluated.

Description

Headache medicine and therapeutics evidence have been rapidly expanding and evolving since the 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the management of headache. Therefore, the CPG was revised in 2023, earlier than the standard 5-year cycle. This article reviews the 2023 CPG recommendations relevant to primary care clinicians for treatment and prevention of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH).

Methods

Subject experts from the VA and the DoD developed 12 key questions, which guided a systematic search using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After reviewing evidence from 5 databases published between 6 March 2019 and 16 August 2022, the work group considered the strength and quality of the evidence, patient preferences, and benefits versus harms on critical outcomes before making consensus recommendations.

Recommendations

The revised CPG includes 52 recommendations on evaluation, pharmacotherapy, invasive interventions, and nonpharmacologic interventions for selected primary and secondary headache disorders. In addition to triptans and aspirin-acetaminophen-caffeine, newer calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors (gepants) are options for treatment of acute migraine. Medications to prevent episodic migraine (EM) include angiotensin-receptor blockers, lisinopril, magnesium, topiramate, valproate, memantine, the newer CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and atogepant. AbobotulinumtoxinA can be used for prevention of chronic migraine but not EM. Gabapentin is not recommended for prevention of EM. Ibuprofen (400 mg) and acetaminophen (1000 mg) can be used for treatment of TTH, and amitriptyline for prevention of chronic TTH. Physical therapy or aerobic exercise can be used in management of TTH and migraines.

Migraine is a highly prevalent disorder in women associated with significant disability. Yet it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine, including the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide, has led to the development of new targeted migraine therapies. It is important for all healthcare professionals caring for women to be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for migraine and for them to follow a stepwise approach to management of acute and chronic migraine that comprises biobehavioral and pharmacologic management, particularly the more recently approved therapies.

1. Clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks

1.1. Subject selection

1.1.1. Migraine definition

Recommendation:

Eligible subjects should fulfil the diagnostic criteria for migraine according to the most current version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) of the IHS.

Comments:

Clinical trials of acute treatments for migraine can include subjects who have migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and both migraine types, but the ICHD diagnostic criteria should be fulfilled to avoid population heterogeneity. In trials focusing on the acute treatment of migraine with aura, subjects with both migraine types can be included, as aura symptoms are recognizable, the attack types are distinguishable, and most people who have migraine with aura also have attacks of migraine without aura. (Refer to Section 2.1 for more information about migraine with aura.) In trials enrolling participants with a history of both types of attacks, the type of the treated attack should be classified according to ICHD criteria based on the clinical features captured in a diary. Note that this requirement may be impractical when subjects are instructed to treat early, because early treatment of migraine can modify the clinical features of an attack and thereby prevent analysis by type (refer to Section 2.2 for more information about early intervention trials). In some instances, after efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in subjects with confirmed diagnoses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura, trials targeting subjects with probable migraine – migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine – may be appropriate.

### Comparative effects of drug interventions for the acute management of migraine episodes in adults: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^6f167abd]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical and policy implications

Results on both benefits and harms should inform shared clinical decision making, considering the preferences of patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. Our findings should help inform future guidelines and updates to recommendations to ensure that patients receive optimal care. Overall, the results of our network meta-analysis suggest that the best performing triptans should be considered the treatment of choice for migraine episodes owing to their capacity for inducing rapid and sustained pain freedom, which is of key importance for people with migraine. While the recent introduction of lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant has expanded options for the acute treatment of migraine, the high cost of these newer drugs, along with the substantial adverse effects of lasmiditan, suggest their use as third line options, after the less expensive, similarly efficacious, second line options such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac potassium, almotriptan, and frovatriptan have been considered. However, ranking of treatments in clinical guidelines extends beyond efficacy, tolerability, safety, and acquisition costs alone and must also consider cost effectiveness, of which analyses are warranted, and accessibility. The inclusion of the most effective triptans (available as generic drugs) into the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines should be considered to promote global accessibility and uniform standards of care (currently, sumatriptan is the only triptan included). Limited access to triptans and their substantial underutilisation represents missed opportunities to offer more effective treatments and deliver better quality of care to people who experience migraine.

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis offer the best available evidence to guide the choice of acute oral drug interventions for migraine episodes. Our results are in line with recent observational evidence. Careful comparisons between randomised controlled trials and observational evidence represent a productive line of research, as they may complement one another, and both can inform clinical decision making. Nevertheless, we believe that, making the best use of the available, if limited, randomised evidence, our results and tools are valid and should be used to guide treatment choices, promoting shared, informed decision making between patients and clinicians.

All the statements comparing the performance of one drug with another should be tempered by the potential limitations of the current analyses, the quality of the available evidence, the characteristics of the study population, and the long term management of migraine. Future network meta-analyses using individual patient data are required to improve personalised guidance for managing acute treatment of migraine episodes.

Introduction

Migraine is the most common neurological cause of disability in the world. Notwithstanding, clinicians and researchers have seen little progress in the therapeutic options available to treat this condition in the last two decades. Recent advances in our understanding of migraine pathophysiology have allowed the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that offer the advantage of targeting mechanisms known to be active in the disorder leading to better management of patients.

The current review follows this bench to bedside approach, with an outline of relevant mechanisms in migraine biology, followed by an up-to-date summary of the most important therapies used in migraine at the present stage.

Clinical context for preventive therapy selection underscores individualized care and study limitations: "Treatment regimens, therefore, need to be designed case by case, which may include complex or even nontraditional approaches". "A shortcoming of migraine prevention clinical studies is the relatively brief treatment duration (often only 12–16 weeks)". "Long-term assessment of the efficacy and safety of migraine preventive treatments is needed". Additional considerations include that "It seems reasonable that a clinician be mindful of comorbid and coexistent conditions in patients with migraine, to maximize potential treatment efficacy and minimize AE risk", and "Because migraine is frequent in women of childbearing age, the potential for adverse fetal effects related to migraine prevention strategies is particularly concerning".

### Migraine prevention [^5fc2a28c]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Preventive medications reduce migraine frequency and severity, and improve migraine-specific quality of life. Recent evidence also suggests that these same medications enhance the patient's response to acute migraine therapies, and may also reduce the likelihood of developing chronic daily headache. However, many patients who should receive or be offered preventive treatment are not. Most patients can be successfully managed when patient and physician expectations are realistic and aligned, the selection of preventive medications is individualised, and the initiation and titration strategy is appropriate and carefully followed. Rational combinations of preventive medications may also be useful. This review provides an evidence and experience-based approach to the preventive treatment of migraine.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^d4b747c3]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1991, the Clinical Trials Standing Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS) published the first edition of the Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Its goal was to improve the quality of controlled clinical trials in migraine by encouraging the use of scientifically robust methods in clinical research. To keep pace with developments in the scientific and clinical understanding of acute treatment, the Committee published a second edition of the Guidelines in 2000 and a third edition in 2012. The commitment to continuous improvement has been recognized; the Guidelines were considered in the 2018 Guidance for industry prepared by the Division of Neurology Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they were adopted by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in a 2016 concept paper that represented an important milestone in its formal revision of the 2007 Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of migraine.

Since the 2012 update, multiple new acute treatments have been developed, including small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, serotonin (5-HT 1F) receptor agonists, triptan reformulations, and neuromodulation approaches. Accordingly, the Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition incorporates data from clinical trials conducted since the third edition of the Guidelines was published, as well as feedback from meetings with representatives of the FDA and EMA, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and patient associations. Although the Committee considered the comments of pharmaceutical and device manufacturers and members of the IHS on the first draft, the published version is an independent and unbiased reflection of the expertise and consensus judgement of its members.

The present publication retains the structure of the third edition, with sub-sections for the selection of subjects, trial design, evaluation of results, statistics, and special issues, as well as a Toolbox, which provides readers with an index to content and summary statements for each section. Several challenges in trial design that were raised in a preliminary statement in the third edition – specifically, the timing of acute treatment, consistency of response, and participants who have migraine with aura – have been addressed in Sections 1.2.9, 1.2.12, and 2.1, respectively. It is therefore hoped that this edition of the Guidelines continues the tradition of its predecessors by providing investigators with a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the conduct and reporting of clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

Acute migraine management in children and adolescents — many children and adolescents do not respond to treatment at home with NSAIDs and triptans and seek pain relief at an emergency department or infusion center. Trials of refractory headache treatment in children and adolescents have been conducted but therapeutic approaches in these circumstances vary. Studies are also needed of alternate delivery routes for acute treatments such as transdermal patches because oral medications are poorly absorbed in children and adolescents with nausea and vomiting. Regardless of the strategy chosen for acute migraine therapy, treatment plans should be individually tailored to the patient and family and include education about migraine prevention strategies.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^c9e5e877]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.9. Timing of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.9.1. The timing of acute treatment should be defined in the trial protocol.

1.2.9.2. Usually, participants are instructed to treat when migraine headache pain is of at least moderate intensity, but alternatives include treating as soon as possible after headache onset, treating when pain intensity is mild, and treating when pain intensity is severe.

1.2.9.3. The timing of acute treatment must be consistent with the objectives of the trial.

1.2.9.4. Subjects should record the time and pain intensity at the time of treatment in the trial diary.

Comments:

The head pain of migraine frequently begins with mild intensity, progressively increases with variable speed to a peak, and is followed by resolution; headache pain can also fluctuate spontaneously during a migraine attack. These characteristics can pose challenges regarding the timing of treatment (e.g. early or when the attack is fully developed) and the evaluation of trial results. For example, healthcare providers typically recommend treating early in the course of a migraine attack, while pain intensity is mild, because it can enhance efficacy. At the beginning of an attack, however, migraine without aura can be difficult to distinguish from non-migraine headaches. Thus, subjects in migraine clinical trials who are instructed to treat as soon as possible (i.e. at the first sign of migraine) may mistakenly treat other headache types. The potential for confusion is mitigated when attacks are allowed to fully develop. Having subjects wait until pain intensity is moderate or severe before treating increases the specificity of migraine diagnoses. Yet because this strategy conflicts with common clinical advice about early treatment, it is essential that participants in clinical trials receive clear instruction about when to use acute treatment. In later stages of development, depending on the specific objectives of the program, trials evaluating early intervention and treatment when headache pain intensity is severe (e.g. for early morning migraine) are encouraged when investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of new treatments.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^d9fc1415]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians — clinical considerations before initiating preventive pharmacotherapy: This guideline assessed the comparative effectiveness of medications that are beneficial to prevent episodic migraine to help clinicians select which medications to use for prevention. Before initiating any pharmacologic treatment to prevent episodic migraine, explore whether there are modifiable triggers and factors that contribute to an acute migraine headache, discuss the importance of lifestyle interventions such as staying hydrated and maintaining regular and adequate sleep and physical activity, and evaluate whether the patient is using appropriate and adequate-strength medications to treat an acute migraine headache. There are no evidence-based definitions or thresholds that can be used as a reference to guide initiation of pharmacologic treatments for episodic migraine headache prevention, and clinicians should consider pharmacologic treatment for prevention in people experiencing severe debilitating headaches despite adequate acute treatment.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of preventive treatment of migraine in children and adolescents, 1st edition [^c349e55d]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Because the results of clinical trials of investigational treatments influence regulatory policy, prescribing patterns, and use in clinical practice, high quality trials are an essential component of the evidence base for migraine. The International Headache Society has published guidelines for clinical trials in adults with migraine since 1991. With multiple issues specific to children and adolescents with migraine, as well as the emergence of novel trial designs and advances in pharmaceuticals, biologics, devices, and behavioural interventions, there is a need for guidance focusing on issues specific to the conduct of clinical trials in children and adolescents with migraine.

Objectives

The objective of these guidelines is to provide a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the design, conduct, and reporting of well-controlled clinical trials of preventive treatment of migraine in children and adolescents.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was based on guidelines previously published by the International Headache Society and regulatory bodies. The recommendations are evidence-based, where available. The process included consultations among various committees, roundtable discussions among stakeholders (lay people and the pharmaceutical industry), and open consultation with the IHS membership on the final draft.

Results

A series of recommendations addressing the major issues in clinical trials in children and adolescents with migraine is provided. Recommendations are supported by evidence-based practice and validated methodologies, where available. Supporting comments are provided to clarify ambiguities.

Conclusions

These guidelines should be consulted and used in designing and conducting clinical trials of preventive treatments in children and adolescents with migraine.

### Migraine practice patterns among neurologists [^26f71f24]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the attitudes, knowledge, and practice patterns of US neurologists regarding migraine management relative to the US Headache Consortium Guidelines (the Guidelines).

Methods

Two samples of 600 neurologists each were selected from the American Academy of Neurology membership database. The first group received a Migraine Attitudes, Knowledge, and Practice Patterns (MKAPP) Survey. The second group received a Clinical Vignette (CV) Survey, presenting two patient histories and correspondent questions.

Results

The MKAPP Survey showed that most neurologists felt that migraine was primarily a disease of the brain with a well-established neurobiological basis (69%) and an important part of their practice (60%). Most (53%) indicated that they routinely used neuroimaging in evaluating severe headache, an approach not recommended by the Guidelines. Most favored acute treatment limits, but 36% did not agree with the Guidelines that acute treatment should be limited to 2 or 3 days/week. In the CV Survey, for vignette 1, most (91%) correctly diagnosed migraine, 31% requested neuroimaging in the absence of indications, 64% appropriately recommended a triptan, and 45% recommended a preventive medication in the absence of indications. For vignette 2, 78% diagnosed migraine, 71% appropriately ordered neuroimaging, 80% appropriately recommended a preventive medication, and 38% prescribed a triptan in face of clear contraindication.

Conclusions

Educational initiatives aiming to increase the awareness of the Guidelines among neurologists should highlight the full range of migraine symptoms that support the diagnosis, appropriate use of neuroimaging, indications for preventive treatments, issues of triptan cardiovascular safety, and preventing rebound headaches.

With the current trend for large multinational trials, there is a need for increased awareness of methodological issues in clinical trials of drugs and other treatments for chronic migraine. These Guidelines are intended to assist in the design of well-controlled clinical trials of chronic migraine in adults, and do not apply to studies in children or adolescents.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Headache — preventive pharmacotherapy selection notes that comparative efficacy is either conflicting or shows no difference across preventive medications; in cluster headache, a network meta-analysis comparing verapamil and galcanezumab found no statistically significant difference in number of cluster headache episodes, and randomized controlled trials were limited by small sample size. The Work Group categorized this topic as Reviewed, New-added and stated its confidence in the evidence was very low, citing limitations including small sample size, conflicting critical outcomes, and inconsistent dosing between studies with subtherapeutic dosing. Management should be individualized, considering administration, monitoring, safety, and patient values and preferences to balance benefits versus risks and harms. Accordingly, the Work Group recommends: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific medication over another for the prevention of migraine headache, tension headache, or cluster headache.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^63ec73c2]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.2. Other primary headaches

Recommendations:

1.1.2.1. Individuals satisfying criteria for chronic migraine or with a history of chronic migraine in the last 12 months should be excluded from pivotal efficacy trials for the acute treatment of migraine. In subsequent trials, exploration of the benefits of new acute treatments in subjects with chronic migraine is needed.

1.1.2.2. Subjects with other concomitant primary headache types (e.g. tension-type headache) are allowed if attacks are infrequent (i.e. present on an average of < 1 day/month and < 12 days/year) and can be differentiated from migraine based on the quality of pain and associated symptoms.

Comments:

Individuals with chronic migraine are excluded from the initial clinical trials of acute treatment because they may complicate analyses of efficacy in undifferentiated populations (refer to for guidance about trials evaluating preventive treatments in adults with chronic migraine). Subjects with migraine may have other primary headache types, including tension-type headache. Those experiencing primary headaches that cannot be distinguished from ICHD-defined migraine without aura should be excluded.

1.1.3. Secondary headaches

Recommendation:

Individuals with secondary headaches, including medication-overuse headache, should be excluded.

Comments:

Excessive use of acute medications for migraine does not necessarily lead to medication-overuse headache, and some individuals may fulfil IHS criteria for overuse of acute medications without suffering from a chronic pattern of headache. The secondary headache exclusion also applies to these subjects.

Conclusions

The recent recognition of migraine as a debilitating neurological condition is an important advance in directing more resources to the development of new treatments and their deployment to patients. The last two decades have seen a number of important studies in the area of primary headaches leading to an extremely exciting era for researchers interested in this disorder. New treatments are rapidly becoming available for patients and a better understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms is allowing a greater awareness of the complexity of a brain disease which has often been overlooked and under-managed.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for real-world evidence studies in migraine and cluster headache [^0dbe3511]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Real-world evidence studies are an important tool for investigating the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of treatments for headache disorders in clinical practice. These studies use data generated from routine clinical practice from a variety of sources and can help to identify unmet needs in headache care and guide new therapies, including populations not always included in randomized clinical trials of different ages, comorbidities, and concomitant stable treatments. Real-world evidence pertains to the clinical evidence surrounding the utilization, as well as the potential advantages or drawbacks of treatment, which is extracted through an analysis of real-world data. Real-world evidence studies can present unique challenges, including timing of data collection (prospective vs retrospective), data selection, data quality issues and potential biases (selection, confounding factors, etc.). The International Headache Society has developed these guidelines for optimizing the design and conduct of real-world evidence studies, and therefore the strength and reliability of their output.
