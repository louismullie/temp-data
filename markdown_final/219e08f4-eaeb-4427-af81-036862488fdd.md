## Question

What determines chronic anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what determines chronic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how chronic anemia is defined and distinguished from acute anemia. Then, I should categorize the core pathophysiologic mechanisms. Next, I will examine the key molecular regulators that modulate severity. After that, I need to consider patient-specific and disease-specific modifiers. Then, I will review diagnostic determinants and screening intervals. Finally, I should assess prognostic drivers and synthesize the framework into a clinically actionable summary [^113D8qwA] [^116SofJW].

> Let me first confirm the definitional anchor points: chronic anemia reflects a sustained reduction in hemoglobin below population-appropriate norms with a gradual course driven by ongoing processes rather than abrupt loss; WHO and related thresholds have historically guided case definition, but they are being re-examined for age, sex, and context dependence, and CKD guidelines specify 13.0 g/dL for adult males and 12.0 g/dL for adult females within CKD populations, which I need to keep in mind to avoid misclassification in special settings like high altitude or chronic inflammation [^113D8qwA] [^116SofJW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what actually determines chronic anemia mechanistically falls into several major categories: iron-restricted erythropoiesis (absolute iron deficiency or functional iron deficiency under inflammation), relative erythropoietin deficiency or resistance (classically in CKD), anemia of inflammation as a composite phenotype, and chronic hemolysis or hemoglobinopathies; I should verify the prominence of iron deficiency globally and the centrality of inflammation in hospitalized or chronically ill cohorts before ranking them [^111sFJG3] [^117SGuKh] [^114BsmYh].

> Let me think about iron-restricted erythropoiesis more carefully: absolute iron deficiency arises from blood loss, low intake, or malabsorption and is typically microcytic with low ferritin and low transferrin saturation, whereas functional iron deficiency reflects adequate or increased stores that are not bioavailable due to hepcidin-mediated ferroportin blockade during inflammation, producing low serum iron with normal or high ferritin and low transferrin saturation; wait, I should double-check that ferritin as an acute-phase reactant can be misleading and that differentiators like sTfR or sTfR/log ferritin index can help in mixed states [^111sFJG3] [^117SGuKh] [^114BsmYh] [^113bSGbB].

> I will now examine EPO deficiency or resistance: in CKD, declining GFR — especially below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and more so below 30 — drives relative erythropoietin deficiency and impaired marrow responsiveness; superimposed inflammation and uremic toxins heighten EPO resistance, so I need to ensure I evaluate renal function explicitly when chronic anemia is present [^115y47Jv] [^112AGZ78].

> Next, I should review anemia of inflammation as a syndrome: IL-6–induced hepcidin upregulation leads to iron sequestration, reduced duodenal absorption, shortened RBC lifespan, blunted EPO production, and erythroid suppression; let me verify that IL-6 tracks with hemoglobin in inflammatory diseases like RA and that targeting upstream drivers of inflammation modifies anemia severity [^117SGuKh] [^116ir8de] [^116hYeZK].

> But wait, what if the chronic anemia is hemolytic or due to a hemoglobinopathy? In sickle cell disease and thalassemias, chronic hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, and organ complications determine baseline anemia severity and oxygen delivery; I should confirm that the determinants here pivot less on iron restriction and more on genetic and hemolytic dynamics unless transfusional iron loading supervenes [^113Tx4eQ] [^115XnfEq].

> Let me consider the molecular determinants that modulate phenotype and severity across etiologies: first, the hepcidin–ferroportin axis gates iron egress and intestinal absorption, thereby determining hypoferremia and iron-restricted erythropoiesis in inflammation and mixed states; second, the EPO–ERFE–hepcidin loop should suppress hepcidin during erythropoietic drive, but chronic inflammation can uncouple this, sustaining restriction; third, the cytokine network (IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ) directly suppresses erythroid progenitors and shortens RBC survival, so I need to check inflammatory tone whenever anemia is refractory [^1114Y6P7] [^114RqVtL] [^117SGuKh].

> I need to ensure I account for patient-specific determinants: age introduces EPO resistance, stem cell dysfunction, and inflammaging that can culminate in unexplained anemia of aging; sex and pregnancy increase iron demand and bleeding risk; and at high altitude, physiological Hb elevation complicates threshold-based diagnosis, so I should adjust interpretation to avoid over- or under-calling anemia in these settings [^113qDU56] [^113hS5xH] [^111sFJG3] [^1121y8V1].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic determinants that identify the specific driver(s): baseline evaluation includes CBC with indices and reticulocyte count to gauge marrow response, iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation, CRP to contextualize ferritin, and B12/folate to exclude macrocytic causes; in inflammatory states, ferritin greater than 100 mcg/L with transferrin saturation below 20% supports anemia of inflammation, whereas sTfR and sTfR/log ferritin index help parse mixed AI/IDA; when hemolysis is suspected, I should confirm with haptoglobin, LDH, bilirubin, and Coombs testing [^116oqmLu] [^112sp2gt] [^1132BBN1] [^112RQe65] [^114afHPN].

> Hold on, I should verify screening intervals in high-risk conditions: in CKD, hemoglobin monitoring is recommended annually in stage 3, twice yearly in stages 4–5 not on dialysis, and every three months in stage 5 on dialysis; the AAFP echoes annual Hb checks at CKD stage 3 and as indicated for milder disease, which I should incorporate into longitudinal plans [^116HCsQc] [^1116ZdUv].

> I will now examine prognostic determinants: lower hemoglobin correlates with symptom burden and cardiovascular strain, yet attempts to normalize above physiologic targets with ESAs increase risks such as stroke and hypertension, so individualized targets generally avoid exceeding the low 11s and certainly not above 13 g/dL; underlying disease control — especially dampening inflammation — often improves anemia and outcomes, while cardiorenal comorbidity clusters like CHF and ESRD amplify risk through inflammation, EPO resistance, and malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis interactions [^114wzHmw] [^116dBd6c] [^114xs3Y8] [^117SGuKh] [^115zFEUA] [^111HmdZK].

> Wait, let me verify treatment responsiveness determinants before I over-attribute nonresponse to "refractory" anemia: ESA responsiveness requires sufficient iron availability and low inflammatory tone; correctable causes should be addressed before ESA initiation, and iron therapy — often IV in functional deficiency — should be titrated with attention to ferritin and transferrin saturation thresholds and toxicity avoidance; I need to confirm resuscitation readiness during IV iron administration and avoid overshooting ferritin where inflammation is absent to prevent overload; future hepcidin-targeted therapies may benefit those with high-hepcidin phenotypes [^116oxpC2] [^116RmEyQ] [^113TEwKM] [^111qUgtx] [^116LosGk] [^117SGuKh].

> Hmm, wait a minute — special populations add nuances: in older adults, unexplained anemia may persist after standard evaluation due to clonal or stem cell biology and EPO resistance; in IBD, concurrent iron deficiency and inflammation are common and require serial screening with inflammation-aware interpretation of ferritin and transferrin saturation; at high altitude, adapted Hb baselines necessitate population-appropriate cutoffs to avoid misclassification; and in chronic wounding conditions like RDEB, iron loss plus relentless inflammation create AI/IDA overlaps with impaired restoration of hepcidin–EPO balance [^113qDU56] [^1132BBN1] [^114afHPN] [^1121y8V1] [^114RqVtL].

> Let me reconsider my earlier framing: I initially implied chronic anemia is always secondary to chronic disease, but that is too absolute — pure nutritional iron deficiency can itself be chronic in the absence of systemic inflammation or organ failure, so I should explicitly recognize sustained dietary deficiency, occult bleeding, or malabsorption as independent determinants of chronic anemia alongside inflammatory, renal, and genetic mechanisms [^111sFJG3].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the hierarchical cascade: chronic anemia is initiated by an underlying driver (nutritional iron deficiency, inflammation, CKD, hemolysis/hemoglobinopathy), mediated through iron availability, erythropoietin production and responsiveness, and erythroid marrow activity, regulated predominantly by the hepcidin–ferroportin and cytokine axes, modified by patient context (age, sex, pregnancy, altitude, genetics, comorbidities), diagnosed via integrated hematimetric and biomarker patterns that distinguish absolute versus functional iron deficiency, and prognosticated by hemoglobin severity, disease control, and treatment responsiveness; keeping mixed etiologies in view — and validating them stepwise — prevents premature closure and aligns therapy with the true determinants [^1114Y6P7] [^111sFJG3] [^117SGuKh] [^113D8qwA].

Chronic anemia results from a combination of **nutritional deficiencies** (iron, B12, folate) [^111sFJG3], **chronic diseases** (CKD, heart failure, IBD, cancer) [^115y47Jv] [^115zFEUA] [^113bSGbB] [^111z2C6o], and **inflammatory states** that drive hepcidin-mediated iron restriction [^117SGuKh] and erythropoietin suppression [^114BsmYh]. Additional contributors include **chronic blood loss**, hemolytic disorders [^115XnfEq], bone marrow failure, and genetic conditions such as sickle cell disease [^113Tx4eQ] and thalassemia [^112AkgfE]. Diagnosis relies on CBC, iron studies [^116oqmLu], and evaluation of underlying causes; management focuses on correcting deficiencies, treating the primary disease, and using **ESAs or transfusions** when indicated [^113rGhTA] [^116Qxyrx].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

**Iron deficiency** is the most common cause globally [^114cUhSs], due to inadequate intake, malabsorption (e.g. IBD, gastrectomy) [^111sFJG3], or chronic blood loss (e.g. menorrhagia, GI bleeding, hookworm) [^111uxchw]. **Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies** are common in older adults [^113hS5xH], causing macrocytic anemia from impaired DNA synthesis [^113hjMh8].

---

## Chronic diseases and inflammation

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduced erythropoietin, inflammation, iron deficiency, and uremic toxins [^115y47Jv] cause normocytic, normochromic anemia.

- **Heart failure**: Inflammation, renal dysfunction, and malabsorption contribute to anemia [^115zFEUA].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Iron deficiency [^113bSGbB] and anemia of chronic disease are frequent.

- **Cancer**: Cytokine-mediated erythropoietin suppression and iron sequestration [^111z2C6o] cause anemia.

- **Chronic inflammation**: IL-6–driven hepcidin [^116ir8de] increases iron sequestration and suppresses erythropoiesis [^114BsmYh].

---

## Chronic blood loss

**Gastrointestinal bleeding** from peptic ulcers, malignancies, and varices, and **gynecologic bleeding** due to menorrhagia and uterine fibroids are common sources of chronic blood loss [^111sFJG3] [^113ed3k8].

---

## Hemolytic disorders

**Sickle cell disease** causes chronic hemolysis from abnormal hemoglobin [^113Tx4eQ], and **thalassemia** results from genetic defects in globin synthesis, leading to chronic hemolysis [^112AkgfE].

---

## Bone marrow failure syndromes

**Aplastic anemia** involves marrow failure that reduces erythropoiesis, whereas **myelodysplastic syndromes** feature ineffective erythropoiesis due to clonal marrow disorders [^113hS5xH].

---

## Genetic factors

**Hemoglobinopathies** such as sickle cell disease [^113Tx4eQ] and thalassemia [^112AkgfE] cause chronic anemia, while **enzyme deficiencies** like G6PD deficiency cause hemolytic anemia [^115XnfEq].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **CBC**: Assess hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and reticulocyte count [^116oqmLu].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin [^116RmEyQ], transferrin saturation, serum iron, and TIBC.

- **Vitamin levels**: Serum B12 and folate [^116oqmLu].

- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP and ESR [^114BsmYh].

- **Additional tests**: Hemolysis markers [^112RQe65], hemoglobin electrophoresis [^112AkgfE], and bone marrow biopsy as indicated [^112RQe65].

---

## Management strategies

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and inflammation [^117SGuKh].

- **Iron supplementation**: Oral or intravenous iron as indicated [^113ed3k8].

- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**: For CKD and other chronic diseases [^1148K2kY] [^116oxpC2].

- **Blood transfusions**: For severe anemia or acute exacerbations [^116Qxyrx].

---

Chronic anemia results from nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, inflammation, chronic blood loss, hemolytic disorders, bone marrow failure, and genetic factors. Accurate **diagnosis** and targeted **management** are essential to improve outcomes [^117SGuKh].

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (inflammatory bowel disease, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), use of certain drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetic factors (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (chronic kidney disease).

- **Epidemiology**: In the United States, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5% to 18%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. It is also a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDA is associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^115y47Jv]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anemia of chronic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: Anemia of CKD is usually normocytic, normochromic, and hypoproliferative, which increases as the kidney disease progresses.

- **Pathophysiology**: Anemia of CKD is mostly caused by a relative deficiency in erythropoietin (EPO) production. Other causes include inflammation, iron deficiency, and accumulation of uremic toxins.

- **Disease course**: Decreased production of EPO due to worsening kidney function results in anemia of CKD, which causes clinical manifestations of decreased quality of life (QoL), cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, CKD progression, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anemia of CKD among diabetics is associated with higher mortality (HR 3.61, 95% CI 2.48–5.26).

### Anemia of inflammation [^117SGuKh]. Blood (2019). High credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI), also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is regarded as the most frequent anemia in hospitalized and chronically ill patients. It is prevalent in individuals with diseases that lead to prolonged immune activation, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. More recently, the list of associated conditions has expanded to include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, and obesity.

Inflammation-inducible cytokines and the master regulator of iron homeostasis, hepcidin, block intestinal iron absorption and cause iron retention in reticuloendothelial cells, resulting in iron-restricted erythropoiesis. Additionally, the shortened erythrocyte half-life, suppressed erythropoietin response to anemia, and inhibition of erythroid cell differentiation by inflammatory mediators further contribute to AI in a disease-specific pattern.

Although the diagnosis of AI is a diagnosis of exclusion and is supported by characteristic alterations in iron homeostasis, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia, diagnosing AI in patients with coexisting iron deficiency is more challenging. Besides addressing the disease underlying AI, the combination of iron therapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can improve anemia in numerous patients. In the future, emerging therapeutics that antagonize hepcidin function and redistribute endogenous iron for erythropoiesis may provide additional options. However, based on experience with anemia treatment in chronic kidney disease, critical illness, and cancer, determining the appropriate indications for specific treatments remains essential.

### How I treat hypoxia in adults with hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic disorders [^115XnfEq]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies are caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormal hemoglobin molecules, leading to hemolytic anemia. Chronic complications involving the lung parenchyma, vasculature, and cardiac function in hemoglobinopathies result in impaired gas exchange, which causes tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia, defined as the deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body, is prevalent in patients with hemoglobinopathies, and its cause is often multifactorial. Chronic hypoxia in hemoglobinopathies often signifies disease severity and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxia in these disease processes is crucial to appropriately treat the underlying cause and prevent complications.

In this article, we discuss the management of hypoxia based on three different cases: sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis. These cases are used to review the understanding of the disease pathophysiology, demonstrate the importance of a thorough clinical history and physical examination, explore diagnostic pathways, and review management strategies.

### The role of iron in chronic inflammatory diseases: From mechanisms to treatment options in anemia of inflammation [^114BsmYh]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI) is a highly prevalent comorbidity in patients affected by chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer, that negatively affect disease outcome and quality of life. The pathophysiology of AI is multifactorial, with inflammatory hypoferremia and iron-restricted erythropoiesis playing a major role in the context of disease-specific factors. Here, we review the recent progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to iron dysregulation in AI, the impact of hypoferremia and anemia on the course of the underlying disease, and novel therapeutic strategies applied to treat AI.

### Sickle cell disease [^113Tx4eQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sickle cell disease:

- **Definition**: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia and end-organ damage.

- **Pathophysiology**: SCD is caused by a mutation in the sixth amino acid of the β-globin gene. Polymerization of abnormal hemoglobin leads to vascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia, which precipitate a cascade of pathologic events, leading to vascular-endothelial dysfunction, functional nitric oxide deficiency, hypercoagulability, increased neutrophil adhesiveness, and platelet activation.

- **Epidemiology**: In the United States, the prevalence of SCD is estimated at 30 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Central nervous system injury is the most debilitating frequent complication of SCD and includes stroke, silent cerebral infarct, and cognitive impairment. SCD causes vasculopathy, leading to pulmonary hypertension, priapism, retinopathy, and progressive ischemic organ failure, including renal failure, hyposplenism, liver damage, and bone disease.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the United States, the median age at death is 42 years for females and 38 years for males. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment but is not feasible for the vast majority of patients suffering from the disease.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^114RqVtL]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

As described earlier, inflammatory signals and the restriction in iron availability impair erythropoiesis, contributing to the development of anemia of inflammation (AI). In response to hypoxia, EPO secretion increases, promoting tissue repair and the expansion of erythroblasts while attenuating inflammatory signaling. Erythroblasts secrete ERFE, which disrupts bone morphogenetic protein signaling, reducing hepcidin secretion by hepatocytes and thereby allowing iron release to support erythropoiesis. However, chronic inflammatory signals can unbalance this homeostatic loop by suppressing EPO production and its downstream signaling. Thus, in chronic pathologies, this dysregulation causes inflammatory iron restriction to progress into absolute iron deficiency (ID), making it common for AI to coexist with ID anemia (IDA). Under conditions of ID, the production of EPO in response to hypoxia is further diminished as the body attempts to conserve limited iron resources for essential functions beyond erythropoiesis. This suppression impairs the maturation of red blood cells, thereby complicating the restoration of hemoglobin levels when AI and IDA occur simultaneously.

Iron deficiency and inflammation are considered the main contributors to anemia in RDEB, yet the role of specific mediators and the reasons behind the limited efficacy of therapies remain incompletely understood. In RDEB, continuous wounding leads to unrelenting inflammation that complicates anemia recovery. However, because of the constant risk of infection, anti-inflammatory drugs are not the first line of treatment for RDEB. This situation underscores the need for further research to understand the complex interplay of these factors.

### Chronic kidney disease: Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment [^1116ZdUv]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, specifically in relation to screening for anemia, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend measuring hemoglobin levels at least annually in patients with CKD stage ≥ 3, and as indicated for patients with less severe disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114afHPN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In humans, multiple factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, pregnancy, environment, and nutrition influence hemoglobin (Hb) levels. In general, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as a decline in blood Hb according to the reference levels given in Table 1. These cutoff levels apply equally to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as the definitions do not vary according to comorbidities. Considering the high prevalence of anemia in chronic inflammatory diseases, the recently published European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) guideline on anemia recommends regular screening according to disease severity and activity.

- **Screening**: Anemia assessment in outpatients with active inflammation (high elevated inflammatory biomarkers or significant endoscopic proof of disease activity) should be performed at least every three months. Screening intervals in outpatients who show few signs of systemic inflammation or are in remission can be extended to every six to twelve months. Special attention should be paid to children and adolescents.

- **Diagnostic markers**: Common diagnostic markers for anemia assessment may be applied to patients without clinical, endoscopic, or biochemical evidence of active disease. In contrast, in IBD patients who have active disease, are receiving ongoing therapy, or have undergone extensive small bowel resection, important parameters for the assessment of anemia, such as erythrocyte indices, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TfS), do not always afford sufficient accuracy. It should be remembered that ferritin is an acute-phase protein that is increased in the context of chronic inflammation.

### Pathogenesis and clinical implications of HIV-related anemia in 2013 [^116FvDEb]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common feature of HIV-related disease and has been uniformly demonstrated to be an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality. Although anemia often responds to combination antiretroviral therapy, many patients remain anemic despite therapy, and such persistent anemia continues to negatively affect prognosis regardless of drug response. Anemia is also a common feature of normal aging.

We postulate that the pathophysiology of anemia in HIV, especially that which persists in the face of combination antiretroviral therapy, reflects underlying proinflammatory pathways. These pathways are also thought to contribute to anemia in the elderly, as well as other age-related chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This suggests that HIV induces inflammatory pathways associated with a pattern of accelerated aging and that anemia is a biomarker of these processes.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV-related anemia may provide important entry points for improving the chronic manifestations of HIV-related disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^113bSGbB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches, and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: Estimates from international data sources [^113D8qwA]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Anaemia develops when the red cell mass is insufficient to meet physiological oxygen-carrying needs and is usually formally diagnosed when the haemoglobin concentration falls below a defined threshold for age and sex. Accurate case definition of anaemia is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment, and for understanding the magnitude and distribution of this condition as a public health problem. WHO's anaemia definitions aim to reflect the lower fifth centile of the haemoglobin distribution of a reference population of healthy individuals. WHO thresholds were initially proposed in 1958, then updated in 1968, and have remained essentially unchanged since. These thresholds were based on studies with restricted measurement of biomarkers of iron and other forms of haematinic deficiency and inflammation. There is limited consensus on anaemia definitions, leading to heterogeneous definitions between sources, expert groups, and public health bodies, translating into inconsistent clinical definitions.

Establishing a valid diagnosis of anaemia is crucial for treating patients and detecting the range of diseases that could underlie this condition. Anaemia can cause clinical effects directly (e.g. anaemia causes a substantial burden of disease); however, even in the absence of overt clinical effects, haemoglobin-based thresholds for anaemia are used as important triggers for investigation and optimisation of underlying contributors. Haemoglobin concentrations are reduced by acute, recurrent, chronic medical or surgical illness. Inflammation (e.g. due to autoimmune disease, infection) also plays a role in modifying haemoglobin levels, which complicates the diagnosis and requires careful consideration in clinical settings.

### Anemia at older age: Etiologies, clinical implications, and management [^113hS5xH]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is quite frequently diagnosed in older individuals and is a key indicator of various reactive and clonal conditions. Many underlying diseases, like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), develop preferentially in elderly individuals. The prevalence of anemia at older age is increasing, mainly due to more frequently applied diagnostics and demographic changes in our societies. The etiology of anemia in older age is complex, ranging from bone marrow failure syndromes to chronic kidney disease, and from nutritional deficiencies to inflammatory processes, including inflammaging in immunosenescence. In a smaller number of cases, no clear-cut etiology is identified. These patients are referred to as having unexplained anemia or idiopathic cytopenia of unknown significance. In others, somatic mutations in leukocytes are found, but diagnostic criteria for MDS or other hematologic diseases are not fulfilled. This condition is termed clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance.

Management of anemia at older age depends on the severity of the anemia, underlying condition(s), and patient-related factors, including comorbidities. Even a mild anemia may substantially affect physical and cognitive capacities and quality of life. An underestimated aspect is that, because of age-related changes, organ function such as erythropoietin production in the kidney may become suboptimal. The management and treatment of anemia in older patients often require a multidisciplinary approach and detailed investigations of organ function.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^112enGwb]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend considering the individualization of therapy. Some patients may experience improvements in quality of life at higher hemoglobin concentrations, and ESA therapy may be initiated when hemoglobin levels are above 10.0 g/dL.

### The definition of anemia: What is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to determine whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make their decision based on the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Anemia in cancer: Some pathophysiological aspects [^111U3aGk]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

More than 30% of cancer patients experience anemia and its side effect, fatigue. Its causes can be numerous, but anemia is usually secondary to an imbalance of cytokines. Among these, tumor necrosis factor-alpha seems to be the major culprit, creating anemia by blunting the physiological effect of erythropoietin. Pharmacologically increasing the erythropoietin level corrects the anemia in about half the treated patients. Several studies have shown that quality of life is substantially improved through such therapy.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^1111w91K]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Anemia is a prevalent global health issue characterized by a reduction in the number of circulating red blood cells or a lower-than-normal hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, irrespective of the underlying cause such as red blood cell enzyme deficiency, red blood cell membrane disorders, hemoglobinopathies, or kidney disease, resulting in a diminished oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Clinically, anemia is conventionally determined when Hb levels fall below the established normal threshold for age, sex, and physiological status. Anemia can be subdivided into acute anemia, typically resulting from sudden blood loss, or chronic anemia, which develops over time and is often associated with underlying health conditions such as nutritional deficiencies or chronic diseases. Chronic anemia is accompanied by significant adverse health outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality, and imposes substantial health and economic burdens worldwide.

In 2021, the global prevalence of anemia, encompassing both chronic and acute forms, was 24.3%, a decrease from 28.2% in 1990. Nevertheless, the total number of individuals affected by anemia has increased due to population growth, rising from 1.50 billion in 1990 to 1.92 billion in 2021. In 2021, it accounted for 52.0 million years lived with disability (YLDs), which translates to 5.7% of all YLDs globally, making it one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.

Some specific populations and demographics are dramatically affected by chronic anemia. Women of reproductive age (15–49 years) face a high prevalence of this condition.

In specific circumstances related to iron deficiency anemia, particularly for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in these patients. It is crucial to determine whether the IDA is due to inadequate intake or absorption or is a result of iron loss, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Treating active inflammation can enhance iron absorption or help reduce iron depletion (Best Practice Advice).

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: Current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective, and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, with the polypeptide hepcidin playing a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detecting functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed.

Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels. However, where this is not possible, erythropoietic-stimulating agents are often used, although concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism, remain. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Anemia in elderly patients: An emerging problem for the 21st century [^112dabUZ]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is a significant problem in elderly patients. Although many anemic elderly patients can be diagnosed with nutritional deficiency or anemia of chronic inflammation or comorbid diseases that explain their decreased hematocrit, the etiology of anemia in a significant fraction remains obscure. There is evidence suggesting that the hematopoietic stem cell displays increasing erythropoietin (EPO) resistance with age. EPO levels rise in elderly, non-anemic patients, and it is hypothesized that there is an interplay between this rising demand for EPO and the decreasing ability of the aging kidney to produce adequate hormone to meet that need.

There is further considerable evidence that aging is associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine expression and that many of these cytokines can contribute to EPO insensitivity. Consequently, genetic variation in the expression of these proinflammatory cytokines may influence the development of anemia in elderly patients, both through induction of hepcidin expression (anemia of inflammation) and through cytokine suppression of erythroid colony formation. The impact of inflammatory mediators, EPO insensitivity, and other factors that may act on the hematopoietic stem cell to decrease erythropoiesis are under active study. This research should serve to elucidate the pathophysiology of this important cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of anemia in elderly patients should provide critical entry points for interventions that will improve survival and quality of life in the aging population.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), more specifically with respect to the initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests in the laboratory evaluation of patients with anemia associated with CKD:

- **CBC (including MCH, MCV, platelet count)**: In addition to the hemoglobin concentration.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: To assess bone marrow responsiveness, if indicated.

- **Assessment of iron status**: This includes the percentage of hypochromic RBCs, but only if processing of the blood sample is possible within 6 hours. Alternatively, the reticulocyte hemoglobin count or equivalent tests such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent can be used. If these tests are not available or the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait, a combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin is recommended.

- **Serum ferritin**: To assess iron stores.

- **Serum CRP**: To assess possible inflammation.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^111uxchw]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

We show that progress towards alleviating the anaemia burden across age, sex, and geography is varied and often slow. Our analysis of the underlying causes of anaemia provides insights for the design of effective, contextualized disease surveillance programmes and public health interventions. Although iron deficiency is often the most frequent cause of anaemia, much of the iron-related anaemia burden could be unresponsive to iron treatments if the underlying issues relating to iron deficiency are not addressed. Interventions to deal with major causes of anaemia — such as chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal disorders, malaria, and, where prevalent, neglected tropical diseases such as schistosomiasis and hookworm disease — are necessary to substantially reduce anaemia burden.

Important gaps in data and knowledge remain, necessitating the development of evidence-based definitions of anaemia centered on actual health loss, quantification of morbidity and mortality associated with low haemoglobin concentrations as a risk factor for other illnesses, and analysis of the effect of comorbid diseases on the incidence and severity of anaemia. Investments in closing these gaps will improve future estimates of the burden of anaemia and will provide policymakers, stakeholders, and health practitioners with the comprehensive data needed to reduce persistently high anaemia prevalence and associated health loss.

The WHO's Global Nutrition Target calls for a 50% reduction in anaemia prevalence among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) by 2030.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^1159mjTY]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Estimating the burden imposed by anemia is not a trivial task. The difficulties in reliably quantifying its consequences stem from complex challenges related to its diagnosis. Anemia is multifactorial and can result from various causes, which can often be hard to differentiate. This makes accurate diagnosis challenging, especially in developing countries. Multiple types of anemia can occur simultaneously, often presenting with similar symptoms, making it challenging to distinguish and accurately attribute the specific causes of anemia on a global scale. Achieving this requires more comprehensive, high-quality data to understand and quantify the contributions of different underlying causes across diverse populations.

- **Over-attribution to iron deficiency anemia**: The most common type of anemia, over-attribution is an important issue. Often due to its status as a default diagnosis in regions with limited diagnostic resources and its high prevalence as a primary etiology in many populations, analyses often rely on iron deficiency while only about half of anemia cases globally are due to it. This leads to misdiagnosis and misclassification. Therefore, assessing anemia should involve testing various biomarkers (e.g. ferritin and retinol) with different sensitivities and specificities. This "biomarker complexity" is further heightened and compounded by interactions with factors like inflammation, nutrient deficiencies, and pregnancy, especially in developing countries, where multiple types of anemia can coexist.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia, designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly with respect to diagnostic criteria, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend suspecting chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a possible cause of anemia when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m². This is especially pertinent if the GFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (or below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² in patients with diabetes) and no other causes, such as blood loss or deficiencies in folic acid or vitamin B12, have been identified.

### Investigation of the role of interleukin-6 and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide in the development of anemia with age [^117C1xTE]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in older adults and is associated with adverse health outcomes in epidemiological studies. A thorough understanding of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms driving anemia in the elderly is lacking; however, inflammation, iron restriction, and impaired erythroid maturation are thought to influence the phenotype. We hypothesized that interleukin-6 contributes to this anemia, given its pro-inflammatory activities, its ability to induce hepcidin antimicrobial peptide, and its negative impact on several tissues in older adults.

We tested this hypothesis by comparing changes in indices of inflammation, iron metabolism, and erythropoiesis in aged C57BL/6 mice to aged mice with targeted deletions of interleukin-6 or hepcidin antimicrobial peptide. Circulating neutrophil and monocyte numbers, as well as inflammatory cytokines, increased with age. A decline in hemoglobin concentration and red blood cell number indicated that C57BL/6, interleukin-6 knockout mice, and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide knockout mice all demonstrated impaired erythropoiesis by 24 months. However, the interleukin-6 knockout genotype and the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide knockout genotype resulted in improved erythropoiesis in aged mice. Increased erythropoietic activity in the spleen suggested that the erythroid compartment was stressed in aged C57BL/6 mice compared to aged interleukin-6 knockout mice.

Our data suggest C57BL/6 mice are an appropriate mammalian model for the study of anemia with age. Furthermore, although interleukin-6 and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide are not required, they can participate in the development of anemia with age.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are frequently encountered in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered:

- **Anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts**: This pattern helps in identifying the underlying abnormalities causing the anemia.
- **Anemia with increased reticulocyte counts**: This indicates a compensatory response to anemia, suggesting hemolysis or blood loss.
- **Life-long history of chronic anemia**: A patient's history can provide insights into inherited or long-standing conditions.
- **Anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes**: This suggests inadequate bone marrow response to anemia.

The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Targeting the hepcidin-ferroportin axis to develop new treatment strategies for anemia of chronic disease and anemia of inflammation [^116LosGk]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD), or anemia of inflammation, is prevalent in patients with chronic infection, autoimmune disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease. ACD is associated with poor prognosis and a lower quality of life. Management of ACD using intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents is ineffective for some patients and is not without adverse effects, driving the need for new alternative therapies. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of iron regulation reveal that increased hepcidin, the iron regulatory hormone, is a key factor in the development of ACD. This review summarizes the role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis, its contribution to the pathophysiology of ACD, and novel strategies that modulate hepcidin and its target ferroportin for the treatment of ACD.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^116q5b2E]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Limitations of global standards for anemia diagnosis and outdated definitions represent significant challenges in estimating the burden of anemia. The thresholds commonly used to define anemia are largely arbitrary. For example, those recommended by the WHO were originally based on hemoglobin (Hb) distributions observed in limited populations, primarily from Western countries like Europe, the United States, and Canada during the 1960s, and were not derived from direct associations with health outcomes. Revising these thresholds might seem straightforward, but accurately defining anemia remains highly complex. This complexity arises from differences in biological, geographical, and geopolitical factors, compounded by challenges related to measurement methods, test validity, and accessibility.

The Hb concentration cutoffs established by the WHO for anemia diagnosis — 13.0 g/dL for men aged 15 years and older, 11.0 g/dL for children, and 12.0 g/dL for nonpregnant women — may not accurately reflect functional outcomes or clinical practice. Moreover, they do not appear to be linked with physiological, health, or other relevant outcomes. A cross-sectional study based on 79,950 Hb observations from 30 global nutrition surveys conducted between 2005 and 2016 across 25 countries revealed that WHO cutoffs are higher than the fifth percentile in most countries, except the United States. This pattern was observed in 13,445 children aged 6–59 months and 25,880 nonpregnant women aged 15–49 years. Elevated levels of the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), a biomarker, were also noted, indicating further complexity in understanding and diagnosing anemia.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113hjMh8]. Blood (2024). Low credibility.

With the globally growing older adult population, clinicians face the common yet complex challenge of how to evaluate and manage anemia in this demographic. Older age predisposes individuals to common causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality.

Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because it may have a single cause, may be multifactorial, or may have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. A systematic approach to diagnosis ensures appropriate testing and avoids the pitfall of undertreatment and overtreatment. This article presents a recommended approach through common scenarios for the management of anemia in the older adult.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^116YXhHM]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene, resulting in the loss of function of collagen VII anchoring fibrils. This structural defect leads to severe skin and mucosal fragility, causing patients to suffer repetitive cutaneous wounds and mucosal damage. These lesions cause blood loss, persistent inflammation, increased risk of infection, iron deficiency (ID), and ultimately, anemia, which further exacerbates the overall disease burden.

Inflammation induces hypoferremia as an innate defense mechanism to restrict iron availability to pathogens. Although this strategy limits microbial growth, it simultaneously impairs erythropoiesis by reducing iron availability for red blood cell production. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines exert a direct negative effect on red blood cell production. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) skews hematopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, prioritizing the production of immune cells over erythrocytes to meet the increased demand for host defense. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) contributes to this shift by directly inhibiting the differentiation and survival of erythroid progenitors, whereas interferon-γ (IFN-γ) shortens erythrocyte life span, further compromising erythroid output. The sustained activation of these mechanisms ultimately leads to anemia of inflammation (AI), also referred to as anemia of chronic disease. AI is associated with highly prevalent conditions including cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, HIV infection, autoimmune diseases, and other inflammatory disorders.

### What is really dangerous: Anaemia or transfusion [^116Qxyrx]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

While complex physiological mechanisms exist to regulate and optimize tissue oxygenation under various conditions, clinical and experimental evidence indicates that anaemia, if unchecked, is associated with organ injury and unfavourable outcomes. More data, especially from human studies, are needed to answer questions regarding the optimal approaches to the treatment of acute and chronic anaemia. In the meantime, allogeneic blood transfusions remain the most common treatment, particularly in surgical and trauma patients, and those with moderate-to-severe anaemia.

Clinical studies emphasize the paradox that both anaemia and transfusion are associated with organ injury, increased morbidity, and mortality across a wide range of disease states and surgical interventions. Further characterization of the mechanisms of injury is needed to appropriately balance these risks and to develop novel treatment strategies that will improve patient outcomes.

- **Understanding physiological mechanisms**: Tissue oxygen delivery, utilization, adaptation, and survival in the context of anaemia are crucial.
- **Evidence on anaemia and transfusion impact**: There is an independent, and often synergistic, deleterious impact of both anaemia and transfusion on patient outcomes.

The risks of anaemia and transfusion, in light of substantial variations in transfusion practices, increasing costs, a shrinking pool of donated resources, and ambiguity about the actual clinical benefits of banked allogeneic blood, demand better management strategies targeted at improving patient outcomes.

### Iron deficiency: a concise review [^114q2zV3]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a major worldwide health problem. Recent evidence suggests that anemia is only the last manifestation of the syndrome and that symptoms can occur before anemia becomes apparent. Advances have been made in understanding the physiology of iron deficiency, although gaps remain in our understanding. While oral iron supplements are still the mainstay of treatment, some indications for intravenous administration have been developed. This review highlights the epidemiology, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options related to iron deficiency.

### Dysregulated monocyte iron homeostasis and erythropoietin formation in patients with anemia of chronic disease [^116Dx4pR]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is frequently found in patients with chronic immune activation. Since most studies on ACD pathophysiology were performed with cell culture or animal models but not in humans, we examined 37 ACD patients suffering from autoimmune diseases or infections, 10 subjects with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), 10 anemic patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS), and 27 age-matched controls. Although hemoglobin concentrations were comparable between ACD and IDA patients, the latter presented with significantly higher serum erythropoietin concentrations than ACD patients. The significant negative correlation between erythropoietin and hemoglobin levels observed in IDA patients was also found in a group of anemic but not hypoferremic hereditary spherocytosis subjects, but not in ACD patients. Increased serum concentrations of the hepcidin precursor prohepcidin were paralleled by a decreased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin in circulating monocytes of ACD patients. In the latter cells, increased amounts of the iron storage protein ferritin and a reduced activity of iron-regulatory protein indicated monocyte iron accumulation. Our data indicate that hypoferremia in ACD may result from downregulation of ferroportin expression by hepcidin and cytokines with subsequent iron retention in monocytes. Together with a diminished erythropoietin formation, the impaired iron recirculation from monocytes may be central in the pathophysiology of ACD in humans.

- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: Used to identify abnormal hemoglobin variants.

- **Free light chains and bone marrow examination**: These are recommended in specific scenarios to further investigate anemia causes.

### Hepcidin inhibits in vitro erythroid colony formation at reduced erythropoietin concentrations [^111d8zV4]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The anemia of chronic disease (ACD) results from three major processes: slightly shortened red cell survival, impaired reticuloendothelial system iron mobilization, and impaired erythropoiesis. Hepcidin is an acute-phase protein with specific iron regulatory properties which, along with the anemia seen with increased hepcidin expression, have led many to consider it the major mediator of ACD. However, if hepcidin is the major factor responsible for ACD, then it should also contribute to the impaired erythropoiesis observed in this syndrome.

Erythroid colony formation in vitro was inhibited by hepcidin at erythropoietin (Epo) concentrations less than or equal to 0.5 U/mL but not at Epo 1.0 U/mL. At Epo concentrations of 0.3 U/mL, HCD57 erythroleukemia cells exposed to hepcidin exhibit decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein pBad compared with controls. These studies suggest that hepcidin may contribute to anemia in ACD not only through effects on iron metabolism, but also through inhibition of erythroid progenitor proliferation and survival.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^1121y8V1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Anemia is a major global health challenge affecting an estimated quarter of the world's population, imposing a substantial burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic costs. Although iron deficiency remains the most frequently cited cause, the etiological landscape of anemia is remarkably diverse. It includes deficiencies of other micronutrients (e.g. vitamin B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell disease and thalassemia), and anemia of chronic disease. Women of reproductive age and young children are especially vulnerable, with iron deficiency anemia contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes, impaired cognitive development, and heightened susceptibility to infection. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are therefore pivotal to controlling this significant public health issue.

Diagnosing anemia, however, is far from straightforward. Hemoglobin (Hb) cutoffs established by the World Health Organization (WHO) provide widely accepted thresholds for identifying anemia in the general population, yet these reference values were largely developed and validated in low-altitude and high-income settings. Such generalized classifications often fail to capture the complexities of diverse global populations, particularly individuals living in high-altitude regions (> 2500 m). Due to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude, an elevated Hb concentration is a normal physiological adaptation to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation. When altitude‐dependent Hb correction cutoffs are applied in these environments, they can…

### Anemia of inflammation [^116xxuaK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammation arising from various etiologies, including infection, autoimmune disorders, chronic diseases, and aging, can promote anemia. The anemia of inflammation (AI) is most often normocytic and normochromic and is usually mild. Characteristic changes in systemic iron handling, erythrocyte production, and erythrocyte lifespan all contribute to AI. The preferred treatment is directed at the underlying disease. However, when the inflammatory insult is intractable, or the cause has not been diagnosed, there are limited options for the treatment of AI. Because anemia is a comorbid condition associated with poor outcomes in various chronic disease states, understanding its pathogenesis and developing new tools for its treatment should remain a priority.

Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide has taken center stage in recent years as a potent modulator of iron availability. As the technology for quantitative hepcidin analysis improves, hepcidin's role in various disease states is also being revealed. Recent insights concerning the regulatory pathways that modify hepcidin expression have identified novel targets for drug development. As the field advances with such therapeutics, the analysis of the impact of normalized hemoglobin on disease outcomes will confirm whether anemia is a reversible independent contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory diseases.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^117BEttW]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Anaemia remains a major public health issue across the life course. The persistently high anaemia burden — particularly in women of reproductive age and young children — underscores the need for renewed attention on accurately measuring the prevalence of anaemia and its underlying causes, and using these data to design comprehensive policies and interventions that reflect the context-specific epidemiology of the disease and its determinants. Analyses of population-level anaemia burden can provide the insights required to appropriately tailor interventions at the country and subnational levels in an effort to reduce the prevalence of anaemia across all ages and sexes. Although probably not obtainable for most countries, multifaceted and contextual approaches will be necessary to ensure substantive progress towards Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 3 and WHO Global Nutrition Targets.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^112emXBc]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Research in context - **Evidence before this study**: The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is a comprehensive effort to systematically measure the causes and risk factors of death and disability. Anaemia-specific manuscripts relating to the 2010 and 2013 GBDs have previously been published. Other studies examining trends in anaemia burden at the global level have often been limited to particular demographic groups (e.g. children or women of reproductive age), geographies (e.g. low-income settings), or specific underlying causes (e.g. iron deficiency) and therefore do not capture the full extent of the anaemia burden. For example, 2022 WHO estimates present anaemia burden among children aged 6–59 months and women aged 15–49 years from 2000 to 2019. In this context, the GBD provides an ideal framework to comprehensively quantify the prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends of anaemia burden across all geographies, demographics, and causes.

To estimate total anaemia prevalence, we used individual-level and tabulated survey and report data from the Global Health Data Exchange, identified using the keywords "anemia" and "hemoglobin". This was supplemented with sources from the WHO Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System, a comprehensive database including measurements of haemoglobin concentration and anaemia prevalence collected from systematic reviews of scientific literature databases; WHO regional and country offices; other research, governmental and non-governmental organisations; and manual searches of non-indexed journals.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^114cUhSs]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Anaemia is a major health problem worldwide. Global estimates of anaemia burden are crucial for developing appropriate interventions to meet international targets for disease mitigation. This study describes the prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), and trends of anaemia and its underlying causes in 204 countries and territories.

We estimated population-level distributions of haemoglobin concentration by age and sex for each location from 1990 to 2021. Anaemia burden was calculated by severity and associated YLDs. Using data on the prevalence of the causes of anaemia and associated cause-specific shifts in haemoglobin concentrations, the proportion of anaemia attributed to 37 underlying causes was modeled for all locations, years, and demographics in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.

In 2021, the global prevalence of anaemia across all ages was 24.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 23.9–24.7), corresponding to 1.92 billion (1.89–1.95 billion) prevalent cases. This was compared with a prevalence of 28.2% (27.8–28.5) and 1.50 billion (1.48–1.52 billion) prevalent cases in 1990. Large variations were observed in anaemia burden by age, sex, and geography, with children younger than 5 years, women, and countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia being particularly affected. Anaemia caused 52.0 million (35.1–75.1) YLDs in 2021, and the YLD rate due to anaemia declined with increasing Socio-demographic Index. Dietary iron deficiency was the most common cause of anaemia YLDs in 2021.

### Regulation of iron homeostasis in anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications [^1114Y6P7]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

The anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is characterized by macrophage iron retention induced by cytokines and the master regulator hepcidin. Hepcidin controls cellular iron efflux by binding to the iron export protein ferroportin. Many patients present with both ACD and iron deficiency anemia (ACD/IDA), the latter resulting from chronic blood loss. Using a rat model of ACD resulting from chronic arthritis, ACD/IDA was mimicked by additional phlebotomy to define differing iron-regulatory pathways.

Iron retention during inflammation occurs in macrophages and the spleen, but not in the liver. In both rats and humans with ACD, serum hepcidin concentrations are elevated, which is paralleled by reduced duodenal and macrophage expression of ferroportin. Individuals with ACD/IDA have significantly lower hepcidin levels than ACD subjects. In contrast to ACD subjects, ACD/IDA individuals can absorb dietary iron from the gut and mobilize iron from macrophages.

Circulating hepcidin levels affect iron traffic in ACD and ACD/IDA and are more responsive to the erythropoietic demands for iron than to inflammation. Hepcidin determination may aid in differentiating between ACD and ACD/IDA and in selecting appropriate therapy for these patients.

### The role of inflammation in the anaemia of end-stage renal disease [^111HmdZK]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic inflammation is a common feature of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that is gaining increasing attention as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is well established that ESRD itself carries a heightened risk of inflammatory disorders and other co-morbid conditions. However, it should also be pointed out that dialysis treatment itself can bring additional risk factors for inflammation, such as impure dialysate or bio-incompatible membranes.

Inflammation has recently been associated with atherosclerosis and malnutrition in ESRD, and this link has led to the development of the malnutrition, inflammation, atherosclerosis (MIA) hypothesis. This describes a syndrome whereby raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) are a common link between malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Additionally, anaemia appears to be an important element linking elevated cytokine levels with poor patient outcomes.

Several mechanisms for cytokine-induced anaemia have been proposed, including intestinal bleeding, impaired iron metabolism, and suppression of bone marrow erythropoiesis and erythropoietin production. These effects suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines may also be an important cause of the lack of response to recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-Epo) therapy. In light of this putative role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-cytokine agents may prove useful to optimize the efficacy of rh-Epo in anaemic chronic renal failure patients. Other potential therapeutic strategies include minimizing exposure to causes of inflammation from various co-morbidities.

### Anemia in early rheumatoid arthritis is associated with interleukin 6-mediated bone marrow suppression, but has no effect on disease course or mortality [^116hYeZK]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is the most common extraarticular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet there is limited information on its cause and consequences. We investigated its prevalence, relationship with proinflammatory cytokines, and impact on disease outcome in patients with RA.

- **Methods**: The presence of anemia was analyzed in a cohort of 111 consecutive patients with early RA. Anemia was associated with markers of erythropoiesis and inflammation, determined clinically and by levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum interleukin 1beta (IL-1β), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The frequency of various disease outcomes during a mean follow-up of 74 months was compared between anemic and nonanemic patients.

- **Results**: ACD was present in 25% of patients within the first year of disease. It was associated with higher CRP (45 vs. 22 g/L; p = 0.04) and ESR levels (54 vs. 33 mm/h; p = 0.002). Hemoglobin levels were inversely correlated with serum erythropoietin (p = 0.003) in univariate analysis, while multivariate analysis revealed only ESR (p = 0.005) and IL-6 (p = 0.056) as independent predictors of hemoglobin levels. ACD presence was not linked with the later development of disease manifestations or mortality.

- **Conclusion**: While ACD affected 25% of patients with RA early in the disease, it had no impact on disease outcomes, including mortality, over the following 6 years. The association between IL-6 and ACD indicates that IL-6-mediated bone marrow suppression is the primary mechanism for anemia development.

### An update on anemia in less developed countries [^1139aDTZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

The highest prevalence of anemia exists in the developing world where its causes are multi-factorial. Anemia is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in less developed countries (LDCs). Understanding the causes of anemia and potential mechanisms is crucial to our ability to intervene and reduce this burden. In the past decade, our understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of anemia in LDCs has advanced significantly. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the burden of anemia in specific sub-groups, the causes and mechanisms of anemia, and the consequences of anemia for the human host.

### Iron in sickle-cell disease: What have we learned over the years [^115c1hSv]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Over the last four decades, monumental advances have been made in the understanding, assessment, and management of transfusion-dependent patients, which have translated into significant improvements in patient morbidity and mortality. Important lessons have been learned from extensive clinical experience of iron management in thalassemias, but greater knowledge of key differences in the sickle-cell disease (SCD) population may impact our approach to patient assessment and management.

The unique pathophysiology of SCD is reflected in a distinct pattern of iron loading with minimal organ-specific injury. An appreciation and understanding of these differences should allow us to develop tailored management approaches that optimize patient outcomes.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^115NRaXz]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Anaemia is a major health problem worldwide. Global estimates of anaemia burden are crucial for developing appropriate interventions to meet international targets for disease mitigation. We describe the prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends of anaemia and its underlying causes in 204 countries and territories.

- **Methods**: We estimated population-level distributions of haemoglobin concentration by age and sex for each location from 1990 to 2021. We then calculated anaemia burden by severity and associated years lived with disability (YLDs). With data on the prevalence of the causes of anaemia and associated cause-specific shifts in haemoglobin concentrations, we modelled the proportion of anaemia attributed to 37 underlying causes for all locations, years, and demographics in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.

- **Findings**: In 2021, the global prevalence of anaemia across all ages was 24.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 23.9–24.7), corresponding to 1.92 billion (1.89–1.95) prevalent cases, compared with a prevalence of 28.2% (27.8–28.5) and 1.50 billion (1.48–1.52) prevalent cases in 1990. Large variations were observed in anaemia burden by age, sex, and geography, with children younger than 5 years, women, and countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia being particularly affected. Anaemia caused 52.0 million (35.1–75.1) YLDs in 2021, and the YLD rate due to anaemia declined with increasing socio-demographic index. The most common causes of anaemia YLDs in 2021 were dietary iron deficiency (cause-specific anaemia YLD rate per 100,000 population)…

### Prevalence of anemia and effects on mortality in patients with heart failure [^111pQ8zP]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic kidney disease, the adverse cardiovascular effects of anemia have been well established. New data are emerging to suggest anemia may represent an important treatable cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. To improve the understanding of the problem of anemia in heart failure, it is important to assess the factors that influence the prevalence of anemia and to assess the consistency of the association of anemia and mortality in various populations of patients with heart failure.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was conducted by performing detailed searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE, searching the bibliographies of the articles retrieved during the database search, and conferring with heart-failure experts involved in clinical trials. Twenty-eight publications from 26 studies that evaluated anemia prevalence with or without effects on mortality in patients with heart failure were identified. The definition of anemia used in each study was tabulated along with pertinent patient characteristics, the prevalence of anemia, and the association between anemia and mortality.

- **Results**: Anemia is common among patients with heart failure. The prevalence of anemia increases with increasing severity of heart failure, declining renal function, and increasing age. Anemia is consistently associated with poorer survival in all patient populations, but there are substantial differences in the patient populations and definition of anemia.

- **Conclusions**: To clarify the prognostic relationship of anemia in patients.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^116rH9yg]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with poor outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is controversial, with recent clinical trials demonstrating increased morbidity and mortality related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Here, we examine recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying anemia of CKD. These insights hold promise for the development of new diagnostic tests and therapies that directly target the pathophysiologic processes underlying this form of anemia.

### What are the clinical consequences of anemia in patients with chronic heart failure [^116MPqRP]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies have drawn cardiologists' attention to the potential impact of anemia in patients with chronic heart failure. Cumulative studies show the association between anemia and poorer functional status, as well as increased morbidity and mortality. Data supports the association of anemia with worse New York Heart Association functional class, lower exercise capacity, and increased hospital admission. Anemia has also been shown to be an independent predictor of survival in these patients. However, the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms by which anemia may increase risk in chronic heart failure are still unknown. Similarly, there is no evidence yet of a true cause-and-effect relationship between anemia and these parameters. Only intervention studies intended to correct anemia and evaluate its effect on clinical outcomes can verify these important hypotheses.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^113a1ABe]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Anemia remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in high-altitude populations where physiological adaptations complicate standard diagnostic practices. WHO hemoglobin cutoff points may lead to misclassification, either under- or overestimating anemia in high-altitude regions. To address this, a refined approach is needed, incorporating revised diagnostic thresholds tailored to population-specific adaptations, alongside personalized clinical assessments and emerging biomarkers. Additionally, integrating genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors will enhance diagnostic precision and treatment efficacy. Implementing this comprehensive framework would facilitate greater diagnostic precision, enable more targeted therapeutic interventions, and enhance health outcomes for the populations most impacted.

### Anemia and risk for cognitive decline in chronic kidney disease [^115fWvVZ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but its health consequences are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between anemia and cognitive decline in older adults with CKD.

- **Methods**: We studied a subgroup of 762 adults aged ≥ 55 years with CKD participating in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women). Cognitive function was assessed annually with a battery of six tests. We used logistic regression to determine the association between anemia and baseline cognitive impairment on each test, defined as a cognitive score more than one standard deviation from the mean, and mixed effects models to determine the relation between anemia and change in cognitive function during follow-up after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Of 762 participants with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate of 42.7 ± 16.4 ml/min/1.73 m², 349 (46%) had anemia. Anemia was not independently associated with baseline cognitive impairment on any test after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Over a median 2.9 (IQR 2.6–3.0) years of follow-up, there was no independent association between anemia and change in cognitive function on any of the six cognitive tests.

- **Conclusions**: Among older adults with CKD, anemia was not independently associated with baseline cognitive function or decline.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114nUyag]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly.

This review summarizes our understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches, and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.

### How I treat renal anemia [^1148K2kY]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Anemia is a frequent complication of kidney disease. When severe, it causes symptoms that can be debilitating. The course of anemia tends to track the decline in kidney function, with prevalence increasing in more advanced disease. Although the most common cause is relative erythropoietin deficiency, other factors such as reduced iron availability contribute to the pathobiology. In this review, we use cases to explore the surprising complexity of decision-making in management of renal anemia.

### The anemia of inflammation/malignancy: mechanisms and management [^111z2C6o]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication in patients with inflammatory diseases of various kinds, including cancer. The mechanisms that have captured the most attention include cytokine-mediated changes in both the production of and the response to erythropoietin (Epo), as well as important alterations in iron metabolism. The last is brought about by the relatively recently recognized peptide hormone, hepcidin. The availability of recombinant human Epo and its derivatives, known collectively as erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESAs), has dramatically changed anemia management in patients with cancer. However, in the process, it has raised as many issues as have been answered. This chapter reviews the mechanisms resulting in anemia in inflammation, including cancer, and focuses on the controversies around management with ESAs and the adjuvant use of iron in anemia management.

### Anemia in chronic heart failure: pathogenetic mechanisms [^115zFEUA]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia can be both a cause and a consequence of heart failure. The pathogenesis of anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) has not been fully elucidated but is likely complex. Epidemiological studies suggest that factors such as kidney dysfunction — by reducing the erythropoietic response to anemia — inflammation — by inducing erythropoietin resistance — decreased body mass index, old age, female gender, and poor clinical status may play important roles in the development of anemia in CHF. Additionally, intestinal malabsorption, chronic aspirin use, and proteinuria may predispose individuals to iron deficiency.

Proinflammatory cytokines are likely to contribute significantly to anemia in CHF by generating the "anemia of chronic illness", which is a hallmark of inflammatory conditions. Despite the importance of understanding these mechanisms, few studies have thoroughly investigated the causes of anemia in CHF, highlighting a critical need for further research.
