## Question

Tendinitis of right shoulder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing right shoulder tendinitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the diagnosis and terminology. Then, I should verify red flags and the initial clinical assessment. Next, I will review imaging indications and choices. After that, I need to outline first-line conservative management, including education, load management, and exercise. Then, I should examine pharmacologic options and their timing. I will now examine injection therapies, including corticosteroids, PRP, and calcific lavage, and check their evidence and limitations. Next, I should review when to refer and consider surgery, and finally, I will consider special populations, return-to-activity planning, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and high-quality trials as I go [^114hHvgC] [^116wEz8W].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic terminology, because precision matters here; "tendinitis" is often a misnomer in the shoulder, and contemporary practice favors "rotator cuff–related shoulder pain" or "rotator cuff tendinopathy" to reflect the limited diagnostic accuracy of attributing pain to a single structure and the predominance of load-related tendon pathology rather than pure inflammation, so I should frame the case as RCRSP unless there is a clear inflammatory flare or calcific process identified on imaging or exam [^116gazYw].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities before jumping to treatment; I need to screen for red flags such as acute trauma, fever, systemic illness, neurologic deficits, or inability to move the shoulder, and if present, I should escalate urgently rather than proceed with routine care, whereas in the absence of red flags I should complete a focused history and examination to localize pain generators, assess scapular mechanics, and identify yellow flags that could impair recovery, using validated patient-reported measures to quantify pain and disability for baseline tracking [^114hHvgC] [^11631jkY].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging indications; I must not order MRI or ultrasound at the initial visit for suspected rotator cuff tendinopathy, because routine imaging does not change early management and increases costs and delays, so imaging is reserved for persistent symptoms after about 12 weeks of appropriate conservative care, at which point ultrasound is preferred given similar diagnostic performance to MRI for most rotator cuff disorders and lower cost, with MRI reserved for preoperative planning or complex differentials [^115gBQRu] [^114zHMg3] [^114JRaQR].

> Let me consider the cornerstone of first-line care; I should confirm that active rehabilitation with progressive loading is the initial treatment of choice, emphasizing patient education on the condition, load management, and avoidance of aggravating activities, while prescribing a structured program that includes motor control and resistance training with graded progression, because this consistently improves pain and function across trials and guidelines [^113jq1nf] [^115URABz] [^116jsitw].

> I need to check the exercise dosing details; evidence suggests that higher-volume programs may confer medium-term disability benefits, whereas load intensity comparisons show no clear short-term superiority, so I should individualize volume and progression while ensuring adherence and symptom-guided advancement rather than chasing a specific load metric, and I should remember that scapular-focused interventions can add short-term pain and disability benefits, though effects may attenuate over time [^115GzKK1] [^1152F4jT] [^116tpNqL].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic adjuncts; acetaminophen and NSAIDs are reasonable short-term options for pain relief, with NSAIDs like indomethacin or sulindac specifically labeled for acute painful shoulder, but I must use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and screen for contraindications, while avoiding opioids as first-line and reserving them only for severe, refractory pain with careful risk assessment and reassessment if used [^11496BFV] [^113y2jnc] [^1127z7JH] [^116qXYxa].

> But wait, what if I am considering an injection; I should double-check that corticosteroid injections are not first-line, yet may be used judiciously for short-term pain relief, with ultrasound guidance improving accuracy and outcomes, and I should limit repeat injections to no more than two if there is no meaningful improvement, given diminishing returns and potential tendon-related harms, especially if surgery is contemplated within three months [^117748mQ] [^1165CcBN] [^114PNccT].

> I will now examine PRP; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — evidence remains mixed, so PRP may be considered after failed conservative care and not as first-line, and I should counsel that benefits appear smaller in the presence of partial-thickness tears and that leukocyte composition may influence outcomes, so shared decision-making is essential here [^114VoknL] [^112XgTDm].

> Let me verify calcific tendinopathy specifics; if calcium is present and symptoms persist despite initial conservative therapy, ultrasound-guided lavage can be considered, but I should confirm that recent high-quality evidence suggests no superiority of lavage or steroid over sham, so expectations must be tempered and decisions individualized, even though earlier studies and meta-analyses suggested potential benefits, underscoring the need to align intervention choice with patient goals and local expertise [^116AR4D4] [^115LMVig] [^112WtkSN].

> Next, I should review referral thresholds; if there is severe or persistent pain and disability despite up to 12 weeks of appropriate nonsurgical management, I should refer to a musculoskeletal specialist for further evaluation, and if a full-thickness rotator cuff tear is suspected or confirmed, surgical consultation becomes appropriate, whereas for atraumatic degenerative cuff tears, high-quality evidence shows no clinically meaningful long-term advantage of subacromial decompression over supervised exercise, reinforcing conservative-first care [^116xHWJJ] [^116ARMEa] [^116w4PQj].

> I need to ensure I address special populations; in older adults, I should be cautious with NSAIDs and fluoroquinolones due to higher risks of GI bleeding and tendon rupture respectively, and I should also remember that bempedoic acid is associated with rotator cuff and other tendon ruptures, so medication reconciliation is critical before attributing symptoms solely to mechanical tendinopathy [^1139nQ31] [^111Qs1wu] [^116HYHf6].

> Let me reconsider return-to-activity planning; I should confirm that athletes and workers require individualized, load-tolerance–based progression using validated patient-reported outcomes and functional tests to guide safe return, integrating scapular mechanics and kinetic chain principles to reduce recurrence risk and optimize performance [^112mvZQv] [^111SZxqh].

> Finally, I should double-check that my decision algorithm aligns with guidelines; start with education and active rehabilitation, reserve imaging for nonresponders at 12 weeks, escalate to injections only as adjuncts with clear limits, and refer for persistent disability or suspected full-thickness tears, while avoiding unnecessary surgery in nontraumatic degenerative disease and tailoring choices to patient values and comorbidities throughout [^114hHvgC] [^115gBQRu] [^116xHWJJ].

Right shoulder tendinitis is best managed with **conservative care first** [^113jq1nf], including rest, NSAIDs, and a structured physical therapy program focused on eccentric and scapular stabilization exercises [^113jq1nf] [^116tpNqL]. Imaging is not initially required [^115gBQRu]; **reserve ultrasound or MRI** for refractory cases or suspected tears [^114zHMg3] [^117PhepF]. Corticosteroid injections may provide short-term relief [^1165CcBN] but are not first-line [^111d7QAV]; avoid repeated injections [^114PNccT]. Most patients improve within 6–12 weeks [^114zHMg3]; refer to orthopedics if there is no improvement after 3 months or if a full-thickness tear is suspected [^116xHWJJ].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Typical symptoms include **anterior or lateral shoulder pain**, worsened by overhead activities or lifting, with night pain and tenderness over the acromion or bicipital groove [^114J8iws]. Key tests include Neer, Hawkins, and Speed/Yergason; **impingement tests** (Neer, Hawkins) are sensitive but not specific, whereas biceps tests (Speed, Yergason) support biceps involvement [^116NN99q]. Imaging is not initially required [^114JRaQR]; **use ultrasound or MRI** if symptoms persist beyond 6–12 weeks or if a tear is suspected [^114zHMg3] [^117PhepF].

---

## Conservative management

### Rest and activity modification

Limit overhead activities and heavy lifting; **avoid provocative movements** until pain subsides.

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

NSAIDs are **first-line** for pain and inflammation (e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen) [^11496BFV]; acetaminophen is an alternative for those who cannot tolerate NSAIDs [^111gH1tX]. Corticosteroid injections may provide short-term relief [^1165CcBN] but are **not first-line** [^111d7QAV]; limit to 1–2 injections and avoid repeated use [^114PNccT].

---

### Physical therapy

- **Eccentric strengthening**: Focus on eccentric loading of the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers [^notfound].

- **Scapular stabilization**: Emphasize scapular control and posture correction [^116tpNqL].

- **Stretching**: Gentle stretching of the shoulder capsule and tendons to restore ROM [^notfound].

---

## Advanced interventions

Advanced options include **ultrasound-guided lavage** for calcific tendinitis refractory to conservative care [^112WtkSN] and **surgery** for refractory cases or full-thickness tears, with arthroscopic debridement or repair considered after 3–6 months of failed conservative treatment [^114udJjH].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

Most patients improve within **6–12 weeks** of conservative care; persistent symptoms beyond 3 months warrant specialist referral [^116xHWJJ]. Recovery depends on adherence, severity, and comorbidities; **prognosis is favorable** with compliance [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Education should emphasize **adherence to therapy**, activity modification, and ergonomic adjustments [^115URABz]. Prevention focuses on regular strengthening, flexibility, and avoiding repetitive overhead motions.

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Persistent symptoms**: No improvement after 3 months of conservative care [^116xHWJJ].

- **Suspected tear**: Clinical suspicion of full-thickness rotator cuff tear [^notfound].

- **Calcific tendinitis**: Refractory cases requiring advanced interventions [^112WtkSN].

---

Right shoulder tendinitis is **managed conservatively** [^116wEz8W] with rest, NSAIDs, and physical therapy; reserve imaging and injections for refractory cases, and refer to orthopedics if there is no improvement after 3 months or if a tear is suspected [^114zHMg3].

### A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of various shoulder disorders [^111gH1tX]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) covering the management of common shoulder disorders.

Data Sources

A systematic search of CPGs on specific shoulder disorders was conducted up to August 2022 in relevant databases.

Study Selection

Twenty-six CPGs on rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy, RC tear, calcific tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis, glenohumeral (GH) instability, GH osteoarthritis, or acromioclavicular disorders published from January 2008 onward were screened and included.

Data Extraction

CPGs methodological quality was assessed with the AGREE II checklist. All recommendations from CPGs were extracted and categorized by shoulder disorder and care components (evaluation, diagnostic imaging, medical, rehabilitation, and surgical treatments). After semantic analysis of the terminology, recommendations for each shoulder disorders were classified by 2 reviewers into "recommended", "may be recommended", or "not recommended". Disagreements were resolved by discussion until reviewers reached consensus.

Data Synthesis

Only 12 CPGs (46%) were of high quality with major limitations related to the applicability and editorial independence of the guidelines. The initial evaluation of shoulder pain should include patient's history, subjective evaluation focused on red flags, and clinical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is usually not recommended to manage early shoulder pain, and recommendations for X-rays are conflicting. Acetaminophen, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and rehabilitation including exercises were recommended or may be recommended to treat all shoulder pain disorders. Guidelines on surgical management recommendations differed; for example, 6 CPGs reported that acromioplasty was recommended or may be recommended in chronic RC tendinopathy, whereas 4 CPGs did not recommend it.

Conclusions

Recommendations vary for diagnostic imaging, conservative vs surgical treatment to manage shoulder pain, although several care components are consensual. The development of evidence-based, rigorous CPGs with a valid methodology and transparent reporting is warranted to improve overall shoulder pain care.

### Radiologic course of the calcific deposits in calcific tendinitis of the shoulder: does the initial radiologic aspect affect the final results? [^111dF8eP]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Although conservative treatment is the first option for the treatment of calcific tendinitis, only a few reports have described its results, without documenting the radiologic changes over time of calcific deposits. We hypothesized that conservative treatment for calcific tendinitis of the shoulder would produce good clinical results in most patients and that the initial radiologic appearance of calcific deposits would not affect the final results.

Materials and Methods

The study enrolled 87 consecutive patients (92 shoulders) who were diagnosed with calcific tendinitis and underwent conservative treatment. The mean age at the time of first visit was 53.2 years. The mean follow-up period was 16.1 months.

Results

At the final follow-up, the Constant score increased to 83.64 points from a mean of 76.17 points at initial visit (P < .001). The score on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Rating Scale improved from 23.42 to 29.69 points (P < .001), and there were 7 excellent (8%), 59 good (64%), and 26 poor (28%) results. Eleven shoulders (12%) revealed complete resolution of calcific deposits; 46 (50%) decreased in size; 18 (20%) had no change in size; and 17 (18%) increased in size.

Discussion

Most patients in calcific tendinitis require treatment due to very severe shoulder pain, and conservative treatment may take precedence over operative treatment. Radiologic changes of calcific deposits report varying results depending on treatment methods. This study suggested that good radiologic results may be expected without performing special therapies.

Conclusion

Conservative treatment for calcific tendinitis of the shoulder showed clinically significant improvement, with 72% of excellent or good results regardless of the location, radiologic type and size, and initial symptoms of calcific deposits. By radiologic type, 46% of the calcific deposits had a tendency to become more cloudy and inhomogeneous than initial findings, and 62% presented complete resolution or decrease in the size.

### What's in a name? The case for using "Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain" in clinical practice [^116gazYw]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: In the absence of diagnostic accuracy (clinical and imaging), specific shoulder structures cannot be implicated as the definitive source of shoulder symptoms. Patients report that the (1) worst pain is unexplained pain, and (2) to engage in a treatment, the treatment must make sense. The diagnostic label, nonspecific shoulder pain does not tick either box: subacromial pain syndrome is confusing, and as nondescript as suprahumeral pain syndrome. The rotator cuff tendons are not the definitive and sole source of shoulder symptoms, which calls into question the validity of terms such as tendinopathy, tendinosis, and tendinitis. The term rotator cuff-related shoulder pain was the overwhelming first choice in a recent global survey of clinicians, and here, we make the case for its clinical use.

### Which method is more effective in treatment of calcific tendinitis in the shoulder? Prospective randomized comparison between ultrasound-guided needling and extracorporeal shock wave therapy [^115LMVig]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Ultrasound (US)-guided needling with subacromial corticosteroid injection is more effective than extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for function restoration and pain relief in patients with calcific tendinitis of the shoulder.

Methods

Fifty-four patients diagnosed with unilateral painful calcific tendinitis were randomly allocated to a US needling or ESWT group. The US needling group underwent US-guided needling and received a subacromial corticosteroid injection. The ESWT group received ESWT 3 times a week. All patients were prospectively evaluated; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog scale for pain scores were recorded before the procedure and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and the last follow-up. The size and morphology of the deposits were evaluated by radiography.

Results

The average follow-up period was 23.0 months. At last follow-up, the mean size of the deposits was significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.001); it decreased to 0.5 mm from 14.8 mm in the US needling group and to 5.6 mm from 11.0 mm in the ESWT group. There were also significant improvements in clinical outcomes in both groups after treatment (P < .05). At 1-year follow-up, the US needling group had significantly better scores than the ESWT group with regard to the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons assessment (90.3 and 74.6, respectively; p = 0.001), Simple Shoulder Test (83.3 and 70.8, respectively; p = 0.015), and visual analog scale for pain (1.4 and 3.3, respectively; p = 0.003). The initial calcium deposit sizes and clinical outcomes were weakly correlated in both groups (P > .05).

Conclusion

Both treatment modalities for calcific tendinitis improved clinical outcomes and eliminated calcium deposits. US-guided needling treatment, however, was more effective in function restoration and pain relief in the short term.

### An algorithmic approach to the management of shoulder instability [^111WTFaX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Evaluation

A full history and physical examination are essential components in the evaluation of a shoulder dislocation. With the former, it is important to gather how the injury occurred, how the shoulder was reduced, how many times the shoulder has dislocated in the past, the patient's goals, and the patient's age at first dislocation. Understanding this information sets the stage for the remainder of the clinical, radiographic, and surgical course of the patient. Provencher et allisted the following characteristics as risk factors for glenoid bone loss: high-energy mechanism of injury, arm abduction and extension at the time of initial dislocation, most instability occurring at midrange of motion (20° to 60° of abduction), instability during normal activities of daily living, and a long history of instability. In addition, care should be taken to rule out other shoulder pathology, such as fracture, rotator cuff tendinopathy, glenohumeral arthritis, and biceps tendinitis, particularly in patients older than 40 years. Finally, it is important to consider the timing of a physical examination relative to the time of injury. An examination in the acute setting can be confused by global pain and inflammation, and thus, allowing a patient to recover for a few days before examination may enhance its accuracy.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^116oVLdD]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy clinical practice guideline — scope and definitions: The guideline targets adults with shoulder pain with suspected rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy and provides recommendations covering the assessment and prognosis, nonsurgical medical care and rehabilitation, and return to function and sport for elite and recreational athletes; it also addresses cases with RC tendinopathy with or without calcifications and partial-thickness RC tears. Background notes that RC disorders account for more than half of shoulder conditions, the RC comprises the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor, and the term RC calcific tendinopathy is used when a calcific deposit within the tendon is confirmed. The document highlights gaps in usual care, stating that initial diagnosis and treatment of RC disorders often do not follow evidence-based recommendations and that diagnoses of shoulder disorders commonly rely on the unnecessary use of diagnostic imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), driving additional costs, treatment delays, and potential overmedicalization.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zG3Nk]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

Based on the results of our initial scoping review and subsequent stakeholder workshops, we included outcomes that assessed six domains: (1) disability, (2) physical function capacity (PFC), (3) function, (4) pain (on loading/activity, over a specified time or without further specification), (5) quality of life and (6) range of motion (ROM) (shoulder joint only). Definitions of each domain and example tools are presented in online supplemental file 3.

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs where at least one intervention arm comprised an exercise therapy that could be categorised according to the therapy classes outlined.

Context

The context included primary care, secondary care or community locations in nations defined as very high or high on the Human Development Index (top 62 countries at the time of protocol development) for the findings to be relevant to the UK context.

Exclusion criteria

In addition to coding treatment arm interventions according to exercise criteria, we also coded non-active (eg, wait-and-see, placebo and sham) and non-exercise (eg, electrotherapy, biomechanics, manual therapy, injection therapy and surgery) categories according to preset definitions (online supplemental file 4). Where any of the non-active or non-exercise categories could be assigned to a treatment arm intervention, these were excluded from the review.

### Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff: management options [^112zdczF]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff tendons is a common cause of shoulder pain in adults and typically presents as activity-related shoulder pain. It is thought to be an active, cell-mediated process, although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. Nonsurgical management continues to be the mainstay of treatment; most patients improve with modalities such as oral anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections. Several options are available for patients who fail nonsurgical treatment, including extracorporeal shock wave therapy, ultrasound-guided needle lavage, and surgical débridement. These modalities alleviate pain by eliminating the calcific deposit, and several recent studies have demonstrated success with the use of these treatment options. Surgical management options include arthroscopic procedures to remove calcific deposits and subacromial decompression; however, the role of subacromial decompression and repair of rotator cuff defects created by removing these deposits remains controversial.

### How does surgery compare to sham surgery or physiotherapy as a treatment for tendinopathy? A systematic review of randomised trials [^114kPPvw]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the ' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses'(PRISMA) guidelines (figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram of included studies. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design and compared surgery to any mode of non-surgical management for any type of tendinopathy in terms of at least one of the following outcomes: 'pain', 'function', 'ROM', 'force/strength', 'patient satisfaction', 'treatment success', 'QoL', 'complications'. Non-randomised observational studies, case reports, case series and literature reviews were excluded. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Studies including patients with full tendon tears were excluded. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of conservative treatment and follow-up. Language criterion was not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL in March 2018, with the following Boolean operators: '(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR tendonitis OR tennis elbow OR jumper's knee OR lateral elbow tendinopathy OR lateral epicondylitis OR rotator cuff disease OR shoulder impingement OR patellar OR Achilles) AND (surgery OR surgical management OR surgical treatment OR tenotomy OR open surgery OR arthroscopic surgery) AND (conservative management OR conservative treatment OR physiotherapy OR eccentric exercises OR eccentric strengthening OR stretching OR shock-wave therapy OR ESWT OR extracorporeal shock wave therapy OR ultrasound OR iontophoresis OR laser OR LLLT OR polidocanol OR sclerotherapy OR botox OR botulinum toxin OR GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin OR corticosteroid injections OR platelet rich plasma OR PRP OR autologous blood OR sham surgery)'.

Medical Subject Heading terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^115gBQRu]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy (RC) diagnosis — imaging use and patient communication includes the following directives: Clinicians should not prescribe or recommend diagnostic imaging tests to confirm an RC tendinopathy in the initial management of an adult with shoulder pain. Clinicians may recommend or prescribe diagnostic imaging test(s) for adults with an RC tendinopathy if symptoms do not resolve or improve within a maximum of 12 weeks of appropriate nonsurgical management. Clinicians must consider the following factors when choosing a diagnostic imaging test: suspected pathologies, diagnostic properties, accessibility, and costs of the diagnostic test. Clinicians should prioritize diagnostic ultrasound because of its lower cost and its diagnostic properties being similar to MRI to confirm an RC disorder. Clinicians should inform the adult with shoulder pain of the diagnostic value and limitations of the various imaging tests, and should also discuss diagnostic imaging test results with the patient.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^114zHMg3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — diagnostic imaging use and referral thresholds: Clinicians should not prescribe or recommend a diagnostic imaging test to confirm rotator cuff tendinopathy in the initial management of an adult with shoulder pain. Clinicians may recommend or prescribe diagnostic imaging test(s) for adults with rotator cuff tendinopathy if symptoms do not resolve or improve within a maximum of 12 weeks of appropriate nonsurgical management, and clinicians must consider suspected pathologies, diagnostic properties, accessibility, and costs when choosing a test. Clinicians must prioritize diagnostic ultrasound because of its lower cost and its diagnostic properties being similar to magnetic resonance imaging for confirming a rotator cuff disorder. Clinicians should refer adults with rotator cuff tendinopathy who have severe and persistent pain and/or disability despite a maximum of 12 weeks of appropriate nonsurgical care to a musculoskeletal physician specialist such as a primary care sports physician, a physiatrist, or an orthopedic surgeon for further assessment and treatment.

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^116wEz8W]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is common, with approximately 1% of adults aged 45 years and older presenting to primary care services with a new episode of shoulder pain each year, accounting for 2.4% of all general practitioner (GP) consultations in the UK. Disorders of the rotator cuff are the most common cause, accounting for 70% of cases. Rotator cuff disorders are often associated with substantial and persistent disability and pain and approximately half of patients continue to have pain or functional limitations for up to 2 years. Most problems with shoulder pain are managed in primary care by physiotherapists and GPs. The aim of treatment is to improve pain and shoulder function. Treatment options include rest, advice, analgesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, exercise, manual therapy, and corticosteroid injections.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

A Cochrane review published in 2016 highlighted insufficient evidence about the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders despite the treatment's widespread provision. Evidence from several small trials with short-term follow-up also raised uncertainty about which types of exercise and delivery mechanisms were associated with best outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to identify new evidence relevant to the GRASP (Getting it Right: Addressing Shoulder Pain) trial (date of last search June 30, 2020; see appendix p 20 for search terms). From an initial 2354 records, we identified seven trials published between 2013 and 2020, comparing the effects of supervised exercise versus unsupervised exercise, or no intervention, in people with a rotator cuff disorder (excluding those who required surgery). The quality of trials was variable and considerable heterogeneity meant we could not combine data from studies. All trials were small apart from two moderate sized trials. Only two of the seven trials reported on the effect of exercise on shoulder pain and function at 12 months. Most of the trials concluded that little or no difference existed between supervised and unsupervised exercise at 6 and 12 months, with the exception of the SUPPORT trial, which showed a benefit of supervised exercise compared with an exercise leaflet at 6 months but not at 12 months. At the time of planning the GRASP trial, a systematic review showed that in comparison with placebo, corticosteroid injection had short-term benefit for treating patients with tendinopathy, although uncertainty existed regarding the injection's use in patients with rotator cuff disorders. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry to identify new evidence relevant to the GRASP trial (date of last search June 30, 2020; see appendix p 20 for search terms). From an initial 794 records, we identified one small trial (n = 50) comparing the effects of corticosteroid injection versus no injection in patients with a rotator cuff tear, which found no difference in shoulder pain and function when analysed at 3 months or 6 months. We identified an additional ten trials comparing the effects of corticosteroid injection with placebo injection, of which four were judged as suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. The remaining trials could not be included because of either incomplete or incompatible outcome data. In these trials, corticosteroid injection showed a benefit over placebo in the short term but not the medium term for shoulder pain and function. No trials provided outcome data beyond 6-month follow-up and none reported any serious adverse events as a result of injection.

### Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder [^117PjgbK]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder is a process involving calcium deposition commonly in the rotator cuff tendons. It is a cell-mediated process that is often chronic in nature, but it is usually self-limiting with regard to its acute pain states. Nonoperative management is still the treatment of choice and is successful in up to 90% of patients. When conservative measures fail, a needling technique or surgical removal may be indicated; the trend is toward arthroscopic management. Acromioplasty should not be performed without radiographic signs of impingement. If a resulting large rotator cuff defect is found after removal of the calcific deposit, it may be worthwhile to close the defect arthroscopically with suture to prevent cuff tear progression and to promote healing.

### Diagnosis and treatment of biceps tendinitis and tendinosis [^1133Lhh1]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Biceps tendinitis is inflammation of the tendon around the long head of the biceps muscle. Biceps tendinosis is caused by degeneration of the tendon from athletics requiring overhead motion or from the normal aging process. Inflammation of the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove, which is known as primary biceps tendinitis, occurs in 5 percent of patients with biceps tendinitis. Biceps tendinitis and tendinosis are commonly accompanied by rotator cuff tears or SLAP (superior labrum anterior to posterior) lesions. Patients with biceps tendinitis or tendinosis usually complain of a deep, throbbing ache in the anterior shoulder. Repetitive overhead motion of the arm initiates or exacerbates the symptoms. The most common isolated clinical finding in biceps tendinitis is bicipital groove point tenderness with the arm in 10 degrees of internal rotation. Local anesthetic injections into the biceps tendon sheath may be therapeutic and diagnostic. Ultrasonography is preferred for visualizing the overall tendon, whereas magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography arthrography is preferred for visualizing the intra-articular tendon and related pathology. Conservative management of biceps tendinitis consists of rest, ice, oral analgesics, physical therapy, or corticosteroid injections into the biceps tendon sheath. Surgery should be considered if conservative measures fail after three months, or if there is severe damage to the biceps tendon.

### Editorial commentary: is magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder ever appropriate in evaluating patients with calcific tendinopathy of the rotator cuff? [^112MsoUG]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Calcific tendinopathy of the rotator cuff is a common pathology that often presents with clinical symptoms simulating a rotator cuff tear. The reported incidence of rotator cuff tear in the setting of calcific tendinopathy varies widely; however, the reported incidence of full-thickness rotator cuff tear on imaging in calcific tendinopathy is consistently low (< 5%). In patients with symptomatic calcific tendinopathy, initial conservative management followed by minimally invasive treatments should be employed prior to performing shoulder magnetic resonance imaging to assess for a rotator cuff tear. A shoulder magnetic resonance imaging may be performed for preoperative planning prior to surgical removal of calcium deposits, but even in this patient population, the incidence of full-thickness rotator cuff tear is low.

### Sulindac [^1127z7JH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of sulindac tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use sulindac tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with sulindac tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Sulindac tablets should be administered orally twice a day with food. The maximum dosage is 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended.

In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended starting dosage is 150 mg twice a day. The dosage may be lowered or raised depending on the response.

A prompt response (within one week) can be expected in about one-half of patients with osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Others may require longer to respond.

In acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis, the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced according to the response. In acute painful shoulder, therapy for 7–14 days is usually adequate. In acute gouty arthritis, therapy for 7 days is usually adequate.

Incidence between 3% and 9%. Those reactions occurring in 1% to 3% of patients are not marked with an asterisk.

### Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy: a final review of a randomised controlled trial at a minimum follow-up of ten years [^116w4PQj]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.

Patients and Methods

This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88 women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability, working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding the final assessment.

Results

A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean 12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures. Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol: operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were found.

Conclusion

The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo, the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115L97t6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis is part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research; Health Technology Assessment 129 388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies. The inclusion criteria were influenced by the project aims, the results of our initial scoping review mapping the exercise and tendinopathy literature, as well as stakeholder workshops. The overall structure of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to address effectiveness were registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020168187) and individual full protocols made publicly available prior to any analyses. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 statement with checklist provided in online supplemental file 1.

Protocol deviations

Multiple protocol deviations occurred due to pragmatic considerations and reflecting on processes from previous work packages in the larger project. Originally, it was intended to extract data not in duplicate but to quantify reliability based on a random 10% sample. Given the large number of reviewers extracting data it was decided to perform extraction in duplicate with agreement following differences when required. Originally, it was intended to conduct risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental studies. As outlined in the following sections, due to pragmatic considerations Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool was used for both randomised and non-randomised designs.

Stakeholder involvement

People with lived experience of exercise for tendinopathy were involved in all stages of the review, from inception to dissemination activities, and were recruited via National Health Service (NHS) public involvement networks and social media. Two people who had received exercise for Achilles tendinopathy and rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP) in NHS and private settings contributed to the design stage by influencing the review questions. One of these people (female, RCRSP) went on to contribute to the oversight committee throughout the review and assisted with reviewing dissemination materials. We also held a stakeholder workshop to inform the direction of the review; four females with lived experience of RCRSP or patellar tendinopathy, including one high performance athlete, took part. We had anticipated greater public involvement; timing of activities (during COVID-19 lockdown) and conducting them solely online may be contributing factors. Nonetheless, contributions were helpful in informing the review.

### Surgical options for patients with shoulder pain [^114udJjH]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in the community, which can arise from diverse causes. Regardless of the cause, mild cases can often be effectively treated conservatively, with options including rest, physiotherapy, pain relief and glucocorticoid injections. If conservative strategies fail after a 3–6 month period then surgery might be considered. Generally, the proportion of patients with shoulder pain who require surgery is small. When surgery is considered, a clear diagnosis and structural information from imaging are required. The indications for surgery, and success rate, depend on the specific diagnosis as well as on the individual clinical presentation. Evidence from case series suggest that surgical interventions for shoulder pain are effective when used appropriately. This article outlines the surgical management of the most common painful conditions that affect the shoulder, including impingement, rotator cuff tear, frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and calcific tendonitis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic shoulder pain: 2022 update [^117PhepF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic shoulder pain is an extremely common presenting complaint. Potential pain generators include the rotator cuff tendons, biceps tendon, labrum, glenohumeral articular cartilage, acromioclavicular joint, bones, suprascapular and axillary nerves, and the joint capsule/synovium. Radiographs are typically the initial imaging study obtained in patients with chronic shoulder pain. Further imaging may often be required, with modality chosen based on patient symptoms and physical examination findings, which may lead the clinician to suspect a specific pain generator. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Editorial commentary: platelet-rich plasma injections produced a significant improvement in most patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy [^112XgTDm]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous blood product containing a high concentration of platelets, growth factors, and cytokines, which basic science studies have shown may improve tendinopathy. However, there is controversy over its clinical efficacy with randomized controlled trials and subsequent meta-analysis finding mixed results when treating shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy. The effect of leukocyte concentration on PRP has been shown to be paramount, with different concentrations being favored for different pathologies. In those with tendinopathy, it is unclear whether leukocyte-rich or leukocyte-poor PRP is superior. Recent research shows that PRP injections produced a significant improvement in most patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy. However, improvement in symptoms and functional outcomes is worse in patients who have a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear compared with isolated tendinopathy without a partial tear. PRP may be more advantageous than corticosteroids. Both function as anti-inflammatories, but PRP may be potentially anabolic, whereas as corticosteroids have a catabolic effect on tendons, which may reduce repairability if patients proceed with surgery. Additionally, there are higher infection rates if patients ultimately go on to surgery within 3 months after corticosteroid injections. Ultimately, we must refine the indications for best use for PRP shoulder injections and determine the 5 R's: right patient, right drug, right dose, right route, and right time. Finally, we must remember that patients can first try conservative management, including physical therapy.

### Is ultrasound-guided lavage an effective intervention for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy? A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113DdKey]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is highly prevalent, and among musculoskeletal disorders, it is the third most common reason for visiting a primary care physician. One common shoulder disorder resulting in pain and loss of function is rotator cuff (RC) calcific tendinopathy. The estimated prevalence of RC calcific deposit is of 7.8% in asymptomatic adults and of 42.5% in adults with subacromial pain syndrome. The prevalence is higher in middle-age adults and in women.RC calcific tendinopathy is characterised by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in one of the RC tendons, most commonly the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons.RC calcific tendinopathy is often classified into three stages which are precalcific, calcific and postcalcific stagesand the time course of these different stages can evolve within a few months to several years.

Initial conservative treatment of RC calcific tendinopathy consists of physiotherapy including an exercise programmeand may also include therapeutic ultrasound. Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can also be prescribed for pain management. If initial conservative treatment fails, other treatments may be prescribed, as a second-line treatment, such as corticosteroid injections or shockwave therapy. Arthroscopic debridement may be considered only in severe chronic recalcitrant cases.

Ultrasound-guided lavage (US-guided lavage), as a second-line treatment, has gained popularity in the last decades. US-guided lavage is a minimally invasive intervention consisting in the introduction of a needle into the calcific deposit. A saline and/or an anaesthetic solution is then injected into the calcification with several short injections, each followed by release of pressure on the plunger to allow the solution and calcific material to evacuate back into the syringe.US-guided lavage is often followed by a subacromial corticosteroid injection. Although several studies have investigated the use of US-guided lavage, it is unclear whether this intervention has beneficial effects compared with conventional interventions. There is a lack of standardisation in the definition of the US-guided lavage intervention. Most reviews on US-guided lavage also included needle fragmentation without lavage.US-guided needle fragmentation is a procedure that is similar to US-guided lavage; however, it does not include the lavage procedure and may not be as efficient for calcification removal. Pooling of US-guided lavage and needle fragmentation without lavage is then debatable since those two interventions are different.

### Diagnosing, managing, and supporting return to work of adults with rotator cuff disorders: a clinical practice guideline [^116ARMEa]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical practice guideline covering the assessment, management, and return to work of adults with rotator cuff disorders. DESIGN: Clinical practice guideline. METHODS: Using systematic reviews, appraisal of the literature, and an iterative approach to obtain consensus from key stakeholders, clinical recommendations and algorithms were developed in the context of the health care system and work environment of the province of Quebec (Canada). RESULTS: Recommendations (n = 73) and clinical decision algorithms (n = 3) were developed to match the objectives. The initial assessment should include the patient's history, a subjective assessment, and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging is only necessary in select circumstances. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and injection therapies may be useful to reduce pain in the short term. Clinicians should prescribe an active and task-oriented rehabilitation program (exercises and education) to reduce pain and disability in adults with rotator cuff disorders. Subacromial decompression is not recommended to treat rotator cuff tendinopathy. Surgery is appropriate for selected patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. A return-to-work plan should be developed early, in collaboration with the worker and other stakeholders, and must combine multiple strategies to promote return to work. CONCLUSION: This clinical practice guideline was developed to assist the multidisciplinary team of clinicians who provide health care for adults with a rotator cuff disorder.

### Musculoskeletal ultrasound: how to treat calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff by ultrasound-guided single-needle lavage technique [^1165Ctod]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this video article is to illustrate the ultrasound appearance of calcium deposition in the rotator cuff and provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for performing the ultrasound-guided single-needle lavage technique for the treatment of calcific tendinitis with emphasis on patient positioning, necessary supplies, real-time lavage technique, and steroid injection into the subacromial subdeltoid bursa.

Conclusion

Musculoskeletal ultrasound is well established as a safe, cost-effective imaging tool in diagnosing and treating common musculoskeletal disorders. Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff is a common disabling cause of shoulder pain. Although most cases are self-limiting, a subset of patients is refractory to conservative therapy and requires treatment intervention. Ultrasound-guided lavage is an effective and safe minimally-invasive treatment not readily offered in the United States as an alternative to surgery, perhaps because of the limited prevalence of musculoskeletal ultrasound programs and limited training. On completion of this video article, the participant should be able to develop an appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for the treatment of calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff using ultrasound.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this review include the use of four important databases, a thorough search strategy and the use of the validated Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. However, this review also has limitations. The small sample size and the high risk of bias of two of the three articles are two important limitations of this review which limits the strength of our conclusions. Our meta-analysis only includes two RCTs, with the analysis heavily based on one RCT. The absence of comparison with a conservative treatment involving physical therapy with an exercise programme is another limitation of this systematic review.

### Classification of distinct tendinopathy subtypes for precision therapeutics [^116M2jgZ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Tendinopathy is a term used to describe a complex, multi-faceted tendon pathology characterized by pain and a dysfunctional joint condition, resulting in long-term or permanent deficits in tendon function. Up to 30% of general musculoskeletal consultations in primary care involve tendinopathy cases. Rotator cuff tendinopathy is the most common type of tendinopathy, and is a major cause of shoulder pain, with up to half of the general population experiencing shoulder pain on at least one occasion per year. The pathology of tendinopathy is complex and diverse, which is manifested as disordered fiber arrangement and destruction of fiber structures, along with increased cellularity in some parts and decreased cellularity in other parts of the diseased tissue. Other pathological changes such as cartilaginous metaplasia, ossification, increased blood vessels, and fat infiltration are also observed.

Clinical treatment modalities for tendinopathy often elicit heterogeneous responses. The specific choice of treatment modality depends on the severity of tendinopathy, which is categorized into surgical or conservative treatment. Surgery is considered for severe tendinopathy. However, surgery has often yielded less than satisfactory results with considerable heterogeneity, and failure rates range from 11% to 94%. Various intrinsic factors, such as age, tear size, muscle atrophy, fat infiltration, and retraction of tendons could diminish the beneficial effects of surgery.

Conservative treatment modalities also often elicit heterogeneous drug responses. These methods can be employed to alleviate symptoms in patients with mild conditions. For instance, glucocorticoids have been widely used in tendon-related diseases, but their use remains a controversial issue. Glucocorticoid therapy may not improve the prognosis, and, in some cases, may even prove to be detrimental. However, some studies have suggested that glucocorticoid injections can alleviate pain and improve joint function, without increasing the risk of tendon re-tearing. Currently, the classification of tendinopathy is primarily based on factors such as onset time, clinical symptoms, and the size and morphology of tear ruptures. These classification methods are not a reliable guide for the selection of clinical drugs. Commonly utilized one size fits all treatment strategies have resulted in variable therapeutic efficacy among different tendinopathy subtypes. Accurately diagnosing and selecting appropriate patients for targeted treatment is expected to improve the current state of tendinopathy therapy.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^114dsBcJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The ever-expanding arsenal of treatment regimes for tendinopathy can be overwhelming to the treating healthcare professional. New treatments continuously emerge and so do research studies that aim to assess their effectiveness. The most powerful tool that evidence-based medicine has to offer remains systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which constitute the highest level of evidence and are therefore often used to inform guidelines and guide clinical practice.

Unlike a narrative review, which is purely a summary of a proportion of (or all) the available studies on a given topic without assessing the quality of the included evidence, an SR is expected to include all the relevant evidence which is comprehensively and thoroughly appraised and presented with qualitative or quantitative syntheses and accompanying strengths of evidence. For reliable, clinically relevant conclusions to be reached, the potential limitations of the included studies need to be considered. What determines the 'quality' of a study remains poorly defined but should relate to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis and presentation are appropriate to answer its research question. Generally, study quality assessment includes a combined assessment of its internal validity (freedom from bias), external validity (generalisability/applicability) and precision (freedom from random error)(online supplemental figure 1). The Cochrane group, which produce some of the highest quality SRs, recommend emphasising the internal validity when assessing the quality of a study, reflected by the risk-of-bias assessment (RoB) tool they have produced. However, external validity and precision should not be overlooked.

Assessing the strength of evidence (also known as 'certainty', 'quality', 'level' or 'grade' of evidence) is closely interlinked with RoB assessment and is a process which is commonly overlooked by many SRs. Together with a meticulous methodology and comprehensive RoB assessment, this is what distinguishes a SR from other types of review articles. Assigning a strength of evidence to a finding is as important as the finding itself. Strength of evidence should accompany every assessed outcome measure within an SR for every assessed follow-up time period. A result with a low strength of evidence differs substantially from that with a high level of evidence in terms of its applicability to clinical practice; further research is likely to change the former but not the latter. Equally, the strength of evidence can be high in an outcome measure and low in another, and high for a certain follow-up but period and low for another.

### Surgery or conservative treatment for rotator cuff tear: a meta-analysis [^1179uVwJ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Comparative evidence on treating rotator cuff tear is inconclusive. The objective of this review was to evaluate the evidence on effectiveness of tendon repair in reducing pain and improving function of the shoulder when compared with conservative treatment of symptomatic rotator cuff tear.

Method

Search on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and Pedro databases. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing surgery and conservative treatment of rotator cuff tear. Study selection and extraction based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions. Random effects meta-analysis.

Results

Three identified RCTs involved 252 participants (123 cases and 129 controls). The risk of bias was considered low for all three RCTs. For Constant score, statistically insignificant effect size was 5.6 (95% CI -0.41 to 11.62) points in 1-year follow up favouring surgery and below the level of minimal clinically important difference. The respective difference in pain reduction was -0.93 (95% CI -1.65 to -0.21) cm on a 0–10 pain visual analogue scale favouring surgery. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.012) in 1-year follow up but below the level of minimal clinically important difference.

Conclusion

There is limited evidence that surgery is not more effective in treating rotator cuff tear than conservative treatment alone. Thus, a conservative approach is advocated as the initial treatment modality. Implications for Rehabilitation There is limited evidence that surgery is not more effective in treating rotator cuff tear than conservative treatment alone. There was no clinically significant difference between surgery and active physiotherapy in 1-year follow-up in improving Constant score or reducing pain caused by rotator cuff tear. As physiotherapy is less proneness to complications and less expensive than surgery, a conservative approach is advocated as the initial treatment modality to rotator cuff tears.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^114J8iws]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Pathoanatomical features of rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — shoulder biomechanics and symptoms: The shoulder is the most mobile joint of the human body, and components of the shoulder must operate in a synergy to ensure an adequate balance between mobility and stability; those components include passive and active structures supported by the sensorimotor system, and together those structures form the acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, and glenohumeral joints, as well as the scapulothoracic joint, a pseudo joint. Notably, (2/3) of the movement occurs at the glenohumeral joint while the scapulothoracic joint allows for the remaining movement, and RC tendinopathy is mostly associated with pain, usually during arm elevation and external rotation, but pain can also occur during sleep or rest in more irritable presentations.

### Long-term course of shoulders after ultrasound therapy for calcific tendinitis: results of the 10-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^1114TwPw]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to follow both the structure- and function-related long-term course of shoulders that had been treated with therapeutic ultrasound for symptomatic calcific tendinitis.

Design

This is a long-term follow-up of 45 shoulders (37 patients) that had been treated for symptomatic calcific tendinitis with either a series of ultrasound or sham ultrasound 10 yrs ago. The main outcome variables were presence of calcium deposits and subacromial impingement on standardized x-ray imaging, shoulder symptoms (Binder score), and function (Constant score).

Results

At 10 yrs, a similar proportion of calcium deposits had resolved in 78% of the originally ultrasound treated compared with 83% of sham-treated shoulders, whereas at 9 mos, significantly more calcium deposits had been resolved in the ultrasound group (P = 0.045). Relative to baseline, shoulder symptoms and function had significantly improved at both the 10-yr and 9-mo follow-up examinations with no significant differences between groups. Regular sports performance at baseline predicted a favorable long-term outcome.

Conclusions

Symptomatic calcific tendinitis of the shoulder has a good likelihood to completely resolve in the long term. Treating the calcium deposit effectively, however, may not be causal to the recovery from symptoms and function in calcific tendinitis.

The patient was a 25-year-old male college student with a chief complaint of right shoulder pain. The patient was initially diagnosed with bicipital tendinitis by his physician and had been treated for 4 weeks by a physical therapist. However, his symptoms did not improve and he was unable to return to his preinjury activity levels, so he sought the services of another physical therapist for a second opinion. Due to concern for a labrum tear, the physical therapist referred the patient to an orthopaedic surgeon. Magnetic resonance arthrography revealed findings consistent with a superior labrum anterior-to-posterior tear.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic painful shoulder: review of nonsurgical interventions [^113NtLNA]. Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic painful shoulder is a common complaint, yet its initial pathogenesis may have multiple etiologies as well as multiple and perhaps distinct primary or secondary etiologies responsible for its final clinical presentation. While the clinical presentation of pain and limitation of motion is easily defined, there are no standardized criteria for the differential diagnosis of various chronic shoulder pain syndromes, much less a consensus on their treatment. At present, there are limited nonsurgical options and medications approved for the treatment of chronic painful shoulder, and, with limited exceptions, there are no definitive conclusions about the efficacy of these therapies based on controlled clinical studies reported in the literature. There is a clear clinical need for local nonsurgical treatments that are safe and effective for chronic painful conditions. In this article, an attempt is made to review the diagnoses associated with chronic shoulder pain and some of the limited data that exist so as to suggest a therapeutic algorithm.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Moxifloxacin Tablets, USP

(mox"I flox' asin)

Read the Medication Guide that comes with moxifloxacin tablets before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about moxifloxacin tablets?

Moxifloxacin tablet belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. Moxifloxacin tablets can cause side effects that can happen at the same time and could result in death. If you get any of the following serious side effects, you should stop taking Moxifloxacin tablets and get medical help right away. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should continue to take moxifloxacin tablets.

Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis).

Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take moxifloxacin tablets. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Symptoms of tendon problems may include:
Pain, swelling, tears and inflammation of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites.
The risk of getting tendon problems while you take moxifloxacin tablets is higher if you:
Are over 60 years of age
Are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
Have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take moxifloxacin tablets.
Other reasons that can increase your risk of tendon problems can include:
Physical activity or exercise
Kidney failure
Tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Stop taking moxifloxacin tablets immediately and call your healthcare provider right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. Stop taking moxifloxacin tablets until tendinitis or tendon rupture has been ruled out by your healthcare provider. Avoid exercise and using the affected area. The most common area of pain and swelling is in the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons.
Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk of tendon rupture with continued use of moxifloxacin tablets. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking moxifloxacin tablets. Tendon ruptures can happen within hours or days after taking moxifloxacin tablets and have happened up to several months after patients have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Stop taking moxifloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
Hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
Bruising right after an injury in a tendon area
Unable to move the affected area or bear weight.

3. **Miscellaneous**: Ganglion, Tendinitis, Epicondylitis. In the treatment of conditions such as tendinitis or tenosynovitis, care should be taken following application of a suitable antiseptic to the overlying skin to inject the suspension into the tendon sheath rather than into the substance of the tendon. The tendon may be readily palpated when placed on a stretch. When treating conditions such as epicondylitis, the area of greatest tenderness should be outlined carefully and the suspension infiltrated into the area. For ganglia of the tendon sheaths, the suspension is injected directly into the cyst. In many cases, a single injection causes a marked decrease in the size of the cystic tumor and may effect disappearance. The usual sterile precautions should be observed, of course, with each injection.

The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures listed above varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 mg to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.

4. Injections for Local Effect in Dermatologic Conditions. Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 mg to 60 mg is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 mg to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. Care should be taken to avoid injection of sufficient material to cause blanching since this may be followed by a small slough. One to four injections are usually employed, the intervals between injections varying with the type of lesion being treated and the duration of improvement produced by the initial injection.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaShoulder pain-atraumatic [^117FzpB3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain is one of the most common reasons for musculoskeletal-related physician visits. Imaging plays an important role in identifying the specific cause of atraumatic shoulder pain. This review is divided into two parts. The first part provides a general discussion of various imaging modalities (radiographs, arthrography, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, CT, and MRI) and their usefulness in evaluating atraumatic shoulder pain. The second part focuses on the most appropriate imaging algorithms for specific shoulder conditions including: rotator cuff disorders, labral tear/instability, bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, biceps tendon abnormalities, postoperative rotator cuff tears, and neurogenic pain. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Prognostic factors for the outcome of needle aspiration of calcific deposits for rotator cuff calcific tendinitis [^112vZZYx]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rotator cuff calcific tendinitis (RCCT) is a frequently diagnosed shoulder disease, which is found in up to 54% of patients with shoulder complaints. It is suggested that RCCT is a self-limiting disease that can be treated with conservative measures (rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or physiotherapy). However, a substantial number of patients has persisting symptoms requiring other therapies such as subacromial injections with corticosteroids, needle aspiration of calcific deposits (NACD), or extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). A recently published meta-analysis comparing these therapies concluded that NACD is the most effective treatment considering relevant clinical outcomes within a follow-up term of 2 years. However, up to 42% of patients experience persisting or recurrent shoulder complaints after NACD. Female gender, smoking, and type I calcifications according to the classification by Gärtner and Heyer are considered predictors for persisting shoulder complaints. However, the majority of studies investigating prognostic factors for the effectiveness of NACD are retrospective and, to our knowledge, no prospective studies investigating prognostic factors have been conducted. As more evidence is needed on this highly prevalent shoulder disease, we conducted a prospective cohort study to further identify prognostic factors for the effectiveness of NACD.

### Effect of resistance exercise dose components for tendinopathy management: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111mZibu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research (Health Technology Assessment 129388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies) and adhered to an a priori protocol (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020168187).

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria and methods were influenced by the project aims, the results of an initial scoping reviewand two subsequent stakeholder workshops (n = 13). The first included nine individuals who delivered exercise therapy for tendinopathy and had an academic interest. The second included four women with lived experience. Finally, an online survey (n = 26) was conducted to gather the views of a more diverse international sample of purposefully selected clinicians and academics. A completed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis checklist for reporting of systematic reviews can be found in online supplemental file 1. The inclusion criteria were framed according to a modified PICOS (participant, intervention, comparator, outcomes, study type) approach which also included context.

Participants

This meta-analysis included people of any age or gender with a diagnosis of RCRSP, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration. Due to difficulty in diagnosing the patho-anatomical cause of shoulder painthe term RCRSP is defined here as pain, impaired movement and function of the shoulder from one or more structures (encompassing subacromial pain/impingement syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial bursitis). We included studies that described participants as having tendinopathy, SIS or RCRSP, thereby acknowledging that participants may have tendinopathy+/−involvement of other structures. Full thickness or large tears were excluded, for all tendinopathies. Trial authors' diagnoses were accepted where a clearly verifiable group of clinical features was reported including: pathognomonic location of pain; a symptom altering response to applied load and/or stretch, with there being a specific test for most tendinopathies; strategies to rule out differential diagnoses; ultrasound or MRI confirmation of structural change. Typically, a minimum of two clinical features were acceptable, however often more were reported. Data from studies with mixed groups were included where there was clear reporting of the tendinopathic group, or they comprised > 90% of the investigated cohort.

### Bempedoic acid and ezetimibe (Nexlizet) [^116HYHf6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2	Tendon Rupture

Bempedoic acid, a component of NEXLIZET, is associated with an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. In the primary hyperlipidemia trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], tendon rupture occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with bempedoic acid versus 0% of placebo-treated patients and involved the rotator cuff (the shoulder), biceps tendon, or Achilles tendon. Tendon rupture occurred within weeks to months of starting bempedoic acid. In the cardiovascular outcomes trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], tendon rupture events occurred in 1.2% of bempedoic acid-treated patients versus 0.9% of placebo-treated patients. Tendon rupture may occur more frequently in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid or fluoroquinolone drugs, in patients with renal failure, and in patients with previous tendon disorders.

Discontinue NEXLIZET immediately if the patient experiences rupture of a tendon. Consider discontinuing NEXLIZET if the patient experiences joint pain, swelling, or inflammation. Advise patients to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture and to contact their healthcare provider if tendinitis or tendon rupture symptoms occur. Consider alternative therapy in patients with a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^113ev2jV]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

CONSORT 2025: Introduction

Item 6: Scientific background and rationale

Example

"Most problems with shoulder pain are managed in primary care by physiotherapists and GPs [general practitioners]. Evidence from small, short-term trials suggests that physiotherapist-prescribed exercise is promising. However, a Cochrane review highlighted the insufficient evidence about the treatment's long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Despite widespread provision, uncertainty exists about which types of exercise and levels of physiotherapy supervision are associated with the best outcomes. This evidence is limited by problems in study design and lack of comparator groups. Progressive resistance training to improve muscular strength, whether supervised or home based, has been identified as a core component of exercise for patients with rotator cuff disorders. Subacromial corticosteroid injections are commonly used to reduce local tissue inflammation and pain. Compared with placebo, corticosteroid injections have short-term benefit in the shoulder, although the longer-term benefits and harms are not known. Corticosteroid injections are being used increasingly in clinical practice alongside physiotherapy for the management of people with rotator cuff disorders; hence justification for investigating corticosteroid injection in the GRASP (Getting it Right: Addressing Shoulder Pain) trial alongside physiotherapist-prescribed exercise".

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — corticosteroid injections: Corticosteroid injections may significantly reduce pain and disability in the short term (up to 8 weeks) when compared to a placebo or oral NSAIDs, and ultrasound-guided injections appear to offer greater reduction in pain and disability and may be preferred, if available. Recommendations #19 state that clinicians may recommend or perform corticosteroid injections to reduce pain and short-term disability in adults with RC tendinopathy, and clinicians should not recommend or perform corticosteroid injections as a first-line treatment to reduce pain and disability in adults with RC tendinopathy.

### Topical glyceryl trinitrate for the treatment of tendinopathies: a systematic review [^115wK9bi]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)guidelines.

Eligibility

Included studies were RCTs comparing at least one treatment group receiving topical GTN with a control group receiving either placebo or an alternative treatment. Studies with participants undergoing concurrent additional therapies were included only if both arms of the study received this additional treatment at the same frequency and intensity. Participants had to be over 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of treatment with, dosage and type of topical GTN used. Language criteria were not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and DB) independently via MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus in January 2018, with the following Boolean operators: '(GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin) AND (tendinopathy OR tendinitis OR tendinosis OR rotator cuff OR supraspinatus OR shoulder OR patellar OR Achilles OR lateral epicondylosis OR lateral epicondylitis OR lateral epicondylopathy OR tennis elbow)'. Medical Subject Headinngs (MeSH)terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search. Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking in Google Scholar was performed for each relevant article.

Screening

From an initial total of 106 articles that were independently identified by two reviewers (DC and DB), after exclusion of duplicate and non-eligible articles, title and abstract screening and addition of missed studies identified by review articles, reference list screening and citation tracking, 10 studies were found to fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Figure 1 illustrates the article screening process according to PRISMA guidelines.

Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)

Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients from birth to 17 years of age, for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure). The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)].

Plague

Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients from birth to 17 years of age, for treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague due to Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and prophylaxis for plague. Efficacy studies of ciprofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with pneumonic plague for feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals. The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1.8), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and CLINICAL STUDIES (14.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)].

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^112hQrRT]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

PROQUIN®XR (pro-kwin)

(ciprofloxacin hydrochloride

extended-release) Tablets

Read the Medication Guide that comes with Proquin®XR before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about Proquin XR?

Proquin®XR belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. Proquin®XR can cause side effects that may be serious or even cause death. If you get any of the following serious side effects, get medical help right away, and talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should continue to take Proquin®XR.

Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendonitis)

Tendons are the tough cords of tissue that connects muscles to bones.
Pain, swelling, inflammation of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites can happen in people of all ages who take fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including Proquin®XR. The risk of getting tendon problems is higher if you:
are over 60 years of age
are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Swelling of the tendon (tendonitis) and tendon rupture (breakage) have also happened in patients who take fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors.
Other reasons for tendon ruptures include:
physical activity or exercise
kidney failure
tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Call your healthcare provider right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation. Stop taking Proquin®XR until tendinitis or tendon rupture has been ruled out by your healthcare provider. Avoid exercise and using the affected area. The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons. Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk of tendon rupture with continued use of Proquin®XR. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking Proquin®XR. Tendon ruptures have happened up to several months after patients have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
bruising right after an incident in a tendon area
unable to move the affected area or bear weight
See the section " What are the possible side effects of Proquin XR? " for more information about side effects.

### The outcome of ultrasound-guided needle decompression and steroid injection in calcific tendinitis [^1134Sqx9]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Needle lavage is frequently performed before consideration of surgical removal in shoulders with calcific tendinitis because this may avoid surgery. However, its role in nonoperative treatment has not been fully investigated in terms of clinical and radiographic response. We hypothesized that needle decompression and subacromial steroid injection would show good clinical results in chronic calcific tendinitis patients.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-five shoulders in 30 consecutive patients with painful calcific tendinitis were treated by ultrasound-guided needle decompression and subacromial corticosteroid injection. Patients were prospectively evaluated using American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant scores at 1, 3, and 6 months after the intervention. Size and morphology of the calcific deposits were compared with those in baseline radiographs at each visit.

Results

At 6 months after the index procedure, 25 shoulders (71.4%) showed ASES and Constant score improvements from 48.0 and 53.7 to 84.6 and 87.9, respectively (P < .01). Ten shoulders (28.6%) showed no symptom relief at the last follow-up. In shoulders with pain improvement, the mean size of calcific deposits reduced from 13.6 to 5.6 mm (P < .01), and in shoulders with no pain improvement or that underwent operation, mean size was 13.1 mm at initial visits and 12.7 mm at final visits (P = 0.75).

Discussion

Shoulders showing little evidence of deposit size reduction at 6 months after needle decompression are less likely to achieve symptomatic improvement and may be considered as candidates for surgical removal.

Conclusion

Needle decompression with subacromial steroid injection is effective in 71.4% of calcific tendinitis within 6 months. The size of calcific deposits in patients that achieved symptom relief was reduced.

Rotator cuff

Rotator cuff tendinopathy encompasses several characteristic changes of the rotator cuff tendons from tendinopathy without macroscopic tendon discontinuity, through partial-thickness and full-thickness tears, to rotator cuff arthropathy.

Surgical treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy is applied after failed conservative treatment except in the case of a traumatic tendon tear where early surgical intervention is advocated. The interventions range from subacromial decompression in the case of therapy-resistant impingement and partial rotator cuff tears involving less than 50% of the tendon thickness, to tendon repair in the case of significant partial tears and rotator cuff tears, or tendon transfers when facing an irreparable tear; reverse shoulder prosthesis with or without tendon transfer may be applied in the case of rotator cuff arthropathy. In addition, the biceps tendon needs to be addressed with tenodesis or tenotomy when the biceps and its pulley system are affected.

Rotator cuff repair is a clinically very successful procedure, but healing occurs through scar tissue and often is incomplete. Despite the introduction of several innovative surgical techniques (eg, single row with several suture modifications, single row with triple loaded suture anchors, double row, triple row, suture bridge, transosseous and transosseous equivalent repair) aiming to optimise the mechanical construct and improve healing of rotator cuff tears, failure rates remain high, especially among large and massive tears. Recent literature does not support an advantage by the use of one specific technique based on clinical outcome scores or healing rate analysed by CT arthrogram and MRI. The tendon remains the weak link of the repair. Whereas some advocate the use of single row repair constructs in small rotator cuff tears and double-row repair in medium and large tears, others are concerned about the reports on medial failure of the repair construct following double-row techniques and increased costs associated with longer surgical time and higher implant costs ({Lorbach, 2012, p.1778}). Chronic rotator cuff tendon tears are accompanied by significant, irreversible deterioration of muscle quality which is decisive for the prognosis indicating timing of surgery to be essential.

Elbow

Well-conducted studies have failed to demonstrate a consistently successful operative treatment for epicondylalgia. The Cochrane database has not identified any surgical treatment as being effective. Current surgical treatments focus on one of two objectives: (1) removing the tendinosis tissue and/or repairing the originor (2) releasing the origin completely. Controlled resisted stress during the rehabilitation period is advocated.

### Chronic shoulder pain: part II. treatment [^111eKmjU]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic shoulder pain is a common problem in the primary care physician's office. Effective treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis of the more common etiologies: rotator cuff disorders, adhesive capsulitis, acromioclavicular osteoarthritis, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and instability. Activity modification and analgesic medications comprise the initial treatment in most cases. If this does not lead to improvement, or if the initial presentation is of sufficient severity, a trial of physical therapy that focuses on the specific diagnosis is indicated. Combined steroid and local anesthetic injections can be used alone or as an adjuvant to the physical therapy. The site of the injection (subacromial, acromioclavicular joint, or intra-articular) depends on the diagnosis. Injections into the glenohumeral joint should be done under fluoroscopic guidance. Symptoms that persist or worsen after six to 12 weeks of directed treatment should be referred to an orthopedic specialist.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on acute shoulder pain [^112zdXUm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The shoulder joint is a complex array of muscles, tendons, and capsuloligamentous structures that has the greatest freedom of motion of any joint in the body. Acute (< 2 weeks) shoulder pain can be attributable to structures related to the glenohumeral articulation and joint capsule, rotator cuff, acromioclavicular joint, and scapula. The foundation for investigation of acute shoulder pain is radiography. Magnetic resonance imaging is the procedure of choice for the evaluation of occult fractures and the shoulder soft tissues. Ultrasound, with appropriate local expertise, is an excellent evaluation of the rotator cuff, long head of the biceps tendon, and interventional procedures. Fluoroscopy is an excellent modality to guide interventional procedures. Computed tomography is an excellent modality for characterizing complex shoulder fractures. Computed tomographic arthrography or fluoroscopic arthrography may be alternatives in patients for whom MR arthrography is contraindicated. A multimodal approach may be required to accurately assess shoulder pathology. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Bempedoic acid (Nexletol) [^111Qs1wu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2	Tendon Rupture

NEXLETOL is associated with an increased risk of tendon rupture or injury. In the primary hyperlipidemia trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], tendon rupture occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with NEXLETOL versus 0% of placebo-treated patients and involved the rotator cuff (the shoulder), biceps tendon, or Achilles tendon. Tendon rupture occurred within weeks to months of starting NEXLETOL. In the cardiovascular outcomes trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], tendon rupture events occurred in 1.2% of NEXLETOL-treated patients versus 0.9% of placebo-treated patients. Tendon rupture may occur more frequently in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid or fluoroquinolone drugs, in patients with renal failure, and in patients with previous tendon disorders.

Discontinue NEXLETOL immediately if the patient experiences rupture of a tendon. Consider discontinuing NEXLETOL if the patient experiences joint pain, swelling, or inflammation. Advise patients to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture and to contact their healthcare provider if tendinitis or tendon rupture symptoms occur. Consider alternative therapy in patients with a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture.

### Acute calcific tendinitis of the wrist [^112sJg58]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute calcific tendinitis, a benign and self-limiting inflammatory condition commonly seen in the shoulder, is also described in many other tendons, including those in the hand and wrist. When involving the wrist, acute calcific tendinitis is often misdiagnosed and mistaken for infection.

Objective

We present this case to increase familiarity with this condition to avoid errors in diagnosis resulting in inappropriate treatment with antibiotics or even surgery.

Case Report

A 27-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a 2-week history of volar wrist pain, with sudden increase in pain associated with chills and new onset swelling and redness of the wrist. Plain radiographs showed characteristic soft-tissue calcification overlying the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon into the wrist. Treatment with ibuprofen and splinting resulted in complete symptom resolution.

Conclusion

Acute calcific tendinitis is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of acute wrist pain. Radiographs are helpful in confirming the diagnosis when symptoms and examination findings are characteristic.

### Rotator cuff disease [^113ZoDCM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The important role played by the rotator cuff in the stability and movement of the glenohumeral joint make it susceptible to damage and injury in patients of all age groups. A number of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms have been described for the development of rotator cuff disease, although it is more likely that the actual etiology in any one individual is multifactorial. The key to successful management in a particular patient is an accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause by thorough clinical examination and the use of appropriate investigations. The mainstay of treatment of patients with rotator cuff disease is nonoperative. Surgical intervention is usually considered only after failure of at least 6 months of conservative therapy. However, there are a few situations where early surgical intervention is indicated.
