## Question

A 32-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He is hypotensive, tachycardic, and has obvious signs of ongoing massive hemorrhage from multiple injuries. On arrival, the trauma team initiates airway and circulatory support. Laboratory tests are sent, and a massive transfusion protocol is activated. Initial labs show hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL, platelet count 110 x10^9/L, INR 1.6, and Clauss fibrinogen level 1.2 g/L. The trauma team is preparing to transfuse blood products and coagulation factors.

According to current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in coagulation support for this patient's major bleeding, and what is the rationale for your choice?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in coagulation support for a 32-year-old male with massive hemorrhage, hypotension, tachycardia, and laboratory evidence of coagulopathy, including INR 1.6 and fibrinogen 1.2 g/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this meets criteria for massive hemorrhage and trauma-induced coagulopathy. Then, I should verify the key laboratory abnormalities and their implications. Next, I will review guideline-endorsed initial strategies for coagulation support in massive transfusion. After that, I need to compare plasma-based versus fibrinogen concentrate–based approaches and decide which is most appropriate now. Finally, I will consider adjuncts like calcium, platelets, and tranexamic acid, and confirm dosing and monitoring priorities with references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Ongoing massive hemorrhage with hypotension and tachycardia in a trauma patient meets criteria for massive transfusion and raises concern for trauma-induced coagulopathy, which is common early after severe injury and worsens outcomes if uncorrected [^e8e83cd3] [^ec8b2037].

> I need to check the laboratory abnormalities and their significance. Hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL reflects acute blood loss, platelets 110 × 10^9/L is borderline low but not yet at critical thresholds, INR 1.6 indicates coagulation factor depletion or dilution, and fibrinogen 1.2 g/L is below the 1.5–2.0 g/L range associated with impaired clot strength and increased mortality in trauma, so fibrinogen repletion is a priority [^e8e83cd3] [^aa528d96].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about plasma-first resuscitation. I should review guideline-endorsed initial strategies. Contemporary European trauma guidelines recommend two acceptable early approaches: plasma-based resuscitation with FFP:RBC in at least a 1:2 ratio, or a factor concentrate–based approach using fibrinogen concentrate with RBC, with the choice tailored to availability and speed of coagulation testing; both are reasonable, but the latter allows faster correction of fibrinogen without the volume and thawing delays of plasma [^e8e83cd3] [^e14679d9] [^d630f21a].

> Wait, let me verify the practical drawbacks of plasma here. FFP requires thawing, which delays therapy, and large volumes can worsen dilutional coagulopathy and fluid overload; moreover, plasma alone may not reliably correct fibrinogen or clot function during active bleeding, whereas fibrinogen concentrate delivers a predictable, rapid increase in fibrinogen with minimal volume, which is advantageous in this scenario [^aa528d96] [^4c44fa40].

> I should confirm the rationale for prioritizing fibrinogen. Trauma-induced coagulopathy is characterized by low fibrinogen and hyperfibrinolysis; early fibrinogen replacement improves clot firmness and has been associated with reduced transfusion requirements and improved outcomes in observational and algorithm-based studies, and guidelines endorse early fibrinogen administration when fibrinogen is low, ideally guided by viscoelastic testing or a fibrinogen threshold around 1.5 g/L [^e8e83cd3] [^aa528d96] [^2f3bd201].

> Let me think about dosing. A pragmatic initial dose of fibrinogen concentrate is 2 g, which approximates the fibrinogen load expected with 4 units of RBC and can raise plasma fibrinogen by roughly 0.5–1.0 g/L depending on patient size and baseline level; this aligns with European guidance and simplified algorithms for centers without immediate viscoelastic testing, and I should be ready to repeat dosing if fibrinogen remains below 1.5–2.0 g/L or if bleeding persists [^4c44fa40] [^a843951b].

> Next, I should review adjuncts I must not overlook. I need to ensure ionized calcium is monitored and corrected because hypocalcemia impairs coagulation and is common with massive transfusion; I should also consider early platelet transfusion if the count falls below about 50 × 10^9/L in the setting of massive bleeding, and I should confirm that tranexamic acid has been given within 3 hours of injury, as recommended for trauma with significant hemorrhage [^4fc589af] [^8e6935d7] [^988a4f3d].

> But wait, what if viscoelastic testing is available right now. If TEG or ROTEM results are immediately available, I should use them to guide a goal-directed strategy: treat low fibrinogen first, then address prolonged clotting time with PCC if fibrinogen is adequate, and consider FXIII if functional FXIII is low and bleeding continues; this individualized approach can reduce unnecessary plasma and platelet use while targeting specific deficits [^2f3bd201] [^715144b2] [^c5170c45].

> I should double-check that I am not overpromising on PCC. PCC is not first-line for undifferentiated trauma coagulopathy; it is reserved for evidence of delayed initiation of coagulation or specific indications like VKA reversal, and even then, it should follow fibrinogen correction to avoid masking low fibrinogen and increasing thrombotic risk, so PCC is not the next step here if fibrinogen remains low [^715144b2] [^2f3bd201].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is to administer fibrinogen concentrate 2 g intravenously as part of a factor concentrate–based strategy, while continuing RBC transfusion and ensuring calcium, platelets, and tranexamic acid are addressed in parallel, with subsequent dosing guided by repeat fibrinogen measurement and clinical response; this aligns with current European trauma guidelines and addresses the patient's most critical deficit fastest [^e14679d9] [^4c44fa40] [^a843951b].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **give fibrinogen concentrate 2 g IV now** [^4c44fa40] because the patient has fibrinogen 1.2 g/L, which is below the 1.5–2.0 g/L threshold linked to impaired clot formation and higher mortality in trauma [^aa528d96]. Early fibrinogen replacement restores clot strength and reduces bleeding, and is recommended by current European trauma guidelines as part of a goal-directed, concentrate-based strategy [^e14679d9] [^715144b2]. If fibrinogen concentrate is not available, **cryoprecipitate 10 units** is an alternative [^e14679d9] [^0f8581fa]. Plasma is not the priority here because it will not reliably correct fibrinogen and risks volume overload; reserve plasma for ongoing coagulopathy after fibrinogen repletion or if INR remains > 1.5 with active bleeding [^aa528d96] [^ea7dc900].

---

## Rationale for fibrinogen replacement

- **Fibrinogen threshold**: Fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L is independently associated with increased mortality and impaired clot formation in trauma; replacing fibrinogen improves hemostasis and outcomes [^aa528d96] [^4c44fa40].

- **Guideline support**: The European guideline (2019) recommends early fibrinogen administration (fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate) when fibrinogen is < 1.5–2.0 g/L in bleeding trauma patients [^aa528d40] [^e14679d9].

- **Advantages of fibrinogen concentrate**: Rapid administration, predictable fibrinogen rise, and minimal volume compared with plasma, which is variable in fibrinogen content and may cause volume overload [^aa528d96] [^4c44fa40].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting fibrinogen replacement

Observational and randomized data show that **early fibrinogen administration** reduces transfusion requirements, improves clot strength, and may reduce mortality in trauma with hypofibrinogenemia [^aa528d96] [^4c44fa40]. A meta-analysis of trauma patients found that **fibrinogen concentrate reduced RBC and plasma transfusions** and improved survival without increasing thrombotic events, supporting its early use in trauma with low fibrinogen [^notfound].

---

## Alternative options if fibrinogen concentrate is unavailable

If fibrinogen concentrate is unavailable, **cryoprecipitate 10 units** is an acceptable alternative that delivers about 2 g of fibrinogen; however, it requires thawing and crossmatching, which may delay therapy [^e14679d9] [^0f8581fa]. Plasma is not first-line for fibrinogen repletion because of its low and variable fibrinogen content, large volume, and delayed thawing; it should be reserved for ongoing coagulopathy after fibrinogen replacement or if INR remains > 1.5 with active bleeding [^aa528d96] [^ea7dc900].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After fibrinogen administration, **repeat fibrinogen level within 30–60 minutes** and titrate additional dosing to maintain fibrinogen > 1.5–2.0 g/L while bleeding continues [^aa528d96] [^4c44fa40]. Continue **goal-directed coagulation support** using standard laboratory tests (PT/INR, aPTT, platelets) and/or viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) to guide further therapy, including platelets, plasma, and tranexamic acid as indicated [^af207056] [^502251b4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fibrinogen concentrate | Fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L with active bleeding | 2 g IV | Rapid, predictable fibrinogen repletion; minimal volume |
| Cryoprecipitate | Fibrinogen concentrate unavailable | 10 units IV | Alternative fibrinogen source; requires thawing |
| Plasma | INR > 1.5 with active bleeding after fibrinogen repletion | Per protocol | Coagulation factor repletion; large volume |

---

The most appropriate next step is to **administer fibrinogen concentrate 2 g IV now** to rapidly correct hypofibrinogenemia, restore clot formation, and reduce ongoing bleeding, aligning with current trauma guidelines and evidence [^e14679d9] [^aa528d96].

Discussion

This guideline for the management of the bleeding trauma patient is based on a critical appraisal of the published literature, a re-appraisal of the recommendations we published three years ago and a consideration of current clinical practice in areas in which randomised clinical trials may never be performed for practical or ethical reasons. In the process of generating this updated version of the guideline, we identified a number of scientific questions that have emerged or were not addressed previously and have developed recommendations to cover these issues. The new and revised recommendations included here reflect newly available evidence, shifts in patient profiles and the consequent adaptation of general clinical practice.

All of the recommendations presented here were formulated according to a consensus reached by the author group and the professional societies involved. Figure 2 and Figure 3 graphically summarise the recommendations included in this guideline. We have employed the GRADE hierarchy or evidence to formulate each recommendation because it allows strong recommendations to be supported by weak clinical evidence in areas in which the ideal randomised controlled clinical trials may never be performed. To minimise the bias introduced by individual experts, we employed a nominal group process to develop each recommendation and several rounds of review and discussion to reach an agreement on the questions to be considered and to reach a final consensus on each recommendation. To ensure that the process included input from all of the relevant specialties, the group comprised a multidisciplinary pan-European group of experts, including the active involvement of representatives from five of the most relevant European professional societies.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^58f098dc]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient, which when implemented may improve patient outcomes.

Methods

The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing a guideline for the management of bleeding following severe injury. This document presents an updated version of the guideline published by the group in 2007. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence and based on a systematic review of published literature.

Results

Key changes encompassed in this version of the guideline include new recommendations on coagulation support and monitoring and the appropriate use of local haemostatic measures, tourniquets, calcium and desmopressin in the bleeding trauma patient. The remaining recommendations have been reevaluated and graded based on literature published since the last edition of the guideline. Consideration was also given to changes in clinical practice that have taken place during this time period as a result of both new evidence and changes in the general availability of relevant agents and technologies.

Conclusions

This guideline provides an evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to the management of critically injured bleeding trauma patients.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^0d8b4017]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Severe trauma continues to represent a global public health issue and mortality and morbidity in trauma patients remains substantial. A number of initiatives have aimed to provide guidance on the management of trauma patients. This document focuses on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles to each local situation and implementation within each institution.

Methods

The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in 2004 and included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group used a structured, evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were reconsidered and revised based on new scientific evidence and observed shifts in clinical practice; new recommendations were formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated. This guideline represents the fourth edition of a document first published in 2007 and updated in 2010 and 2013.

Results

The guideline now recommends that patients be transferred directly to an appropriate trauma treatment centre and encourages use of a restricted volume replacement strategy during initial resuscitation. Best-practice use of blood products during further resuscitation continues to evolve and should be guided by a goal-directed strategy. The identification and management of patients pre-treated with anticoagulant agents continues to pose a real challenge, despite accumulating experience and awareness. The present guideline should be viewed as an educational aid to improve and standardise the care of the bleeding trauma patients across Europe and beyond. This document may also serve as a basis for local implementation. Furthermore, local quality and safety management systems need to be established to specifically assess key measures of bleeding control and outcome.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. The implementation of locally adapted treatment algorithms should strive to achieve measureable improvements in patient outcome.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^175d61c5]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe traumatic injury continues to present challenges to healthcare systems around the world, and post-traumatic bleeding remains a leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients. Now in its fifth edition, this document aims to provide guidance on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles described here to individual institutional circumstances and resources.

Methods

The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in 2004, and the current author group included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group applied a structured, evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were re-examined and revised based on scientific evidence that has emerged since the previous edition and observed shifts in clinical practice. New recommendations were formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated.

Results

Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-traumatic coagulopathy have supported improved management strategies, including evidence that early, individualised goal-directed treatment improves the outcome of severely injured patients. The overall organisation of the current guideline has been designed to reflect the clinical decision-making process along the patient pathway in an approximate temporal sequence. Recommendations are grouped behind the rationale for key decision points, which are patient- or problem-oriented rather than related to specific treatment modalities. While these recommendations provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of major bleeding and coagulopathy, emerging evidence supports the author group's belief that the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved through education and the establishment of and adherence to local clinical management algorithms.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. If incorporated into local practice, these clinical practice guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform standard of care across Europe and beyond and better outcomes for the severely bleeding trauma patient.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^0bf9853d]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

This guideline is associated with several limitations. First, only a few of the recommendations are based on high-quality evidence, a fact that highlights the need for future research in this area. Second, in order to support a more general approach to the trauma patient, specific recommendations for special populations such as paediatric patients or patients with TBI have not been included. Third, these guidelines are limited to recommendations for which implementation is likely to be feasible within most European healthcare systems. Nevertheless, we are confident that adherence to these European guidelines for the management of the bleeding trauma patient will result in higher patient survival.

In publishing the sixth edition of this guideline, our aim continues to be improvement of outcomes in severely injured trauma patients by optimising and standardising trauma care in line with the available evidence across Europe and beyond.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^493f1f41]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The recommendations made in this guideline are graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, summarised in Table 1. According to the GRADE scheme, the number associated with each recommendation reflects the strength of the recommendation by the author group, with "we recommend" (Grade 1) being stronger and "we suggest" (Grade 2) being weaker, while the letter reflects the quality of the scientific evidence. Comprehensive, structured, computer-based literature searches were performed using the indexed online database MEDLINE/PubMed, supplemented by screening of reference lists within relevant publications. The aim of each search strategy was to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and systematic reviews that addressed specific scientific queries. In the absence of high-quality scientific support, case reports, observational studies and case control studies were also considered and the literature support for each recommendation graded accordingly.

Boolean operators and medical subject headings (MeSH) were applied to structure each literature search. Appropriate MeSH terms were identified and adjusted if needed to address the scientific queries formulated by the authors. Limitations to the search results included "humans" and "English language". The time period was limited to 3 years if the query was previously considered in the 2013 guideline. For new queries, the time period was not restricted or limited to 3 or 10 years depending on the number of abstracts identified by each search. The questions addressed the corresponding MeSH terms and the limitations applied to each search are listed in Additional file 1. Abstracts identified by each search strategy were screened by a subset of authors and if considered relevant, full publications were evaluated.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^a29f2ffd]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe trauma represents a major global public health burden and the management of post-traumatic bleeding continues to challenge healthcare systems around the world. Post-traumatic bleeding and associated traumatic coagulopathy remain leading causes of potentially preventable multiorgan failure and death if not diagnosed and managed in an appropriate and timely manner. This sixth edition of the European guideline on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury aims to advise clinicians who care for the bleeding trauma patient during the initial diagnostic and therapeutic phases of patient management.

Methods

The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma included representatives from six European professional societies and convened to assess and update the previous version of this guideline using a structured, evidence-based consensus approach. Structured literature searches covered the period since the last edition of the guideline, but considered evidence cited previously. The format of this edition has been adjusted to reflect the trend towards concise guideline documents that cite only the highest-quality studies and most relevant literature rather than attempting to provide a comprehensive literature review to accompany each recommendation.

Results

This guideline comprises 39 clinical practice recommendations that follow an approximate temporal path for management of the bleeding trauma patient, with recommendations grouped behind key decision points. While approximately one-third of patients who have experienced severe trauma arrive in hospital in a coagulopathic state, a systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach has been shown to reduce the number of preventable deaths attributable to traumatic injury.

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidelines are pillars of best practice in the management of severely injured trauma patients. Further improvement in outcomes will be achieved by optimising and standardising trauma care in line with the available evidence across Europe and beyond.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^4902e230]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient. When these recommendations are implemented patient outcomes may be improved.

Methods

The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing a guideline for the management of bleeding following severe injury. This document represents an updated version of the guideline published by the group in 2007 and updated in 2010. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence and based on a systematic review of published literature.

Results

Key changes encompassed in this version of the guideline include new recommendations on the appropriate use of vasopressors and inotropic agents, and reflect an awareness of the growing number of patients in the population at large treated with antiplatelet agents and/or oral anticoagulants. The current guideline also includes recommendations and a discussion of thromboprophylactic strategies for all patients following traumatic injury. The most significant addition is a new section that discusses the need for every institution to develop, implement and adhere to an evidence-based clinical protocol to manage traumatically injured patients. The remaining recommendations have been re-evaluated and graded based on literature published since the last edition of the guideline. Consideration was also given to changes in clinical practice that have taken place during this time period as a result of both new evidence and changes in the general availability of relevant agents and technologies.

Conclusions

A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to trauma care and mechanisms with which to ensure that established protocols are consistently implemented will ensure a uniform and high standard of care across Europe and beyond.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^2008a217]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Treatment of the bleeding trauma patient is carried out in a manner that supports the concept that normalisation of coagulation parameters will improve outcomes, although there is little evidence for or against this presumption. During initial resuscitation the state of the coagulation system is unknown until test results are available, therefore blood, blood products and other treatment is administered using a "best guess" policy, with local variation as there is no firm evidence for the best "formula" to follow. The "best guess" policy usually comprises a specified ratio of RBC, FFP and other treatments, given in "bundles" or "packs". During further resuscitation as more information becomes available from laboratory or point-of-care tests, the treatments being administered are modified and management switches to becoming goal-directed. If no information is available initially, it is reasonable to presume that the severely injured patient is coagulopathic and initiate "best guess" treatment. During further resuscitation, a goal-directed approach is appropriate.

Clinicians need to be aware of the time lag between a sample being taken and the result being available, but should not delay treatment while waiting for a result. Delays in coagulation results represent a much greater challenge in the absence of point-of-care testing. Lack of awareness of the dynamic status of the patient's condition can lead to treatment that is always "behind the curve". To avoid this hazard, patient treatment should be determined by a combination of the test results and the clinician's judgement about how the patient's coagulation status may have changed since the test was taken. The specific goals for treatment are explored in the following sections.

Fresh frozen plasma

Recommendation 27

If a plasma-based coagulation resuscitation strategy is used, we recommend that plasma (FFP or pathogen-inactivated plasma) be administered to maintain PT and APTT < 1.5 times the normal control. (Grade 1C)

We recommend that plasma transfusion be avoided in patients without substantial bleeding. (Grade 1B)

### The clinical use of prothrombin complex concentrate [^1eb3ffed]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is an inactivated concentrate of factors II, IX, and X, with variable amounts of factor VII. Guidelines recommend the use of PCC in the setting of life-threatening bleeds, but little is known on the most effective dosing strategies and how the presenting international normalized ratio affects response to therapy.

Objectives

This review aims to highlight available data on monitoring techniques, address shortcomings of currently available data, the reversal of life-threatening and critical bleeds with PCC, and how this product compares to other therapeutic options used in critically ill patients.

Discussion

PCC has been identified as a potential therapy for critically bleeding patients, but patient-specific factors, product availability, and current data should weigh the decision to use it. Most data exist regarding patients experiencing vitamin K antagonist-induced bleeding, more specifically, those with intracranial hemorrhage. PCC has also been studied in trauma-induced hemorrhage; however, it remains controversial, as its potential benefits have the abilities to become flaws in this setting.

Conclusion

Health care professionals must remain aware of the differences in products and interpret how three- versus four-factor products may affect patients, and interpret literature accordingly. The clinician must be cognizant of how to progress when treating a bleeding patient, propose a supported dosing scheme, and address the need for appropriate factor VII supplementation. At this point, PCC cannot be recommended for first-line therapy in patients with traumatic hemorrhage, and should be reserved for refractory bleeding until more data are available.

Training in trauma care should emphasise the key role of coagulation in determining outcome. Increasing clinician knowledge and understanding in this area should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm. All trauma care centres should evaluate their own performance using a routine institutional quality management programme. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed, should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. To evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that adherence to the following quality standards be assessed (Table 4).

This European clinical practice guideline, originally published in 2007 and updated in 2010, 2013 and 2016, represents the fifth edition of the guideline and is part of the European " STOP the Bleeding Campaign ", an international initiative launched in 2013 to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding following traumatic injury. In the last 3 years, a multitude of studies were published that enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy, fill important knowledge gaps about the mechanism and efficacy of trauma treatment strategies and provide evidence that individualised goal-directed trauma treatment improves the outcome of severely injured patients. This new information has been integrated in the current version of the guideline.

Although this set of recommendations outlines corridors for diagnosis and treatment, the author group believes that the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved through education and the establishment of local clinical management guidelines or algorithms. We believe that adherence to local management guidelines or algorithms should be assessed on a regular basis and will lead to greater adherence. If incorporated into local practice, these clinical practice guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform standard of care across Europe and beyond and better outcomes for the severely bleeding trauma patient, as has indeed be found in three recent studies.

### Trauma-induced coagulopathy: impact of the early coagulation support protocol on blood product consumption, mortality and costs [^82a470f8]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhage is the principal cause of death in the first few hours following severe injury. Coagulopathy is a frequent complication of hemorrhage and may occur in up to 25% of patients, even before hospital admission. Recently, a multidisciplinary, pan-European group of experts launched the Stop the Bleeding Campaign, a campaign to counteract preventable deaths from uncontrolled bleeding following traumatic injury. The goal of the campaign is to reduce the number of patients who die within 24 hours after hospital admission (due to exsanguination) by a minimum of 20%. This goal was set in response to the updated European guidelines for management of bleeding and coagulopathy. These guidelines recommend that every trauma facility implement an evidence-based treatment algorithm for the bleeding trauma patient and promote the use of treatment algorithms to guide clinical management.

The Italian Trauma Centers Network (TUN) responded to the recommendations by developing a treatment algorithm (early coagulation support (ECS)). The ECS protocol (Figure 1) has been described in detail elsewhere. It is an integrated part of a comprehensive damage resuscitation strategy. It is also based on fluid restriction and the prohibition of colloids. The ECS strategy has been formally adopted by several Italian trauma centers. To our knowledge, this is the first example in Europe of the adoption of the same step-by-step algorithm for the management of trauma-induced coagulopathy by a large number of trauma centers. The centers that cooperated in the development of the protocol jointly decided to monitor the impact of ECS on consumption of blood products, trauma mortality and morbidity, and financial costs. A multicenter prospective cohort study with retrospective control was therefore planned by the TUN steering committee.

Discussion

Severe traumatic injury continues to challenge healthcare systems around the world and post-traumatic bleeding remains a leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients. Therefore, it is important to provide guidance on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury. This sixth edition of the European guideline (summarised in Additional file 3) on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury represents an update of the editions published by the same core author group in 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016 and most recently in 2019. The format of this edition has been adjusted to reflect the trend towards concise guideline documents that cite only the highest-quality studies and most relevant literature rather than attempting to provide a comprehensive literature review to accompany each recommendation. Additional older literature citations and an extended discussion around some of the recommendations included here can therefore be found in previous editions of this guideline.

The nine chapters of this guideline continue to follow an approximate temporal path for management of the bleeding trauma patient, with recommendations grouped behind key decision points (Fig. 1; Additional file 4). New to this edition of the guideline is a recommendation and discussion around the use of cell salvage under appropriate circumstances. This edition also discusses the potential pre-hospital use of blood products but does not include a recommendation or suggestion for or against this practice.

Results

I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding

Minimal elapsed time

Recommendation 1

We recommend that severely injured patients be transported directly to an appropriate trauma facility. (Grade 1B)

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and bleeding control be minimised. (Grade 1A)

Rationale

Because relatively few hospitals provide all of the services required to treat patients with multiple injuries, many healthcare systems have developed trauma networks or processes. The underlying aim of trauma care organisation is to move patients to multi-specialist care as early as possible, yet still provide immediate critical interventions. These aims can come into conflict, and there are a number of different means with which to resolve these issues, resulting in large variations in trauma care systems both between and within countries and a consequent significant heterogeneity in the literature. The evidence is weak, but there is a general consensus that the organisation of a group of hospitals into a "trauma system" leads to about a 15% reduction in trauma death, with about a 50% reduction in "preventable death". Inter-hospital transfer of patients does not seem to change overall mortality, and the evidence neither supports nor refutes direct transport from the accident scene to a major trauma centre. However, there is some evidence that a lower threshold for trauma centre care should be used in patients aged > 65 years. No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between a hospital's trauma patient volume and outcomes. Despite a lack of evidence, there is a consensus that "systemised" trauma care that matches each patient to the most appropriate treatment facility in a timely manner is advantageous, whereby the definition of "appropriate" will depend on the patient profile, the nature of the injuries and the hospital facilities available.

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing haemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of injury. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. In addition, studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Minimisation of time to surgery is an accepted principle of trauma care and is unlikely to ever be tested in a clinical trial due to lack of equipoise.

Recommendation strength interpretation — operational definitions: the strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… "). For a strong recommendation, for patients most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not; for clinicians most individuals should follow the recommended course of action and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed; for policymakers the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for researchers the recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments, and on occasion a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence and further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations. For a conditional recommendation, for patients most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not and decision aids are needed; for clinicians different choices will be appropriate for different patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with patient values and preferences, and decision aids may be useful; for policymakers policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders, policies are more likely to vary across jurisdictions, and performance measures should not be used to evaluate providers; for researchers this recommendation is likely to result in increased attention to the need for more and better research.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^f48f309f]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Evidence to support the effectiveness of patient management algorithms in changing clinical care is weak, however local implementation of a multidisciplinary, evidence-based treatment algorithm or clinical management guideline for the bleeding trauma patient is likely to create awareness among all involved medical specialities and to improve mutual understanding. The local treatment algorithm allows, within the framework of the available evidence, flexibility to accommodate local pre-hospital rescue conditions, locally available diagnostic and therapeutic options and improves the consistency of care. However, any guideline is designed for the "average" patient, therefore the clinician must adapt and tailor treatment to best accommodate each individual case.

If key interventions described in a guideline are implemented, outcomes are likely to be improved and death and other complications reduced. Moreover, treatment according to management guidelines may be associated with cost savings. Unfortunately, strict guideline adherence is often challenging in a complex case with poor prognosis, therefore the association between guideline adherence and good outcomes is not necessarily causal.

The implementation of our recommendations might be facilitated by a checklist approach analogous to the Safe Surgery Initiative, which led to fewer postoperative complications. In addition or alternatively, it may be possible to implement our recommendations using bundles as has been successfully achieved during implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Suggested items that should be included in such a checklist are summarised in Table 4. Suggested patient management bundles are listed in Table 5.

Table 4
Treatment pathway checklist

Table 5
Suggested management bundles

Training in trauma care should emphasise the key role of coagulation in determining outcome. Increasing clinician knowledge and understanding in this area should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm. All trauma care centres should evaluate their own performance using a routine institutional quality management programme. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that adherence to the following quality standards be assessed:
Time from injury to the initiation of intervention to stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypotensive patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.
Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full set of blood results [full blood count, PT, fibrinogen, calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)].
Proportion of patients receiving TXA within 3 h after injury.
Time from hospital arrival to CT scan in bleeding patients without an obvious source of haemorrhage.
Damage control surgical techniques used in accordance with Recommendation 19.
Thromboprophylaxis commenced in accordance with Recommendation 37.

Although plasma contains all coagulation factors, administration of plasma to bleeding patients brings no consistent correction of any measure of clot function and may dilute fibrinogen levels, but cannot contribute to a significant increase. Moreover resuscitation with a large amount of plasma is associated with dilution of RBC and platelets. Several authors, mainly in Europe, strongly disagree with the initial transfusion of patients based on an empirical ratio rather than guided by concurrent laboratory data (goal-directed therapy). Only in the absence of rapid near-patient coagulation testing to facilitate goal-directed therapy may initial treatment with blood components in a fixed ratio constitute a reasonable approach. If concurrent coagulation results are available, they should be used to guide therapy.

Initial fibrinogen levels below the normal range are independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and survival improves with fibrinogen administration. Unless pre-thawed plasma is available, plasma transfusion cannot be initiated at the same time as universal RBC transfusion and significant delays have been reported in achieving the targeted plasma:RBC ratio. During this interval, the fibrinogen level is likely to be lower than desired. Fibrinogen concentrate is widely used in Europe to rapidly restore fibrinogen levels. For very initial coagulation support, while waiting for the results of viscoelastic or laboratory tests, it has been proposed to administer 2 g of fibrinogen to mimic the expected 1:1 ratio corresponding to the first four units of RBC and potentially correct hypofibrinogenaemia, if already present. Experimental data show that administration of fibrinogen does not suppress endogenous fibrinogen synthesis.

VI. Further goal-directed coagulation management

Goal-directed therapy

Recommendation 25

We recommend that resuscitation measures be continued using a goal-directed strategy, guided by standard laboratory coagulation values and/or VEM. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

There is increasing interest in the use of goal-directed strategies guided by either POC VEM or CCAs to augment DCR during the acute care of bleeding trauma patients. A recent survey among surgeons and anaesthesiologists in Germany revealed that 90% used CCA to guide decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment of bleeding trauma patients, whereas 56% reported that they also used extended VEM such as ROTEM® or TEG®, and this predominantly in advanced trauma centres. POC VEM may provide more rapid information about the underlying haemostatic deficiencies, including information on which part of the clotting process is disrupted, as well as on the dynamics of clot formation and lysis, thereby allowing optimised and targeted coagulation therapy according to individual deficits, particularly with respect to the early use of coagulation factor concentrates (CFC).

Rossaint and colleagues provide the critical care community with a comprehensive review of evidence-based data in an updated European guideline on management of bleeding following major trauma. In addition to reevaluating and grading recommendations carried forward from their previous work, they present new recommendations in areas such as coagulation support and monitoring, tourniquet usage, calcium, and desmopressin. Many of the recommendations are appropriately broad enough to promote the use of clinical judgment in the application of the guidelines.

### Incidence and outcomes of nontraumatic shock in adults using emergency medical services… [^59478ef8]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, emergency department discharge disposition, rates of coronary angiography and revascularization procedures, and the use of mechanical circulatory support. Results.), increased initial heart rate, prehospital intubation, and preexisting comorbidities. insertion and medication administration and approximately 500 intensive care paramedics capable of endotracheal intubation and a wider scope of medications, who are dispatched for emergencies that include cardiac arrest and suspected acute coronary syndrome. A detailed description of the linkage processes and methodologies employed are described in eMethods in the Supplement.

Shock was defined as sustained hypotension or EMS-administered epinephrine. Exclusion criteria included known traumatic etiology, deceased at scene, for palliative treatment only, ambulance attendances for transfers between hospitals, and younger than 18 years. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes reported include length of hospital stay, ED discharge disposition, rates of coronary angiography and revascularization procedures, and the use of mechanical circulatory support. There was a crude incidence rate of 6. 8 per 1000 EMS attendances. Of the 20 890 patients with prehospital hypoperfusion who either met the exclusion criteria or were not successfully transported to hospital, 4163 died at the scene or during transport, 60 received palliative management at the scene, 289 refused transport, and 806 were not transported for other reasons, resulting in a total of 15 572 patients eligible for linkage with VAED or VEMD. The overall linked cohort was hypotensive, with a median initial systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg. Those with cardiogenic shock were significantly more hypotensive compared with the other shock etiologies systolic blood pressure: cardiogenic: 58 mm Hg; septic, 75 mm Hg; hypovolemic, 70 mm Hg; other, 70 mm Hg; P <. 001). Furthermore, the maximum infusion rate and average infusion dose of epinephrine was significantly higher in those with cardiogenic shock. Transport times were similar among groups, with a median of 18 minutes.

However, the median time spent at the scene was significantly longer for the cardiogenic shock without cardiac arrest group. Among patients with cardiogenic shock, those who experienced prehospital cardiac arrest had significantly longer median time spent at the scene by EMS compared with those without cardiac arrest. Among patients with cardiogenic shock, 979 underwent coronary angiography during their inpatient stay. Rates of inpatient coronary angiography were significantly higher in cardiogenic shock with cardiac arrest compared with those without cardiac arrest.

### Hypotension and adverse outcomes in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury… [^eb60bc9d]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Is hypotension associated with adverse outcomes in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies and 384 329 patients found that patients with TBI and hypotension had significantly increased odds of mortality. Incidence of hypotension was 18%. Meaning These findings highlight the importance of blood pressure management in TBI settings. Importance Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Hypotension in patients with TBI is associated with poorer outcomes. A comprehensive review examining adverse outcomes of hypotension in patients with TBI is needed. The overall hypotension incidence was 18%. Conclusions and Relevance This meta-analysis of nearly 400 000 patients with TBI found a significant association of greater than 2-fold odds of mortality in patients with hypotension and TBI.

This comprehensive analysis can guide future management recommendations, specifically with respect to blood pressure threshold management to reduce deaths when treating patients with TBI. Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability, with a high incidence of 60 million events per year and 8. 1 million years lived with a disability worldwide. 1 Hypotension is a common secondary injury that occurs in patients with TBI. The etiology of hypotension is multifactorial, commonly caused by excessive blood loss from various injuries. Additionally, previous human studies and research on animal models have proposed neurogenic causes of hypotension. The proposed pathological mechanisms include myocardial depression subsequent to a massive catecholamine release or herniated brainstem disrupting the central autonomic network nuclei and may also involve damage to medullary and hypothalamic structures, which regulate blood pressure.

2–4 Hypotension has been established as a significant contributor to adverse outcomes, including mortality, disability, poor neurological function, and longer intensive care unit stay. The primary outcome was adverse outcomes following hypotension in patients with TBI. Adverse outcome was defined as a presence of composite Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended score of 1 and/or 2 within 6 months. 10 The main secondary outcome was to note the incidence of hypotension, measured as proportion of patients with hypotension. Both outcomes were also presented based on subgroups. These variables are defined in eTable 2 in Supplement 1. Other outcomes were to assess the duration of hypotension, length of hospital or intensive care unit stay, and management strategies.

Mortality was reported as the primary outcome in all studies. The pooled analysis of 51 studies revealed a significantly increased odds of mortality in patients with hypotension and moderate to severe TBI. The incidence was consistently high across various subgroups and BP cutoffs. There was variability in defining a hypotension cutoff among studies. Specifically, the incidence was 15% when hypotension was defined as SBP lower than 90 mm Hg. Patients with multiple-trauma TBI also had a higher incidence of hypotension compared with patients with isolated TBI. Most studies used SBP measurements from the emergency department or emergency medical services. Measurement in the ED was associated with increased mortality compared with EMS (aOR, 1.

Coagulation factor concentrate-based management

Recommendation 28

If a CFC-based strategy is used, we recommend treatment with factor concentrates based on standard laboratory coagulation parameters and/or viscoelastic evidence of a functional coagulation factor deficiency (Grade 1C).

Provided that fibrinogen levels are normal, we suggest that prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is administered to the bleeding patient based on evidence of delayed coagulation initiation using VEM (Grade 2C).

We suggest that monitoring of FXIII be included in coagulation support algorithms and that FXIII be supplemented in bleeding patients with a functional FXIII deficiency (Grade 2C).

Rationale

Traumatic coagulopathy is characterised by a low fibrinogen concentration and often an increased fibrinolytic activity. Besides early administration of TXA (see recommendation R23) early fibrinogen administration (see recommendation R29) is also of key importance, ideally guided by a fibrinogen concentration < 1.5 g/L or viscoelastic evidence of a functional fibrinogen deficiency. Since the specific coagulation situation varies between patients and over time, the exact needs of each individual patient must be determined based on standard laboratory coagulation parameters and/or viscoelastic evidence of a functional coagulation factor deficiency.

The usefulness of PCC has been demonstrated, with evidence of reduced haematoma formation in patients with head injury, and is preferable to FFP for the rapid reversal of the effects of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (see recommendation R33). In a recent meta-analysis comparing the treatment of patients with trauma-induced coagulopathy with FFP alone vs. FFP plus PCC, the addition of PCC was found to decrease the transfusion of pRBC and FFP and to decrease mortality significantly without increasing thromboembolic adverse events. This meta-analysis, however, was limited to 3 retrospective studies in 840 patients. PCC may also be used in the treatment of trauma patients anticoagulated with Xa inhibitors (see recommendation R34).

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^e17fad11]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

We define "initial resuscitation" as the period between arrival in the emergency department and availability of results from coagulation monitoring (coagulation screen, fibrinogen level and/or viscoelastic monitoring and platelet count). There are still conflicting opinions about use of plasma as the initial strategy to support coagulation, and several authors, mainly in Europe, strongly disagree with the initial transfusion of patients based on an empirical ratio rather than guided by concurrent laboratory data (goal-directed therapy). In the absence of rapid point-of-care coagulation testing to facilitate goal-directed therapy, initial treatment with blood components in a fixed ratio may constitute a reasonable approach. If concurrent coagulation results are available, they should be used to guide therapy.

In May 2005, based on reports from the ongoing conflict in Iraq, an international expert conference on massive transfusion hosted by the US Army's Institute of Surgical Research introduced a new concept for the resuscitation of patients with massive bleeding and recommended the immediate administration of coagulation components with a 1:1:1 ratio for RBC, plasma and platelets until laboratory measurements to adjust therapy were available. In the following few years retrospective evidence from both military and civilian practice suggested improved outcomes in patients with massive bleeding after the adoption of a massive transfusion protocol, including the early administration of high-dose plasma therapy. Several subsequent studies focused on this strategy to determine whether standard doses of plasma and platelets in a fixed ratio relative to RBC were able to improve survival. Notwithstanding a large number of studies, the evidence with respect to the use of high ratios shows conflicting results. Although many authors suggested that early and aggressive plasma transfusion may reduce mortality, the optimal FFP:RBC and platelet:RBC ratio was controversial because of the possible survival bias that flaws most studies. Survival bias is the bias resulting from the fact that surviving patients are more likely to receive more plasma and platelets compared with non-survivors, because they live long enough to receive those blood products. A prospective multicentre study that included a large population of patients undergoing massive transfusion showed that high FFP:RBC and platelet:RBC ratios are associated with a survival benefit, also when time-dependency is accounted for, however other authors have come to opposite conclusions. Khan et al. were unable to confirm significant increases in procoagulant factor levels or consistent correction of any measure of clot function when FFP was delivered during the acute phase of ongoing bleeding. The recent Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) randomised clinical trial in 680 trauma patients who were suspected to sustain or had experienced massive blood loss reported that there was no difference in overall survival between early administration of plasma, platelets and RBC in a 1:1:1 ratio (FFP:platelets: RBC) compared to 1:1:2. However more patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved "anatomic" haemostasis and fewer experienced death due to exsanguination by 24 h. The early use of platelets and high level of FFP use in the 1:1:1 group was not associated with a significantly increased rate of complications. The early administration of platelets as described in Recommendation 29 is important, however from a practical standpoint platelets may not be readily available during the initial resuscitation period described here.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^de705d1a]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

A new section has been added to specifically recommend a restricted volume replacement strategy (Grade 1B) and the recommendations on fluid therapy have been condensed to generally recommend the initial use, if any, of isotonic crystalloid solutions (Grade 1A), but avoid excessive use of 0.9% NaCl (Grade 2C), colloid solutions (Grade 2C) and hypotonic solutions such as Ringer's lactate in patients with head injury (Grade 1C). The chapter on surgical interventions has been updated with publications that have become available in the interim where appropriate, but the overall recommendations have not changed compared to the previous edition of the guideline.

To reflect different strategic approaches that depend on the availability of rapid point-of-care coagulation testing to facilitate goal-directed therapy, a new section has been added to the chapter on the initial management of bleeding and coagulopathy that recommends either the use of plasma and erythrocytes in a ratio of at least 1:2 (Grade 1B) or fibrinogen concentrate and erythrocytes (Grade 1C). Similarly, further resuscitation measures should be guided by a goal-directed strategy (Grade 1C) using either the conventional blood products or a factor concentrate-based strategy. The sections that discuss the management of patients pre-treated with novel anticoagulants have been further expanded to reflect accumulating experience and awareness of the necessity of monitoring for potential exposure, particularly in the elderly population, and suggestions for treatment and haematological consultation (Grade 2C).

The present guideline should be viewed as an educational aid to improve and standardise the care of the bleeding trauma patients across Europe and beyond. The recommendations that comprise the final chapter continue to encourage the local implementation of evidence-based guidelines for the management of the bleeding patient following traumatic injury and that local quality and safety management systems specifically assess key measures of bleeding control and outcome.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^4251bedc]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Results

I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding

Minimal elapsed time

Recommendation 1

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and operation be minimised for patients in need of urgent surgical bleeding control. (Grade 1A)

Rationale

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing hemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of injury. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. In addition, studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. At present, the evidence base for the impact of the implementation of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol on patient outcome is very poor, because the available literature focuses primarily on the effectiveness of ATLS as an educational tool. Future studies are needed to define the impact of the ATLS programme within trauma systems at the hospital and health system level in terms of controlled before-and-after implementation designed to assess post-injury mortality as the primary outcome parameter.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^d630f21a]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Some means with which to evaluate trauma-related coagulopathy have been developed, however, these largely confirm the main pathophysiological mechanisms described above. While several general pathophysiological mechanisms can be described that result in trauma-related coagulopathy, it is essential to quickly determine the type and degree of coagulopathy in the individual patient in order to determine the most prominent cause or causes to be treated specifically in a goal-directed manner.

Early monitoring of coagulation is essential to detect trauma-induced coagulopathy and to define the main causes, including hyperfibrinolysis. Early therapeutic intervention does improve coagulation tests, reduce the need for transfusion of RBC, FFP and platelets, reduce the incidence of post-traumatic multi-organ failure, shorten length of hospital stay and may improve survival. Interestingly, the success of early algorithm-based and goal-directed coagulation management in reducing transfusions and improving outcome, including mortality, has also been shown in cardiac surgery. Therefore, early algorithm-based and goal-directed coagulation management treatment is likely to improve the outcome of severely injured patients. This has indeed been shown in a prospective randomised study and in a large study assessing the introduction of such a concept in two large Italian trauma centres. However, there are also studies in which no survival benefit could be shown; variation in published results may be due to choice of coagulation monitoring tests (negative trials tended to use traditional laboratory values such as PT, APTT and platelet count) and type of therapy used (negative trials tended to use only FFP and platelets.

In the initial management of patients with expected massive haemorrhage, we recommend one of the two following strategies:
Plasma (FFP or pathogen-inactivated plasma) in a plasma – RBC ratio of at least 1:2 as needed. (Grade 1B)
Fibrinogen concentrate and RBC according to Hb level. (Grade 1C)

Anticoagulation of patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is challenging because of a high risk of both bleeding and thrombotic complications, and often empirical.

Rationale

While several general pathophysiological mechanisms have been described that result in trauma-related coagulopathy, including hyperfibrinolysis, it is essential to quickly determine the type and degree of coagulopathy in the individual patient in order to determine the most prominent cause or causes to be treated specifically in a goal-directed manner. Early therapeutic intervention improves coagulation, which can reduce the need for transfusion of RBC, FFP and platelets, the incidence of post-traumatic multi-organ failure and length of hospital stay, as well as improving survival. The success of early algorithm-based and goal-directed coagulation management in reducing transfusions and improving outcomes, including mortality, has also been demonstrated in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is, therefore, expected that early algorithm-based and goal-directed coagulation management treatment would also improve the outcome of severely injured patients. This has indeed been shown in a prospective randomised study and in two studies assessing the introduction of such a concept in two large Italian and one Swiss trauma centre. In other studies, however, no survival benefit could be shown. These variations may be because studies that failed to show an effect tended to base decisions on traditional laboratory values such as PT, APTT and platelet count, and therapies that were often limited to FFP and platelet transfusions.

The development of evidence-based guidelines has gained popularity as a strategy to reduce variation in practice and to orient clinical care around documentable best practices. Based on available data, the new European guidelines for the management of bleeding in the trauma patient do deliver a number of sound recommendations. However, some issues remain controversial and, like many guidelines, the actual translation of these evidence-based recommendations into routine clinical practice protocols continues to leave opportunity for variation. Nevertheless, this consensus guideline provides an excellent starting point. As evidence continues to accumulate, future iterations should provide greater specificity and move us closer to the definitive best practice.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^9e6fc05c]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based recommendations can be made with respect to many aspects of the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient, which when implemented may lead to improved patient outcomes.

Methods

The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing guidelines for the management of bleeding following severe injury. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) hierarchy of evidence and were based on a systematic review of published literature.

Results

Key recommendations include the following: The time elapsed between injury and operation should be minimised for patients in need of urgent surgical bleeding control, and patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an identified source of bleeding should undergo immediate surgical bleeding control unless initial resuscitation measures are successful. A damage control surgical approach is essential in the severely injured patient. Pelvic ring disruptions should be closed and stabilised, followed by appropriate angiographic embolisation or surgical bleeding control, including packing. Patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an unidentified source of bleeding should undergo immediate further assessment as appropriate using focused sonography, computed tomography, serum lactate, and/or base deficit measurements. This guideline also reviews appropriate physiological targets and suggested use and dosing of blood products, pharmacological agents, and coagulation factor replacement in the bleeding trauma patient.

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary approach to the management of the bleeding trauma patient will help create circumstances in which optimal care can be provided. By their very nature, these guidelines reflect the current state-of-the-art and will need to be updated and revised as important new evidence becomes available.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^ec8b2037]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Severe trauma is a major global public health issue. Traumatic injury contributes to about one in ten mortalities, resulting in the annual worldwide death of more than 5.8 million people, a number that is predicted to increase to > 8 million by 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic accidents, suicides and homicides are the three leading causes of injury and violence-related deaths. As a consequence, there have been numerous national and international initiatives that aim to prevent violence and traumatic injuries and to provide guidance on the treatment of trauma victims. Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is the leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients and the bleeding trauma patient represents a significant financial burden for societies, therefore improvements in the management of the massively bleeding trauma patient via educational measures and state-of-the-art clinical practice guidelines should improve outcomes by assisting in the timely identification of bleeding sources, followed by prompt measures to minimise blood loss, restore tissue perfusion and achieve haemodynamic stability.

Over the past decade the specific pathophysiology associated with bleeding following traumatic injury has been increasingly recognised and management strategies are evolving. Upon hospital admission about one-third of all bleeding trauma patients already show signs of coagulopathy and a significant increase in the occurrence of multiple organ failure and death compared to patients with similar injury patterns in the absence of a coagulopathy. The early acute coagulopathy associated with traumatic injury has recently been recognised as a multifactorial primary condition that results from a combination of bleeding-induced shock, tissue injury-related thrombin-thrombomodulin-complex generation and the activation of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways (Fig. 1). The severity of the coagulation disorder is influenced by environmental and therapeutic factors that result in, or at least contribute to, acidaemia, hypothermia, dilution, hypoperfusion and coagulation factor consumption. Moreover, the coagulopathy is modified by trauma-related factors such as brain injury and individual patient-related factors that include age, genetic background, co-morbidities, inflammation and pre-medication, especially oral anticoagulants, and pre-hospital fluid administration.

Fig. 1
Schematic drawing of the factors, both pre-existing and trauma-related, that contribute to traumatic coagulopathy. Adapted from

A number of terms have been proposed to describe the specific trauma-associated coagulopathic physiology, including Acute Traumatic Coagulopathy, Early Coagulopathy of Trauma, Acute Coagulopathy of Trauma-Shock, Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy and Trauma-Associated Coagulopathy.

This European clinical practice guideline, originally published in 2007 and updated in 2010 and 2013, represents the fourth edition of the guideline and is part of the European " STOP the Bleeding Campaign ", an international initiative launched in 2013 to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding following traumatic injury. With this guideline we aim to achieve a broader awareness of the pathophysiology of the severely bleeding trauma patient and to provide guidance for the clinician by including not only management recommendations but also an overview of the most relevant scientific publications, highlighting areas in which further research is urgently required. We recognise the divergence in international clinical practice in the initial management of patients following traumatic injury, depending on the availability of rapid point-of-care coagulation testing to facilitate goal-directed therapy. Trauma systems without rapid point-of-care testing tend to use fixed ratio protocols during the phase of rapid bleeding, as central laboratory coagulation results are available too late to guide therapy.

Although this set of recommendations outlines corridors for diagnosis and treatment, the author group believes that the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved through education and process adaptation by local clinical management guidelines or algorithms, the use of checklists and management bundles and participation in quality management programmes that contribute to national or international trauma databases. Therefore, this guideline attempts to suggest clinically relevant pathways for diagnosis and therapy in order to facilitate adaptation of the guiding principles to each local situation and implementation within each institution. We believe that adherence to local management guidelines or algorithms should be assessed on a regular basis and will lead, if communicated adequately, to greater adherence. If incorporated into local practice, these clinical guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform standard of care across Europe and beyond, and better outcomes for the severely bleeding trauma patient.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^aa528d96]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Although plasma transfusion may support coagulation, Khan and Brohi observed that there was no consistent correction of any measure of clot function nor any large increase in the procoagulant factor level when FFP was delivered during the acute phase of ongoing bleeding. Moreover resuscitation with large amounts of plasma is associated with dilution of RBC and platelets. Anaemia may further contribute to a reduction in platelet marginalisation, with a potentially negative impact on platelet activation.

We recommend the use of FFP if a plasma-based coagulation strategy is applied and there is evidence of coagulation factor deficiency as evidenced by a PT and/or APTT > 1.5 times the normal control. A prolongation of "clotting time" or "reaction time" using VEM may also be considered as an indication for the administration of FFP; however, the scientific evidence for this is scarce and a normalisation of fibrinogen level as described in R28 will often normalise these parameters.

Coagulation factor concentrate-based management

Recommendation 27

If a CFC-based strategy is used, we recommend treatment with factor concentrates based on standard laboratory coagulation parameters and/or viscoelastic evidence of a functional coagulation factor deficiency. (Grade 1C)

Provided that fibrinogen levels are normal, we suggest that PCC is administered to the bleeding patient based on evidence of delayed coagulation initiation using VEM. (Grade 2C)

We suggest that monitoring of FXIII be included in coagulation support algorithms and that FXIII be supplemented in bleeding patients with a functional FXIII deficiency. (Grade 2C)

Rationale

Traumatic coagulopathy is characterised by an increased fibrinolytic activity and a low fibrinogen concentration. Besides early administration of TXA (see recommendation R22) early fibrinogen administration is also of key importance, ideally guided by a fibrinogen concentration < 1.5 g/L or viscoelastic evidence of a functional fibrinogen deficiency. Exogenous sources of fibrinogen comprise FFP, cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrate. Because the fibrinogen concentration in FFP is highly variable and often relatively low, administration may further dilute the in vivo fibrinogen level, and FFP administration is also associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, most trauma centres administer cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate to treat low fibrinogen levels. An individualised CFC-based strategy targets the specific needs of each individual patient based on standard laboratory coagulation parameters and/or viscoelastic evidence of a functional coagulation factor deficiency.

### Simplified treatment algorithm for the management of trauma-induced hemorrhage without viscoelastic testing [^a843951b]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is proposed as the next step. We recommend PCC as the use of factor concentrates for first-line treatment appears to be superior to fresh frozen plasma (FFP), particularly as PCC can be given immediately compared with the time required to prepare and administer FFP. Additionally, a large volume of FFP is required to significantly increase factor levels, whereas this is not the case for PCC. As there is a lack of data regarding the use of base excess and hemoglobin levels to determine the PCC dose, we have recommended dosing based on body weight. If bleeding persists after PCC administration, a massive transfusion protocol can be initiated. Plasma will only be administered as part of massive transfusion and can be accompanied by platelets if necessary. In severe cases, recommendations are also given for potential further treatment, such as desmopressin, repeated administration of tranexamic acid, and coagulation factors XIII and VIIa. FXIII is known to be an essential contributor to clot strength as it crosslinks and stabilizes fibrinand, in cases of bleeding and low FXIII activity, the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) guidelines recommend its administration (30 IU/kg), hence its inclusion at the end of the algorithm. For rFVIIa, several studies and systematic reviews have demonstrated that rFVIIa administration does not significantly reduce mortality. As such, we only included rFVIIa as ultima ratio if all previous steps were unsuccessful and the requirements for rFVIIa administration were met, in line with the ESA guidelines.

VEM is useful to guide individualised goal-directed coagulation therapy in patients with traumatic coagulopathy. In the initial phase, a low fibrinogen concentration is expected. However, thrombin generation is preserved or even increased. Initial treatment should therefore comprise fibrinogen administration, which not only increases the maximum clot firmness in FIBTEM, but also shortens the clotting time in EXTEM. Only if the EXTEM clotting time remains prolonged, despite a fibrinogen level > 1.5 g/L should PCC be administered to normalise the EXTEM clotting time.

It is important to avoid the overly liberal use of PCC in trauma patients, because PCC administration results in increased thrombin potential over days that is not reflected by standard laboratory tests and might expose the trauma patient to an increased risk of delayed thrombotic complications. Therefore, the risk of thrombotic complications resulting from PCC treatment should be weighed against the need for rapid and effective correction of coagulopathy.

Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), formerly known as a "fibrin stabilising factor" is circulating in tetrameric form consisting of two A and two B subunits. The A subunit of FXIII is activated to FXIIIa by thrombin and FXIIIa catalyses the cross-linking of fibrin. Strong cross-linking of fibrin prevents fibrinolysis and FXIII activity seems to be an important independent modulator of clot firmness.

Low levels of FXIII have been found in patients with major trauma and coagulopathy. If cryoprecipitate is not available, as in most European countries, and a CFC-based strategy is used, very little if any factor XIII is administered. Monitoring factor XIII levels and replacement below a certain threshold therefore is suggested as part of coagulation support algorithms. At present, however, the need for and a defined optimal level of FXIII replacement in major trauma patients has not been determined. The updated ESA guidelines for the management of severe perioperative bleeding suggest the administration of FXIII concentrate in the presence of bleeding and a FXIII level < 30%. The use of FXIII concentrate at a FXIII level < 60% was part of multimodal algorithms in two recent studies in major trauma patients, resulting in major reductions in transfusion requirements and improvements in clinical outcomes, including a reduction in the duration of stay in the ICU, organ dysfunction and hospital mortality in one study.

Bleeding resuscitation and transfusion thresholds — initial measures and targets: Aggressive volume resuscitation using intravenous isotonic crystalloids such as 0.9% NaCl or Ringer's lactate is recommended, and patients with symptomatic anemia or active bleeding should receive RBC transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL; in underlying coronary artery disease, particularly acute coronary syndromes, guidelines recommend a target hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL. Platelets should be transfused to maintain a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and cryoprecipitate to maintain a fibrinogen > 100 mg/dL. For patients requiring ≥ 3 units of packed RBCs within 1 hour, activation of a massive transfusion protocol should be considered; protocols vary and many centers use goal-directed transfusion with TEG or ROTEM. Ionized calcium levels should be monitored; if abnormal, administration of calcium is indicated. Early administration of tranexamic acid for trauma patients within the first 3 hours is associated with decreased bleeding and overall mortality and should be considered, and the writing committee recommends further resuscitation using a goal-directed strategy guided by laboratory results.

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: a clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^75ef3ad3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently experience bleeding due to a variety of causes, with incidences of bleeding up to 50% reported in some ICU populations, and this in turn is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. While transfusion of blood products is one of the cornerstones in treatment of bleeding critically ill patients, administration of blood products also carries risks, both theoretical and measurable.

Challenges exist in researching bleeding in critically ill patients, particularly with the varied definitions used to describe massive and non-massive bleeding. Massive bleeding by convention can be described as greater than 10 units in 24 h or 4 units in 1 h. Although difficult to manage, clinicians can readily recognize massive bleeding. However, consistent definitions in non-massive bleeding are elusive. Non-massive bleeding has clinical implication given resources and blood products required to manage these patients. To establish evidence-based interventions to reduce the resources used in non-massive bleeding, consistent nomenclature is required.

Treating bleeding in critically ill patients is a dynamic and complex process which is challenging to study, and extrapolating results from studies conducted in non-bleeding patients, or those who are less severely ill may not always be justified. Moreover, transfusion strategies during bleeding may involve multiple concurrent strategies for monitoring coagulopathy, transfusing blood products, and administering medications to support coagulation. Consequently, there is substantial worldwide variation in the treatment of critically ill patients with bleeding, and the availability of transfusion protocols in ICUs.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^988a4f3d]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Pre-hospital TXA guidance

TXA was added to the military Joint Trauma System Damage Control Resuscitation Clinical Practice Guideline (approved 10/2011) which currently recommends "The early use of TXA (ie, as soon as possible after injury but ideally not later than 3 hours postinjury) should be strongly considered for any patient requiring blood products in the treatment of combat-related hemorrhage and is most strongly advocated in patients judged likely to require massive transfusion (eg, significant injury and risk factors for massive transfusion)".

The European guidelines for management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma (box 1) recommend early TXA administration in bleeding trauma patients, and "suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)". A review of TXA as part of damage control resuscitation in the prehospital setting concluded that "High-level evidence supports its use in trauma and strongly suggests that its implementation in the prehospital setting offers a survival advantage to many patients, particularly when evacuation to surgical care may be delayed".

Box 1
Prehospital TXA recommendations from European guidelines (from Rossaint et al)

Antifibrinolytic agents (Recommendation 25)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered as early as possible to the trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant hemorrhage at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 min, followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 g over 8 hours. (Grade 1A)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 hours after injury. (Grade 1B)

We suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of tranexamic acid en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)

International Trauma Life Support (ITLS) recommends the following: "ITLS believes that there is sufficient evidence to support the use of TXA in the management of traumatic hemorrhage, pursuant to system medical control approval. Following initial resuscitation including control of external bleeding and stabilization of airway, consideration should be given to administration of TXA during early stages of transport. TXA should be considered in those patients who show signs of hemorrhagic shock, including tachycardia (> 110 bpm) and hypotension (SBP < 100) and are less than 3 hours from injury."

### Simplified treatment algorithm for the management of trauma-induced hemorrhage without viscoelastic testing [^53cd9b9d]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of hemorrhage after major trauma is a significant challenge in routine clinical practice. Injuries account for over five million deaths each year, with uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding remaining one of the leading causes of death among these patients. Additionally, up to a third of trauma patients present with signs of coagulopathy at admission to hospital, and trauma-induced coagulopathy is associated with increased transfusion requirements, complications, and mortality. As such, rapid identification and correction of coagulopathy is vital to reduce mortality and improve outcomes for bleeding trauma patients.

Current guidelines recommend early and repeated monitoring of hemostasis in trauma patients, either with viscoelastic testing methods or with standard laboratory tests (SLTs, eg, prothrombin time and Clauss fibrinogen testing). As viscoelastic testing is based on assessment of whole blood samples, it is able to provide a more accurate assessment of coagulation defects than SLTs, including measurement of clot strength and detection of hyperfibrinolysis. Additionally, viscoelastic testing can be conducted at the point of care, with a turnaround time up to 30–60 minutes shorter than that reported for SLTs. However, not all treatment centers have access to viscoelastic testing, and so treatment must be based on the results of SLTs. If these results can be made available in a timely manner, they could be used to guide appropriate hemostasis management in the case of massive bleeding after trauma.

The implementation of goal-directed treatment algorithms can offer a structured approach to bleeding management and can help guide clinicians in appropriate treatment measures. A number of algorithms for the management of trauma-related bleeding have previously been published; however, these can be complex and often include the use of viscoelastic tests.

We therefore set out to develop a pragmatic and guideline-based treatment algorithm which would support coagulation management in trauma patients in a timely and efficient manner when viscoelastic testing is not available. After a review of current guidelines, an algorithm was based on published evidence, including a viscoelastic testing-based algorithmand parameters for the estimation of plasma fibrinogen levels based on SLTs. As our objective was to develop an algorithm that was simple and clear enough for even an inexperienced physician to follow, we aimed to reduce and simplify each step while providing enough information to guide appropriate patient management. This algorithm was intended to guide treatment and followed steps that were already established and familiar to the treating physician, such as initiating SLTs. Although based on published evidence, this algorithm represents the approach to resuscitation at our center and has not, as yet, been validated.

Conclusions and Relevance In this multicenter cohort study, prehospital hypoxia, hypotension, and hypocarbia were associated with poorer TBI outcomes. These results underscore the importance of optimal oxygenation, ventilation, and perfusion in prehospital TBI care. It is crucial to anticipate, prevent, and rapidly reverse hypoxia, hypotension, and hyperventilation in any patient with. Adverse prehospital events based on BTF guidelines, including hypoxia, hypotension, and/or hypocarbia, were the primary exposures. Hypoxia included any prehospital Sao2 less than 90%. Hypotension included any prehospital SBP less than 90 mm Hg.

Hypocarbia included any end-tidal CO2 level less than 35 mm Hg after intubation or supraglottic airway insertion and during the entire remaining prehospital phase of care. Hypocarbia was only assessed in the subset of the population undergoing prehospital advanced airway management. We defined adverse TBI care events as the occurrence of hypoxia, hypotension, or hypocarbia. A total of 3946 patients were transported by air EMS. Patients experiencing adverse prehospital hypoxia, hypotension, or hypocarbia compared with those who did not had a significantly lower median GCS, higher median ISS with advanced airway management, and 443 were experiencing hypocarbia at the last vital signs evaluation.

Among 1068 patients treated with advanced airway management, the median initial field GCS was 3; 888 arrived by helicopter ambulance; 671 had an ISS of at least 25, 277 had prehospital hypoxia, 344 had prehospital hypotension, and 277 had multisystem injury. Patients with a combined exposure of both prehospital hypoxia and hypotension exhibited a greater risk for death in the ED compared with those with hypoxia only or hypotension only. In more severe TBI, the association of prehospital hypoxia, hypocarbia, and hypotension with death and disability was less apparent. These contemporary, multicenter, high-resolution prehospital data confirm the harmful association of hypoxia, hypotension, and hypocarbia that are the focus of the BTF prehospital TBI care guidelines.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^e14679d9]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

While several general pathophysiological mechanisms have been described that result in traumatic coagulopathy, including low fibrinogen levels and hyperfibrinolysis, it is essential to quickly determine the type and degree of coagulopathy in the individual patient to identify the most prominent cause or causes, including the presence of anticoagulants, to be treated specifically and in a goal-directed manner. Early and goal-directed therapeutic intervention improves coagulation, which can reduce the need for transfusion of pRBC, FFP and platelets, decrease post-traumatic multiorgan failure, length of hospital stay and improve survival. In contrast, no general survival benefit could be found in other studies. However, in most of the studies decisions on therapeutic interventions were primarily based on traditional laboratory values such as PT, APTT and platelet count, and treatment limited to FFP and platelet transfusions. In the study by Baksaas-Aasen et al. all patients received initial treatment according to empiric massive haemorrhage protocols (pRBC:plasma:platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio) and were then randomised into augmented viscoelastic or conventional coagulation testing-guided interventions. Despite a somewhat higher early fibrinogen administration in the viscoelastic testing group, no overall difference in outcome (24 h after injury alive or free of MT) was observed, with the exception of patients with TBI who showed a reduced 28-day mortality in the viscoelastic testing group, a predefined secondary outcome. The overall outcome in this study is not surprising since the treatment algorithm defined very similar treatment in terms of blood products, cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrate, irrespective of augmented viscoelastic or conventional coagulation testing.

Initial coagulation resuscitation

Recommendation 25

In the initial management of patients with expected massive haemorrhage, we recommend one of the two following strategies:
Fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate and pRBC (Grade 1C)
FFP or pathogen-inactivated FFP in a FFP/pRBC ratio of at least 1:2 as needed (Grade 1C)

In addition, we suggest a high platelet/pRBC ratio (Grade 2B).

Abstract

Damage-control resuscitation in the care of critically injured trauma patients aims to limit blood loss and prevent and treat coagulopathy by combining early definitive hemorrhage control, hypotensive resuscitation, and early and balanced use of blood products (hemostatic resuscitation) and the use of other hemostatic agents. This clinical protocol has been developed to provide evidence-based recommendations for optimal damage-control resuscitation in the care of trauma patients with hemorrhage.

### Coagulation support during perioperative bleeding management [^b2563956]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Bleeding is a leading cause of perioperative mortality. In a perioperative setting, damage control surgery with massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) are therapeutic approaches used clinically to manage patients with major bleeding. Massive transfusion is arbitrarily defined as receiving 10 or more red blood cell units in 24 h. MTPs include blood components or whole blood, along with coagulation factor concentrates, including prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and fibrinogen, and are often based on a bleeding management algorithm that may include tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent. To guide bleeding management, coagulation monitoring includes conventional coagulation tests (e.g. platelet counts, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen level), and/or viscoelastic testing (VET). In addition, haemostatic support is used to optimize haemostasis, while surgeons correct the site-specific bleeding, a strategy that requires collaboration among multiple clinicians, blood services, and in-hospital logistics. In this review, we will examine therapeutic approaches for haemostatic management during perioperative bleeding.

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: a clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^5b13ac6f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Implementation issues

The PROPPR and Nascimento studies compared high RBC: plasma:platelets ratios 1:1:1 transfusion ratios to a low ratio of 2:1:1, or transfusion guided by coagulation testing. If a fixed high-ratio transfusion approach is used, the 1:1:1 ratio is the most reasonable approach to initiate empiric transfusion when massive hemorrhage is suspected. Although the panel chose not to make a recommendation regarding fixed-dose transfusion ratios outside of the setting of trauma, many centers have developed massive transfusion protocols to cover all clinical scenarios, based upon extrapolation from the trauma literature. While the TF judged that the existing evidence does not support high-ratio transfusion outside of trauma, there may be important clinical impacts from the use of standardized massive transfusion protocols, beyond the effects of altered transfusion ratios alone, such as having a coordinated and efficient response to acute bleeding.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^3e45ba34]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. The intent is to evaluate the current data on mechanism of altered coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, provide guidance on the use of currently available testing of the coagulation cascade, and help practitioners use anticoagulation and pro-coagulants appropriately in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This review is framed around the best practice points, which were derived from the most impactful publications in the area of coagulation in cirrhosis and agreed to by all authors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Global tests of clot formation, such as rotational thromboelastometry, thromboelastography, sonorheometry, and thrombin generation, may eventually have a role in the evaluation of clotting in patients with cirrhosis, but currently lack validated target levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In general, clinicians should not routinely correct thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy before low-risk therapeutic paracentesis, thoracentesis, and routine upper endoscopy for variceal ligation in patients with hepatic synthetic dysfunction-induced coagulation abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunization, and/or transfusion reactions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimize clot formation in advanced liver disease: hematocrit ≥ 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL. Commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion, but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary international normalized ratio target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the utility of this agent significantly. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate contains both pro- and anticoagulant factors that offer an attractive low-volume therapeutic to rebalance a disturbed hemostatic system. However, dosage is, in part, based on international normalized ratio, which is problematic in cirrhosis, and published experience in liver disease is limited. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Anti-fibrinolytic therapy may be considered in patients with persistent bleeding from mucosal oozing or puncture wound bleeding consistent with impaired clot integrity. Both ε-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit clot dissolution. Neither is believed to generate a hypercoagulable state, although both may exacerbate pre-existing thrombi. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Desmopressin releases von Willebrand factor as its primary hemostatic mechanism. As this factor is usually elevated in cirrhosis, the agent lacks a sound evidence-based foundation, but may be useful in patients with concomitant renal failure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Systemic heparin infusion is recommended for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis, but there are unresolved issues regarding monitoring with both the anti-Xa assay and the partial thromboplastin time due to cirrhosis-related antithrombin deficiency (heparin cofactor). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Treatment of incidental portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis depends on estimated impact on transplantation surgical complexity vs risks of bleeding and falls. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and direct-acting anticoagulants improve portal vein repermeation vs observation alone. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Direct-acting anticoagulants, such as the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors, are relatively safe and effective in stable cirrhotic patients, but are in need of further study in patients with more advanced liver disease.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^7adf178e]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^4fc589af]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Early (within minutes of arrival to a trauma centre) administration of plasma, platelets and RBC is also supported by the first RCT designed to evaluate the benefit of blood product ratios (1:1:1 or 1:1:2 FFP:platelets:RBC) on patient outcome. More patients in the 1:1:1 group achieved haemostasis and fewer experienced death as a result of exsanguination at 24 h. However, a 1:1:1 ratio compared to a 1:1:2 ratio did not result in significant differences in all-cause mortality at 24 h or 30 days. Unfortunately, this study did not independently examine the effects of plasma and platelets on outcomes.

A theoretical shortcoming of ratio-driven resuscitation is over-transfusion with plasma and platelets, resulting in no benefit or in added morbidity such as multiple organ failure. Recent observations suggest that both early FFP (0–6 h) and delayed (7–24 h) platelet transfusions are risk factors for hypoxaemia and ARDS after 24 h, respectively. The age of transfused platelets may also play a role. Although decreased morbidity due to aggressive use of plasma and platelets has been reported, evidence for routine early prophylactic platelet transfusion as part of a massive transfusion protocol is weak.

Calcium

Recommendation 30

We recommend that ionised calcium levels be monitored and maintained within the normal range during massive transfusion. (Grade 1C)

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^7ce9e139]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Quality management

Recommendation 37

We recommend that each institution include an assessment of adherence to the institutional algorithm in routine quality management. (Grade 1C)

Rationale

The development of a multi-disciplinary evidence-based treatment algorithm for the bleeding trauma patient offers a unique opportunity to create awareness among all involved medical specialities and to improve mutual understanding. The treatment algorithm allows, within the framework of the available evidence, flexibility to accommodate local pre-hospital rescue conditions, locally available diagnostic and therapeutic options and improves the consistency of care. Numerous examples demonstrate the value of a treatment algorithm in improving the care of trauma patients; some also resulted in cost savings. Conversely, deviation from treatment pathways increases morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, with a three-fold increased mortality in the subgroup of major deviations.

The implementation of our recommendations and adherence to a local treatment algorithm is facilitated by a checklist analogous to the Safe Surgery Initiative. Suggested items that should be included in such a checklist are summarised in Table 4. Trauma treatment training should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm.

Table 4
Treatment pathway checklist

N/A, not applicable.

In addition, adherence to the institutional treatment algorithm should be included as part of routine institutional quality management. Most institutions have established a quality improvement program to assist clinical teams in evaluating their own performance. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that the following quality standards be used:

â€¢ Time from injury to the initiation of intervention to stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypotensive patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.

â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full set of blood results (full blood count, PT, fibrinogen, calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)).

â€¢ Proportion of patients receiving TXA before leaving the emergency room.

â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to CT scan in bleeding patients without an obvious source of hemorrhage.

â€¢ Damage control surgical techniques are used in accordance with Recommendation 21.

â€¢ Thromboprophylaxis commenced in accordance with Recommendation 34.

Extended post-discharge follow-up times may be required to provide longer-term outcome data, because an increasing percentage of trauma mortality occurs after hospital discharge. Approximately 50% of mortality among trauma patients older than 65 years of age occurs between 30 days and 6 months after injury.

Introduction

Aims of these guidelines and specific objectives

Please refer to the original ASH guideline on thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19.

Description of the health problem

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant public health impact. As of 2 May 2021, more than 152 million cases and 3.2 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19–related illness globally. It is estimated that 5% to 20% of infected patients require hospital admission, of whom 5% to 15% may develop critical illness requiring intensive care support.

Patients with critical illness resulting from COVID-19 may develop a severe inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction, which may result in platelet activation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and a hypercoagulable state. Several laboratory predictors of thrombosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have been reported, including elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.VTE has emerged as an important complication in critically ill patients with COVID-19, occurring in up to 23% of such patients. This was observed in the very early days of the pandemic, but it remains an important issue, even with the introduction of improved treatments in subsequent waves of the pandemic. In addition, arterial thrombotic complications including stroke have been noted. Microvascular thrombosis, which may involve the pulmonary vasculature and other organs, has been reported in autopsy studies, although its impact on the development of respiratory and multiorgan failure remains unclear. Patients who are critically ill may also be at increased bleeding risk, which may be a result of platelet dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, organ dysfunction, or consumptive coagulopathy.

The optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy that balances thrombotic and bleeding risk in critically ill patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. This uncertainty has led to variability in clinical practice regarding empiric thromboprophylaxis regimens, and several randomized trials are in progress. Although COVID-19–associated coagulopathy seems to be marked primarily by thrombotic complications, patients may develop major bleeding complications when receiving anticoagulation therapy, which can have an impact on the safety of intensified thromboprophylaxis regimens. In this living guideline update, the role of intermediate- vs prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is addressed.

Description of the target populations

The target population, patients with COVID-19–related critical illness, is described in Table 2.

Pre-Hospital Mass Casualty Triage and Trauma Care Topic Collection June 10, 2025. Topic Collection: Pre-Hospital Mass Casualty Triage and Trauma Care Performing triage and trauma care during a mass casualty incident requires efficiency and coordination among multiple response entities. Efforts may need to be directed toward doing the greatest good for the greatest amount of people, which is counter to day-to-day trauma triage. Simple actions to control bleeding and manage breathing issues can, and do, save lives, and should be part of on-scene care, as appropriate. Research indicates that the most effective triage is performed by experienced providers using their clinical skill. There are many triage tools and protocols such as Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment and Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment/Transport.

These tools are valuable to personnel that do not routinely triage trauma patients but are not likely to be remembered unless incorporated into triage tags. Trauma criteria applied on an everyday basis to categorize patients as critical should also be applied during mass casualty situations whenever relevant as this generates practice and familiarity. The safety of first responders and pre-hospital providers is always paramount, and when adequate transportation resources are available triage activities should not delay rapid transport to a trauma hospital. Mass shooting and bombing events require a different approach to patient triage and initial treatment as described in Mass Casualty Trauma Triage Paradigms and Pitfalls.

This Topic Collection can help hospital emergency planners, EMS personnel, and emergency medicine clinicians understand the basics of field triage and immediate stabilization of MCI victims. Lessons learned from recent incidents are included. For incident-specific information, access our Topic Collections on Burns, Active Shooter and Explosives, and Radiological and Nuclear Events.

### Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adult trauma patients with refractory acute cardiopulmonary failure: guideline from the Chinese society of extracorporeal life support 2025 [^05b55f43]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Justification and implementation considerations. Massive bleeding or hemorrhagic shock is among the primary causes of early death in trauma patients, which may create the traumatic lethal triad in terms of coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis, significantly increasing the mortality risk of patients with massive but potentially survivable injuries. With the advances in anticoagulant strategies and devices, trauma-induced coagulopathy is no longer an absolute contraindication of ECMO, which in turn may provide survival benefits for trauma patients who failed to respond to maximal DCR. Although insufficient data and inherent defects, such as the retrospective nature, high risk of bias, and heterogeneity across the studies, hindered further analyses, considering the high mortality risk of patients with the traumatic lethal triad and the serious concern about the risk of bleeding by physicians and surgeons who are responsible for ECMO management and decisive surgery, the panel issued a best practice statement on the close monitoring and management of patients with a higher ISS or suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy during ECMO therapy. However, in the context of ECMO therapy, the diagnostic indices for coagulopathy should be treated with caution, and the clinical observation, severity of injury, and physician's judgment are still of paramount importance in the early detection of the traumatic lethal triad.

Recommendation 10. We suggest that bedside ultrasound be used to optimize fluid management in adult trauma patients requiring ECMO (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^ea7dc900]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for transfusion strategies in critical care, more specifically with respect to massive bleeding (plasma transfusion), ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend to guide further use of FFP, if a fresh-frozen plasma-based coagulation resuscitation strategy is used in patients with traumatic hemorrhage, by standard laboratory coagulation screening parameters (PT and/or aPTT > 1.5 times normal and/or viscoelastic evidence of a coagulation factor deficiency).

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for plasma transfusion [^a5882090]. Transfusion (2010). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based plasma transfusion guidelines — scope and outcomes were defined with questions framed by patient groups, plasma transfusion as the intervention, and a comparator most often of "no plasma transfusion," with mortality as the primary outcome; studies using other comparators (e.g., prothrombin complex concentrate) were outside scope, the use of plasma during plasma exchange was not addressed since it had been examined elsewhere, and dosage guidance could not be issued due to data limitations; the systematic review focused on short-term outcomes (up to 30 days), presented both absolute and relative effect measures, and provided tentative GRADE-quality criteria for each outcome.

---

### Simplified treatment algorithm for the management of trauma-induced hemorrhage without viscoelastic testing [^f9a7f219]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Uncontrolled bleeding after major trauma remains a significant cause of death, with up to a third of trauma patients presenting with signs of coagulopathy at hospital admission. Rapid correction of coagulopathy is therefore vital to improve mortality rates and patient outcomes in this population. Early and repeated monitoring of coagulation parameters followed by clear protocols to correct hemostasis is the recommended standard of care for bleeding trauma patients. However, although a number of treatment algorithms are available, these are frequently complex and can rely on the use of viscoelastic testing, which is not available in all treatment centers. We therefore set out to develop a concise and pragmatic algorithm to guide treatment of bleeding trauma patients without the use of point-of-care viscoelastic testing. The algorithm we present here is based on published guidelines and research, includes recommendations regarding treatment and dosing, and is simple and clear enough for even an inexperienced physician to follow. In this way, we have demonstrated that treatment protocols can be developed and adapted to the resources available, to offer clear and relevant guidance to the entire trauma team.

### Emergency transfusions [^f5ca6dd3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Successful emergency transfusions require early recognition and activation of resources to minimize treatment delays. The initial goals should focus on replacement of blood in a balanced fashion. There is an ongoing debate regarding the best approach to transfusions, with some advocating for resuscitation with a fixed ratio of blood products and others preferring to use viscoelastic assays to guide transfusions. Whole-blood transfusion also is a debated strategy. Despite these different approaches, it generally is accepted that transfusions should be started early and crystalloid infusions limited. As hemodynamic stability is restored, endpoints of resuscitation should be used to guide the resuscitation.

### Hemorrhage and coagulopathy in the critically ill [^a4bf5d26]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Bleeding is the second leading cause of death after trauma. Initial care of the patient with hemorrhage focuses on restoring circulating blood volume and reversing coagulopathy. Trauma and injury can initiate the coagulation cascade. Patients with massive bleeding should be resuscitated with goal-directed therapy. Hemostatic resuscitation in conjunction with ratio-based transfusion and massive transfusion protocols should be utilized while awaiting hemorrhage control. The military initiated massive transfusion protocols in the battlefield. We discuss the coagulation cascade, recent recommendations of goal-directed therapy, massive transfusion protocols, fixed ratios, and the future of transfusion medicine.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^1d915d93]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

It is often misunderstood that the conventional coagulation screens [PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)] only provide information on levels of coagulation factor. These values, therefore, will typically appear normal during early blood loss, despite the potential for an underlying activation of coagulation and thrombus formation. The turnaround time for results of VEM [TEG®, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®)], as for POC PT/INR, has been shown to be significantly shorter than conventional laboratory testing, with a time saving of 30–60 min. VEM may also be useful in the detection of coagulation abnormalities associated with the use of direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran, argatroban, bivalirudin or hirudin, although these tests cannot discriminate between the effects of inhibitors and the impact of traumatic coagulopathy.

VEM provides a rapid assessment of haemostasis to support clinical decision-making. This in turn has generated a growing confidence in these methods and increased use in children, adolescent and adult patients. To date, however, only one open randomised controlled study has been completed, which involved 111 injured patients from an academic level-1 trauma centre meeting criteria for massive transfusion protocol activation. Patients were randomised to receive either a massive transfusion protocol goal-directed using TEG® or by conventional coagulation assays (CCA). Survival at 28 days in the TEG® group was significantly higher than the CCA group, with 20 deaths in the CCA group (36.4%) compared with 11 in the TEG® group (19.6%) (p = 0.049). Most bleeding deaths occurred within the first 6 h following patient arrival at the clinic (21.8% CCA group vs 7.1% TEG® group) (p = 0.032). CCA patients required a similar number of RBC units as the TEG® patients but more plasma units [CCA, 2.0 (0–4); TEG®, 0.0 (0–3)] (p = 0.022), and more platelet units [CCA, 0.0 (0–1); TEG®, 0.0 (0–0)] (p = 0.041) in the first 2 h of resuscitation. Despite these very promising results, it should be noted that this study was open, unblinded, and that randomisation into either of the two treatment modalities was based on alternating weeks, which potentially introduces a bias into the care of the patients.

### The use of viscoelastic haemostatic assays in the management of major bleeding: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^7db97dbd]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for transfusion strategies in critical care, more specifically with respect to coagulation and viscoelastic testing, BSH 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that normal viscoelastic hemostatic assay results confer a high negative predictive value for transfusion need in trauma patients, enabling the clinical team to monitor the patient closely without immediate activation of the major hemorrhage protocol.

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: a clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^e88c82b5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop evidence-based clinical practice recommendations regarding transfusion practices and transfusion in bleeding critically ill adults.

Methods

A taskforce involving 15 international experts and 2 methodologists used the GRADE approach to guideline development. The taskforce addressed three main topics: transfusion support in massively and non-massively bleeding critically ill patients (transfusion ratios, blood products, and point of care testing) and the use of tranexamic acid. The panel developed and answered structured guideline questions using population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) format.

Results

The taskforce generated 26 clinical practice recommendations (2 strong recommendations, 13 conditional recommendations, 11 no recommendation), and identified 10 PICOs with insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.

Conclusions

This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of massively and non-massively bleeding critically ill adult patients and identifies areas where further research is needed.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^ca0c7d03]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for disseminated intravascular coagulation, more specifically with respect to prothrombin complex concentrate, BCSH 2009 guidelines recommend to consider administering factor concentrates, such as prothrombin complex concentrate, if transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, recognizing that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors.

### COVID-19 coagulopathy and thrombosis: analysis of hospital protocols in response to the rapidly evolving pandemic [^826b6cd5]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

As the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread to the US, so too did descriptions of an associated coagulopathy and thrombotic complications. Hospitals created institutional protocols for inpatient management of COVID-19 coagulopathy and thrombosis in response to this developing data. We collected and analyzed protocols from 21 US academic medical centers developed between January and May 2020. We found greatest consensus on recommendations for heparin-based pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients without contraindications. Protocols differed regarding incorporation of D-dimer tests, dosing of VTE prophylaxis, indications for post-discharge pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, how to evaluate for VTE, and the use of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. These findings support ongoing efforts to establish international, evidence-based guidelines.

### Haematological management of major haemorrhage: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^80ccabd2]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to transfusion strategies, massive bleeding, BSH 2022 guidelines recommend to administer plasma (in a 1:1 ratio with RBCs) early as part of initial resuscitation in patients with major traumatic hemorrhage until results from coagulation monitoring are available.
