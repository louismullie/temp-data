## Question

Benzodiazepines chronic use sleep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks and benefits of chronic benzodiazepine use for sleep, and what the evidence-based recommendations are for clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and define chronic insomnia and the scope of benzodiazepine use. Then, I should appraise the efficacy evidence, including magnitude and durability of benefit. Next, I will examine safety, tolerance, and dependence risks, especially in older adults and special populations. After that, I need to review guideline positions and deprescribing strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Chronic insomnia disorder is defined by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with daytime consequences persisting for at least 3 months, and it is common, with prevalence around 10–20% and a chronic course in many patients, which frames the relevance of long-term treatment decisions [^10b42412] [^a9f76275]. Benzodiazepines have historically been used for insomnia, but contemporary guidelines emphasize short-term use only, so I need to ensure I'm aligning with current standards before drawing conclusions [^95109e5a] [^10b42412].

> I will now examine the efficacy evidence for benzodiazepines in chronic insomnia. Meta-analyses show small-to-moderate short-term improvements in sleep latency, total sleep time, and awakenings, with effect sizes around 0.5–0.7 for key sleep variables, but most trials are short, often ≤ 4 weeks, and long-term randomized data are sparse, limiting confidence in sustained benefit [^909120d5] [^4d8b913a] [^8280c532]. Wait, let me verify durability claims: some narrative reviews suggest therapeutic effects may diminish within days to weeks due to neuroadaptation, which aligns with clinical observations of tolerance, though high-quality long-term RCTs are limited, so I should be cautious not to overstate this as definitive [^d705e6dc] [^45bd37bc].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability, especially with chronic use. Benzodiazepines are associated with cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, motor vehicle accidents, respiratory depression, and dependence, with risks amplified in older adults and when combined with other CNS depressants; the Beers Criteria advise avoidance for insomnia in older adults, and observational data link chronic use to increased dementia risk, though confounding remains a concern [^980ec8bd] [^25ec21b0] [^fd72665c]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of specific harms: meta-analyses in older adults show markedly increased risks of daytime sedation, cognitive impairment, and psychomotor effects, and population data associate current or recent benzodiazepine use with higher hip fracture risk, reinforcing the need to avoid long-term use when possible [^29aee3dd] [^d705e6dc].

> I need to check the tolerance and dependence dynamics. Chronic benzodiazepine exposure leads to receptor-level adaptations that can blunt efficacy while maintaining or increasing adverse effects, and withdrawal symptoms are common and sometimes prolonged, complicating discontinuation and exposing patients to rebound insomnia and anxiety [^d705e6dc] [^fd72665c]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup retains benefit long term: even where patients report perceived benefit, objective sleep architecture may be impaired with reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep, and polysomnographic studies of chronic users show altered sleep macrostructure that may not normalize quickly after withdrawal, underscoring the disconnect between subjective and objective outcomes [^b5960002] [^23df3315].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with best practice. Major guidelines converge on limiting benzodiazepines to short-term use only, typically ≤ 4 weeks, and recommend CBT-I as first-line for chronic insomnia; the AASM gives only weak recommendations for specific hypnotics and emphasizes individualized risk–benefit assessment, while the VA/DoD recommends against benzodiazepines for chronic insomnia disorder outright [^95109e5a] [^d1ef4a8e] [^10b42412]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: some guidelines allow for carefully selected, intermittent, long-term use only after shared decision-making and failure of safer alternatives, but this remains a minority position and requires close monitoring [^5cdea689].

> I will now examine deprescribing and discontinuation strategies, since many patients are already on chronic benzodiazepines. Supervised tapering, often combined with CBT-I, achieves high rates of dose reduction or cessation with sustained benefits; direct-to-patient behavioral interventions and structured programs also reduce sedative use and improve sleep outcomes, supporting scalable approaches in primary care [^b5960002] [^7c180bfa] [^f0506b7e]. Wait, let me verify adjuncts during taper: some evidence supports pharmacologic adjuncts such as antidepressants or pregabalin to mitigate withdrawal, but data are heterogeneous and generally low quality, so I should frame these as optional, individualized strategies rather than routine [^943757d7] [^fd72665c].

> But wait, what about special populations where the risk–benefit calculus shifts? In older adults, the harms of benzodiazepines clearly outweigh benefits for insomnia, with increased falls, fractures, cognitive decline, and delirium; in patients with comorbid OSA, respiratory depression risk is a major concern; and in those with substance use disorders, misuse and overdose risk rise substantially, especially with concomitant opioids, so I should avoid benzodiazepines in these groups whenever possible [^980ec8bd] [^223979bb] [^7fce1d1c]. Hold on, I should verify that even short-acting agents carry risks: yes, both long- and short-acting benzodiazepines impair balance, cognition, and driving safety, and the dose and half-life modulate but do not eliminate risk [^980ec8bd] [^fd72665c].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For patients with chronic insomnia, prioritize CBT-I as first-line and reserve pharmacotherapy for adjunctive, short-term use when necessary; if a hypnotic is used, choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration, avoid benzodiazepines in older adults, those with OSA, cognitive impairment, or SUD, and plan a taper from the outset with patient education about dependence and withdrawal [^d1ef4a8e] [^aa3dcb14] [^e9f41277]. I should double-check that alternatives with better safety profiles are reasonable: non-benzodiazepine BzRAs, melatonin agonists, and dual orexin receptor antagonists have modest efficacy and different risk profiles, and may be considered short term when CBT-I is unavailable or insufficient, again with counseling on complex sleep behaviors and fall risk [^9a5f8f0e] [^aa3dcb14].

> Finally, I need to acknowledge uncertainties and research gaps. High-quality, head-to-head, long-term trials comparing benzodiazepines with CBT-I and newer hypnotics are sparse; most pharmacologic studies are industry-sponsored and short, complicating inference about durability and safety; and we lack robust biomarkers or phenotypes to predict who, if anyone, might safely benefit from prolonged benzodiazepine therapy for insomnia [^aa41c214] [^8280c532]. Hmm, wait a minute, could emerging neurobiologic work on hyperarousal or legacy effects change this? Possibly, but current evidence does not support routine long-term benzodiazepine use for chronic insomnia outside of rare, individualized exceptions after shared decision-making and specialist input [^063aea02] [^15285c01].

Chronic benzodiazepine use for sleep is **not recommended** because benefits wane with tolerance [^d705e6dc], while risks of cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, dependence, and withdrawal persist [^fd72665c] [^980ec8bd]. Guidelines advise **limiting use to ≤ 4 weeks** [^95109e5a] and prefer CBT-I as first-line therapy [^d1ef4a8e]; if medication is needed, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with a planned taper [^aa3dcb14] [^e9f41277]. For long-term management, consider non-benzodiazepine options (e.g. melatonin, doxepin, orexin antagonists) and implement deprescribing strategies when possible [^aa3dcb14] [^f0506b7e].

---

## Efficacy of chronic benzodiazepine use for sleep

- **Short-term efficacy**: Benzodiazepines reduce sleep latency, increase total sleep time, and decrease awakenings over 1–4 weeks [^4d8b913a] [^909120d5].

- **Tolerance**: Therapeutic effects diminish within days to weeks due to receptor adaptations, limiting long-term efficacy [^d705e6dc] [^45bd37bc].

- **Lack of long-term benefit**: No robust evidence supports sustained efficacy beyond 4 weeks; chronic use does not improve sleep quality or duration [^d705e6dc] [^8280c532].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of chronic benzodiazepine use

- **Cognitive impairment**: Chronic use is linked to memory deficits, attention problems, and executive dysfunction [^fd72665c] [^25ec21b0].

- **Falls and fractures**: Increased risk, especially in older adults, with higher rates of hip fractures and hospitalizations [^980ec8bd] [^d705e6dc].

- **Dependence and withdrawal**: High risk of physical dependence; withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, rebound insomnia, seizures) are common and may be prolonged [^fd72665c] [^e9f41277].

- **Respiratory depression**: Risk is heightened in patients with OSA, COPD, or when combined with opioids or alcohol [^980ec8bd] [^f5174718].

- **Mortality**: Observational data associate chronic use with increased all-cause mortality, though confounding is possible [^80883157].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) | - Limit benzodiazepines to short-term use (≤ 4 weeks) [^notfound] <br/> - Prefer CBT-I as first-line therapy [^d1ef4a8e] |
| European Insomnia Guideline (EIN/ESRS 2023) | - Short-term use only (≤ 4 weeks) [^95109e5a] <br/> - Consider intermittent use in selected patients after individualized risk–benefit discussion [^5cdea689] |
| VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline | - Strongly recommend against benzodiazepines for chronic insomnia [^10b42412] <br/> - Emphasize CBT-I and safer pharmacologic alternatives [^aa3dcb14] |

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

- **Melatonin receptor agonists**: Ramelteon and prolonged-release melatonin are options for sleep-onset insomnia with favorable safety profiles [^6496eb84].

- **Sedating antidepressants**: Low-dose doxepin is FDA-approved for sleep maintenance; trazodone is commonly used off-label but with weaker evidence [^29880649].

- **Dual orexin receptor antagonists**: Suvorexant and lemborexant are effective for sleep onset and maintenance with lower dependence risk [^notfound].

- **Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs)**: Zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon are effective short-term but carry risks of dependence and complex sleep behaviors; use cautiously and at the lowest effective dose [^9a5f8f0e] [^28d3389c].

---

## Strategies for discontinuation and tapering

- **Gradual tapering**: Reduce dose by 25% every 1–2 weeks; adjust pace to withdrawal symptoms [^fb748453].

- **CBT-I**: Improves taper success and sleep outcomes; consider concurrent therapy [^b5960002].

- **Pharmacological adjuncts**: Gabapentin, pregabalin, or antidepressants may ease withdrawal; evidence is limited and individualized [^943757d7].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients warrant **extra caution or avoidance**:

- **Older adults**: Higher risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and delirium; avoid when possible [^980ec8bd] [^2693d8f2].

- **Patients with respiratory disorders**: Increased risk of respiratory depression; avoid in OSA/COPD [^980ec8bd] [^223979bb].

- **Patients with substance use disorders**: High risk of misuse, dependence, and overdose; avoid benzodiazepines [^fd72665c] [^7fce1d1c].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Chronic benzodiazepine use for sleep is **not supported** due to diminishing efficacy and substantial risks. Clinicians should:

- **Prioritize CBT-I**: First-line for chronic insomnia [^d1ef4a8e].

- **Limit benzodiazepines**: Use only short-term (≤ 4 weeks) at the lowest effective dose with a planned taper [^95109e5a] [^e9f41277].

- **Consider alternatives**: Melatonin agonists, low-dose doxepin, orexin antagonists, or carefully selected Z-drugs [^aa3dcb14].

- **Implement deprescribing**: Use gradual tapering and CBT-I to support discontinuation [^b5960002] [^f0506b7e].

In sum, **chronic benzodiazepine use for sleep is inappropriate**; reserve for short-term rescue while pursuing safer, evidence-based therapies.

Benzodiazepine receptor agonists and other hypnotics — geriatric cautions, adverse effects, and mitigation — are described as having pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences among older and younger adults, necessitating lower starting dosages; the American Geriatric Society Beers criteria recommend that benzodiazepines be avoided for treatment of insomnia in older patients and further recommend that newer generation benzodiazepine receptor agonists be limited to shorter-term use (< 90 days); adverse effect data do not suggest a high frequency of serious side effects but are scant and inconsistent, warranting caution, with reported adverse effects including dependency/withdrawal, cognitive impairment, falls/fractures, parasomnias, and driving impairment and motor vehicle accidents; complications are observed most frequently in older populations, with risks clearly increased in the elderly, at dosages in excess of those recommended, or when combined with other psychoactive agents; sedation-related complications are most likely with longer-acting agents and during morning hours following bedtime administration, and use of shorter-acting agents and the lowest effective dosage may help to reduce these complications; complete avoidance may be appropriate in select patients, particularly those with severe sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia, in whom use has been associated with respiratory suppression.

### Patient self-guided interventions to reduce sedative use and improve sleep… [^7c180bfa]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Can direct-to-patient mailed interventions reduce sedative use and improve sleep outcomes. Findings In this 3-arm, randomized clinical trial of 565 older adult users of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, Sleepwell, a knowledge mobilization and behavior change intervention, had the highest rate of sedative discontinuation and dose reduction compared with updated versions of informational booklets from the Eliminating Medications Through Patient Ownership of End Results study and treatment as usual, as well as improvements in sleep outcomes. The number needed to mail to have 1 person discontinue long-term sedative use was 5. 3 with Sleepwell and
7. 8 with EMPOWER. Meaning Transitioning insomnia care for older adults away from long-term sedative use and toward cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia can be achieved using a mailed, direct-to-patient approach.

Importance Direct-to-patient interventions enabling transitions from long-term benzodiazepine receptor agonist use to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia by older adults has the potential to reduce BZRA use and related harms while improving sleep outcomes without requiring prearranged clinician involvement. Objective To compare 2 direct-to-patient behavior change interventions with treatment as usual on BZRA use, sleep, and other health outcomes, and uptake of CBTI techniques. Design, Setting, and Participants. The Your Answers When Needing Sleep in New Brunswick study was a 3-arm, pragmatic, open-label, minimum-contact, randomized clinical trial. The study began November 2020 and ended June 2022. Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups, including 2 different mailed behavior change interventions or no intervention.

Participants were from communities across the province of New Brunswick, Canada, and included adults 65 years and older living independently with long-term use of BZRAs and current or past insomnia. Main Outcomes and Measures BZRA use at 6 months was the primary measure. Secondary measures included CBTI use, sleep, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, safety, anxiety, frailty, and quality of life. Results. Conclusions and Relevance Results of the YAWNS NB randomized clinical trial show that, as a simple, scalable, direct-to-patient intervention, YAWNS-1 substantially reduced BZRA use and improved sleep outcomes. It could be implemented to transform insomnia care for older adults at the population level. Trial Registration.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use eszopiclone as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zaleplon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use triazolam as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use trazodone as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tiagabine as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tryptophan as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use valerian as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK).

Quazepam — randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults with insomnia included seven studies; the methodologies were not comparable to the standard of data reporting required by GRADE and, therefore, no specific recommendation was made. Quazepam and its metabolites have long half-lives, raising concerns regarding accumulation and daytime impairment, and data regarding daytime sleepiness from these studies suggests a higher percentage of patients with somnolence in the active treatment group versus placebo, particularly at the 30 mg dosage.

Broad evidence synthesis — Wilt et al. systematic review and meta-analysis included 93 randomized controlled trials (≥ 4 weeks) and harms from 11 longer observational trials, finding that eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term outcomes with small effect sizes and low-to-moderate strength of evidence, while evidence for benzodiazepines (BZDs), melatonin agonists, and antidepressants was insufficient or too low; they concluded that comparative effectiveness and long-term efficacy remain insufficiently determined.

Sleep-promoting medications — evidence limitations and research needs — are characterized by overall quality of evidence that is relatively low in the vast majority of cases, with insufficient evidence for numerous drugs and highly variable, idiosyncratic data reporting that precludes comparing data from one study to another or conducting meta-analyses; virtually all studies of prescription hypnotic agents are industry-funded, and potential publication bias, particularly lack of publication of negative results, and the role of industry in study design and data analysis may compromise evidence quality and uniformity; with these limitations, the task force recommends for future investigations: clear definitions of inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequately powering studies to detect significant differences for key sleep variables, and development and utilization of uniform data collection instruments to improve cross-study analysis and comparisons.

### The efficacy and safety of drug treatments for chronic insomnia in adults: a meta-analysis of RCTs [^4d8b913a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hypnotics have a role in the management of acute insomnia; however, the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions in the management of chronic insomnia is unclear.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of drug treatments for chronic insomnia in adults.

Data Sources

Twenty-one electronic databases were searched, up to July 2006.

Study Selection

Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were eligible. Quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. Data were pooled using the random effects model.

Data Synthesis

One hundred and five studies were included in the review. Sleep onset latency, as measured by polysomnography, was significantly decreased for benzodiazepines (BDZ), (weighted mean difference: -10.0 minutes; 95% CI: -16.6, -3.4), non-benzodiazepines (non-BDZ) (-12.8 minutes; 95% CI: -16.9, -8.8) and antidepressants (ADP) (-7.0 minutes; 95% CI: -10.7, -3.3). Sleep onset latency assessed by sleep diaries was also improved (BDZ: -19.6 minutes; 95% CI: -23.9, -15.3; non-BDZ: -17.0 minutes; 95% CI: -20.0, -14.0; ADP: -12.2 minutes; 95% CI: -22.3, -2.2). Indirect comparisons between drug categories suggest BDZ and non-BDZ have a similar effect. All drug groups had a statistically significant higher risk of harm compared to placebo (BDZ: risk difference [RD]: 0.15; non-BDZ RD: 0.07; and ADP RD: 0.09), although the most commonly reported adverse events were minor. Indirect comparisons suggest that non-BDZ are safer than BDZ.

Conclusions

Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines are effective treatments in the management of chronic insomnia, although they pose a risk of harm. There is also some evidence that antidepressants are effective and that they pose a risk of harm.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^d705e6dc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks. This guidance reflects the general lack of evidence for the long-term clinical benefit of BZDs, as well as research demonstrating that the clinical benefits may decrease over time while the risks persist. – Meta-analyses of patients taking BZDs for insomnia demonstrated minor improvements in sleep onset, increased sleep duration, and decreased nighttime awakenings. However, therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks due to changes in BZD receptor density and/or affinity resulting from chronic use, while risks remain present. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BZDs to placebo for insomnia in adults over age 60 showed a 3.8-fold increase in daytime sedation, a 4.8-fold increase in cognitive impairment, and a 2.6 fold increase in incidence of psychomotor effects (e.g. falls, motor vehicle accidents). Another meta-analysis showed an increased risk of hip fractures (RR 1.34) associated with current and recent BZD use in older adults. In addition to its psychomotor effects, BZDs may increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension in older adults, which also contributes to fall risks.

Although long-term BZD use should generally be avoided, exceptions do exist. For example, long-term BZD use may be indicated in patients with severe treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or bipolar spectrum disorders. – Long-term BZD use may also be appropriate for medical conditions such as complex seizure disorders, spasticity, sleep disorders involving abnormal movements (e.g. rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome), and catatonia. Finally, BZDs have a role in palliative and end-of-life care. In any of these patient populations, clinicians should consider consulting with an appropriate specialist to determine whether BZD tapering is indicated and manage the process when it is.

Comparative effectiveness — Winkler and Doering review of 31 randomized trials reported that benzodiazepines (BZDs) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) were significantly more effective than antidepressants for primary insomnia, both showed small to moderate effect sizes for major sleep variables, BZDs were somewhat superior to BzRAs for subjective sleep latency (SL), and adverse events were not analyzed.

### Benzodiazepine use disorder: common questions and answers [^fd72665c]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse-use of a drug in a way that a doctor did not direct-accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes. Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.

Guideline recommendation scope and strength — these analyses yield recommendations for use of a limited number of drugs for a limited number of specific indications such as sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance, and in all cases the recommendations are "weak", based on relatively limited and/or low quality evidence; many agents shown to be "statistically significantly superior" to placebo may nonetheless be "not recommended", reflecting differences between FDA criteria and the GRADE approach, which establishes evidence quality ratings and clinical significance thresholds not used in individual studies or FDA approval, and each prescriber bears responsibility for treatment determinations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^ebfbd19e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Insomnia — methodologic priorities and overarching conclusions emphasize standardized statistical analysis and data presentation with means ± SD for sleep outcomes, with transformations for non-normally distributed variables and efforts to report means and SD across studies. Beyond individual sleep variables, achieving remission of chronic insomnia disorder should be considered as a clinically relevant outcome for pharmacological trials. The document urges to encourage funding for independent, non-industry investigation of the efficacy and effectiveness of hypnotic medications, notes that adverse event data are not collected and analyzed in standard ways with a need to standardize the assessment of adverse effects data, and highlights daytime safety by recognizing potential risk of motor vehicle or occupational accidents and that further efforts to include objective assessments of performance impairments which may be associated with daytime sedation is encouraged. Pediatric evidence is limited despite use, as virtually no data exists regarding the use of sleep-promoting agents in children and adolescents and such medications are not infrequently used in this age group. The summary states it relies heavily on rigorous evaluation of the quality of evidence for efficacy, based on GRADE and that foundational data are sorely limited, concluding that many commonly used drugs, including some which carry FDA approval for treatment of insomnia, are not recommended, and advising clinicians to continue to exercise sound clinical judgment considering experience, prior response, preferences, and adverse effects.

### Hypnotic medication in the treatment of chronic insomnia: non nocere! doesn' T anyone care? [^dd82c8b2]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2000). Low credibility.

Chronic primary insomnia is a recurrent condition that negatively effects the daily functioning of patients, diminishing the quality of their lives. It is associated with, and in some situations, is a risk factor in both psychiatric (depression) and physical (cardiovascular) illness. Treatment effectiveness has been shown in the short term for both drug (benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine agonists) and behavioral treatment. Expert opinion has strongly advised against long-term drug treatment because of concerns about residual sedative effects, memory impairment, falls, respiratory depression, rebound insomnia, medication abuse, dose escalation, dependency and withdrawal difficulties, and an increased risk of death possibly associated with the current hypnotic medications. Many of these concerns could be made against using these agents at all. Worries about these potential problems are challenged by the widespread clinical practice of using hypnotic drugs long-term without any of these difficulties developing and with patients who feel their sleep and daily function function is improved with the nightly use of their sleeping pill. The ability to mount a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind trial of hypnotic medication in primary insomnia may not be possible. We may have to develop large systematic clinical databases, a number of case series in effect, to monitor both emergent symptoms and possible clinical effectiveness. There is the additional concern that there is a reluctance to examine the long-term drug treatment of insomnia. This reluctance may reflect a negative moral judgement about treating primary insomnia with drugs, a sort of < < < < pharmacological Calvinism > > > >, rather than just a data based judiciousness.

### The treatment of chronic insomnia: drug indications, chronic use and abuse liability. summary of a 2001 new clinical drug evaluation unit meeting symposium [^886163fb]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

This paper summarizes a group of presentations and panel discussions on chronic insomnia at the 2001 NCDEU meeting. The presentations and discussions focused on the twin issues of efficacy and concerns of abuse liability with long-term hypnotic therapy. The panel concluded that insomnia may be an epidemiological marker for a variety of difficulties including accidents, increased health care utilization and subsequent development of major depression. Whether or not treatment of insomnia will prevent these long-term problems has not yet been determined. Since the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia. Some participants expressed concern at the lack of data for this practice, particularly the absence of dose-response and tolerance information, and noted that the small amount of efficacy data available is not encouraging. Similarly, there are minimal data to support the use of antihistamines as sleep aids; moreover, their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be under appreciated. The limited data available on nightly long-term usage of the newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, primarily of six-months' duration, suggest an absence of tolerance, but more data for both nightly and non-nightly administration are needed. Insomniacs tend to show therapy-seeking, rather than drug-seeking behavior, and patients without histories of drug abuse are unlikely to self-escalate dosage of currently available hypnotics. There is fairly good agreement on the characteristics of an ideal hypnotic. All currently available agents, while effective and safe, do not achieve this ideal. The next few years are likely to see the appearance of a variety of agents with new and promising mechanisms of action.

### Association of benzodiazepines for sleep disorders with drug overdose risk… [^7fce1d1c]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Is benzodiazepine treatment for sleep, compared with alternative pharmacologic treatments, associated with increased risk of overdose among young people. Findings In this cohort study of 23 084 young people initiating benzodiazepine treatment and 66 706 initiating a comparator treatment, the risk of drug overdose in the 6 months after treatment start was elevated for young people starting benzodiazepine treatment compared with alternative treatments for sleep disorders. This risk was further heightened for young people with a recent prescription opioid fill. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that the elevated risk of drug overdose with benzodiazepine treatment compared with alternative pharmacologic treatments for sleep disorders is an important safety consideration when treating young people.

Importance Benzodiazepines are prescribed for the treatment of adolescent sleep disorders; however, benzodiazepine overdoses occur, often in combination with opioids. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study suggest that benzodiazepines, compared with alternative pharmacologic treatments for common sleep disorders, were associated with an increased risk of drug overdose among young people during the following 6-month period, especially among those with a recent opioid prescription. Drug overdose is an important safety consideration when treating young people with benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are 1 class of medications prescribed for the treatment of sleep disorders, 9–13 with selected benzodiazepines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia in adults.

Although benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed, including to young people, 11, 14–16 they are recommended less frequently for insomnia among children than among adults given the lack of efficacy and safety data for younger age groups. 8, 17 When benzodiazepines are prescribed for any age group, short-term treatment is recommended.
6. We therefore sought to evaluate whether benzodiazepine treatment compared with alternative prescription treatments for sleep disorders among young people was associated with increased drug overdose risk in the 6 months after treatment start, and whether this association varies by recent prescription opioid use. We hypothesized that, for young people, benzodiazepine treatment would be associated with an increased risk of drug overdose compared with alternative sleep medications. New users of benzodiazepines and new users of comparator drugs had many similar characteristics.

### The treatments of chronic insomnia: a review of benzodiazepine receptor agonists and psychological and behavioral therapies [^45bd37bc]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The present review provides an assessment of the efficacy and safety of benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) and psychological and behavioral interventions for insomnia. These methods include relaxation techniques, sleep hygiene rules, stimulus control, sleep restriction and cognitive techniques, often also referred to as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) when encompassing cognitive strategies and at least one kind of behavioral intervention. In order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of these standard treatments for insomnia, an integrative synthesis of the existing meta-analytic studies for each of the various treatment modalities was conducted. Where meta-analytic studies were not available, data from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The summary findings from this review are (1) BZRAs and psychological and behavioral methods are effective to treat insomnia in the short-term and the latter have significantly more durable effects when active treatment is discontinued; and (2) there is only very limited evidence that BZRAs retain their efficacy during long-term treatment. The present review underscores the need for further research regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of these treatments for insomnia, how this varies with age and comorbidity, and how the various treatment modalities impact (1) daytime functioning, (2) quality of life, (3) health care utilization; and (4) pharmacoeconomics. Finally, it is particularly important that studies be conducted to determine if successful insomnia treatment influences the clinical course of the diseases that often occur co-morbidly with sleep continuity disturbance.

Strength of recommendations — GRADE assessment and evidence synthesis specify that the GRADE approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence, with the task force using objective data whenever possible (e.g., polysomnography) and designating objective data as the primary determinant of quality of evidence. Recommendation formulation balanced quality of evidence, benefits versus harms, and patient values and preferences. For quality judgments, criteria included imprecision (when 95% CI cross the clinical significance thresholds), inconsistency (I² cutoff of 75%), indirectness (study population), and risk of publication bias (funding sources), and quality was based exclusively on studies included in meta-analyses. For meta-analyses, pooled results are expressed as the total number of patients, MD and 95% confidence interval (CI), with adverse events presented as risk difference.

### What can predict and prevent the long-term use of benzodiazepines? [^bcf46d76]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Although benzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed for insomnia or anxiety, long-term use of BZDs causes serious adverse effects such as daytime drowsiness and cognitive decline. In the current study, we evaluated the predictors and preventers of long-term usage of BZDs from a retrospective survey by utilizing the 12-year prescription record of a university hospital. From the prescription data of 92,005 people, users of BZDs (n = 3,470, male = 39.2%, mean age = 60 ± 17.5) were analyzed. During this period, both the number of prescriptions (2722 in 2004 to 1019 in 2016) and the number of BZDs (1.73 in 2004 to 1.36 in 2016) gradually decreased, although more than half of the patients continued to take BZDs for over three years. High risk factors for long-term use of BZDs include elderly patients (> 65 years old), high dosage (> 5 mg diazepam per day), psychiatrist-prescribers, and users with polytherapy. Discontinuation is significantly found in users of hypnotic BZDs and alternative psychotropic medical drugs (including antipsychotics, serotonergic drugs, or newer types of sleep medicine). Future studies should focus on elucidating interventions that are more effective against long-term usage of BZDs.

### The association between benzodiazepine use and sleep quality in residential aged care facilities: a cross-sectional study [^afac8942]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The association between benzodiazepine use and sleep quality in residents of aged care facilities is dependent on the half-life and prescribing pattern of the benzodiazepine. Short-acting PRN benzodiazepines were associated with lower night time sleep quality and longer day-time napping compared to long-acting regular benzodiazepines. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these findings reflect channeling of the short-acting agents and PRN prescribing to residents at higher risk of sleep disorders, or acute rather than chronic insomnia. Further research should be undertaken to explore the effect of benzodiazepine dose and duration on sleep quality.

### Pharmacologic management of insomnia [^211d8cbe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for many types of insomnia, most notably transient insomnia associated with stress, acute illness, or jet lag. Many patients with chronic insomnia, including primary insomnia and insomnia secondary to a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders, also benefit from pharmacotherapy. Relatively few individuals receive prescription medication to help them sleep, and the majority use medication for a few nights to several weeks, as opposed to continuous use for months or years. The hypnotics available on the U.S. market today are benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs). The BZRAs are efficacious in reducing sleep latency, increasing total sleep time, reducing awakenings, and improving sleep quality without the development of tolerance in studies as long as 6 months. Side effects of the BZRAs are infrequent, dose-related, and related to the sedative properties of the drug. Sedating antidepressants are also frequently prescribed to promote sleep despite inadequate data to support their efficacy for this indication and a greater potential for clinically troublesome side effects.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^223979bb]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines for insomnia — systematic review findings and safety — showed "significantly improved sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, sleep quality, total sleep time (TST), and WASO relative to placebo", but "although they had significant findings, it was not clear whether these findings were clinically relevant", with "the longest duration of follow-up… approximately seven months" and "many trials… ≤ 12 weeks"; study quality "was generally rated as fair". The reviews noted gaps as "the studies did not examine harms, doses of benzodiazepines, and the time course of changes in treatment outcomes and adverse events (ranging from 2–224 days; majority were < 35 days of use)". Safety concerns are emphasized: "Benzodiazepines may have an adverse effect on sleep architecture (slow wave sleep suppression), are difficult to taper and discontinue, and have significant interactions with alcohol and other drugs, notably other CNS depressants", "may also have a negative impact on daytime functions (e.g., driving)", with "concerns about the risk of dependency and diversion" and potential harms in "older patients", those with "respiratory conditions (including sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation), neuromuscular diseases, and cognitive disorders", and those "at risk for falls"; "active-duty service member use of benzodiazepines may affect deploy ability".

### Opioid therapy and sleep disorders: risks and mitigation strategies [^0a913ca7]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with chronic pain frequently experience concomitant sleep disorders. There has been controversy on whether opioids have a beneficial or deleterious effect on sleep quality, duration and efficiency. There is also concern regarding the association between chronic opioid therapy (COT) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and the increased risk for unintentional opioid related overdose. This article provides a narrative review of the literature on the effect of opioids on sleep disorders and discusses risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

Design

A narrative review of the current literature on the effect of prescription opioids on sleep quality and efficiency, the relationship between opioids and sleep disorders and potential risk factors in patients with chronic pain.

Results

There is conflicting evidence regarding the benefit of opioids in improving sleep quality, duration and efficiency with several studies and reviews suggesting a beneficial effect of opioids on sleep and other studies demonstrating the opioids can cause sleep disturbance leading to hyperalgesia. There was credible evidence of a strong relationship between opioids and SDB with noted risk factors including use of methadone, high opioid dosing (> 200 mg MED) and combining opioids with benzodiazepines.

Conclusions

Further research is required to elucidate the effect of prescription opioids on sleep quality and pain intensity and the risks associated with opioids and SDB. The risk of SDB should be routinely assessed in patients on COT.

### Chronic insomnia [^ae9d21cc]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent complaint in clinical practice that can present independently or comorbidly with another medical or psychiatric disorder. In either case, it might need treatment of its own. Of the different therapeutic options available, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists (BzRAs) and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) are supported by the best empirical evidence. BzRAs are readily available and effective in the short-term management of insomnia, but evidence of long-term efficacy is scarce and most hypnotic drugs are associated with potential adverse effects. CBT is an effective alternative for chronic insomnia. Although more time consuming than drug management, CBT produces sleep improvements that are sustained over time, and this therapy is accepted by patients. Although CBT is not readily available in most clinical settings, access and delivery can be made easier through use of innovative methods such as telephone consultations, group therapy, and self-help approaches. Combined CBT and drug treatment can optimise outcomes, although evidence to guide clinical practice on the best way to integrate these approaches is scarce.

### Sleep, hypnotics and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^8fc05be5]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The quality of sleep is significantly compromised in many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may be further diminished when certain comorbidities are present. A reduced sleep quality is associated with daytime consequences like fatigue, psychiatric problems and an impaired quality of life. Sleep induces physiologic alterations in respiratory function, which can become pathologic and may provoke or worsen hypoxemia and hypercapnia in COPD. Dyspnea, cough and excessive mucus production should be optimised to minimise causes for sleep disturbance. Pharmacological therapy may be helpful; sedatives like benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine-receptor agonists (NBBRAs) are (equally) effective in improving sleep quality. Whether or not these hypnotics produce serious adverse respiratory effects during sleep, remains unclear due to opposing studies. Therefore, their use should be as short as possible.

### Insomnia [^a9f76275]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Insomnia is one of the most prevalent health concerns in the population and in clinical practice. Clinicians may be reluctant to address insomnia because of its many potential causes, unfamiliarity with behavioral treatments, and concerns about pharmacologic treatments.

Objective

To review the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of insomnia in adults.

Evidence Review

Systematic review to identify and summarize previously published quantitative reviews (meta-analyses) of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for insomnia.

Findings

Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability or fatigue during wakefulness. The prevalence of insomnia disorder is approximately 10% to 20%, with approximately 50% having a chronic course. Insomnia is a risk factor for impaired function, development of other medical and mental disorders, and increased health care costs. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors culminating in hyperarousal. The diagnosis of insomnia is established by a thorough history of sleep behaviors, medical and psychiatric problems, and medications, supplemented by a prospective record of sleep patterns (sleep diary). Quantitative literature reviews (meta-analyses) support the efficacy of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacologic interventions for insomnia. Brief behavioral interventions and Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy both show promise for use in primary care settings. Among pharmacologic interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although persistent concerns focus on their safety relative to modest efficacy. Behavioral treatments should be used whenever possible, and medications should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.

Conclusions and Relevance

Clinicians should recognize insomnia because of its effects on function and health. A thorough clinical history is often sufficient to identify factors that contribute to insomnia. Behavioral treatments should be used when possible. Hypnotic medications are also efficacious but must be carefully monitored for adverse effects.

### Benzodiazepine misuse in the elderly: risk factors, consequences, and management [^3ec737f0]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) inappropriate use (i.e., misuse and overuse) is a worldwide public health problem. Despite current knowledge about increased sensitivity to side effects in the elderly, that should lead to more caution, only a third of BZD prescriptions in this age group are considered appropriate. The most frequent inadequate situations are excessive duration and/or dosage of a medical prescription or self-medication, especially in a context where it would be contraindicated, e.g., long-acting BZD in the elderly. Polypharmacy and comorbidities are major risk factors. Consequences of BZD inappropriate use are falls, delirium and other cognitive dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, car accidents, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. An emerging concern is a potentially increased risk of dementia. Contrary to most clinicians' belief, discontinuation of chronic BZD use in elderly patients is feasible, with adequate psychotherapeutic or pharmacological strategies, and can lead to long-term abstinence. Brief cognitive therapy mostly relies on psychoeducation and motivational enhancement and is particularly useful in this context. Further research is needed, notably in three areas: (1) assessing the impact of public health programs to prevent BZD inappropriate use in the elderly, (2) developing alternative strategies to treat anxiety and insomnia in elderly patients, and (3) exploring the association between chronic BZD use and dementia.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^0e5d1389]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — PICO scope defines the population as "Adults who have been using one or more BZD medication for at least 2–4 weeks, including those with benzodiazepine use disorder". Interventions included "Interventions that promote the successful discontinuation of BZD use" and "Interventions that manage withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing BZDs". Comparators were "alternative interventions, treatment as usual, placebo, or active control condition", and outcomes included "BZD cessation or dose reduction, BZD withdrawal severity, recurrence or rebound of BZD-indicated conditions (e.g., insomnia, anxiety), sleep problems, cognition, mood, quality of life and patient satisfaction, global functioning, study attrition, other substance use, and adverse events".

### Randomized clinical trial of supervised tapering and cognitive behavior therapy to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in older adults with chronic insomnia [^b5960002]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the effectiveness of a supervised benzodiazepine taper, singly and combined with cognitive behavior therapy, for benzodiazepine discontinuation in older adults with chronic insomnia.

Method

Seventy-six older adult outpatients (38 women, 38 men; mean age of 62.5 years) with chronic insomnia and prolonged use (mean duration of 19.3 years) of benzodiazepine medication for sleep were randomly assigned for a 10-week intervention consisting of a supervised benzodiazepine withdrawal program (N = 25), cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (N = 24), or supervised withdrawal plus cognitive behavior therapy (N = 27). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3 and 12 months. The main outcome measures were benzodiazepine use, sleep parameters, and anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Results

All three interventions produced significant reductions in both the quantity (90% reduction) and frequency (80% reduction) of benzodiazepine use, and 63% of the patients were drug-free within an average of 7 weeks. More patients who received medication taper plus cognitive behavior therapy (85%) were benzodiazepine-free after the initial intervention, compared to those who received medication taper alone (48%) and cognitive behavior therapy alone (54%). The patients in the two groups that received cognitive behavior therapy perceived greater subjective sleep improvements than those who received medication taper alone. Polysomnographic data showed an increase in the amount of time spent in stages 3 and 4 sleep and REM sleep and a decrease in total sleep time across all three conditions from baseline to posttreatment. Initial benzodiazepine reductions were well maintained up to the 12-month follow-up, and sleep improvements became more noticeable over this period. No significant withdrawal symptoms or adverse events were associated with benzodiazepine tapering.

Conclusions

A structured, time-limited intervention is effective in assisting chronic users of benzodiazepine medication to discontinue or reduce their use of medication. The addition of cognitive behavior therapy alleviates insomnia, but sleep improvements may become noticeable only after several months of benzodiazepine abstinence.

### Benzodiazepine use and risk of Alzheimer's disease: case-control study [^25ec21b0]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and public health

Benzodiazepines are indisputably valuable tools for managing anxiety disorders and transient insomnia. As stated in international guidelines, however, treatments should be of short duration and not exceed three months.

Our study reinforces the suspicion of an increased risk of Alzheimer type dementia among benzodiazepine users, particularly long term users, and provides arguments for carefully evaluating the indications for use of this drug class. Our findings are of major importance for public health, especially considering the prevalence and chronicity of benzodiazepine use in older people and the high and increasing incidence of dementia in developed countries. In such conditions, a risk increased by 43–51% in users would generate a huge number of excess cases, even in countries where the prevalence of use of these drugs is not high.

To date, no preventive or curative treatment has been shown to be satisfactorily effective in Alzheimer's disease. For this reason, the search for putative alterable risk factors should be prioritised. Long term use of benzodiazepines and related drugs (such as other anxiolytics and hypnotics) could be a candidate because their association with Alzheimer's disease is at least plausible and this factor is typically alterable as only use over three months (that is, outside international recommendations and without a priori therapeutic justification) seems to be associated with an excess risk. This putative impact, added to other adverse consequences such as fractures related to falls, should be seriously considered by regulatory agencies and prescribers. In view of the evidence, it is now crucial to encourage physicians to carefully balance the benefits and risks when initiating or renewing a treatment with benzodiazepines and related products in older patients. Despite the lack of data in younger adults, the precautionary principle would also support extending that recommendation to them.

Unanswered questions and future research

Experimental animal or cellular models are needed to help in identifying a possible biological mechanism linking benzodiazepines with risk of Alzheimer's disease. Studies based on a long follow-up — that is, at least 20–30 years — would make it possible to evaluate the risk of long term use of benzodiazepines in younger adults and to better assess the exact role of anxiety, sleep disorders, and depression as putative early risk factors of future dementia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^fd281ce2]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

History of hypnotic usage — pharmacological agents have been used for insomnia throughout much of recorded history, with the first benzodiazepine (BZD) chlordiazepoxide introduced to the United States market in 1963, followed by diazepam. Flurazepam, the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved hypnotic BZD, became available in 1970 and rapidly supplanted barbiturates and similar compounds for treatment of insomnia. Zolpidem, the first United States nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist (non-BZD, BzRA), became available in 1992 and remains the most widely prescribed hypnotic medication, accounting for 87.5% of all BzRA prescriptions in a recent survey. Since 2005, ramelteon, low-dose doxepin, and suvorexant have entered the United States market.

### Benzodiazepines and zolpidem for chronic insomnia… [^909120d5]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Objective. — To evaluate the efficacy of benzodiazepines and zolpidem tartrate in chronic insomnia based on a quantitative review of literature. Data Sources. — Articles from 1966 to 1996 were identified using MEDLINE, by a manual review of relevant journals, and from bibliographies of identified articles. Study Selection. — Studies using randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or crossover designs with benzodiazepines or zolpidem in adults younger than 65 years with chronic insomnia were selected for review. Self-report and polysomnographic measures of sleep-onset latency, total sleep time, number of awakenings, and sleep quality were selected as outcomes. Data Extraction. — Twenty-two studies met the selection criteria. A combined test of P values was performed, pooling broadly from the 22 studies to determine whether medication was superior to placebo.

A combined test of effect sizes was performed on the subset of studies that reported effect size information to determine the magnitude of medication effect. Data Synthesis. — A homogeneous sample of studies summarized 1894 patients treated for a median duration of 7 days. The combined test of P values demonstrated that medication was superior to placebo in all 4 outcome measures. Treatment response was moderate in magnitude by the combined test of effect sizes. Conclusions. — Benzodiazepines and zolpidem produced reliable improvements in commonly measured parameters of sleep in patients with chronic insomnia. Relative to the chronic and recurring course of insomnia, both the limited duration of treatments studied and the lack of follow-up data from controlled trials represent challenges for developing evidence-based guidelines for the use of hypnotics in the management of chronic insomnia.

### Comparative safety of chronic versus intermittent benzodiazepine prescribing in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^3454f5d4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines (neuroscience-based nomenclature (NbN): positive allosteric modulators (GABA-A receptor, benzodiazepine site)) are a treatment for anxiety disorders and insomnia but are no longer considered the first-line treatment for either indication. However, benzodiazepine use remains widespread, especially in older adults. In recent data from Ontario, the prevalence of benzodiazepine use in community-dwelling older adults was 11%, with 60% using low doses (50% or less than the World Health Organization defined daily dose (DDD)), 25% using moderate doses (51–100% of the DDD) and 15% using high doses (greater than the DDD).

Regular benzodiazepine use over prolonged periods is controversial due to concerns of tolerance (leading to progressive elevation of dose), dependence, risk of difficult withdrawal and other adverse events. While older adults are susceptible to anxiety disorders and sleep problems, the potential for adverse consequences associated with the use of benzodiazepines appears to be greater than in younger people, particularly in terms of increased risk of falls, fractures, cognitive impairment and mortality. Older adults are more likely to adopt a chronic pattern of use, with one Canadian study reporting a mean duration of use of 75.5 days in new benzodiazepine users aged > 66 years. Other studies have suggested that the duration of use may be even longer, especially in older adults with comorbid dementia where a mean duration of 2 years has been reported.

The issues of whether benzodiazepines should be prescribed to older adults and if so whether treatment should be restricted to a maximum duration have been addressed by numerous national and international guidelines and position statements. However, the controversy is unresolved, and the guidelines have adopted contrasting positions. Some guidelines take the view that benzodiazepines should be avoided entirely in older adults. A second group, comprising both guidelines for adults and those specific to older adults, states that short-term benzodiazepine use may be acceptable for some indications. 'Short-term use' is often not defined but at least one guideline suggests a maximum duration of around 4 weeks. A further group of guidelines acknowledge that time-limited use is preferable, but allow for long-term use in circumstances where the benefits outweigh the risks.

Chronic insomnia pharmacologic treatment in adults — comparative efficacy and scope — notes that hypnotic medications are comparably efficacious to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during acute treatment, but the gains associated with CBT-I are durable following completion of treatment, whereas those associated with medication tend to dissipate following discontinuation; most investigations address relatively short-term use (e.g. one day to five weeks), and chronic use should be reserved for those individuals for whom CBT is either inaccessible or ineffective, who have been appropriately screened for contraindications, who maintain long-term gains with medication, and who are followed regularly; findings presented in this report apply only to adults, as none of the agents discussed are approved for use in children and none of the findings presented apply to children or adolescents.

### Treatment options for insomnia [^4961b355]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The frequency of sleep disruption and the degree to which insomnia significantly affects daytime function determine the need for evaluation and treatment. Physicians may initiate treatment of insomnia at an initial visit; for patients with a clear acute stressor such as grief, no further evaluation may be indicated. However, if insomnia is severe or long-lasting, a thorough evaluation to uncover coexisting medical, neurologic, or psychiatric illness is warranted. Treatment should begin with nonpharmacologic therapy, addressing sleep hygiene issues and exercise. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy. Exercise improves sleep as effectively as benzodiazepines in some studies and, given its other health benefits, is recommended for patients with insomnia. Hypnotics generally should be prescribed for short periods only, with the frequency and duration of use customized to each patient's circumstances. Routine use of over-the-counter drugs containing antihistamines should be discouraged. Alcohol has the potential for abuse and should not be used as a sleep aid. Opiates are valuable in pain-associated insomnia. Benzodiazepines are most useful for short-term treatment; however, long-term use may lead to adverse effects and withdrawal phenomena. The better safety profile of the newer-generation nonbenzodiazepines (i.e., zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopidone, and ramelteon) makes them better first-line choices for long-term treatment of chronic insomnia.

### Effects of pharmacotherapy on sleep-related outcomes in adults with chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^b11e0607]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Various national clinical practice guidelines include pharmacotherapy (e.g. analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants) as treatment options for CLBP. Many medications used for pain can have effects on sleep, which vary by medication types, sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency), and whether measures are subjectively or objectively collected. For example, an antidepressant (duloxetine), when compared to placebo, decreased self-reported sleep continuity (total sleep time and sleep efficiency) in patients with chronic diabetic peripheral neuropathy, while anticonvulsant (pregabalin) increased sleep continuity in the sample. These effects were not different to placebo when sleep was measured objectively via polysomnography. Medications used to manage sleep (e.g. sleep medications such as benzodiazepines, or antidepressants such as trazodone) are also often taken by patients with chronic pain, and effects on sleep and pain vary by types of medications and pain conditions. For example, a review reported that, diazepam (sleep medication) decreased pain in rheumatoid arthritis, but a combination of tenoxicam and bromazepam (both benzodiazepines) was not superior to placebo. Considering medications are often associated with adverse effects (e.g. nausea and vomiting from opioids, somnolence and fatigue from benzodiazepines) and increased risk of misuse or overdose, it is important that clinicians understand implications medications have on health factors (e.g. sleep in patients with CLBP) which may influence treatment outcomes. Additionally, understanding multitargeting properties of a medication can reduce fragmentation of care (where a single symptom is treated with a single medication) and the risks associated with concurrent use of multiple medications. Furthermore, prior findings based on heterogeneous or different chronic pain conditions may have limited generalisability to CLBP, given varying chronic pain conditions can respond differently to the same medicationand this can influence the sleep and pain relationship.

### Treatment of chronic insomnia in adults [^ac33386b]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Insomnia affects 30% of the U.S. population, with 5% to 15% meeting criteria for chronic insomnia. It can negatively impact quality of life, decrease productivity, increase fatigue and drowsiness, and put patients at higher risk of developing other health problems. Initial treatment focuses on nonpharmacologic therapies such as cognitive behavior therapy, which improves negative thought patterns and behaviors through sleep restriction, stimulus control, and relaxation techniques. Other nonpharmacologic treatments include exercise, mindfulness, and acupuncture. If these approaches are ineffective, pharmacologic agents may be considered. Medications such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are often prescribed for insomnia but should be avoided, if possible, due to short- and long-term risks associated with their use. Melatonin receptor agonists are safer and well tolerated but have limited effectiveness. Dual orexin receptor antagonists are effective in patients who have sleep maintenance insomnia or difficulty with sleep onset. Evidence for the use of antihistamines to treat insomnia is generally lacking, but doxylamine is effective for up to four weeks.

It states that "Short/intermediate acting benzodiazepine receptor agonists (benzodiazepines [BDZs] or newer BZD receptor agonist modulators [BzRAs]) or ramelteon were recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy", while "sedating antidepressants or anticonvulsant medications were recommended as second or third-line agents, particularly when comorbidities (e.g. mood disorder or epilepsy) are present", and "over-the-counter antihistamine sleeping aids and herbal/nutritional agents were not recommended due to lack of demonstrated efficacy as well as safety concerns". A British Association for Psychopharmacology consensus further notes that "prolonged-release melatonin was recommended as a first-line treatment for insomnia in persons over 55 years".

### Chronic benzodiazepine usage and withdrawal in insomnia patients [^a3019708]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We studied the sleep of patients with insomnia during continuous and very long-term use of benzodiazepines (BZDs), and after withdrawal. A group of 25 patients (mean age 44.3 ± 11.8 years) with persistent insomnia, who had been taking BZDs nightly for 6.8 ± 5.4 years was selected. The control group was comprised of 18 age-matched healthy individuals. Sleep stage parameters were analyzed during Night 1 (while taking BZDs), Night 2 (first night after completing BZD withdrawal), and Night 3 (15 days after gradual BZD withdrawal). Sleep data for control subjects was monitored in parallel. Sleep EEGs of the patients were analyzed using Period Amplitude Analysis (PAA), during Nights 1 and 3 only. During BZD use, a significant reduction of Total Sleep Time (TST) and increased sleep latency were found in the insomniac group when compared to controls. We found an increase in stage 2 non-REM (NREM) sleep, and a reduction in Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) when comparing to night 3 (after withdrawal). Sleep EEGs analysis showed an increase in sigma band and decrease in delta count in stages 2, 3, 4 NREM and REM sleep in the BZD group when comparing to night 3 (after withdrawal). During the BZD withdrawal period, six out of nine subjects taking lorazepam failed withdrawal. In the remaining 19 subjects, gradual withdrawal of BZDs was associated with immediate worsening of nocturnal sleep, as indicated by sleep parameters. However, 15 days after withdrawal (Night 3), some of the sleep structure parameters of patients were not significantly different from baseline (while taking BZDs), except for a significant increase in SWS and in delta count throughout most sleep stages, and a decrease in stage 2 NREM sleep. These values were not different from those shown by control subjects. REM sleep parameters showed no significant variation across the experimental conditions. Subjective sleep quality was significantly improved on Night 3 compared with Night 1.

Conclusions

Chronic intake of BZDs may be associated with poor sleep in this population. A progressive 15-day withdrawal did not avoid an immediate worsening of sleep parameters. But at the end of the protocol, SWS, delta count, and sleep quality were improved compared to those recorded during the chronic BZD intake, despite the lack of change in sleep efficiency.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^e5efa364]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Reduce and remove daily analgesic therapy

Regular analgesic use may be associated with increased pain sensitivity and should be withdrawn with careful weaning. For some patients, especially those who have been living with daily analgesia for sometimes months or even years, this approach can be quite distressing. Therefore, communication with both patient and their caregivers, including reasons for withdrawing medication and clear explanation of the entire pain management plan and outcome expectations, is essential, with confirmation that this information has been understood. If the patient is not fully committed to the structured pain management plan, improvement in outcomes is unlikely.

Pharmacological sleep management

Sleep is a critical component of treatment and sleep management aims to ensure sufficient quantity of good quality sleep.

Short-term use of benzodiazepines or z-drugs (zolpidem and zopiclone) may be helpful during the initial stage of pain management. However, this should be limited to the shortest time possible (ie, less than 2 weeks), with withdrawal as pain and function improve. Reasons for choosing these drugs should be discussed with the patient, including that the duration of use will be limited to a certain period of time, which must be specified.

Thereafter, if sleep remains a problem, short-term intermittent use of sedative antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, trazodone) is preferred. In carefully selected patients, it may be appropriate to prescribe Z-drugs for intermittent use. Because of potential for adverse effects, long-term use of benzodiazepines should be avoided (Box 6). Patients who are already taking benzodiazepines should preferably be slowly weaned (over approximately a month) until the medication can be discontinued altogether.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^f69814f6]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia pharmacotherapy — non-BZD BzRA use and recommendation: A non-BZD BzRA, if prescribed, should be at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration possible, and non-BZD BzRAs are also potentially inappropriate for geriatric patients according to the 2023 Beers Criteria; all patients should be counseled on the potential risks. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, therefore it is categorized as New-replaced, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low, and the benefits of improved sleep outcome measures slightly outweighed the potential harm of adverse events, which was small; thus, the Work Group decided on a Weak for recommendation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^03b372be]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines for low back pain — There is moderate quality evidence for acute low back pain (LBP) and low quality evidence for chronic LBP indicating that the harms/burden of benzodiazepine use outweigh the benefits, and the Work Group decided upon a Strong against recommendation. Reported harms included central nervous system adverse events such as somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness with benzodiazepines versus placebo, and the potential for abuse, addiction/dependence, overdose potentially resulting in death, respiratory depression, and sleep apnea. The adverse CNS effects may be even greater in patients also receiving other pain medication with similar side effects (polypharmacy), and risks are further compounded when combined with opioids, particularly for respiratory depression and overdose death. Subgroup considerations include patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at higher risk for respiratory depression or patients with comorbid SUD. The harms of benzodiazepines (potentially severe) outweighed the benefits with no benefit on pain severity or functional outcome, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate for acute LBP and low for chronic LBP.

### Polysomnographic findings in a cohort of chronic insomnia patients with benzodiazepine abuse [^9fa35df4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To evaluate sleep modifications induced by chronic benzodiazepine (BDZ) abuse.

Methods

Cohort study, comparison of sleep measures between BDZs abusers and controls. Drug Addiction Unit (Institute of Psychiatry) and Unit of Sleep Disorders (Institute of Neurology) of the Catholic University in Rome. Six outpatients affected by chronic BDZ abuse were enrolled, (4 men, 2 women, mean age 53.3 ± 14.8, range: 34–70 years); 55 healthy controls were also enrolled (23 men, 32 women, mean age 54.2 ± 13.0, range: 27–76 years). All patients underwent clinical evaluation, psychometric measures, ambulatory polysomnography, scoring of sleep macrostructure and microstructure (power spectral fast-frequency EEG arousal, cyclic alternating pattern [CAP]), and heart rate variability.

Results

BDZ abusers had relevant modification of sleep macrostructure and a marked reduction of fast-frequency EEG arousal in NREM (patients: 6.6 ± 3.7 events/h, controls 13.7 ± 4.9 events/h, U-test: 294, p = 0.002) and REM (patients: 8.4 ± 2.4 events/h, controls 13.3 ± 5.1 events/h, U-test: 264, p = 0.016), and of CAP rate (patients: 15.0 ± 8.6%, controls: 51.2% ± 12.1%, U-test: 325, p < 0.001).

Discussion

BDZ abusers have reduction of arousals associated with increased number of nocturnal awakenings and severe impairment of sleep architecture. The effect of chronic BDZ abuse on sleep may be described as a severe impairment of arousal dynamics; the result is the inability to modulate levels of vigilance.

### The neurobiology, investigation, and treatment of chronic insomnia [^063aea02]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic insomnia is defined by difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening, and is coupled with daytime consequences such as fatigue, attention deficits, and mood instability. These symptoms persist over a period of at least 3 months (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 criteria). Chronic insomnia can be a symptom of many medical, neurological, and mental disorders. As a disorder, it incurs substantial health-care and occupational costs, and poses substantial risks for the development of cardiovascular and mental disorders, including cognitive deficits. Family and twin studies confirm that chronic insomnia can have a genetic component (heritability coefficients between 42% and 57%), whereas the investigation of autonomous and central nervous system parameters has identified hyperarousal as a final common pathway of the pathophysiology, implicating an imbalance of sleep-wake regulation consisting of either overactivity of the arousal systems, hypoactivity of the sleep-inducing systems, or both. Insomnia treatments include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Treatments currently under investigation include transcranial magnetic or electrical brain stimulation, and novel methods to deliver psychological interventions.

### Lost in translation: toward clinically effective translational research [^15285c01]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Even shorter timeframes, however, have shown multi-pronged adaptive neural responses after use of both benzodiazepines and SSRIs. In terms of antidepressants, most chronic studies are focused on uncovering purportedly adaptive neuroadaptations or neuroplasticity, in accordance with the often short-term alleviation of symptoms that occurs in patients. Few if any studies have investigated neuroadaptation that occurs after truly long-term use. In patients, it is uncertain whether the changes induced by antidepressants revert to their original state upon discontinuation or if they persist. While a number of animal studies of the effects of benzodiazepine exposure have shown neuroadaptation and changes, many have been focused on tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal and so it is unclear to what extent these findings are relevant to these types of persistent syndromes in clinical populations.

While research on long-term effects of drugs used to treat mood and anxiety in clinical studies is ongoing, it has already been shown that other psychotropic medications, such as antipsychotics, can lead to lasting brain alterations, including tardive dyskinesia. Other potential long-term impacts of mood and anxiety medications also include "legacy effects", withdrawal, and rebound effects. "Legacy" effects are defined as the persistent impact that a medication has on an individual even after drug use has been discontinued. For example, persistent cognitive effects have been shown in individuals even after stopping or abstaining from benzodiazepine use, including impairments in recent memory, processing speed, visuoconstruction, divided attention, working memory, and sustained attention.

Withdrawal effects, which refer to the symptoms that occur when a person reduces or stops taking a drug, indicate that there are physiological changes that take place in response to the presence of a drug. These may include predictable "rebound" reactions, like anxiety after benzodiazepine withdrawal, poor sleep after medication used for insomnia, and hypersensitivity to pain in opiate withdrawal. Similarly, antidepressant withdrawal can range from mild to severe, with many experiencing significant symptoms lasting weeks to months, and sometimes longer.

### Current practice in benzodiazepine receptor agonists deprescribing on acute geriatric wards: a cohort study [^d9d8399a]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRA), including benzodiazepines and z-drugs, are the most prescribed psychotropic drugs in older people, with prescription rates ranging from 7% to 25% in elderly persons living in the community, to 52% in long-term-care residents, and 32.6% in hospitalised patients.

BZRAs may be appropriate in a few circumstances, such as seizure disorders or ethanol withdrawal. However, they are mainly used in the treatment of sleep disorders and anxiety. For these indications, they are often inappropriate because of their moderate and short-term efficacy and their numerous and serious adverse events, such as delirium, falls and fractures. Although, the American Geriatric Society, the START-STOPP criteria, and the FORTA list recommend that BZRAs should be avoided in all older people, and certainly in those with dementia, risk of delirium, or risk of falls.

Deprescribing can be defined as the process of withdrawal of an inappropriate medication under the supervision of a healthcare professional with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes. There is a growing body of evidence that BZRA deprescribing can reduce the risk of harm associated with chronic BZRA use, with no worsening of, or even improvement in, sleep quality, and reduction in anxiety or depression. The success rates reported in older people vary according to the definition of deprescribing (discontinuation only or dose reduction), the setting in which the effects of deprescribing are measured, the nature of the interventions, the type of analysis, and the follow-up duration. For example, BZRA deprescribing success rates range from 27% to 80% in older people living in the community, and from 33% to 66% in nursing-home settings.

### Benzodiazepine use in relation to long-term dementia risk and imaging markers of neurodegeneration: a population-based study [^8c1be2d6]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the availability of effective alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for anxiety and sleep problems, it is important to carefully consider the necessity of prolonged benzodiazepine use in light of potential detrimental effects on brain health. In our study, we observed an association between benzodiazepine use and subclinical accelerated reduction in hippocampal volume, which is in contrast with one earlier performed cross-sectional study, which reported larger hippocampal volumes in benzodiazepine users. While this cross-sectional study was performed within a memory-clinic population, our study is the first to focus on long-term associations within a cognitively healthy group. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the effect of benzodiazepines on brain volume are still unclear, one animal study showed decreased neuronal plasticity in mice when chronically exposed to benzodiazepines. In addition, benzodiazepines have suggested amyloid lowering properties. Several amyloid-lowering therapies have been associated with decrease in hippocampal volume without changes in clinical outcomes, of which mechanisms are still unexplained. Future studies should explore whether benzodiazepine use has distinct effects on specific dementia pathologies linked to amyloid deposition in limbic structures, such as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). Nonetheless, our result indicate that benzodiazepine use may have subtle, long-term impact on brain health, although we found no evidence of a dose–response relationship, and in contrast to dementia analyses, subgroup analyses did not support stronger effects in anxiolytics use compared to use of sedative-hypnotics. Meanwhile, our results support the current guidelines cautioning against long-term benzodiazepine prescription.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^e8e5d907]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^fb748453]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjusting the Taper Strategy

Tapering often does not proceed at the same pace over the entire process; rather, pacing should be flexibly adjusted based on patient response. Although clinicians and patients can prepare for the BZD tapering process by setting realistic expectations around the potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms a given patient may be likely to experience, accurately predicting the extent and severity of symptoms that may manifest once tapering is underway is difficult. For this reason, clinicians should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each dose reduction and counsel them to report any concerning symptoms. Clinicians should discuss this inherent uncertainty with patients so that, together, they can adjust planned tapering strategies as necessary.

Some patients may interpret the emergence of symptoms as evidence that BZD medication is necessary to manage their underlying condition. Clinicians should help patients understand that these symptoms commonly reflect physical dependence. Chronic BZD use leads to changes in BZD receptor expression and response. As the BZD dose is reduced, the BZD receptors slowly adjust. Symptoms should resolve as the receptors return to homeostasis. Clinicians should reassure patients that tapering strategies can be adjusted to address significant symptoms that may occur.

Symptoms can also reflect the reduction in BZD-induced sedation. For example, patients who are taking high doses of BZDs may have increased sleep duration above their age-appropriate sleep needs. As the BZD is tapered, they may return to age-appropriate sleep needs. Patients may be concerned that this reduced sleep indicates insomnia, but it may instead be evidence of previous oversedation with the BZD.

In general, tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper. Adjustments could include slowing the pace of the taper, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing the taper. The CGC noted that clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose as this can undermine the goal of resetting BZD receptor levels in the brain. However, if patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms that are not addressed adequately by the above strategies, clinicians can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize and are able to continue with the taper.

Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks, and therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks.

### Advances in the management of chronic insomnia [^07c6873a]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Chronic insomnia is a common condition that affects people worldwide and has negative effects on patients' health and wellbeing. The treatment of insomnia can be complex and time consuming for patients and providers. Although behavioral interventions are the first line therapy, there are barriers to access for these treatments. However, in recent years, alternative ways of providing these behavioral therapies that make them more widely available have been investigated. Drugs also play an important role in the treatment of insomnia and new drugs have been introduced as options for treating patients with sleep initiation and sleep maintenance insomnia. In this review, we will discuss advances in the past six years in both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for patients with chronic insomnia. We will also review the controversies surrounding some of the current drug treatments, as well as the role that technology and personal activity monitoring devices may play in treating insomnia.

Treatment of Insomnia Disorder with Low-Dose Antidepressants

Insomnia belongs to the most frequent disorders of the brain. In industrialized countries, approximately 6% of the adults suffer from insomnia as a disorder and as many as 50% may suffer from transient insomnia symptoms. Although insomnia is not regarded as a severe mental disorder, it shares many features with depression. In order to offer a patient an effective treatment of insomnia, there is a need for a broader perspective, one that reaches far beyond the prescription of hypnotics. Current treatment guidelines strongly recommend the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder and only short-term use of the sleep-promoting drugs in patients with insufficient response to CBI-I. However, in daily clinical practice, the use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia is very common. The most frequently used drugs to treat insomnia aside from benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine (eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) hypnotics are sedative antidepressants. However, due to the lack of methodologically sound randomized clinical trials in insomnia, only one of them, doxepin, is approved by FDA for the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Furthermore, recent recommendations discourage the use of other drugs from this class than doxepin for the insomnia treatment. In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option of insomnia in a situation in which despite being in CBT-I therapy, the patient still requires sleep-promoting drugs more than 3–4 times per week. The use of sedative antidepressants should be also considered when there is a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder because such patients are at increased risk of developing hypnotic dependency. Moreover, in many insomnia patients, physiological parameters, e.g. hormone secretion, whole body, and brain metabolic rate, are altered in a similar fashion to the depressed ones what is called a hyperarousal, supporting the use of sedative antidepressants to treat such patients. The pros and cons of using sedative antidepressants in insomnia patients were discussed extensively in the earlier papers. This is especially true for trazodone that is very often used as a sleep-promoting drug. Frequently expressed concern with the usage of sedative antidepressants in insomnia is that their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be underrated. Indeed, although there is evidence for efficacy of sedative antidepressants to promote sleep, for example for TCA in a form of a recent meta-analytic study, it is important to remember that these drugs should be used in insomnia patients only in a very low dose, e.g. for doxepin as low as 3 to 6 mg or 25–50 mg for trazodone. Many psychiatrists are astonished that a sedative antidepressant can promote sleep in such a low dose. Firstly, it should be noted that such low doses are appropriate only for patients with primary insomnia. In the presence of a comorbid mood disorder, the antidepressants have to be used in a recommended therapeutic dose. Secondly, such treatment should be used only when combined with behavioral interventions from CBT-I protocol. When a patient restricts time in bed and uses stimulus control technique, even low-dosage pharmacological treatment starts to work. Thirdly, to be effective in treating sleep-onset insomnia, sedative antidepressants have to be taken much earlier than hypnotics in regard to their pharmacokinetics, especially the time they take to reach the maximum serum concentration (Cmax). It usually means at least 2 hours before sleep (in the case of more rapid drug action the patient should be encouraged to shorten this time). In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a safe class of drugs when given in low doses. We use them in many patient groups where hypnotics are contraindicated, e.g. in the elderly patients, in patients with sleep apnea and in patients with a history of alcohol and substance abuse. Despite the fact that the use of atypical antipsychotics, mostly quetiapine, is increasing for treatment of insomnia accompanying bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, we hold the conviction that sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option for such patients as well. Based on our clinical experience and review of published case reports, we believe that the use of sedative antidepressants in a low dose is not related to the increased risk of phase shift in bipolar disorder. Moreover, we have observed that for the treatment of insomnia low doses (5–10 mg) of citalopram administered in the morning can be an alternative to sedative antidepressants with good treatment effects.

Obstructive sleep apnea — safety and implementation considerations for non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists: Patient preferences for pharmacologic assistance should be considered in light of potential risks such as dependency and other adverse effects, especially in older adults, and literature discusses the potential risk of abuse, dependence, motor vehicle accidents, falls in older adults, and diversion. For service members on active-duty, or for those with a commercial driver's license, limitations in duties and temporary medical profiles may need to be implemented if a sedative hypnotic medication is prescribed. In April 2019, the FDA released a safety announcement advising healthcare professionals of the risk of serious injuries or deaths caused by sleep behaviors including sleepwalking, sleep driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake associated with the non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists, including eszopiclone. Although these injuries are rare, they have occurred in patients with and without a history of such behaviors, even at the lowest recommended doses, and even after taking one dose. To minimize the incidence of adverse events, a non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist, if prescribed, should be at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration possible, and all patients offered non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists should be counseled on these potential risks.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^37f195a9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Insomnia is a major healthcare problem in the Western world. It is defined as a dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep and is associated with difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep as well as with early-morning waking with an inability to return to sleep. Approximately 6 to 10% of adults experience insomnia that meets diagnostic criteria. Insomnia is more commonly experienced by older adults and can occur independently or be caused by other diseases.

Benzodiazepine-like medications (BDLM), also called Z-drugs, are a chemically heterogenous group defined by their mechanism of action: a selectivity for certain γ- aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits that distinguishes them from Benzodiazepines (BDZ).

Over the last 5 years zolpidem has been the most frequently prescribed hypnotic worldwide. In the year of 2017, zolpidem and zopiclone were the top two prescribed BDLM in Europe. Various studies confirm the high prescription rate of Z-drugs in community-dwelling, hospitalized and nursing home patients, with prescribing rates highest for older women.

BDLM are licensed only for short-term use. This restriction entails a paradox, as the vast majority of afflicted patients is in need of long-term treatment.

The time restriction on BDLM use is attributable to their effect-risk profile, where negative impact multiplies with prolonged duration of treatment and benefits decrease or stay steady at best.

BDLM were expected to achieve the strong sedative and hypnotic effects desired, while avoiding the anxiolytic, myorelaxant, analgesic, and anticonvulsant side effects of Benzodiazepines. It was hypothesized that there was a link between receptor subtype selectivity and the reduction of side effects.

However, recent studies point to hang-over effects including impairment of cognitive and memory functions on the day after use the development of rebound insomnia after discontinuation of therapy, and most strikingly a lack of difference to BDZ in the rapid induction of tolerance, as well as a high risk of addiction resulting in an increasing proportion of chronic users and abusers.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^f5174718]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Sleep patterns — screening for sleep-disordered breathing and opioid safety: Validated risk tools such as the STOP-Bang can help diagnose obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), including items such as Body mass index more than 35 kg/m²; Age older than 50, Neck size large, and Gender = male. Persons with high suspicion of OSA or central sleep apnea should be referred to a formal sleep study. Careful monitoring and judicious opioid escalation are warranted in persons at risk of excessive opioid sedation, and persons with a high risk for sedation or severe OSA may not be appropriate candidates for chronic opioid therapy. The concomitant use of opioid therapy with other central nervous system depressants or psychoactive medications may induce or exacerbate sleep disturbances, and in particular, the concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines can lead to drastically elevated risks for sedation and respiratory depression.

### The association between benzodiazepine use and sleep quality in residential aged care facilities: a cross-sectional study [^da5adb66]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

There was a statistically significant positive association between regular long-acting benzodiazepine use and higher night-time sleep quality. However, the sample size for regular long-acting benzodiazepines (n = 14) was modest in comparison to other categories. Traditionally, long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam are more commonly prescribed to manage anxiety disorders. As such, residents using long-acting benzodiazepines may not have had existing sleep problems.

In our study, there was an association between use of short-acting benzodiazepines on a PRN basis only and lower night-time sleep quality, although this was not statistically significant. The effects of benzodiazepine use on sleep quality have been mixed. For example, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that sedative hypnotics offer statistically significant, but small, improvements in sleep quality. However, long-term benzodiazepine use is associated with tolerance which may negate the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines. As our study was cross-sectional we were not able to investigate tolerance and duration of benzodiazepine use. A cross-sectional study by Béland et al. also reported an association between benzodiazepines and poor sleep quality, which the authors attributed to the physiological tolerance mechanism. The use of short-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, is recommended as a first line short-term treatment for insomnia by the Australian Therapeutics Guidelines. Thus, this finding may be attributed to the role of using short-acting benzodiazepines, as required, in residents who are experiencing poor sleep quality. Individuals with poor sleep quality may be more likely to be prescribed PRN short-acting benzodiazepines, and this may highlight potential confounding by indication.

There was an association between PRN benzodiazepine only use and longer day-time napping. Australian Therapeutic Guidelines recommend the use of PRN medication in both the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Historically, short-acting benzodiazepines have been attributed with lower rates of adverse events and lowered risk of residual next-day sequelae such as napping. Clinician awareness of preventing adverse events is seen through prescribing habits and patterns. Thus, our findings may reflect channeling of PRN medications to residents susceptible to daytime napping, particularly those with acute rather than chronic insomnia. This study found no association between benzodiazepine use and day-time drowsiness, whereas previous research indicates benzodiazepine users are at a greater risk of somnolence. The different effects of varying formulations and regimens of benzodiazepines on the sleep domains highlights the need for informed decision making when it comes to prescribing these medications.

### Future directions in the management of insomnia [^905c3550]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Research on insomnia has provided a number of important new insights, but fundamental deficits in our understanding remain. In considering priorities for future research, 3 areas warrant immediate attention. First, a causal relationship between insomnia and the adverse outcomes seen in insomnia patients needs to be established. Second, currently available symptomatic therapies need to be optimized. Recent data suggest that some benzodiazepine receptor agonists produce their hypnotic effect without side effects that were presumed to be inherent to sedation. Understanding the neuropharmacology underlying this differential effect would allow substantial improvements in the risk-benefit ratio for these drugs. Finally, the mechanisms of insomnia need to be better understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that physiologic arousal is important to the clinical presentation of primary insomnia. It remains unclear, however, whether this activation is primary or secondary to the insomnia itself. If physiologic hyperarousal causes primary insomnia, it would provide new approaches to the management of this disorder.

Pharmacological Therapies

Sedating and Alerting Agents

A number of hypnotic agents, including benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, and sedating antidepressants and antihistamines, are frequently used to treat insomnia in healthy adults. However, such agents are almost exclusively only approved for short-term use and are recommended as a secondary measure to nonpharmacological approaches. This is because i) all such agents bear limited efficacy and salient risk of significant adverse effects and ii) there is insufficient evidence to balance benefits against such risks for long-term use in healthy adults. There is even less scope to contend that benefits outweigh such risks in older individuals or patients with neurodegenerative disorders: as outlined below, robust randomized controlled trials are sparse, and extrapolation from observational studies suggests that risks are likely to be more prominent in such populations.

Benzodiazepines and Z-Drugs

Both benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, and triazolam, and Z-drugs, such as zopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon, improve sleep quality by reducing sleep latency and awakenings via agonism of GABA A receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Adverse effects of benzodiazepines include tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal, as well as both acute and chronic impairment of attention and psychomotor speed. Impairment of memory consolidation is also well supported, although refuted by some studies. While risks of such adverse effects are lower with Z-drugs, they are not absent. Moreover, both benzodiazepines and Z-drugs have been found to reduce REM and/or slow-wave sleep, stages of sleep vital to memory consolidation and glymphatic clearance of neurotoxic waste.

In line with these observations, among elderly populations, benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are consistently associated with an increased risk of hip fracture due to falls, and some evidence suggests an increased risk of cognitive impairment and decline. Likewise, in an observational study in a probable Alzheimer's cohort adjusted for baseline cognitive function and confounding clinical features, use of benzodiazepines was associated with a higher risk of deterioration. In Parkinson's disease, a small placebo-controlled study of eszopiclone identified improved subjective sleep measures without marked adverse events, but with a treatment period of only 6 weeks. High-quality evidence among neurodegeneration-specific cohorts is otherwise lacking.

Thus, it is highly likely that use of such agents in a neurodegenerative population will bring harm in excess of benefit and should therefore be viewed with caution.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^f17810d7]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia disorder — research priorities emphasize research supporting implementation and dissemination of evidence-based behavioral insomnia treatments and evaluating effectiveness when treatments are adapted for the primary care setting, when treatments are abbreviated, and when treatments are delivered by different provider types in different clinical contexts, along with dismantling studies to better understand the efficacy of individual components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Priorities include research assessing combinations of CBT-I plus adjunctive interventions (e.g., medication, acupuncture, mindfulness), including their relative efficacy in the presence of comorbid conditions, and a focus on long-term outcomes of CBT-I and pharmacotherapy for insomnia as well as comparative effectiveness studies comparing CBT-I to recently FDA-approved hypnotic medications with novel mechanisms of action (e.g., dual orexin antagonists). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in younger adults as well as in the active-duty military population that may have lower risks of side effects or adverse events when using hypnotics for short periods of time are needed, and research is especially needed for agents that are not controlled substances. Comparative effectiveness trials evaluating DORAs versus non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists to determine if there is a difference in functional impairment during the sleep period between these two drug classes are highlighted, which is critical for patients who have a job that necessitates immediate alertness when waking from sleep and for older adults who are at risk for nighttime falls. Future research on cannabis and cannabinoid products should determine dosing strength and formulations with patients assessed for and meeting diagnostic criteria per the ICSD-3-TR or DSM-V, with long term studies needed to evaluate risks of long-term use and durability of benefits, and studies to evaluate potential withdrawal symptoms and risks with discontinuation; well-designed placebo-controlled trials are needed to clarify the potential benefit of controlled release melatonin, passionflower, and magnesium formulations for treatment of chronic insomnia disorder.

### Hypnotics and mortality in an elderly general population: a 12-year prospective study [^80883157]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypnotics are widely used by the elderly, and their impact on mortality remains controversial. The inconsistent findings could be due to methodological limitations, notably the lack of control for underlying sleep symptoms or illness associated with hypnotic use, for example, insomnia symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness, depression and anxiety. Our objective was to examine the association between the use of hypnotics and mortality risk in a large cohort of community-dwelling elderly, taking into account a wide range of potential competing risks including sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and chronic disorders as well as underlying psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints.

Methods

Analyses were carried out on 6,696 participants aged 65 years or older randomly recruited from three French cities and free of dementia at baseline. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models with delayed entry, and age of the participants as the time scale, were used to determine the association between hypnotic use and 12-year survival.

Results

At baseline, 21.7% of the participants regularly used at least one hypnotic. During follow-up, 1,307 persons died, 480 from cancer and 344 from cardiovascular disease. Analyses adjusted for study center, age and gender showed a significantly greater risk of all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality with hypnotics, particularly benzodiazepines, and this increased with the number of hypnotics used. None of these associations were significant in models adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, chronic disorders including cardiovascular pathologies, sleep and psychiatric disorders. Results remained unchanged when duration of past hypnotic intake or persistent versus intermittent use during follow-up were taken into account.

Conclusions

When controlling for a large range of potential confounders, the risk of mortality was not significantly associated with hypnotic use regardless of the type and duration. Underlying psychiatric disorders appear to be the principal confounders of the observed association.

### Opioids and sleep [^c06f2e79]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Summarize the effects of opioids on sleep including sleep architecture, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome.

Recent Findings

Opioids are associated with the development of central sleep apnea (CSA) and ataxic breathing. Recent reports suggest that adaptive servo-ventilation may be an effective treatment for CSA associated with opioids.

Summary

Opioids have multiple effects on sleep, sleep architecture and SDB. Although originally described with methadone use, most commonly used opioids have also been shown to affect sleep. In patients on chronic methadone, sleep architecture changes include decreases in N3 and REM sleep. However, in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain, opioids improve sleep quality and sleep time. Opioids, generally at a morphine equivalent dose more than 100mg/day, are associated with an increased incidence of CSA and ataxic breathing as well as obstructive sleep apnea. Other risk factors may include concomitant use of other medications such as antidepressants, gabapentinoids and benzodiazepines. Opioid-induced CSA can be potentially treated with adaptive servo-ventilation. Finally, opioids are a potential therapeutic option for restless legs syndrome unresponsive to dopamine agonists and other medications. However, use in patients with restless legs syndrome should proceed with caution, taking into account the risk for dependence and development of SDB.

### Benzodiazepine use in patients with chronic pain in an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program [^c2ecaa5a]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the context of widespread opioid use in the United States, increased emphasis has been placed on the potentially deleterious effects of concurrent benzodiazepine (BZD) and opioid use. Among individuals with chronic pain, the coadministration of BZDs and opioids have been associated with elevated rates of cognitive dysfunction, sedation, central sleep apnea, respiratory depression, and overdose deaths.–The pharmacological effects of BZDs are due to the potentiation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA A -receptors. When administered concurrently, BZD-related inhibitory effects can be synergistic with the inhibitory effects of opioids.

BZDs are widely used to treat a broad range of mental health problems. This is relevant because the prevalence of commonly occurring mental health disorders in adults with chronic pain exceeds 50%–60%. Although associations between BZDs, opioids, and various clinical factors have been observed in primary care and population-based studies,–the potential correlates of BZD use in patients undergoing interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation (IPR) have not been reported. This is important because this patient population has high rates of long-term opioid use and high levels of depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and pain severity.–Thus, the primary aim of this study was to determine the associations between BZD use and opioid use in adults with chronic pain upon admission to an outpatient IPR program. Secondary aims include investigating the associations between BZD use and depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, pain severity, and demographic characteristics.

### Addressing barriers to reducing prescribing and implementing deprescribing of sedative-hypnotics in primary care [^ac5472a1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In community practice, sedatives and hypnotics (SH), including certain benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine GABA-receptor agonists, as well as drugs with sedating adverse effects, are frequently prescribed, especially for insomnia. - Systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines for insomnia suggest that these prescriptions should primarily be of short duration because of insufficient evidence to support extended use, evidence of harm, and availability of safe and effective nonpharmacological alternatives (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBTi]). - However, chronic SH utilization in the community is high, with reported rates between 3% and 17%. -,-

SH exposure is associated with serious adverse events, including falls, cognitive impairment, and increased mortality, and extended use of some classes may be associated with drug dependence (eg, benzodiazepines). - Professional societies include SH on their list of potentially inappropriate or high-risk medications for insomnia management for older adults and endorse reduction of SH use to minimize the risk of adverse events. - Recent observational data suggest that prescribing practices have shifted from traditional benzodiazepines to newer Z-drugs and other sedating medication classes (eg, off-label use of quetiapine and trazodone) because these newer medications are falsely perceived as safer alternatives.-

### Risks associated with long-term benzodiazepine use… [^9fcee736]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are widely used to treat anxiety and insomnia, even though antidepressants are first-line therapy for anxiety disorders based on the evidence. 1 In this issue of American Family Physician, Drs. Ramar and Olson review the management of insomnia and other sleep disorders. 2 When benzodiazepines are used to treat insomnia, the effect wears off after a few weeks, 3 and rebound insomnia has been reported with cessation of the drugs. Although patients report enhanced sleep with long-term use, there is no objective evidence to support this. Although zaleplon and zolpidem are often described as nonbenzodiazepines, they are chemically similar and both act on benzodiazepine receptors. These drugs are specific for the benzodiazepine 1 receptor.

Because of the short half-life, withdrawal after discontinuing these drugs does not occur unless they are abused or taken in high doses for an extended period. As with other potentially addictive drugs, benzodiazepines activate dopamine in mesolimbic projections. In addition to abuse and dependence, other major risks associated with benzodiazepine use include the following: Cognitive impairment. Benzodiazepines cause acute adverse effects: drowsiness, increased reaction time, ataxia, motor incoordination, and anterograde amnesia. Additionally, a meta-analysis of studies looking at withdrawal from an average of 17 mg per day of diazepam found that long-term use led to substantial cognitive decline that did not resolve three months after discontinuation. 8 Benzodiazepines increase the risk of addiction, withdrawal, cognitive decline, motor vehicle crashes, and hip fracture.

The risk of overdose is particularly great when combined with sedative drugs such as opioids or alcohol. For these reasons, if used, benzodiazepines generally should not be prescribed continuously for more than one month. There are effective alternatives. Psychotherapy and antidepressants are the treatments of choice for anxiety disorders. Short-term medications that can be used for anxiety without risk of addiction include propranolol, anticonvulsants, or major tranquilizers. Finally, insomnia can be treated with trazodone, doxepin, or ramelteon without risk of rebound insomnia.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^943757d7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations of short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated if pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 38 trials (involving 2543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2295 participants. Many different interventions were studied, and no single intervention was assessed in more than four trials. We extracted data on 18 different comparisons. The risk of bias was high in all trials but one. Trial Sequential Analysis showed imprecision for all comparisons. For benzodiazepine discontinuation, we found a potential benefit of valproate at end of intervention (1 study, 27 participants; risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.03; very low-quality evidence) and of tricyclic antidepressants at longest follow-up (1 study, 47 participants; RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.82; low-quality evidence). We found potentially positive effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; mean difference (MD) -3.10 points, 95% CI -3.51 to -2.69; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -1.00 points, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.87; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -3.57 points, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.80; very low-quality evidence), tricyclic antidepressants (1 study, 38 participants; MD -19.78 points, 95% CI -20.25 to -19.31; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (3 studies, 58 participants; standardised mean difference -0.95, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.19; very low-quality evidence) at end of intervention. However, the positive effect of paroxetine on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms did not persist until longest follow-up (1 study, 54 participants; MD -0.13 points, 95% CI -4.03 to 3.77; very low-quality evidence). The following pharmacological interventions reduced symptoms of anxiety at end of intervention: carbamazepine (1 study, 36 participants; MD -6.00 points, 95% CI -9.58 to -2.42; very low-quality evidence), pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; MD -4.80 points, 95% CI -5.28 to -4.32; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -5.70 points, 95% CI -6.05 to -5.35; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -6.75 points, 95% CI -9.64 to -3.86; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (1 study, 18 participants; MD -1.30 points, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.32; very low-quality evidence). Two pharmacological treatments seemed to reduce the proportion of participants that relapsed to benzodiazepine use: valproate (1 study, 27 participants; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90; very low-quality evidence) and cyamemazine (1 study, 124 participants; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; very low-quality evidence). Alpidem decreased the proportion of participants with benzodiazepine discontinuation (1 study, 25 participants; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2.3 participants; low-quality evidence) and increased the occurrence of withdrawal syndrome (1 study, 145 participants; RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 21.14; NNTH 5.9 participants; low-quality evidence). Likewise, magnesium aspartate decreased the proportion of participants discontinuing benzodiazepines (1 study, 144 participants; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; NNTH 5.8; very low-quality evidence). Generally, adverse events were insufficiently reported. Specifically, one of the flumazenil trials was discontinued due to severe panic reactions.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low or very low quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes, and the small number of trials identified with a limited number of participants for each comparison, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding pharmacological interventions to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users. Due to poor reporting, adverse events could not be reliably assessed across trials. More randomised controlled trials are required with less risk of systematic errors ('bias') and of random errors ('play of chance') and better and full reporting of patient-centred and long-term clinical outcomes. Such trials ought to be conducted independently of industry involvement.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^00fe1b21]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines for anxiety in adult ICU patients — Recommendation 1 states: "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety in adult patients admitted to the ICU", and the panel adds, "Due to a lack of evidence, the panel cannot currently make a recommendation regarding the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety in ICU patients", noting that "no studies directly answered our PICO with the exception of one before-and-after cohort study conducted in burn patients which presented limited evidence". Special considerations report that "Severe anxiety is experienced by more than one quarter of intubated patients 6 hours after the interruption of midazolam or propofol, while ten of 16 patients reported anxiety about the endotracheal tube at hospital discharge regardless of sedation", and caution that "abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines prescribed for baseline chronic anxiety may precipitate acute withdrawal; hence, continuation of the chronic benzodiazepines upon admission to the ICU should be considered".

### Management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^d1ef4a8e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Perceptions, clinical characteristics, and other factors associated with prolonged and high daily dose of benzodiazepine use among patients with anxiety or depressive disorders [^a5007582]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines (BZDs) have been widely used to treat anxiety; however, the risk of adverse health effects caused by their long-term use is high. This study examined the factors associated with the duration and higher daily dose of BZDs use among a population with anxiety or depressive disorders.

Methods

A cross-sectional study design was used. Patients from a psychiatric outpatient department who had been prescribed BZDs were recruited. Data were collected from 250 patients.

Results

Nearly 94% of patients were long-term BZDs users. The mean duration of BZDs use was 5.5 years; and mean defined daily dose (DDD) of BZDs use, converted to diazepam milligram equivalent (DDD), was 1.53 DME-DDD. Patients who knew more about alternative treatments were less prone to use BZD longer. Patients aged 65 years or older and those with difficulty falling asleep were more prone to use BZDs longer. Patients who were currently taking BZDs at higher daily dose were those who felt more depressed, prescribed second generation antipsychotics, suffered from disrupted sleep, less aware of alternative treatments, had comorbid chronic physical illness, and were current smokers.

Limitations

The cross-sectional study design limited its ability to confirm causal relationships.

Conclusions

Long-term and excessive daily dose of BZDs use in patients with depressive or anxiety disorders needs to be noted. Providing information or program of non-pharmacological treatment in reducing anxiety and improving specific sleep disturbance is suggested. Elderly, suffering from depressive mood, had comorbid chronic physical illness need to be targeted for further intervention.

### Pharmacological management of insomnia [^56ef86c7]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition associated with significant morbidity, reduction in quality of life, and increase in healthcare costs, and is a risk factor for multiple physical and mental disorders. The primary treatment modality is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) but this is associated with difficulties with access and higher cost as well as poor response in some patients. Therefore, pharmacotherapy for insomnia is common and hypnotic agents are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States. Older medications for insomnia are limited by their side effect burden and narrow therapeutic window. Newer hypnotics, on the other hand, have been shown to have a better safety profile and longer term efficacy. While some studies have shown that long-term hypnotic use is associated with adverse outcomes, the current evidence is equivocal. The decision to treat chronic insomnia disorder with long-term hypnotics should be individualized and balance the potential risks of continuing hypnotic medication use with the risks of untreated persistent insomnia and associated functional limitations. This clinical review discusses the currently available medication options to treat insomnia, their mechanisms of action, dosing, and side effect profiles. This review also provides guidance on long-term management of hypnotics and the use of these medications in the elderly, those with medical comorbidities, and other special populations.

### Clinical management of withdrawal from benzodiazepine anxiolytic and hypnotic medications [^703e42dc]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed widely in the management of patients with insomnia or anxiety disorders, despite the availability and acceptability of alternative pharmacological and psychological treatments. Many patients will experience adverse effects during treatment and considerable distress when the dosage is reduced and stopped. Management of benzodiazepine withdrawal includes measures to prevent the development of dependence, careful attention to underlying medical conditions, medication consolidation and gradual dosage reduction, accompanying psychological interventions, occasional prescription of concomitant medication, and relapse prevention with on-going support to address psychosocial stressors. There are needs for easier patient access to services with refined expertise and for further research to optimise strategies for preventing dependence and facilitating withdrawal.

Chronic insomnia disorder pharmacologic therapy — VA/DoD guideline recommendations address ramelteon, suvorexant, antipsychotic drugs, benzodiazepines, and trazodone. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of ramelteon for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of suvorexant for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder. We suggest against the use of antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder, we suggest against the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder, and we suggest against the use of trazodone for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder.

### Brief interventions targeting long-term benzodiazepine and Z-drug use in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^12de279e]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines have multiple clinical indications, including anxiety and insomnia. Guidelines recommend restricting benzodiazepine prescriptions to short‐term use (≤ 4 weeks) to minimize adverse outcomes, such as dependence and withdrawal symptoms [1, 2]. Similar recommendations apply to Z‐drugs (e.g. zopiclone, zolpidem), a group of non‐benzodiazepine hypnotics which are also available to treat insomnia [3]. However, guidelines are often not adhered to, as long‐term use of these medications, which are collectively referred to as benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs), persists world‐wide [4, 5]. Numerous countries have reported no notable changes, or only modest decreases, in benzodiazepine use in recent years [6, 7, 8, 9]. In some instances, changes in benzodiazepine prescribing have been offset by increased Z‐drug prescribing [5, 9, 10, 11] for which evidence of a more favourable risk profile is lacking [3].

The estimated prevalence of long‐term BZRA use (> 6 months) among the general population varies throughout countries (range = 6–15%), with the highest prevalence reported among older people (range = 22–55%), typically defined as ≥ 65 years [12, 13, 14]. Long‐term benzodiazepine use is one of the most commonly identified indicators of potentially inappropriate prescribing in older people [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This is concerning, as age‐related physiological changes impact on the drugs' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, thereby making older adults most susceptible to BZRAs' adverse effects such as falls, fractures and cognitive impairment [21, 22]. Only in recent years have prescribing tools to assess quality use of medicines incorporated Z‐drugs (e.g. Beers criteria [23]). Hence, comparatively fewer studies have examined potentially inappropriate Z‐drug prescribing and associated risks [24, 25]. The ongoing issue of long‐term BZRA use has called existing guidelines into question [26]. As long‐term BZRA prescribing also occurs in middle‐aged populations (typically defined as 45–64 years) [7, 27], the problem is likely to persist for generations to come without targeted interventions.

### Pharmacologic management of insomnia: past, present, and future [^c21e4cc4]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Views on the etiology and morbidities associated with insomnia are evolving and affect clinicians' approach to the pharmacologic management of insomnia. Currently, benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) and a single melatonin receptor agonist are recognized as safe and efficacious hypnotics. Variability in BzRAs, pharmacokinetics, and manipulation of dose provide clinicians with options that meet the needs of most patients. Other drugs (eg, sedating antidepressants) also are used commonly in clinical practice to treat insomnia, but evidence is lacking to support this most cases. Improvement in managing insomnia will result from systematic research with these drugs, with drugs in development, and with novel uses, such as co-therapy.

Sidebar 4. Pharmacotherapy considerations for chronic insomnia disorder — before starting short-term pharmacotherapy, review sleep history, reproductive status, and evaluate contraindications for pharmacotherapy; evaluate for other sleep disorders (e.g., apnea, NREM parasomnias), daytime sleepiness, respiratory impairment, cognitive impairment, substance abuse history, and medication interactions, and encourage non-pharmacologic approaches (e.g. CBT-I or BBT-I). When short-term pharmacotherapy is appropriate, consider the following agents and discuss deprescribing plan: low-dose doxepin; or dual orexin receptor antagonists; or non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (all patients offered treatment with a non - benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist should be specifically counseled regarding the risk of complex sleep-related behaviors) (See Recommendation 9). The use of antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine, and trazodone are NOT suggested for treatment of chronic insomnia disorder (See Recommendation 10), and consider sleep specialist referral in patients who do not respond to pharmacotherapy.

Sleep disturbance during benzodiazepine tapering in co-occurring psychiatric conditions — monitoring and adjustments: Sleep disturbance is a common symptom during BZD tapering and may contribute to symptom exacerbation of underlying mood or psychotic disorders; the CGC recommends that clinicians monitor sleep closely in these patients, particularly those with bipolar disorder because sleep disturbance can trigger episodes of mania; if patients with psychiatric conditions experience sleep disturbance, clinicians should pause the taper until symptoms resolve unless continued BZD use presents imminent safety concerns; clinicians can provide patients with information on sleep hygiene and offer or provide referrals for alternative treatment options such as CBT-I, and clinicians can also consider consulting with psychiatrists or sleep medicine specialists to help guide treatment plans.

VA/DoD insomnia management — non-pharmacologic prioritization, duty considerations, and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist (non-BZD BzRA) safety state that non-pharmacologic treatments should be considered first before beginning pharmacotherapy, with important subgroup considerations in the active-duty population for which duty limitations may apply with the use of hypnotic medication. Veterans and active-duty personnel may have a commercial driving license or operate heavy machinery, and for service members on active-duty or those with a commercial driver's license, limitation in duties and temporary medical profiles may need to be implemented if a non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist is prescribed. The Work Group notes resource use as the costs of these medications can vary widely and some of them require prior authorization, and providers may be hesitant to use tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in patients with cardiac disease or those who might be susceptible to anticholinergic side effects. Other published literature independent from the strength of this recommendation discusses the potential risk of abuse, dependence, motor vehicle accidents, and diversion, and in April 2019 the FDA released a safety announcement advising of serious injuries from complex sleep behaviors (e.g., sleepwalking, sleep driving, activities while not fully awake) associated with non-BZD BzRAs; these behaviors have at times resulted in deaths and, although rare, have occurred in patients.

### Gender differences in the efficacy and safety of chronic nightly zolpidem [^b928d7fa]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Studies have shown pharmacokinetic differences for hypnotics in women compared to men, but few studies have assessed either short-or long-term differences in efficacy and safety.

Methods

To evaluate gender differences in the efficacy and safety of chronic nightly zolpidem (10 mg), we did a post hoc assessment of a large clinical trial. In the trial, participants with primary insomnia (n = 89), ages 23–70, meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for primary insomnia were randomized, double blind, to nightly zolpidem, 10 mg (n = 47) or placebo (n = 42) 30 minutes before bedtime nightly for 12 months. Polysomnographic sleep on 2 nights in months 1 and 8 and likelihood of next-day sleepiness, rebound insomnia, and dose escalation were evaluated in months 1, 4, and 12.

Results

Relative to placebo, zolpidem significantly increased sleep efficiency and reduced sleep latency and wake after sleep onset assessed at months 1 and 8, with no differences in efficacy between women and men and no diminution of efficacy over months. On a next-day multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), no residual sedation was observed for either women or men. No rebound insomnia or dose escalation was seen with no gender differences in either.

Conclusions

In adults with primary insomnia, nightly zolpidem administration showed no gender differences in acute or chronic efficacy or in next-day sleepiness. Zolpidem remained efficacious and safe across 12 months.

### Pharmacologic approach to insomnia [^8b2ce693]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Sleep management is essential to effective treatment of pain symptoms. Identification of the precise nature of sleep complaint, awareness of patient's age and co-morbid conditions and choice of the hypnotic medication class can help guide treatment approach. In addition to benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine medications acting at the GABA receptor, novel approaches, including orexin receptor agonists, may be safer and more promising pharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic interventions, when used cautiously for a limited period of time and in complement with behavioral and cognitive approaches, can serve to improve sleep quality and significantly help in management of pain.
