## Question

What are the diagnostic criteria for pneumonia in a patient with cough and fever?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for pneumonia in a patient presenting with cough and fever. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pretest probability and why cough plus fever is insufficient. Then, I should verify which clinical features most efficiently raise or lower the likelihood of pneumonia. Next, I will consider the diagnostic gold standard and imaging choices, including chest radiography and lung ultrasound. After that, I need to review when and how biomarkers, especially CRP, add value and where procalcitonin fits. I will then integrate this into a practical decision algorithm and account for special populations and atypical pathogens. Finally, I should summarize a safe, stewardship-aligned approach to antibiotic use and follow-up while double-checking that each assertion aligns with guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical starting point: cough and fever are sensitive but nonspecific features of community-acquired pneumonia, so they cannot alone confirm or exclude the diagnosis. I should explicitly state that these symptoms shift the pretest probability upward but remain insufficient for diagnosis without corroboration, and that relying on clinical judgment alone risks overcalling pneumonia and unnecessary antibiotics, especially in outpatient settings [^113Nk9cA] [^111MgD3U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review which individual clinical findings meaningfully modify the likelihood of pneumonia and which do not. I need to check that pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, and new focal chest findings (crackles, bronchial breath sounds, dullness to percussion) are the most discriminative elements when combined with fever, whereas cough by itself has poor diagnostic performance; notably, in older adults, typical symptoms are often absent, which can mislead clinical gestalt, and I should also confirm that hypoxemia (SpO2 < 95–96%) is a red flag that meaningfully increases risk and should lower the threshold for imaging [^112gaLqu] [^113Nk9cA] [^114Z96rf] [^113KKHqN].

> Wait, let me verify the role of chest radiography before assuming imaging is always required. I initially thought "all suspected pneumonia requires chest radiography", but I should correct that; CHEST suggests that adults with acute cough and suspected pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy, yet the same guidance notes that routine radiography for all acute cough is unnecessary and safe to avoid when suspicion is low and the result would not change management, reinforcing a targeted imaging strategy based on pretest probability and exam findings [^113Nk9cA] [^117Hj5DT]. I need to ensure I anchor this to IDSA/ATS, which historically defines pneumonia by the presence of a pulmonary infiltrate on imaging plus compatible clinical features, making radiographic confirmation the de facto standard in guideline-based care pathways [^116N8vas] [^114PtydE].

> Let me consider acceptable alternatives when radiography is not immediately available or when sensitivity is a concern. Lung ultrasound has emerged as a reasonable diagnostic alternative to chest radiography for suspected CAP in experienced hands; I should confirm that the most recent ATS guidance explicitly supports lung ultrasound where appropriate expertise exists, acknowledging its potential advantages in certain settings, though availability and operator skill vary [^116NjiCc]. I should double-check that for immunocompromised hosts, chest radiography may miss subtle infiltrates, and CT is often required to detect new or worsening infiltrates and distinguish infectious from noninfectious etiologies, which is a different diagnostic bar than in immunocompetent adults [^1112GDfv].

> Next, I should review biomarkers, and I need to ensure I do not overstate procalcitonin. The strongest evidence base supports CRP: adding CRP to clinical features improves diagnostic discrimination, with CRP > 30 mg/L increasing the likelihood of pneumonia and CRP < 10 mg/L in the right clinical context helping to rule out pneumonia; conversely, procalcitonin adds little to no incremental diagnostic value in primary care outpatients and should not be routinely obtained in this setting [^114CErez] [^111ZUJ8V] [^116LGbGn]. But wait, what if someone cites emergency department data suggesting procalcitonin use; I should clarify that while some ED stewardship frameworks have explored procalcitonin, guidelines caution against using procalcitonin, especially driven by fever alone, to decide on antibiotics, so in the outpatient with cough and fever, procalcitonin remains low-yield and potentially misleading if overinterpreted [^112o43mk] [^111Baq8a].

> I will now examine how to operationalize this into a decision pathway. In primary care, I should integrate fever, tachypnea, pleuritic pain, and focal chest findings into a pretest estimate, and if the clinical picture suggests a nontrivial chance of pneumonia, obtain chest radiography; if radiography demonstrates a new infiltrate, treat as pneumonia, and if negative, consider alternative diagnoses or revisit pretest assumptions, including the possibility of early or atypical pneumonia below radiographic detection thresholds or a nonpneumonic process such as bronchitis or viral URI [^113Nk9cA] [^111MgD3U]. I should double-check that a low CRP in a patient with otherwise low-risk features can support a decision to withhold antibiotics and avoid imaging when aligned with shared decision-making, while a clearly abnormal exam with hypoxemia should lower the threshold for imaging and empiric therapy pending results [^114CErez] [^113KKHqN].

> Let me think about special populations and exceptions. In older adults, fever and cough may be absent despite pneumonia, so I need a lower threshold for imaging when functional decline, confusion, or new hypoxia are present. Similarly, in children, clinical features like increased work of breathing and hypoxemia outperform tachypnea alone for predicting radiographic pneumonia, and the WHO clinical criteria have modest sensitivity, which means I should avoid anchoring on tachypnea alone and prioritize oxygenation and work of breathing in decision-making [^114Z96rf] [^111yU9kA] [^112XnT58]. For immunocompromised patients, I should confirm that imaging sensitivity must be higher (often CT) and that concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies are common, so a strict reliance on classic symptoms will miss disease. A high index of suspicion and early advanced imaging are warranted when clinically suspected [^1112GDfv].

> But wait, what if the cough and fever reflect atypical or viral pneumonia, or an early bacterial process. I should consider Mycoplasma in adolescents and young adults with extrapulmonary features and prolonged cough, and remember that chest radiography may show interstitial changes rather than lobar consolidation; I also need to ensure that if influenza is suspected during circulation, early testing and antiviral therapy within 48 hours can reduce complications and downstream antibiotic use, aligning with IDSA influenza guidance and CHEST suggestions in acute cough pathways [^notfound] [^113Nk9cA] [^1127aTvn]. I should double-check that auscultatory findings are variably sensitive and that absence of focal findings does not reliably exclude pneumonia, reinforcing the need for imaging when pretest probability is moderate to high [^111MgD3U].

> I need to ensure my antibiotic stewardship stance is explicit. In outpatients with cough and fever but low suspicion and low CRP, it is reasonable to withhold antibiotics and provide safety-netting, whereas when clinical features and imaging support pneumonia, empiric therapy should follow local antibiograms and guideline-based regimens. Procalcitonin should not be used to decide on antibiotics in this setting, and routine microbiologic testing is usually unnecessary unless it will change management or in special epidemiologic contexts [^113Nk9cA] [^111Baq8a] [^112FFUZj]. Let me reconsider whether a "wait-and-see" approach could substitute for imaging. CHEST suggests that when imaging is deferred, clinical judgment with selective radiography can be safe, but that strategy hinges on close follow-up and explicit criteria for reassessment, which I should document and communicate clearly [^117Hj5DT].

> In summary, I should confirm the following: cough plus fever alone is not diagnostic of pneumonia. Targeted integration of tachypnea, pleuritic pain, focal chest findings, and hypoxemia with judicious use of chest radiography (or lung ultrasound where available) is the most reliable outpatient approach. CRP meaningfully refines risk when combined with clinical features, whereas procalcitonin does not. And I must adapt thresholds for older adults, children, and immunocompromised patients while maintaining diagnostic vigilance for atypical and viral pathogens, including influenza, that can present with cough and fever without classic consolidation on imaging [^113Nk9cA] [^114CErez] [^116NjiCc] [^1127aTvn].

The diagnosis of pneumonia in a patient with cough and fever requires a **combination of clinical features and imaging** [^116N8vas] [^113Nk9cA]. The most reliable clinical predictors are **tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, crackles, and fever ≥ 38°C** [^112gaLqu]; however, no single sign or symptom is sufficient to confirm pneumonia [^111MgD3U]. Chest radiography is the **diagnostic gold standard** to confirm pneumonia by demonstrating new pulmonary infiltrates [^114PtydE] [^111MgD3U]. CRP > 30 mg/L supports the diagnosis, whereas procalcitonin is not routinely recommended [^114MnkRz] [^111ZUJ8V] [^111Baq8a]. In immunocompromised patients, a lower threshold for imaging and broader microbiologic testing is advised [^1112GDfv] [^113738cu].

## Clinical features suggestive of pneumonia

The following **clinical features** are strongly associated with pneumonia in patients presenting with cough and fever:

- **Tachypnea**: Respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute in adults is a strong predictor of pneumonia [^113KKHqN] [^114mKQms].

- **Pleuritic chest pain**: Presence of pleuritic chest pain significantly increases the likelihood of pneumonia [^113Nk9cA] [^111ukg7W].

- **Crackles on auscultation**: Lung crackles or rales are highly suggestive of pneumonia [^112gaLqu].

- **Fever**: Temperature ≥ 38°C is a common clinical feature of pneumonia [^112gaLqu] [^111ukg7W].

- **Absence of rhinorrhea**: The absence of nasal discharge or rhinorrhea increases the likelihood of pneumonia [^112gaLqu] [^116Q5Pxo].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Chest radiography is the **gold standard** for confirming pneumonia, demonstrating new pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia [^111MgD3U] [^116N8vas]. It is recommended for patients with suspected pneumonia based on clinical features [^113Nk9cA]. Chest ultrasound is an acceptable alternative in centers with appropriate expertise, particularly when radiography is unavailable or contraindicated [^116NjiCc].

---

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests can support the diagnosis of pneumonia, although they are not definitive on their own. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a useful inflammatory marker; **CRP > 30 mg/L** significantly increases the likelihood of pneumonia [^114MnkRz] [^114CErez]. Procalcitonin is not routinely recommended because it adds limited diagnostic value in outpatient settings [^111Baq8a] [^116LGbGn].

## Diagnostic criteria summary

| **Diagnostic component** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|
| Clinical features | - Tachypnea <br/> - Pleuritic chest pain <br/> - Crackles on auscultation <br/> - Fever ≥ 38°C <br/> - Absence of rhinorrhea [^113Nk9cA] [^116Q5Pxo] |
| Imaging | - Chest radiography demonstrating new pulmonary infiltrates [^114PtydE] [^116N8vas] |
| Laboratory tests | - CRP > 30 mg/L (supportive) <br/> - Procalcitonin not routinely recommended [^114MnkRz] [^111ZUJ8V] [^111Baq8a] |

---

## Special considerations

Immunocompromised patients may present **atypically**; a lower threshold for imaging and broader microbiologic testing is recommended [^115T7z2g] [^116dJzPo] [^1127aTvn]. Pediatric patients are often diagnosed clinically using tachypnea and chest indrawing, with chest radiography reserved for severe cases or when complications are suspected [^112eHQeU] [^116vZRCr].

---

The diagnosis of pneumonia in a patient with cough and fever requires a **combination of clinical features and imaging**, with chest radiography as the gold standard [^116N8vas] [^111MgD3U]. Clinical features such as tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, crackles, and fever ≥ 38°C are strongly suggestive, while CRP > 30 mg/L provides supportive evidence [^116Q5Pxo] [^111ZUJ8V].

### Clinical performance of existing diagnostic criteria for pneumonia in older emergency patients: a prospective cohort study [^114Z96rf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia accounts for over half a million older adult emergency department (ED) visits annually, but ED pneumonia diagnosis is inaccurate. Geriatric-specific pneumonia diagnostic criteria exist for other settings; no prospective data exist to determine if application in the older adult ED population is feasible. The objective was to prospectively evaluate the utility of four current diagnostic criteria (Loeb; Modified McGeer; Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society; American College of Emergency Physicians) in older adult ED patients.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational cohort study of older adult ED patients ≥ 65years of age in two U.S. EDs with suspected pneumonia defined as having chest radiography ordered and treating physician suspicion. The standard we used for defining the presence, absence, or inability to determine a diagnosis of pneumonia diagnosis was expert physician chart adjudication. We report the summary statistics for demographic characteristics and symptoms/exam findings and sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals of the existing diagnostic criteria. Pre-specified cutoff values of a positive LR > 10 and a negative LR < 0.3 were considered clinically significant.

Results

Of 135 patients enrolled, 27 had pneumonia by adjudicator review. Typical patient-reported pneumonia symptoms, such as fever (18.5%) and new/worse cough (51.9%), were not consistently present in pneumonia. The IDSA/ATS and ACEP criteria had positive LR > 10 and negative LR < 0.3; however, all confidence intervals included pre-specified cutoffs.

Conclusions

Older adults presented to the ED with low frequency of typical pneumonia symptoms. Although existing diagnostic definitions had promising test characteristics, they may not perform well enough for clinical application without refinement.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^112dpFnE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 illness is highly variable, ranging from infection with no symptoms through to pneumonia and life-threatening consequences. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia), can help flag early on if the disease is present. Such information could be used either to rule out COVID-19 disease, or to identify people who need to go for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches up to 10 June 2021 in the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We used artificial intelligence text analysis to conduct an initial classification of documents. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included people with clinically suspected COVID-19, or recruited known cases with COVID-19 and also controls without COVID-19 from a single-gate cohort. Studies were eligible when they recruited people presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies that included people who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract, and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist, and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Analyses were restricted to prospective studies only. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary prospective studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.

Main Results

We identified 90 studies; for this update we focused on the results of 42 prospective studies with 52,608 participants. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 3.7% to 60.6% with a median of 27.4%. Thirty-five studies were set in emergency departments or outpatient test centres (46,878 participants), three in primary care settings (1230 participants), two in a mixed population of in- and outpatients in a paediatric hospital setting (493 participants), and two overlapping studies in nursing homes (4007 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild COVID-19 disease from COVID-19 pneumonia, so we present the results for both conditions together. Twelve studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because they used a high level of preselection to decide whether reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was needed, or because they enrolled a non-consecutive sample, or because they excluded individuals while they were part of the study base. We rated 36 of the 42 studies as high risk of bias for the index tests because there was little or no detail on how, by whom and when, the symptoms were measured. For most studies, eligibility for testing was dependent on the local case definition and testing criteria that were in effect at the time of the study, meaning most people who were included in studies had already been referred to health services based on the symptoms that we are evaluating in this review. The applicability of the results of this review iteration improved in comparison with the previous reviews. This version has more studies of people presenting to ambulatory settings, which is where the majority of assessments for COVID-19 take place. Only three studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 96 symptoms or combinations of signs and symptoms. Evidence on individual signs as diagnostic tests was rarely reported, so this review reports mainly on the diagnostic value of symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. RT-PCR was the most often used reference standard (40/42 studies). Only cough (11 studies) had a summary sensitivity above 50% (62.4%, 95% CI 50.6% to 72.9%)); its specificity was low (45.4%, 95% CI 33.5% to 57.9%)). Presence of fever had a sensitivity of 37.6% (95% CI 23.4% to 54.3%) and a specificity of 75.2% (95% CI 56.3% to 87.8%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of cough was 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) and that of fever 1.52 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.10). Sore throat had a summary positive likelihood ratio of 0.814 (95% CI 0.714 to 0.929), which means that its presence increases the probability of having an infectious disease other than COVID-19. Dyspnoea (12 studies) and fatigue (8 studies) had a sensitivity of 23.3% (95% CI 16.4% to 31.9%) and 40.2% (95% CI 19.4% to 65.1%) respectively. Their specificity was 75.7% (95% CI 65.2% to 83.9%) and 73.6% (95% CI 48.4% to 89.3%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of dyspnoea was 0.96 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.11) and that of fatigue 1.52 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.91), which means that the presence of fatigue slightly increases the probability of having COVID-19. Anosmia alone (7 studies), ageusia alone (5 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had summary sensitivities below 50% but summary specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a summary sensitivity of 26.4% (95% CI 13.8% to 44.6%) and a specificity of 94.2% (95% CI 90.6% to 96.5%). Ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 23.2% (95% CI 10.6% to 43.3%) and a specificity of 92.6% (95% CI 83.1% to 97.0%). Anosmia or ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 39.2% (95% CI 26.5% to 53.6%) and a specificity of 92.1% (95% CI 84.5% to 96.2%). The summary positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.55 (95% CI 3.46 to 5.97) and 4.99 (95% CI 3.22 to 7.75) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The summary positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was 3.14 (95% CI 1.79 to 5.51). Twenty-four studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining olfactory symptoms. By combining symptoms with other information such as contact or travel history, age, gender, and a local recent case detection rate, some multivariable prediction scores reached a sensitivity as high as 90%.

Authors' Conclusions

Most individual symptoms included in this review have poor diagnostic accuracy. Neither absence nor presence of symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out the disease. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for the presence of COVID-19. The presence of cough also supports further testing. There is currently no evidence to support further testing with PCR in any individuals presenting only with upper respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, coryza or rhinorrhoea. Combinations of symptoms with other readily available information such as contact or travel history, or the local recent case detection rate may prove more useful and should be further investigated in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. The diagnostic accuracy of symptoms for COVID-19 is moderate to low and any testing strategy using symptoms as selection mechanism will result in both large numbers of missed cases and large numbers of people requiring testing. Which one of these is minimised, is determined by the goal of COVID-19 testing strategies, that is, controlling the epidemic by isolating every possible case versus identifying those with clinically important disease so that they can be monitored or treated to optimise their prognosis. The former will require a testing strategy that uses very few symptoms as entry criterion for testing, the latter could focus on more specific symptoms such as fever and anosmia.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112FFUZj]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — conclusions and practice suggestions emphasize that there should be an assessment of clinical symptoms and signs, and those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, whereas there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. Microbiological diagnostic testing should be considered when the results may indicate a change in therapy. For outpatient adults with acute cough, we suggest the use of empiric antibiotics when pneumonia is suspected based on epidemiologic and clinical features in settings in which imaging cannot be performed, but where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. For suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and hospitalization and improved outcomes.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1161d6Je]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Workshop format and methods — participants were invited based on relevant expertise and vetted for conflicts, and consensus was built using two Delphi rounds. Two rounds of a Delphi survey were administered before the live workshop; round one consisted of 34 questions across definition, populations and risk categories, diagnostic criteria (microbiology and radiology), and clinical trial considerations; participants used a Likert scale with consensus defined as at least 70% agreement of participant responses; a second set of Delphi statements refined areas of consensus.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^113vsfAC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to indications for microbiological testing, IDSA 2007 guidelines recommend to obtain evaluation for specific pathogens that would significantly alter empirical management decisions in patients with CAP if the presence of such pathogens is suspected based on clinical and epidemiologic clues.

### Development and validation of a simple tool composed of items on dyspnea, respiration rates, and C-reactive protein for pneumonia prediction among acute febrile respiratory illness patients in primary care settings [^114mKQms]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI) leading to pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. How to identify potential pneumonia cost-effectively is the priority for the physician in treating AFRI patients, because patients with pneumonia require specific anti-infection treatment. According to most clinical guidelines globally, acute pulmonary infiltrates on computerized tomography (CT) are the reference standard for diagnosing pneumonia. However, CT scans are not always conveniently accessible or properly used in many primary care settings due to economic reasons or physicians' clinical experience limitations. Instead, chest X-ray is used more frequently. Although chest X-ray could be an alternative in some cases, it may result in missed diagnosis of pneumonia at an early stage due to the low resolution of lung images. Especially for viral pneumonia, a little patchy interstitial infiltration at the initial stage is difficult to be identified on chest X-ray. This then necessitates the need for pneumonia prediction by clinical features, which could help physicians identify potential pneumonia patients more quickly and accurately and then use CT scans to confirm diagnosis.

Several clinical features have been identified for pneumonia prediction in outpatient settings. According to a meta-analysis in adults, symptoms such as cough, fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea were limited as a single predictor for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Clinical features that showed the best pooled positive likelihood ratios were respiration rates > 20/min, temperature ≥ 38 °C, pulse rates > 100/min, crackles, and molecular biomarkers of procalcitonin (PCT) > 0.25 ng/ml and C-reactive protein (CRP) > 20 mg/l. However, so far clinical decision rule that combines these clinical features together for predicting radiographic pneumonia is still lacking.

In this study, we assessed the value of symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests in predicting pneumonia among AFRI patients who came to our fever clinics and worked out a simple multivariable model for pneumonia prediction in these patients. Then an external multi-center validation study was conducted with a bigger and more varied patient population in 5 primary care settings from different provinces in China.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^1127aTvn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatients (including emergency department patients) during influenza activity (defined as the circulation of seasonal influenza A and B viruses among persons in the local community) have the following testing recommendations: Clinicians should test for influenza in high-risk patients, including immunocompromised persons who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness (eg, cough without fever) if the testing result will influence clinical management (A-III). Clinicians should test for influenza in patients who present with acute onset of respiratory symptoms with or without fever, and either exacerbation of chronic medical conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart failure) or known complications of influenza (eg, pneumonia) if the testing result will influence clinical management (A-III). Clinicians can consider influenza testing for patients not at high risk for influenza complications who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness and who are likely to be discharged home if the result will influence antiviral treatment decisions or reduce use of unnecessary antibiotics, further diagnostic testing, and time in the emergency department, or if results might influence treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions for high-risk household contacts (C-III).

### Decoding community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and analysis of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical trials [^111uqdQZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening condition. Even though the disease is common, evidence on CAP management is often of variable quality. This may be reinforced by the lack of a systematic and homogeneous way of defining the disease in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Objectives

This study aims to assess the diagnostic criteria and definitions of the term 'community-acquired' used in RCTs on CAP management.

Data Sources

On the basis of the protocol (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019147411), we conducted a systematic search of Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs published or registered between 2010 and 2024.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Study eligibility criteria included completed and ongoing RCTs.

Participants

Participants included adults hospitalized with CAP.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Data were collected using a tested extraction sheet, as endorsed by the Cochrane Collaboration. After cross-checking, data were synthesized in a narrative and tabular form.

Results

In total, 7173 records were identified through our searches. After removing records that did not fulfil the eligibility criteria, 170 studies were included. Diagnostic criteria were provided in 69.4% of studies, and the term 'community-acquired' was defined in 55.3% of studies. The most frequently included diagnostic criteria were pulmonary infiltrates (94.1%), cough (78.8%), fever (77.1%), dyspnoea (62.7%), sputum (57.6%), auscultation/percussion abnormalities (55.9%), and chest pain/discomfort (52.5%). The different criteria were used in 87 different sets across the studies. The term 'community-acquired' was defined in 57 different ways.

Conclusions

The diagnostic criteria and definitions of CAP in RCTs exhibit significant heterogeneity. Standardizing these criteria in clinical trials is crucial to ensure comparability across studies.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^112ENfbz]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Nk9cA]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza — states that for outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest the following clinical symptoms and signs are suggestive of pneumonia: cough; dyspnea; pleural pain; sweating, fevers, or shivers; aches and pains; temperature ≥ 38°C; tachypnea; and new and localizing chest examination signs. Those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Although the measurement of C-reactive protein levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. We suggest that there is no need for routine microbiological testing. We suggest the use of empiric antibiotics according to local and national guidelines when pneumonia is suspected in settings in which imaging cannot be performed. Where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. For outpatient adults with acute cough and suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment (according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice) within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and improved outcomes.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^1174NG85]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) stands as the most prevalent and serious hospital-acquired infection observed in intensive care units. VAP prolongs hospital stays, durations of mechanical ventilation, and is associated with considerable mortality and an increase in healthcare costs.

Diagnosing VAP can be challenging for clinicians as it shares clinical signs and symptoms with other forms of pneumonia as well as non-infectious conditions. The most recent international clinical guidelines define VAP as the presence of respiratory infection signs combined with new radiographic infiltrates in a patient who has been ventilated for at least 48 h. While the guidelines developed by ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT do not provide a detailed definition of signs of respiratory infection, the ATS/IDSA guidelines mention that clinical signs may include the new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leucocytosis, and decline in oxygenation. However, the ATS/IDSA guideline panel also acknowledges that there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of VAP. This lack of a standardised definition is further highlighted by the varying, surveillance-based definitions of VAP provided by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). These definitions, focusing on a combination of clinical, radiological, and microbiological signs to identify cases of VAP, were established to standardise reporting and facilitate the monitoring of infections in healthcare settings. However, the criteria given by the CDC and ECDC may not always align with the diagnostic criteria used by clinicians to confirm or rule out the condition.

### Is influenza an influenza-like illness? Clinical presentation of influenza in hospitalized patients [^116ZgQii]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Early recognition of influenza virus infection in hospitalized patients can prevent nosocomial transmission.

Objective

To determine the clinical presentation of influenza in hospitalized patients.

Design

Case series. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and included demographic information, comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, microbiologic test results, and outcomes (including pneumonia and intensive care unit [ICU] admission).

Setting

A 1,400-bed teaching hospital.

Patients

A total of 207 inpatients who received a diagnosis of influenza virus infection during 3 seasons from 2000 to 2003.

Results

Over the course of 3 seasons, 207 patients received a diagnosis of influenza (186 were infected with influenza A virus, and 21 were infected with influenza B virus). The most commonly reported symptoms were cough (186 patients [90%]) and subjective fever (137 patients [66%]); 124 patients (60%) had a documented temperature of 37.8 degrees C or greater before influenza was diagnosed. Sore throat was uncommon (44 patients [21%]). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI) — temperature 37.8 degrees C or greater and either cough or sore throat — were met by 107 patients (51%). There were no differences in the proportion of patients who met ILI criteria with respect to age, sex, season, influenza virus type, or time to diagnosis in the hospital. Most patients (150 [72%]) received acetaminophen. Only 41 patients (20%) had positive results of clinical cultures; 178 patients (86%) received antibiotic therapy. Fifty-six patients (27%) had pneumonia: 36 (17%) required admission to the ICU, and 25 (12%) required ventilatory support. Patients with pulmonary disease were more likely to require ventilatory support (12 [26%] vs 13 [8%]; p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Only half of hospitalized patients with influenza met CDC criteria for ILI. These criteria may be more appropriate in outpatient settings. A high index of suspicion is needed to recognize influenza in hospitalized patients.

### Distribution and determinants of pneumonia diagnosis using integrated management of childhood illness guidelines: a nationally representative study in Malawi [^113LMwJN]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Of the 3136 children in our sample at least 2 months old, 573 (18%) met the IMCI-based criteria for pneumonia diagnosis based on re-examination. Only 118 children (21%) of these children were correctly diagnosed with pneumonia (table 2). Of the 455 children meeting the case definition of pneumonia who were not diagnosed with it (ie, had a 'missed diagnosis'), 212 (46%) were diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection and 158 (34%) were diagnosed with malaria; older children were more likely to be diagnosed with malaria than children under one (36.4% vs 21.4%, P < 0.001, data not shown). Among the children meeting IMCI criteria for pneumonia, the overwhelming majority (90%) had symptoms with a duration of less than 1 week, suggesting acute illness (data not shown). Sensitivity was lower in children 12 months to 59 months old, with 78 of 428 (18% sensitivity) diagnosed with pneumonia compared with 40 of 145 cases (28% sensitivity) in children under one. Healthcare workers were more likely to assign the correct diagnosis when children presented with fever, high respiration or both as well as cough: sensitivity among these children (n = 206) was 28%. Although prevalence of confirmed fever was equal across age groups, caretakers of children over one were more likely to report fever as a cause for the visit (76.7% vs 63.4%, P = 0.003), with or without cough or other symptom (data not shown).

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^116QoCrf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The clinical implications of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are highly variable. Some people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID‐19 and COVID‐19 pneumonia in others. This can lead to some people requiring intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of smell or taste, and signs such as oxygen saturation are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID‐19, or select patients for further testing. This is an update of this review, the first version of which published in July 2020.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID‐19 clinics, has COVID‐19.

Search methods

For this review iteration we undertook electronic searches up to 15 July 2020 in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection criteria

Studies were eligible if they included patients with clinically suspected COVID‐19, or if they recruited known cases with COVID‐19 and controls without COVID‐19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies in hospitalised patients were only included if symptoms and signs were recorded on admission or at presentation. Studies including patients who contracted SARS‐CoV‐2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.

Data collection and analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full‐text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) checklist. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random‐effects meta‐analysis whenever five or more primary studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.

Main results

We identified 44 studies including 26,884 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID‐19 varied from 3% to 71% with a median of 21%. There were three studies from primary care settings (1824 participants), nine studies from outpatient testing centres (10,717 participants), 12 studies performed in hospital outpatient wards (5061 participants), seven studies in hospitalised patients (1048 participants), 10 studies in the emergency department (3173 participants), and three studies in which the setting was not specified (5061 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild from severe COVID‐19, so we present the results for all disease severities together.

Fifteen studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. This may have especially influenced the sensitivity of those features used in referral protocols, such as fever and cough. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional 12 studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. This makes it very difficult to judge the validity of the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms from these included studies.

The applicability of the results of this review update improved in comparison with the original review. A greater proportion of studies included participants who presented to outpatient settings, which is where the majority of clinical assessments for COVID‐19 take place. However, still none of the studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults.

We found data on 84 signs and symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. Only cough (25 studies) and fever (7 studies) had a pooled sensitivity of at least 50% but specificities were moderate to low. Cough had a sensitivity of 67.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.8% to 74.1%) and specificity of 35.0% (95% CI 28.7% to 41.9%). Fever had a sensitivity of 53.8% (95% CI 35.0% to 71.7%) and a specificity of 67.4% (95% CI 53.3% to 78.9%). The pooled positive likelihood ratio of cough was only 1.04 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.11) and that of fever 1.65 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.93).

Anosmia alone (11 studies), ageusia alone (6 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had sensitivities below 50% but specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a pooled sensitivity of 28.0% (95% CI 17.7% to 41.3%) and a specificity of 93.4% (95% CI 88.3% to 96.4%). Ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 24.8% (95% CI 12.4% to 43.5%) and a specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 81.3% to 96.3%). Anosmia or ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 41.0% (95% CI 27.0% to 56.6%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.4%). The pooled positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.25 (95% CI 3.17 to 5.71) and 4.31 (95% CI 3.00 to 6.18) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was only 2.88 (95% CI 2.02 to 4.09).

Only two studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining fever and cough with other symptoms. These combinations had a specificity above 80%, but at the cost of very low sensitivity (< 30%).

Authors' conclusions

The majority of individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic accuracy, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out COVID‐19. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID‐19. The presence of fever or cough, given their high sensitivities, may also be useful to identify people for further testing.

Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID‐19, are still urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111ZUJ8V]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia — C-reactive protein (CRP): For outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) because the addition of CRP to features such as fever (38°C or greater), pleural pain, dyspnea and tachypnea, and signs on physical examination of the chest (tachypnea and new and localizing chest examination signs) strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia (Grade 2C). The quality of evidence is low but a CRP > 30 mg/L in addition to suggestive symptoms and signs increases the likelihood that the cough may be related to having pneumonia; acute cough (ie, < 3 weeks in duration) is less likely to be caused by a pneumonia when the CRP < 10 mg/L or between 10–50 mg/L in the absence of dyspnea and daily fever.

Discussion

Main findings

Pneumonia was diagnosed by chest x radiography in 140 (5%) of the 2820 patients presenting to primary care with acute cough. The optimal combination of symptoms and signs for predicting pneumonia was absence of runny nose and presence of breathlessness, crackles and diminished breath sounds on auscultation, tachycardia, and fever. Signs and symptoms were useful in correctly identifying patients with a "low" (< 2.5%) or "high" (> 20%) diagnostic risk in 26% of patients. In the 74% of patients in whom diagnostic doubt remained (estimated risk 2.5%-20%), measurement of C reactive protein (CRP) concentration helped to correctly exclude pneumonia. A simplified diagnostic score based on symptoms, signs, and CRP concentration resulted in proportions of pneumonia of 0.7%, 4%, and 18% in the low, intermediate, and high risk group, respectively. Measurement of procalcitonin concentration had no clinically relevant added value in this setting.

Influenza in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients — atypical presentation and testing triggers: Immunocompromised patients may present without typical findings of influenza, and the CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) criteria, defined as fever and either cough or sore throat, were poorly predictive of RT-PCR–positive cases; in an ambulatory stem cell transplant center outbreak, only 7% met the CDC ILI definition and only a minority had fever. Nosocomial acquisition should be considered when fever begins ≥ 48 hours after hospital admission during influenza season, and during influenza season, even without fever, new or worsening or unexplained cough in a hospitalized patient should prompt testing for influenza. In a 2015 prospective study among 504 hospitalized or emergency department patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, only 29% were clinically diagnosed with influenza; receiving a diagnosis of bacterial infection decreased the likelihood of an influenza diagnosis by 3-fold.

### Is it possible to distinguish between atypical pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia? evaluation of the guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia in Japan [^116qNyga]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) published the guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in 2000. The guidelines set up nine parameters and criteria for the differential diagnosis of atypical pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia based on clinical symptoms, physical signs and laboratory data. To evaluate the performance of these guideline criteria, 91 cases of Chlamydia pneumoniae (53 cases were pure-C. pneumoniae and 38 cases were mixed-C. pneumoniae pneumonia), 103 cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (86 cases were pure-M. pneumoniae and 17 cases were mixed-M. pneumoniae pneumonia) and 144 cases of bacterial (Streptococcus pneumoniae and/or Haemophilus influenzae) pneumonia were analyzed. The accordance rate for a suspected atypical pneumonia with the guideline criteria was 84.8% for pure-M. pneumoniae pneumonia and 60.3% for pure-C. pneumoniae pneumonia, but only 9.0% for bacterial pneumonia, 12.1% for mixed-C. pneumoniae pneumonia and 16.6% for mixed-M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria in the JRS guidelines were 75.5% and 90.9%, respectively. Our results indicated that the differentiation of pneumonia in the JRS guidelines is useful for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia, but difficult to apply to the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae pneumonia.

### Use of serum C reactive protein and procalcitonin concentrations in addition to symptoms and signs to predict pneumonia in patients presenting to primary care with acute cough: diagnostic study [^113JDTp2]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Absence of a runny nose and presence of dry cough, breathlessness, chest pain, diarrhoea, fever, and crackles have previously been found to have diagnostic value for pneumonia in primary care populations". Tachycardia" and "diminished vesicular breathing" have diagnostic value in secondary care populations. We were able to confirm the predictive value of most of these items, apart from chest pain and diarrhoea. Differences between our findings and those from previous studies could relate to the difference in prevalence of pneumonia, inclusion criteria, and outcome definition.

Our finding that CRP concentration can be low in people with pneumonia is not new. Flanders and colleagues reported on a small subgroup of patients with pneumonia who had a CRP of less than 11 mg/L. In the 54 patients with pneumonia with low CRP in our study, the estimated diagnostic risk of pneumonia was high (n = 3) or intermediate (n = 51) based on history and physical examination results as defined in our model. These findings emphasise that CRP test results should be interpreted together with clinical findings.

Of the factors known to lower CRP — such as steroid useand duration of disease — only steroid use (including both oral and inhaled steroids) was significantly more prevalent in the group of patients with pneumonia with low CRP concentration. Exclusion of all steroid users from our analyses resulted in a similar association between CRP concentration and pneumonia.

Procalcitonin concentrations in our study were higher in patients with pneumonia and comparable with previous findings in patients with lower respiratory tract infection in primary care. They did not, however, add meaningful diagnostic information. Holm and colleagues showed a clear association between procalcitonin concentration and radiographic pneumonia as well as bacterial infection, but the positive predictive value was too low to be useful in clinical practice. Our findings support this conclusion. Moreover, Holm and colleagues studied a population with a higher prevalence of pneumonia (13%) and did not combine history and physical examination with procalcitonin test results.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117Hj5DT]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Acute cough outpatients — PICO question 1 (chest radiograph plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone) — the search retrieved 43 publications and identified 19 studies for full‑text review, but no studies met all criteria and no articles directly addressed the question. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) partially addressed it: patients had chest radiographs and the treating team was randomly assigned as to whether they received the chest radiograph result; overall, the provision of chest radiograph results did not lead to better patient outcomes or significantly different treatment strategies. Among patients for whom a chest radiograph would not be ordered routinely, approximately 2% had an infiltrate. The authors concluded that it is safe to not obtain a chest radiograph for all patients with acute cough illness and recommended limiting chest radiographs to situations in which the history and physical examination suggest the need for antibiotic treatment and a chest radiograph would alter this decision; in a small subset of patients, a chest radiograph provides added diagnostic value in addition to clinical judgment in the management of adults with acute cough.

### A decision aid to rule out pneumonia and reduce unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics in primary care patients with cough and fever [^116hu8iR]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory tract infections are the most frequent reasons for unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and inappropriate treatment with antibiotics is one of the avoidable causes for the world-wide increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Guidelines and patient information leaflets emphasize this serious problem by recommending antibiotics only for patients with bacterial pneumonia and not for patients with acute bronchitis or mild exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The reasons for the still high rate of inappropriate prescriptions in patients with cough and fever are manifold. An important and comprehensible one is that physicians do not want to miss the diagnosis of pneumonia. The problem in daily practice is that no single symptom or clinical sign is pathognomonic for the presence or absence of pneumonia, and differentiation between pneumonia and non-pneumonia based on single clinical signs is not possible.

While a normal chest x-ray, the reference test applied in clinical practice, rules out pneumonia with a high degree of certainty, recommendations discourage performing an x-ray in every patient presenting with a cough and increased body temperature. Costs are unjustifiably high and patients would be exposed to radiation unnecessarily. An easy applicable diagnostic aid to support primary care physicians in ruling out pneumonia and to identify patients for whom treatment with antibiotics is not necessary would be helpful but is unavailable.

The aim of this study was the development of a diagnostic aid, based on clinical signs and the measurement of C-reactive protein, to support physicians to safely rule out pneumonia in patients with cough and fever and to help in reducing unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^1144MpiB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what are experienced by patients, for example cough or nausea. Signs are obtained by clinical examination. Signs of COVID‐19 examined in this review include lung sounds, blood pressure, blood oxygen level and heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever at examination greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste (Struyf 2021). Signs and symptoms indicating possible pneumonia (severe or critical disease) include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Clinical pathway

Important in the context of COVID‐19 is that the pathway is multifaceted because it is designed to care for the diseased individual and to protect the community from further spread. Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time if and when effective treatments are identified and populations are increasingly vaccinated. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to inform rational decision making.

Prior test(s)

Prior testing will depend on whether people are being investigated for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, mild COVID‐19 or COVID‐19 pneumonia. In this review on signs and symptoms, no prior tests are required because signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and in identifying people with mild COVID‐19 or COVID‐19 pneumonia.

Role of index test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used as triage tests, that is, to rule out SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or COVID‐19 disease, but also to identify people with possible COVID‐19 who may require further testing, care escalation or isolation.

Outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia — clinical features: For outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest the following clinical symptoms and signs are suggestive of pneumonia (cough, dyspnea, pleural pain, sweating/ fevers/shivers, aches and pains, temperature 38°C or greater, tachypnea and new and localizing chest examination signs) (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). The quality of evidence is low but the absence of runny nose and presence of breathlessness, crackles and/or diminished breath sounds on auscultation, tachycardia, and fever (38°C or greater) is suggestive of pneumonia.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113gmuYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia [^114pZt1j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is a significant cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics is recommended. However, M. pneumoniae is difficult to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and signs. Diagnostic uncertainty can lead to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, which may worsen clinical prognosis and increase antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are (i) to assess the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia; and (ii) to assess the influence of potential sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (January 1950 to 26 June 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to 26 June 2012). We identified additional references by handsearching the reference lists of included articles and snowballing. We searched the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews identified by searching the Medion database, Database of Reviews of Effects 2012, Issue 6 (25 June 2012) and the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy studies (2 July 2012). Experts in the field reviewed our list of included studies for any obvious omissions.

Selection Criteria

We included peer-reviewed published studies which prospectively and consecutively recruited children with community-acquired pneumonia from any healthcare setting, confirmed the presence of M. pneumoniae using serology with or without other laboratory methods and reported data on clinical symptoms and signs in sufficient detail to construct 2 x 2 tables.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author scanned titles to exclude obviously irrelevant articles. Two review authors independently scanned the remaining titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text versions of potentially relevant articles, assessed the quality of included articles and extracted data on study characteristics and the following clinical features: cough, wheeze, coryza, crepitations, fever, rhonchi, shortness of breath, chest pain, diarrhea, myalgia and headache. We calculated study-specific values for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We estimated the post-test probability of M. pneumoniae based on the absence or presence of symptoms and signs. We calculated pooled sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% CIs for symptoms and signs where data were reported by at least four included studies by fitting a bivariate normal model for the logit transforms of sensitivity and specificity. We explored potential sources of heterogeneity by fitting bivariate models with covariates using multi-level mixed-effects logistic regression. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding data from studies for which we were concerned about the representativeness of the study population and/or the acceptability of the reference standard.

Main Results

Our search identified 8299 articles (excluding duplicates). We examined the titles and abstracts of 1125 articles and the full-text versions of 97 articles. We included seven studies in our review, which reported data from 1491 children; all were conducted in hospital settings. Overall, study quality was moderate. In two studies the presence of chest pain more than doubled the probability of M. pneumoniae. Wheeze was 12% more likely to be absent in children with M. pneumoniae (pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; pooled negative likelihood ratio (LR-) 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.23). Our sensitivity analysis showed that the presence of crepitations was associated with M. pneumoniae, but this finding was of borderline statistical significance (pooled LR+ 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; pooled LR- 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.96).

Authors' Conclusions

M. pneumoniae cannot be reliably diagnosed in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical symptoms and signs. Although the absence of wheeze is a statistically significant diagnostic indicator, it does not have sufficient diagnostic value to guide empirical macrolide treatment. Data from two studies suggest that the presence of chest pain more than doubles the probability of M. pneumoniae. However, further research is needed to substantiate this finding. More high quality large-scale studies in primary care settings are needed to help develop prediction rules based on epidemiological data as well as clinical and baseline patient characteristics.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) evaluation in adults — five clinical scenarios are outlined with specific recommended evaluations as follows: For any patient with a cough of > 2–3 wk duration with at least one additional symptom (fever, night sweats, weight loss, or hemoptysis), the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB (or if patient has HIV infection), collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an unexplained illness, including respiratory symptoms, of > 2–3 wk duration, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB, collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient with HIV infection and with cough and fever, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia who has not improved after 7 d of treatment, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an abnormal chest radiograph suggestive of TB even if symptoms are minimal or absent, the recommended evaluation is review of previous chest radiographs if available, three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

Consensus statement — immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) diagnosis requires clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, and with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate; the panel determined that the formal diagnostic criteria for ICHP would be best presented as an algorithm, with an approach for hosts with a known immune defect determined by compatible clinical presentation, possible pathogen identification, and exclusion of competing causes of the clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic manifestations, and an alternate algorithm for patients without previously known immune defects who present with evidence of pneumonia caused by an unusual opportunistic pathogen; additionally, clarifying statement 1 notes that clinical presentations of pneumonia are often atypical in immunocompromised hosts, therefore signs and symptoms of pneumonia are not required.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients and study design

We analyzed samples from prospectively enrolled CAP patients at Haukeland University Hospital, a tertiary care referral center in Bergen, Norway. The patients had been included in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (CAPNOR, NCT04660084) or a following observational study on ED patients with suspected CAP, between October 1, 2020, and September 19, 2022. The criteria for eligibility were the same in both cohorts. In short, patients were considered for inclusion if they were ≥ 18 years, presenting to the ED with a suspicion of CAP and fulfilling at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening cough; new or worsening expectoration of sputum; new or worsening dyspnea; hemoptysis; pleuritic chest pain; radiological evidence of pneumonia; abnormalities on chest auscultation and/or percussion; fever (≥ 38.0°C). Exclusion criteria were cystic fibrosis, severe bronchiectasis, hospitalization within the last 14 days prior to admission, a palliative approach (defined as life expectancy below two weeks), or if the patient was not willing or able to provide an LRT sample. For the current investigation, all participants with a confirmed diagnosis of CAP were considered, provided that a paired OP- and high-quality LRT sample were available for analysis. The diagnostic criteria for CAP in the CAPNOR RCT have been described elsewhere.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^1159xND5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses of the review

Strengths of our review are the systematic and broad search performed to include all possible studies, including those prior to peer‐review, to gather the largest number of studies available at this point. Exclusion of cases‐only studies, the largest number of the published cohorts of patients with COVID‐19, limits the available data but also improves the quality of the evidence and the possibility to present both sensitivity and specificity (cases only cannot provide both accuracy measures). Because this is a living systematic review, future updates may offer the possibility to do a meta‐analysis, which was not possible at this stage. In addition, further insights into this novel disease may lead to new evidence on signs and symptoms that are more diagnostic, which we will incorporate in future updates.

The lack of data on combinations of signs and symptoms is an important evidence gap. Consequently, there is no evidence on syndromic presentation and the value of composite signs and symptoms on the diagnostic accuracy measures. In addition, subgroup analyses by the pre‐defined variables were not feasible due to lack of reporting.

We need to assess multiple variables for their possible confounding effect on the summary estimates. Possible confounders include the presence of other respiratory pathogens (seasonality), the phase of the epidemic, exposure to high versus low prevalence setting, high or low exposure risk, comorbidity of the participants, or time since infection. Seasonality may influence specificity, because alternative diagnoses such as influenza or other respiratory viruses are more prevalent in winter, leading to more non‐COVID‐19 patients displaying symptoms such as cough or fever, decreasing specificity. In this version of the review, all studies were conducted in Winter or early Spring, suggesting this may still have been at play. However, social distancing policies have shortened this year's influenza season in several countries, which may have led to higher specificity for signs and symptoms than what we may expect in the next influenza season. In future updates of the review, we will explore seasonality effects if data allow. As for time since onset, given that the moment of infection is more likely than not an unrecognisable and unmeasurable variable, time since onset of symptoms can be used as a proxy. Reporting of studies, with presentation of the 2x2 table stratified by time since onset of disease, is informative and might have the potential to increase accuracy of the signs and symptoms and their diagnostic differential potential.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^116DLWHi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Only two studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining both fever and cough. These combinations had a specificity above 80%, but at the cost of very low sensitivity (< 30%).

We concluded that the majority of individual signs and symptoms included in the review appear to have very poor diagnostic accuracy, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on the available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for the presence of COVID‐19. The presence of fever or cough may, given their high sensitivities, be useful as a triage tool for further testing.

New evidence since previous review

We found more studies on symptoms in people with suspected COVID‐19 that used prospective data collection, allowing for more reliable estimation of measures of diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, this update contains new studies on the diagnostic value of 29 different combinations of signs and symptoms.

Limitations of previous review

The main weakness of the initial review and of the first update was the high risk of selection bias, with many studies including patients who had already been admitted to hospital or who had presented to hospital settings with the intent to hospitalise.

The lack of data on combinations of signs and symptoms was an important evidence gap. Only two studies presented data on such combinations. The few composite signs and symptoms that were presented in those studies had little added diagnostic value compared to single tests.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113MuD7Q]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — scope and key clinical questions focus on suspected pneumonia or influenza in nonimmunocompromised patients and frame eight PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions across diagnosis and treatment. The guideline states it "do[es] not include acute bronchitis and other upper respiratory tract infections" and "exclude[s] patients who are immunocompromised". It reports "Eight PICO questions were formulated", addressing diagnostic confirmation (chest radiography plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone; C-reactive protein [CRP] or procalcitonin rather than symptoms alone to predict pneumonia; diagnostic algorithm/clinical prediction rule/diagnostic score plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia; microbiological testing plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia) and therapeutic strategies (antibiotics vs no antibiotics; nonantibiotic therapy vs none; antibiotics with atypical coverage vs without atypical coverage; antiviral therapy vs no antiviral therapy with outcomes including antibiotic prescriptions, visits, hospitalizations, or mortality).

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116g381C]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — acute cough evidence base included only three studies meeting quality assessment, all with a high risk of bias; all were prospective with no harms reported, and none had a control group or used a validated outcome tool for cough assessment; two studies defined acute cough as < 3 weeks and the third as no more than 28 days; all the subjects (N = 308) sought medical attention for complaints of cough < 3 weeks' duration; the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Kxyq1]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis" for acute bronchitis.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this common respiratory condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby guiding appropriate treatment and management strategies.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis are based on four key components. The first component is the presence of symptoms indicative of an acute respiratory infection, predominantly cough, with or without sputum production. The second component is the duration of these symptoms, which should be less than three weeks. The third component involves ruling out pneumonia, both clinically and radiographically, as the cause of the cough. The final component requires the exclusion of other potential causes of the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered likely if all four components are met. Conversely, if these criteria are not fully met, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the clinical assessment of patients presenting with cough and other symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection, helping to distinguish acute bronchitis from other respiratory conditions.

The diagnostic criteria for determining the likelihood of acute bronchitis involve assessing four key factors. The diagnostic tool articulates these factors as follows:

- Symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, specifically a cough, with or without sputum production.
- Symptoms persisting for less than 3 weeks.
- Exclusion of pneumonia as the cause of the cough, established through clinical evaluation and radiographic evidence.
- Elimination of other potential causes for the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

For evaluating the likelihood of acute bronchitis, the diagnostic process simplifies to checking each of these criteria. If all four criteria are confirmed as true, it suggests that acute bronchitis is likely. Conversely, if any of these criteria are not met, the likelihood of acute bronchitis is considered improbable.

This structured approach aids in distinguishing acute bronchitis from other conditions that might present similar respiratory symptoms, providing a clear pathway for diagnosis based on clinical markers and exclusions.

### Children with cough and fever: up-to-date imaging evaluation and management [^1117erMc]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Cough and fever in infants and children are frequent but nonspecific symptoms. Several usual differential diagnoses are under consideration and imaging is often necessary to help arrive at an accurate diagnosis and ensure proper management. A broad spectrum of underlying disorders may be present. Radiologists must remain cognizant of the potential for immune dysfunction and underlying structural abnormalities. A clear understanding of up-to-date imaging evaluation recommendations and characteristic imaging features can assist radiologists and clinicians in arriving at the most accurate diagnosis in a timely manner and help ensure proper management and necessary follow-up imaging assessment.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^114udGCG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable. Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in others. This can lead to some people requiring intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of smell or taste, and signs such as oxygen saturation are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19, or select patients for further testing. This is an update of this review, the first version of which published in July 2020.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.

Search Methods

For this review iteration we undertook electronic searches up to 15 July 2020 in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies in hospitalised patients were only included if symptoms and signs were recorded on admission or at presentation. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.

Main Results

We identified 44 studies including 26,884 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 varied from 3% to 71% with a median of 21%. There were three studies from primary care settings (1824 participants), nine studies from outpatient testing centres (10,717 participants), 12 studies performed in hospital outpatient wards (5061 participants), seven studies in hospitalised patients (1048 participants), 10 studies in the emergency department (3173 participants), and three studies in which the setting was not specified (5061 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild from severe COVID-19, so we present the results for all disease severities together. Fifteen studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. This may have especially influenced the sensitivity of those features used in referral protocols, such as fever and cough. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional 12 studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. This makes it very difficult to judge the validity of the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms from these included studies. The applicability of the results of this review update improved in comparison with the original review. A greater proportion of studies included participants who presented to outpatient settings, which is where the majority of clinical assessments for COVID-19 take place. However, still none of the studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 84 signs and symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. Only cough (25 studies) and fever (7 studies) had a pooled sensitivity of at least 50% but specificities were moderate to low. Cough had a sensitivity of 67.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.8% to 74.1%) and specificity of 35.0% (95% CI 28.7% to 41.9%). Fever had a sensitivity of 53.8% (95% CI 35.0% to 71.7%) and a specificity of 67.4% (95% CI 53.3% to 78.9%). The pooled positive likelihood ratio of cough was only 1.04 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.11) and that of fever 1.65 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.93). Anosmia alone (11 studies), ageusia alone (6 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had sensitivities below 50% but specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a pooled sensitivity of 28.0% (95% CI 17.7% to 41.3%) and a specificity of 93.4% (95% CI 88.3% to 96.4%). Ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 24.8% (95% CI 12.4% to 43.5%) and a specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 81.3% to 96.3%). Anosmia or ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 41.0% (95% CI 27.0% to 56.6%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.4%). The pooled positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.25 (95% CI 3.17 to 5.71) and 4.31 (95% CI 3.00 to 6.18) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was only 2.88 (95% CI 2.02 to 4.09). Only two studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining fever and cough with other symptoms. These combinations had a specificity above 80%, but at the cost of very low sensitivity (< 30%).

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic accuracy, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out COVID-19. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID-19. The presence of fever or cough, given their high sensitivities, may also be useful to identify people for further testing. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19, are still urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Pneumocystis pneumonia, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ECIL 2016 guidelines recommend to use composite criteria to assess the need for diagnostic bronchoscopy and empiric treatment for PCP, as single clinical diagnostic criteria are insufficient to prove the diagnosis:

- patient at risk

- clinical signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and/or cough, fever, hypoxemia, chest pain

- imaging findings compatible with PCP, preferably chest CT

- with or without unexplained serum LDH elevation.

### An analysis of clinical predictive values for radiographic pneumonia in children [^115QVXVr]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children 1–59 months of age worldwide. Annually, there are over 800 000 deaths from pneumonia among children worldwide. Such morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia disproportionately affects children in low-income and middle-income countries, with nearly 90% of pneumonia-related deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeastern Asia alone. Despite the large global burden of disease of childhood pneumonia, a commonly agreed upon standardised approach to the diagnosis of pneumonia is lacking.

The diagnosis of childhood pneumonia is often established based on clinical findings, as the definitive diagnosis can only be made using invasive testing such as lung biopsies, which are reserved for patients in whom traditional therapeutics have failed. As such, chest radiography is often used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia and has been used as a reference standard in previous investigations. In a large, multicountry study in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, chest radiography correlated with clinically diagnosed pneumonia in over half of patients included. Nevertheless, the routine use of chest radiography for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia in the outpatient setting is not recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America. Similarly, the World Health Organization's (WHO) integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) chart booklet used in many low-income and middle-income countries, recommends the diagnosis of pneumonia be made clinically, with reliance on tachypnoea or lower chest indrawing in a child with cough or difficulty breathing. However, recent analyses suggest that the sensitivity (54%–62%) and specificity (59%–64%) of tachypnoea and sensitivity (38%–48%) and specificity (72%–80%) of lower chest indrawing is lower than originally estimated. Concerns around the low specificity of the WHO pneumonia signs, and potential excess antibiotic prescribing, prompted further evaluation of these clinical criteria for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children.

### New biomarkers for respiratory infections [^114tNo9T]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although pneumonia, either community or hospital-acquired, is the most frequent severe respiratory infection, it is an infection difficult to diagnose. At present, the diagnosis of pneumonia relies on a combination of clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic criteria. However, these criteria are far from perfect leading to uncertainty in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and choice of antibiotic therapy. Biomarkers have been used to bring additional information in this setting.

Recent Findings

The aim of this review is to provide a clear overview of the current evidence for biomarkers to distinguish between patients in several clinical scenarios: to exclude pneumonia in order to withhold antibiotics, to identify the causative pathogen to target antimicrobial treatment, to identify phenotypes of inflammatory response to facilitate adjunctive treatments, to stratify the risk of severe pneumonia and provide the adequate level of care, and to monitor treatment response and de-escalate antibiotic therapy.

Summary

In recent years the number of new biomarkers increased markedly in different areas like pathogen identification or host response. Although far from the ideal, there are several promising areas that could represent true evolutions in the management of pneumonia, in the near future.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111MgD3U]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Acute cough with suspected pneumonia — diagnostic indicators and reference standard: Physician judgment alone frequently led to overestimation of the probability of pneumonia. Although individual signs and symptoms alone cannot rule in or rule out pneumonia, combinations of signs and symptoms can improve overall diagnostic accuracy, and the absence of any vital sign abnormalities has a high negative predictive value for ruling out pneumonia. However, even with the highest cutoff points for decision rules, the positive predictive value is rarely > 50%. Studies assessed clinical algorithms against chest radiography as the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis, although chest radiography is described as an imperfect gold standard because a significant proportion of pneumonia cases initially diagnosed based on higher-resolution imaging of the chest are not detected on chest radiographs.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^115X2yui]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Childhood community-acquired pneumonia in context

Globally there are 155 million cases of childhood pneumonia annually, and pneumonia results in the death of 2 million children younger than 5 years every year (20% of all deaths in this age group), making it the biggest single cause of childhood death. In the United Kingdom the annual incidence of attendance to hospital for pneumonia is 14.4 per 10,000 in children ages 0–16 years, and 33.8 per 10,000 for those ages < 5 years, with admission rates just slightly lower. In the developing world, one South African study indicated a pneumonia incidence of 0.27 episodes per child-year and a case–fatality ratio of 1% for cases admitted to a hospital.

The definition of community-acquired pneumonia in children is almost identical in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United States, it is "the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child caused by an infection that has been acquired outside of the hospital". According to the British Thoracic Society it is "the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia (such as fever of > 38.5°C, cough and respiratory distress) in a previously healthy child, due to an infection which has been acquired outside the hospital".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pneumonia in the immunocompetent child [^116vZRCr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common acute infections and the single greatest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. In uncomplicated, community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent patients, the diagnosis is clinical and imaging has no role. The first role of imaging is to identify complications associated with pneumonia such as pleural effusion, pulmonary abscess, and bronchopleural fistula. Radiographs are recommended for screening for these complications and ultrasound and CT are recommended for confirmation. The second role of imaging is to identify underlying anatomic conditions that may predispose patients to recurrent pneumonia. CT with intravenously administered contrast is recommended for this evaluation. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115xiKFK]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients commonly present to primary care services with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and guidelines to help physicians investigate and treat acute cough due to suspected pneumonia and influenza are needed.

Methods

A systematic search was carried out with eight patient, intervention, comparison, outcome questions related to acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza.

Results

There was a lack of randomized controlled trials in the setting of outpatients presenting with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza who were not hospitalized. Both clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made on the evidence available and CHEST Expert Cough Panel advice.

Conclusions

For outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest the following clinical symptoms and signs are suggestive of pneumonia: cough; dyspnea; pleural pain; sweating, fevers, or shivers; aches and pains; temperature ≥ 38°C; tachypnea; and new and localizing chest examination signs. Those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Although the measurement of C-reactive protein levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. We suggest that there is no need for routine microbiological testing. We suggest the use of empiric antibiotics according to local and national guidelines when pneumonia is suspected in settings in which imaging cannot be performed. Where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. Finally, for outpatient adults with acute cough and suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment (according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice) within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and hospitalization and improved outcomes.

### Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care: narrative review of C reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) and antibacterial use in patients who present with symptoms of RTI [^113KKHqN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

In the largest prospective cohort of primary care patients with LRTI, serious adverse outcomes (death, hospital admission or late-onset pneumonia) occurred in 1.1% of the patients. Patients radiographed within 1 week of the index consultation, showed four independent predictors of radiograph-confirmed pneumonia: temperature > 37.8°C, crackles on auscultation, oxygen saturation < 95% and pulse > 100 beats/minute. The CRB-65 rule was developed to predict the risk of admission to the intensive care unit and mortality in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia.CRB-65 has superseded the complex Pneumonia Severity Index, which used 20 different clinical variables and the CURB-65 that includes the measurement of urea, which limits is timeliness and value in primary care. However, in a meta-analysis of validation studies, CRB-65 overpredicted the probability of 30-day mortality in the community setting across all strata of predicted risk, low, intermediate and high. Modified scoring systems have been studied with similar results, like the CORB75 (similar to the classical CRB-65, but adding oxygen saturation and increasing the age to 75 years). The STARWAVe clinical algorithm is a clinical rule to improve antibiotic use in children presenting with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and cough. A study that examined all published sign and symptom models for prediction of pneumonia in primary care were externally validated by individual patient data of previously performed diagnostic studies. A recent meta-analysis of studies evaluating the diagnostic value of clinical features to identify radiographic pneumonia among adults in the primary care setting, the clinical variable with the best pooled positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was the respiratory rate ≥ 20 breaths/minute (PLR 3.47), followed by temperature ≥ 38°C, and pulse rate > 100 beats/minute. Cough, sputum, crackles, dyspnoea and chest pain were limited as single predictors for the diagnosis of pneumonia and none of these criteria reached the PLR of 2.5. Laboratory tests showed the highest pooled PLRs with C reactive protein (CRP) > 20 mg/L associated with a PLR of 3.76.

### Pneumocystis carinii infection: current treatment and prevention [^113K3JQu]. The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (1996). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Miller criteria for PCP severity assessment" for Pneumocystis pneumonia.

The Miller criteria is a clinical calculator used for assessing the severity of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. This scoring system is crucial in determining the need for hospitalization and intensive care, as well as guiding treatment decisions. The Miller criteria takes into account factors such as arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), arterial-alveolar gradient (A-a gradient), and the presence of extrapulmonary disease. Patients with severe PCP according to the Miller criteria may require more aggressive treatment and closer monitoring. The calculator may not be applicable or accurate in patients with co-existing lung diseases or conditions that can affect the PaO2 or A-a gradient.

The Miller criteria for assessing the severity of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia) guide healthcare professionals through evaluating a patient's symptoms, arterial oxygen levels, and chest X-ray findings. By analyzing these inputs, we can categorize the disease into mild, moderate, or severe.

Here's how the evaluation works:

Inputs considered:

- **Symptoms and Signs**:
	- Dyspnea on exertion, possibly with cough and sweats
	- Dyspnea on minimal exertion, occasional rest dyspnea, fever, cough
	- Dyspnea and tachypnea at rest, persistent fever, cough

- **Arterial Oxygen Tension** (partial pressure of oxygen at rest on room air):
	- Greater than 11.0 kPa (82.5 mmHg)
	- Between 8.1 and 11.0 kPa (60.75 to 82.5 mmHg)
	- Less than 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg)

- **Arterial Oxygen Saturation** (SaO2, at rest on room air):
	- Above 96%
	- Between 91% and 96%
	- Below 91%

- **Chest X-ray Findings**:
	- Normal or shows minor perihilar shadowing
	- Diffuse interstitial shadowing
	- Extensive interstitial shadowing, possibly with diffuse alveolar shadowing

To determine the severity:

- **Severe PCP is indicated by any of these conditions**:

- Symptoms of dyspnea and tachypnea at rest
- Arterial oxygen tension less than 8.0 kPa
- Arterial oxygen saturation below 91%
- Extensive interstitial shadowing present on X-ray

- **Mild PCP is likely when all these specific conditions are met**:

- Symptoms are limited to dyspnea on exertion (cough and sweats possible)
- Arterial oxygen tension more than 11.0 kPa
- Arterial oxygen saturation above 96%
- Chest X-ray shows normal or minor perihilar shadowing

- **Moderate PCP is diagnosed if any of the following are true**:

- Symptoms include minimal exertion dyspnea, occasional rest dyspnea, fever, cough
- Arterial oxygen tension between 8.1 and 11.0 kPa
- Arterial oxygen saturation between 91% and 96%
- Diffuse interstitial shadowing seen on X-ray

These evaluations help clinicians make informed decisions about the management of the patient's condition by accurately assessing the severity of PCP based on the presented criteria.

Recommendation levels — Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty based on strength of evidence Class I or overwhelming evidence from Class II studies that directly address all issues; Level B recommendations identify strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty based on Class II or Class III studies that directly address all issues; Level C recommendations are based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence or, if no published literature exists, on panel consensus; recommendations may be downgraded due to heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, strength of prior beliefs, and publication bias; and recommendations are not intended to represent the only diagnostic and management options for emergency physicians.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Childhood pneumonia in low-and-middle-income countries: an update [^112eHQeU]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Classification of pneumonia

In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for classifying and treating childhood pneumonia were revised. Children presenting with cough or difficulty in breathing were classified into 3 diagnostic categories (pneumonia, severe pneumonia or no pneumonia) according to clinical features. Pneumonia is defined as tachypnea and/or chest indrawing in a child older than 2 months. Severe pneumonia is defined as cough or difficulty breathing with at least one of the following: (i) central cyanosis or oxygen saturation < 90% on pulse oximetry, (ii) severe respiratory distress (grunting, very severe chest indrawing), or (iii) any general danger sign (inability to breastfeed or drink, lethargy or unconscious, convulsions). Children without signs of pneumonia or severe pneumonia are classified as no pneumonia: cough or cold. Abnormal oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry predicts oral antibiotic failure. Children with pneumonia seen at outpatient settings without the capacity to perform appropriate investigations such as pulse oximetry, nutritional assessment or HIV testing may need referral.

Chest imaging

Chest X-ray remains the primary imaging modality for pneumonia (Fig. 1). The WHO developed standardized criteria for interpretation of chest radiographs in bacterial vaccine trials with three categories of radiological disease: (i) primary end-point pneumonia (end-point consolidation or pleural effusion), (ii) other infiltrate and (iii) no consolidation/infiltrate/effusion. However agreement amongst readers for detection of consolidation was modest (80%, adjusted k = 0.60), and poor for other infiltrates (66.5%, adjusted k = 0.33). Chest ultrasonography for paediatric pneumonia may be a rapid and safe diagnostic method. Data from a recent meta-analysis show that the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 93%, against various reference tests including chest radiographs in nine studies, clinical diagnosis in four studies and computed tomography in one study. However, substantial heterogeneity exists across individual studies, and a reliable reference standard is lacking. Greater methodological rigour is needed in future studies.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1112GDfv]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on acute respiratory illness [^113LtUot]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

In a patient with acute respiratory illness (cough, sputum production, chest pain, and/or dyspnea), the need for chest imaging depends on the severity of illness, age of the patient, clinical history, physical and laboratory findings, and other risk factors. Chest radiographs seem warranted when one or more of the following are present: age ≥ 40; dementia; a positive physical examination; hemoptysis; associated abnormalities (leukocytosis, hypoxemia); or other risk factors, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or drug-induced acute respiratory failure. Chest CT may be warranted in complicated cases of severe pneumonia and in febrile neutropenic patients with normal or nonspecific chest radiographic findings. Literature on the indications and usefulness of radiologic studies for acute respiratory illness in different clinical settings is reviewed.

### Use of serum C reactive protein and procalcitonin concentrations in addition to symptoms and signs to predict pneumonia in patients presenting to primary care with acute cough: diagnostic study [^114CErez]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To quantify the diagnostic accuracy of selected inflammatory markers in addition to symptoms and signs for predicting pneumonia and to derive a diagnostic tool.

Design

Diagnostic study performed between 2007 and 2010. Participants had their history taken, underwent physical examination and measurement of C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin in venous blood on the day they first consulted, and underwent chest radiography within seven days.

Setting

Primary care centres in 12 European countries.

Participants

Adults presenting with acute cough.

Main Outcome Measures

Pneumonia as determined by radiologists, who were blind to all other information when they judged chest radiographs.

Results

Of 3106 eligible patients, 286 were excluded because of missing or inadequate chest radiographs, leaving 2820 patients (mean age 50, 40% men) of whom 140 (5%) had pneumonia. Re-assessment of a subset of 1675 chest radiographs showed agreement in 94% (κ 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.54). Six published "symptoms and signs models" varied in their discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) ranged from 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.61) to 0.71 (0.66 to 0.76)). The optimal combination of clinical prediction items derived from our patients included absence of runny nose and presence of breathlessness, crackles and diminished breath sounds on auscultation, tachycardia, and fever, with an ROC area of 0.70 (0.65 to 0.75). Addition of CRP at the optimal cut off of > 30 mg/L increased the ROC area to 0.77 (0.73 to 0.81) and improved the diagnostic classification (net reclassification improvement 28%). In the 1556 patients classified according to symptoms, signs, and CRP > 30 mg/L as "low risk" (< 2.5%) for pneumonia, the prevalence of pneumonia was 2%. In the 132 patients classified as "high risk" (> 20%), the prevalence of pneumonia was 31%. The positive likelihood ratio of low, intermediate, and high risk for pneumonia was 0.4, 1.2, and 8.6 respectively. Measurement of procalcitonin added no relevant additional diagnostic information. A simplified diagnostic score based on symptoms, signs, and CRP > 30 mg/L resulted in proportions of pneumonia of 0.7%, 3.8%, and 18.2% in the low, intermediate, and high risk group respectively.

Conclusions

A clinical rule based on symptoms and signs to predict pneumonia in patients presenting to primary care with acute cough performed best in patients with mild or severe clinical presentation. Addition of CRP concentration at the optimal cut off of > 30 mg/L improved diagnostic information, but measurement of procalcitonin concentration did not add clinically relevant information in this group.

### Viral pneumonia in older adults [^111ZZJvU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Viruses account for a substantial portion of respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia, in the elderly population. Presently, influenza virus A H3N2 and respiratory syncytial virus are the most commonly identified viral pathogens in older adults with viral pneumonia. As diagnostic tests such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction become more widely used, the relative importance of additional viruses (such as parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus) will likely increase. Influenza virus should be considered as a cause of pneumonia during the winter months, especially during periods of peak activity. Patients with high-grade fever, myalgias, and cough should arouse the highest suspicion. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia should also be suspected during the winter in patients with coryza, wheezing, low-grade fever, and patchy infiltrates, especially if negative for influenza on rapid testing. Because clinical features and periods of activity for many viruses overlap, laboratory confirmation of influenza is recommended for cases involving seriously ill or institutionalized patients.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^112LASDP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example, cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example, lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible severe disease or pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

### Diagnostic accuracy of a set of clinical and radiological criteria for screening of COVID-19 using RT-PCR as the reference standard [^117XKP3J]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Our set of clinical-radiological criteria developed by intensive care physicians in March 2020 — when there was still no complete knowledge about the signs and symptoms that could be related to the disease — based on the literature and used pragmatically to screen patients with SARF on ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic, showed sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values similar to those of diagnostic model for COVID-19 developed using logistic regression models and artificial neural network.

We included in the set of clinical-radiological criteria respiratory symptoms and fever, which at the beginning of the pandemic were the most related to covid-19. This could explain the burden of other non-COVID-19 lung diseases in the false positive group, as many lung diseases share similar symptoms. However, other studies demonstrate that fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and rhinorrhea are the most strongly correlated with the diagnosis of COVID-19, although several other extrapulmonary signs and symptoms may be present in patients with COVID-19.

Among the patients identified as having a weak suspicion for COVID-19, we found only 1.5% of false-negative results; the confounders in these cases were other lung diseases, especially bacterial pneumonia.

The limitations of our study include the involvement of multiple intensivists in routinely evaluating the parameters of the clinical-radiological criteria and CT scans, which could have resulted in diverse interpretations of the findings, and the final reports of chest CTs being signed by different radiologists. As a strength, the group of professionals who performed the initial evaluation was small. Finally, we want to emphasize that all patients analyzed in this study had moderate to severe disease as determined by the WHO Clinical Progression Scale, i.e. a score ≥ 5 in the 10-point table.

Finally, we consider that the study contributes with relevant information by presenting the possibility of screening patients with suspected COVID 19 based on clinical and radiological criteria without the use of RT-PCR, which was not always available, especially in low-income countries.

### Clinical features for diagnosis of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XnT58]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the biggest cause of deaths in young children in developing countries, but early diagnosis and intervention can effectively reduce mortality. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of clinical signs and symptoms to identify radiological pneumonia in children younger than 5 years and to review the accuracy of WHO criteria for diagnosis of clinical pneumonia.

Methods

We searched Medline (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists of relevant studies, without date restrictions, to identify articles assessing clinical predictors of radiological pneumonia in children. Selection was based on: design (diagnostic accuracy studies), target disease (pneumonia), participants (children aged < 5 years), setting (ambulatory or hospital care), index test (clinical features), and reference standard (chest radiography). Quality assessment was based on the 2011 Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) criteria. For each index test, we calculated sensitivity and specificity and, when the tests were assessed in four or more studies, calculated pooled estimates with use of bivariate model and hierarchical summary receiver operation characteristics plots for meta-analysis.

Findings

We included 18 articles in our analysis. WHO-approved signs age-related fast breathing (six studies; pooled sensitivity 0.62, 95% CI 0.26–0.89; specificity 0.59, 0.29–0.84) and lower chest wall indrawing (four studies; 0.48, 0.16–0.82; 0.72, 0.47–0.89) showed poor diagnostic performance in the meta-analysis. Features with the highest pooled positive likelihood ratios were respiratory rate higher than 50 breaths per min (1.90, 1.45–2.48), grunting (1.78, 1.10–2.88), chest indrawing (1.76, 0.86–3.58), and nasal flaring (1.75, 1.20–2.56). Features with the lowest pooled negative likelihood ratio were cough (0.30, 0.09–0.96), history of fever (0.53, 0.41–0.69), and respiratory rate higher than 40 breaths per min (0.43, 0.23–0.83).

Interpretation

Not one clinical feature was sufficient to diagnose pneumonia definitively. Combination of clinical features in a decision tree might improve diagnostic performance, but the addition of new point-of-care tests for diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia would help to attain an acceptable level of accuracy.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

American Thoracic Society workshop — immunocompromised host pneumonia scope and rationale: Pneumonia imposes a significant clinical burden on people with immunocompromising conditions, and many individuals have compromised immunity due to cytotoxic cancer treatments, biological therapies, organ transplants, and immunodeficiencies. Despite awareness of increased infectious pneumonia risk, immunocompromised people are often excluded from pneumonia clinical guidelines and treatment trials. The report states that the absence of a widely accepted definition for immunocompromised host pneumonia hampers consistent clinical care and research, and describes an American Thoracic Society workshop with participants across pulmonary disease, infectious diseases, immunology, genetics, and laboratory medicine aiming to define this entity and its diagnostic criteria.

### Does this child have pneumonia? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111yU9kA]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. It is important to identify the clinical symptoms and physical examination findings associated with pneumonia to improve timely diagnosis, prevent significant morbidity, and limit antibiotic overuse.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of symptoms and physical examination findings in identifying children with radiographic pneumonia.

Data Sources and Study Selection

MEDLINE and Embase (1956 to May 2017) were searched, along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify diagnostic studies of pediatric pneumonia across a broad age range that had to include children younger than age 5 years (although some studies enrolled children up to age 19 years); 3644 unique articles were identified, of which 23 met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently abstracted raw data and assessed methodological quality. A third author resolved disputes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Likelihood ratios (LRs), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for individual symptoms and physical examination findings for the diagnosis of pneumonia. An infiltrate on chest radiograph was considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Results

Twenty-three prospective cohort studies of children (N = 13 833) with possible pneumonia were included (8 from North America), with a range of 78 to 2829 patients per study. The prevalence of radiographic pneumonia in North American studies was 19% (95% CI, 11%-31%) and 37% (95% CI, 26%-50%) outside of North America. No single symptom was strongly associated with pneumonia; however, the presence of chest pain in 2 studies that included adolescents was associated with pneumonia (LR, 1.5–5.5; sensitivity, 8%-14%; specificity, 94%-97%). Vital sign abnormalities such as fever (temperature > 37.5°C [LR range, 1.7–1.8]; sensitivity, 80%-92%; specificity, 47%-54%) and tachypnea (respiratory rate > 40 breaths/min; LR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.3–1.7]; sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 51%) were not strongly associated with pneumonia diagnosis. Similarly, auscultatory findings were not associated with pneumonia diagnosis. The presence of moderate hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≤ 96%; LR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.1–3.6]; sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 77%) and increased work of breathing (grunting, flaring, and retractions; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.6–2.7]) were signs most associated with pneumonia. The presence of normal oxygenation (oxygen saturation > 96%) decreased the likelihood of pneumonia (LR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.32–0.67]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Although no single finding reliably differentiates pneumonia from other causes of childhood respiratory illness, hypoxia and increased work of breathing are more important than tachypnea and auscultatory findings.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^115iaYzu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases

Pneumonia

In patients with COPD, the symptoms of pneumonia and ECOPD may be similar (worsened cough, sputum production, dyspnea, and fever). Physical examination may help in the differentiation, with signs of consolidation (localized crackles, crepitus, and dullness on percussion) more frequent in patients with pneumonia. However, because a diagnosis of COPD increases pneumonia risk (by 1.3- to 13.5-fold) and severity, pneumonia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with symptoms of ECOPD.

If the clinical assessment deems the ECOPD to be mild or moderate and there are no signs of lung consolidation, no further diagnostic testing to differentiate the two diseases is indicated. However, if the episode is severe and/or prolonged, and there are abnormal chest exam findings, a proper diagnosis of pneumonia should be undertaken. Mortality after hospitalized pneumonia is higher than after hospitalized ECOPD. Although most patients without severe ECOPD can be safely treated on the basis of chest X-ray results alone, opacities not visible on a chest X-ray may be seen with more sensitive CT scans.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111ukg7W]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend to consider assessing for clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of pneumonia (cough, dyspnea, pleural pain, sweating, shivers, pains, fever ≥ 38 °C, tachypnea, new and localizing chest examination signs) in adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia.

### Application of the World Health Organization criteria to predict radiographic pneumonia in a US-based pediatric emergency department [^115Dtu9b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) established guidelines that rely on simple clinical signs for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia in resource-limited settings. Our objective was to evaluate the test characteristics of the WHO criteria for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia in the emergency department setting.

Methods

We prospectively collected clinical information from children ≤ 5 years of age presenting to a US-based pediatric emergency department who had a chest radiograph performed for suspicion of pneumonia. Patients were classified as meeting the WHO case definition of pneumonia if they had both 1) cough or difficulty breathing and 2) age-specific WHO-defined tachypnea. The primary outcome was radiographic pneumonia based on the final radiology report. Among children with cough or with difficulty breathing, receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the test characteristics of triage respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia.

Results

Two thousand eight children were enrolled. Median age was 19 months, and 28.5% had tachypnea based upon age-specific respiratory rate thresholds. Of the 324 children with radiographic pneumonia, 111 met the WHO case definition of pneumonia (sensitivity = 34.3%, 95% confidence interval: 29.1–39.7). Triage respiratory rate demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.54 for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia. The area under the curve for triage temperature and oxygen saturation was 0.56 and 0.60, respectively.

Conclusions

The WHO criteria demonstrated poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia in a US-based pediatric emergency department. Compared with respiratory rate, oxygen saturation offered slightly improved test characteristics. Although applied to a different target population, these findings suggest the WHO criteria may not be a sensitive screening tool for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children.

### Adding fever to WHO criteria for diagnosing pneumonia enhances the ability to identify pneumonia cases among wheezing children [^111XVs2f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the ability of the criteria proposed by the WHO to identify pneumonia among cases presenting with wheezing and the extent to which adding fever to the criteria alters their performance.

Design

Prospective classification of 390 children aged 2–59 months with lower respiratory tract disease into five diagnostic categories, including pneumonia. WHO criteria for the identification of pneumonia and a set of such criteria modified by adding fever were compared with radiographically diagnosed pneumonia as the gold standard.

Results

The sensitivity of the WHO criteria was 94% for children aged < 24 months and 62% for those aged ≥ 24 months. The corresponding specificities were 20% and 16%. Adding fever to the WHO criteria improved specificity substantially (to 44% and 50%, respectively). The specificity of the WHO criteria was poor for children with wheezing (12%). Adding fever improved this substantially (to 42%). The addition of fever to the criteria apparently reduced their sensitivity only marginally (to 92% and 57%, respectively, in the two age groups).

Conclusion

The authors' results reaffirm that the current WHO criteria can detect pneumonia with high sensitivity, particularly among younger children. They present evidence that the ability of these criteria to distinguish between children with pneumonia and those with wheezing diseases might be greatly enhanced by the addition of fever.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^112BUb54]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst in others the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 disease and COVID-19 pneumonia, leading some patients to require intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19 disease or COVID-19 pneumonia.

Search Methods

On 27 April 2020, we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included patients with suspected COVID-19 disease, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 disease and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), clinical expertise, imaging, serology tests and World Health Organization (WHO) or other definitions of COVID-19.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist. Analyses were descriptive, presenting sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in ROC (receiver operating characteristic) space and in dumbbell plots. We did not attempt meta-analysis due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity across studies and the high risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified 16 studies including 7706 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%. There were no studies from primary care settings, although we did find seven studies in outpatient clinics (2172 participants), and four studies in the emergency department (1401 participants). We found data on 27 signs and symptoms, which fall into four different categories: systemic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular. No studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms and results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity; only six symptoms had a sensitivity of at least 50% in at least one study: cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. Of these, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache could be considered red flags (defined as having a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5) for COVID-19 as their specificity was above 90%, meaning that they substantially increase the likelihood of COVID-19 disease when present. Seven studies carried a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional four studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. These factors make it very difficult to determine the diagnostic properties of these signs and symptoms from the included studies. We also had concerns about the applicability of these results, since most studies included participants who were already admitted to hospital or presenting to hospital settings. This makes these findings less applicable to people presenting to primary care, who may have less severe illness and a lower prevalence of COVID-19 disease. None of the studies included any data on children, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We hope that future updates of this review will be able to provide more information about the diagnostic properties of signs and symptoms in different settings and age groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic properties, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19 disease, are urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions such as self-isolation or selecting patients for further diagnostic testing. We also need data on potentially more specific symptoms such as loss of sense of smell. Studies in older adults are especially important.

### Improving the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis… [^113ThfNb]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

As evidence continues to show that many episodes of bronchitis are better managed without antibiotics, the ability to accurately differentiate cases of pneumonia from other lower respiratory tract infections becomes increasingly significant. The classic diagnostic criteria derived from hospital studies are of limited applicability in primary care. In addition, family physicians face increasing challenges to accurately diagnose pneumonia with limited time and laboratory resources. Hopstaken and colleagues studied the diagnostic value of various parameters to derive a prediction rule for pneumonia in 15 general practices in the Netherlands. They studied all adult patients consulting 25 family physicians with symptoms of lower respiratory infection. All patients had new or increasing cough within the previous 29 days plus symptoms such as dyspnea, wheeze, chest pain, fever, perspiration, headache, and myalgias.

To be included, patients had to be diagnosed clinically by the physician as having a lower respiratory tract infection. Patients with recent antibiotic use, current serious illness, recent hospitalization for a respiratory condition, or inability to tolerate antibiotics were excluded. Pregnant or lactating women were also excluded from the study. During the 16-month study period, pneumonia was diagnosed radiographically in 32 of the 246 patients assessed. The physicians made a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia in 21 cases. As shown in the table on page 682, recent cough and mental confusion were predictive symptoms that occurred in relatively few patients. Conversely, nausea and diarrhea were common complaints that at least doubled the probability of pneumonia. Classic diagnostic characteristics of pneumonia, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and clinical signs, were not discriminatory for pneumonia.

The physicians had a high index of suspicion for pneumonia, and their clinical impression for severe illness and the diagnosis was associated with increased probability of radiologic diagnosis. In logistic regression analysis, dry cough, diarrhea, and fever had statistically significant odds ratios. When ESR and CRP were added to the diagnostic model, the ability to predict pneumonia was significantly improved. ESR and CRP values alone had higher diagnostic odds ratios than any of the clinical symptoms or signs. The authors calculate that using a CRP value of less than 20 can help differentiate patients with pneumonia from those with other lower respiratory tract infections. In practice, the presence of dry cough, diarrhea, temperature higher than 38°C and elevated ESR and CRP levels can be considered significant factors in the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and the decision to prescribe antibiotics.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients [^115BC6PU]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory illness, defined as cough, sputum production, chest pain, and/or dyspnea (with or without fever), is a major public health issue, accounting for millions of doctor office and emergency department visits every year. While most cases are due to self-limited viral infections, a significant number of cases are due to more serious respiratory infections where delay in diagnosis can lead to morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute respiratory illness. This study reviews the current literature concerning the appropriate role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of the immunocompetent adult patient initially presenting with acute respiratory illness. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^116yAbza]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Some people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst in others the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia, leading some patients to require intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID‐19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID‐19 clinics, has COVID‐19 disease or COVID‐19 pneumonia.

Search methods

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients: 2024 update [^114QxmG1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory illness is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality amongst infectious diseases worldwide and a major public health issue. Even though most cases are due to self-limited viral infections, a significant number of cases are due to more serious respiratory infections where delay in diagnosis can lead to morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute respiratory illness. This document reviews the current literature concerning the appropriate role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of the immunocompetent adult patient initially presenting with acute respiratory illness. Imaging recommendations for adults presenting with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations are discussed. Finally, guidelines for follow-up imaging in suspected pneumonia cases to ensure occult malignancy is not overlooked. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or intermediate, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^115srJRm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Clinical pathway

Important in the context of COVID‐19 is that the pathway is multifaceted because it is designed to care for the diseased individual and to protect the community from further spread. Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time, if and when effective treatments and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform rational decision making.

Prior test(s)

In this review on signs and symptoms, no prior tests are required because signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease. Patients can, however, self‐assess before presenting to healthcare services based on their symptoms. This is in contrast to contact tracing, in which patients or participants are tested based on a documented contact with a SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive person and may themselves be asymptomatic.

Role of index test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used as triage tests, that is, to rule out COVID‐19 disease, but also to identify patients with possible COVID‐19 who may require further testing, care escalation or isolation.

Alternative test(s)

Chest X‐ray, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to diagnose COVID‐19 pneumonia. Availability and usage varies between settings. We address these radiological tests in a separate review.

Defining diagnostic criteria of immunocompromised host pneumonia emphasizes that "The definition of ICHP is predicated on a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and host factors rather than on infectious etiology", while "pathogen identification is central to the appropriate management of ICHP". The report acknowledges that the definition is "limited by a lack of universally reportable markers of host immune dysfunction, [and] diagnostic criteria for ICHP are complicated by limitations in diagnostic tools", and notes that "The second part of the workshop focused on diagnostic criteria for ICHP", outlining that discussion of diagnostic technologies "is followed by a proposed diagnostic algorithm and clarifying statements".
