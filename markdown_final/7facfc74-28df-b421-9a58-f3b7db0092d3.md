## Question

Alcohol rate of metabolism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the alcohol rate of metabolism, including typical elimination rates, the zero-order kinetics model, key modifiers, and how to apply this clinically and forensically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacokinetic model and whether ethanol elimination is zero-order. Then, I should verify typical elimination rates in different populations. Next, I will examine modifiers such as sex, genetics, chronic use, age, and organ function. After that, I need to check special populations like infants and pregnancy. Finally, I will consider clinical applications, forensic back-calculation, and the limitations of using a fixed rate, and I will synthesize a cautious, practical conclusion with ranges and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic model. Ethanol exhibits zero-order elimination in the post-absorptive phase, meaning a constant amount is cleared per unit time rather than a constant fraction, which is why we express the elimination rate as a β value in g/L/h or mg/dL/h rather than a half-life, and this zero-order behavior is the foundation for retrograde BAC calculations in forensic toxicology [^64cd6a06] [^64cd6a06].

> I should double-check typical elimination rates. In social drinkers, the average β is commonly cited around 0.15 g/L/h, which equals 15 mg/dL/h, with a commonly used forensic range of 0.10 to 0.25 g/L/h. Chronic heavy drinkers can show substantially higher rates, often in the 0.20–0.30 g/L/h range, and in severe intoxication or alcoholics, rates exceeding 0.30 g/L/h have been documented, including pediatric cases with rates around 28.6 mg/dL/h, which aligns with adult alcoholic ranges [^64cd6a06] [^83bd9c31] [^3727e874] [^80a86051].

> Wait, let me verify the zero-order assumption at high BAC. The model holds because ADH becomes saturated at higher ethanol concentrations, making the rate of metabolism relatively constant until BAC falls into lower ranges where first-order kinetics may emerge; this saturation underpins the linear decline used in retrograde calculations and is consistent with clinical observations of steady clearance during the post-absorptive phase [^64cd6a06] [^83bd9c31].

> Next, I should review modifiers. Sex differences are consistent, with women often showing higher peak BAC and slower elimination, partly due to lower total body water and differences in gastric first-pass metabolism. Genetic variation in ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2 alters both the rate of ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde clearance, with East Asian ALDH2 variants slowing acetaldehyde removal and reducing intake via flushing, while ADH1B fast variants increase ethanol oxidation and can modestly increase elimination rates. Chronic heavy use induces CYP2E1, which accelerates metabolism and can raise β by roughly 30–50% in some studies. Age reduces clearance via lower hepatic blood flow and function, and liver disease slows elimination. Food delays absorption and can lower peak BAC but does not fundamentally change the zero-order elimination slope once absorption is complete [^ea3301be] [^ad0db038] [^e14ace91] [^b63158ce] [^6e5a8278].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In infants and young children, case reports show elimination rates that can approximate adult alcoholic ranges, with documented rates around 21.6–28.6 mg/dL/h, though data are limited and variable. In pregnancy, maternal elimination varies widely and fetal elimination is impaired, prolonging exposure and increasing risk even with similar maternal intake. In severe intoxication, very high BACs still follow zero-order kinetics, but the absolute β may be higher in chronic users, which is important for predicting time to sobriety [^92e817d4] [^3727e874] [^c3ddaa91] [^80a86051].

> I will now examine clinical applications. For withdrawal risk, clinicians often integrate BAC with signs of tolerance. A patient with a high BAC who is not overtly intoxicated signals dependence and a risk of severe withdrawal, though thresholds vary and there is no universally accepted BAC cutoff. For bedside estimation, a rough rule of thumb is that one standard drink increases BAC by about 0.02–0.03 g/dL in a typical adult, and metabolism removes roughly 0.015 g/dL/h, but I need to emphasize that this is a crude estimate and individual variability is large, especially in chronic drinkers or those with altered body composition [^1b13a689] [^64cd6a06].

> But wait, what if we need a forensic back-calculation. I should confirm the approach. Retrograde estimates use the measured BAC, subtract the product of β and time elapsed, and report a range using β = 0.10–0.25 g/L/h. Forward estimates use the Widmark formula with assumed volume of distribution and the same β range. The ASB guidance explicitly recommends reporting a range to reflect interindividual variability and uncertainty in Vd and β, which is crucial in legal contexts [^64cd6a06] [^83bd9c31].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fixed rates. I need to ensure we communicate uncertainty. Elimination is person-specific and context-dependent; chronic heavy drinkers may clear faster, older adults and those with liver disease slower, and genetic variants can shift the slope. Therefore, any single β estimate should be interpreted cautiously, and clinical decisions should prioritize observed intoxication and withdrawal signs over back-calculated estimates whenever possible [^1b13a689] [^64cd6a06].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis. Typical ethanol elimination in social drinkers averages about 15 mg/dL/h with a forensic range of 10–25 mg/dL/h. Chronic heavy drinkers often clear at 20–30 mg/dL/h or higher. Infants and severe intoxication cases can show rates in the 20–30 mg/dL/h range. Pregnancy and liver disease slow clearance. And all of this assumes zero-order kinetics in the post-absorptive phase, which is a robust but imperfect approximation that must be applied with population- and individual-specific caveats [^64cd6a06] [^83bd9c31] [^3727e874] [^c3ddaa91].

The average alcohol metabolism rate in healthy adults is **about 15 mg/dL per hour** (0.015 g/dL/h) [^64cd6a06], with a typical range of 10–25 mg/dL/h [^83bd9c31]. Chronic heavy drinkers can metabolize alcohol up to **50% faster** due to CYP2E1 induction, while women generally have slightly slower rates than men because of lower body water and different gastric metabolism [^e14ace91]. Genetic variants in ADH and ALDH can accelerate or slow metabolism, and food intake slows absorption but does not change the elimination rate once absorption is complete [^ad0db038] [^6e5a8278]. Clinically, a BAC of 0.08 g/dL typically declines by about 0.015 g/dL/h, so it takes roughly 5–6 hours to return to zero, but individual variability is substantial and should be considered in any estimation [^64cd6a06].

---

## Average alcohol metabolism rate

- **Average metabolism rate**: Approximately 15 mg/dL per hour (0.015 g/dL/h) in healthy adults [^64cd6a06].
- **Typical range**: 10–25 mg/dL/h (0.010–0.025 g/dL/h) depending on individual factors [^83bd9c31].
- **Zero-order kinetics**: Ethanol is metabolized at a constant rate independent of blood concentration, explaining the linear decline in BAC over time [^64cd6a06].

---

## Factors influencing alcohol metabolism rate

Several factors influence **individual metabolism rates**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on metabolism rate** |
|-|-|
| Sex | Women generally have slightly slower rates due to lower body water and different gastric metabolism [^951dcb86] |
| Age | Older adults metabolize alcohol more slowly due to reduced liver function and body water [^b63158ce] |
| Genetics | Variants in ADH and ALDH genes can accelerate or slow metabolism [^ad0db038] [^5c4e7268] |
| Chronic alcohol use | Induces CYP2E1, increasing metabolism rate by up to 50% [^e14ace91] |
| Food intake | Slows absorption but does not change elimination rate once absorbed [^notfound] |
| Liver function | Impaired liver function significantly slows metabolism [^a66baecf] |

---

## Variability in alcohol metabolism

Interindividual variability is substantial, with metabolism rates ranging from 10 to 25 mg/dL/h in most adults and even wider in special populations. Chronic heavy drinkers can metabolize alcohol **up to 50% faster** than occasional drinkers due to CYP2E1 induction [^e14ace91]. Genetic polymorphisms in ADH and ALDH can markedly alter metabolism, with some variants increasing risk of acetaldehyde accumulation and others accelerating clearance [^ad0db038] [^5c4e7268].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding metabolism rates is essential for:

- **BAC estimation**: A BAC of 0.08 g/dL typically declines by about 0.015 g/dL/h, so it takes roughly 5–6 hours to reach zero in average adults [^notfound].
- **Alcohol withdrawal**: Faster metabolism in chronic drinkers can lead to earlier withdrawal symptoms as BAC falls [^notfound].
- **Forensic assessments**: Retrograde BAC calculations rely on metabolism rates to estimate prior BAC, but variability necessitates cautious interpretation [^64cd6a06].

---

## Special populations

- **Infants and children**: Metabolism rates can be similar to adults, but young children are more susceptible to hypoglycemia and CNS depression [^92e817d4].
- **Pregnant women**: Metabolism is slower, and fetal exposure is prolonged due to impaired fetal elimination [^c3ddaa91].
- **Elderly**: Slower metabolism increases risk of prolonged intoxication and interactions with medications [^b63158ce].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Average metabolism rate**: ~15 mg/dL/h (0.015 g/dL/h) [^64cd6a06].
- **Range**: 10–25 mg/dL/h (0.010–0.025 g/dL/h) [^83bd9c31].
- **Chronic use**: Increases metabolism by up to 50% [^notfound].
- **Genetics**: ADH/ALDH variants significantly alter metabolism [^ad0db038].
- **Clinical estimation**: BAC declines by ~0.015 g/dL/h on average, but individual variability is substantial [^64cd6a06].

---

The average alcohol metabolism rate is about 15 mg/dL/h, with a range of 10–25 mg/dL/h; chronic use, genetics, sex, age, and liver function all contribute to individual variability, so **clinicians should avoid relying on fixed estimates** and consider patient-specific factors when interpreting BAC or planning care [^64cd6a06].

### The clinical significance of variations in ethanol toxicokinetics [^161210d8]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many variables affect the interpretation of an isolated ethanol level in an acutely intoxicated patient. This review demonstrates the significant variability in metabolism and elimination of ethanol, how it can differ between individuals, and the clinical importance of these variables.

Discussion

Isolated ethanol values in a clinical scenario are only a snapshot of a dynamic process. The individual pharmacokinetic differences of people make it extremely difficult to estimate ethanol elimination rates or calculate previous ethanol concentrations at the time of an accident because of medical-legal reasons. Not only are the techniques used in measuring ethanol concentrations in bodily fluids (blood, serum, breath, and urine) not equivalent, but also the units used to report ethanol concentrations are often misinterpreted. Acute and chronic tolerance and social adaptive changes make interpreting this isolated ethanol level extremely difficult. The purpose of this review is to enable the clinician to appropriately interpret ethanol concentrations.

Conclusion

The clinical evaluation of a patient's inebriation is always more reliable than an isolated ethanol level for determining disposition. Only an estimation of a current serum ethanol level can be made if the blood draw was performed hours earlier. This review is clinically important because it shows the clinically significant variability in metabolism and elimination of ethanol and how it can differ between individuals. It will also describe different ways to measure ethanol concentrations and how to compare them. Finally, the interpretation of isolated ethanol levels will be discussed.

### ADH single nucleotide polymorphism associations with alcohol metabolism in vivo [^05f12c61]. Human Molecular Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

We have previously found that variation in alcohol metabolism in Europeans is linked to the chromosome 4q region containing the ADH gene family. We have now typed 103 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across this region to test for allelic associations with variation in blood and breath alcohol concentrations after an alcohol challenge. In vivo alcohol metabolism was modelled with three parameters that identified the absorption and rise of alcohol concentration following ingestion, and the rate of elimination. Alleles of ADH7 SNPs were associated with the early stages of alcohol metabolism, with additional effects in the ADH1A, ADH1B and ADH4 regions. Rate of elimination was associated with SNPs in the intragenic region between ADH7 and ADH1C, and across ADH1C and ADH1B. SNPs affecting alcohol metabolism did not correspond to those reported to affect alcohol dependence or alcohol-related disease. The combined SNP associations with early- and late-stage metabolism only account for approximately 20% of the total genetic variance linked to the ADH region, and most of the variance for in vivo alcohol metabolism linked to this region is yet to be explained.

### Genetic polymorphism in ethanol metabolism: acetaldehyde contribution to alcohol abuse and alcoholism [^fa3b6784]. Molecular Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Acetaldehyde, the first product of ethanol metabolism, has been speculated to be involved in many pharmacological and behavioral effects of ethanol. In particular, acetaldehyde has been suggested to contribute to alcohol abuse and alcoholism. In the present paper, we review current data on the role of acetaldehyde and ethanol metabolism in alcohol consumption and abuse. Ethanol metabolism involves several enzymes. Whereas alcohol dehydrogenase metabolizes the bulk of ethanol within the liver, other enzymes, such as cytochrome P4502E1 and catalase, also contributes to the production of acetaldehyde from ethanol oxidation. In turn, acetaldehyde is metabolized by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In animal studies, acetaldehyde is mainly reinforcing particularly when injected directly into the brain. In humans, genetic polymorphisms of the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase are also associated with alcohol drinking habits and the incidence of alcohol abuse. From these human genetic studies, it has been concluded that blood acetaldehyde accumulation induces unpleasant effects that prevent further alcohol drinking. It is therefore speculated that acetaldehyde exerts opposite hedonic effects depending on the localization of its accumulation. In the periphery, acetaldehyde is primarily aversive, whereas brain acetaldehyde is mainly reinforcing. However, the peripheral effects of acetaldehyde might also be dependent upon its peak blood concentrations and its rate of accumulation, with a narrow range of blood acetaldehyde concentrations being reinforcing.

### Site of alcohol first-pass metabolism among women [^6e5a8278]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

There is broad agreement that a fraction of ingested alcohol is metabolized before reaching the bloodstream; this is known as first-pass metabolism (FPM). The virtual elimination of FPM, seen following gastrectomyand gastric bypass, increases blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), the bioavailability of alcohol, and the risk of alcohol-related diseases. However, whether alcohol FPM primarily occurs in the stomach or the liverremains uncertain. While gastrectomy eliminates alcohol FPM, it is unclear whether this is because of the removal of the gastric source of FPM or the saturation of the hepatic source of FPM by the delivery of alcohol as a bolus in the absence of the gastric pylorus.

Because sleeve gastrectomy (SG) reduces approximately 80% of the stomach but preserves the pylorus, we compared alcohol pharmacokinetics in patients who underwent SG with control participants who did not undergo surgery and achieved comparable time-to-peak BAC (Tmax) after drinking. This design allowed differentiation of the effects of gastric emptying rate on hepatic vs gastric FPM. In addition, to control for association of SG with potential changes in systemic alcohol elimination rates (AER) that could confound differences in the bioavailability of ingested alcohol between groups, we used an intravenous (IV) alcohol clamp that estimates AER independent of variations in alcohol absorption.

### The effect of exercise, alcohol or both combined on health and physical performance [^e4fec75b]. International Journal of Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol (ethanol) is consumed on a daily basis by a large fraction of the population, and in many countries, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is considered as an integral part of the diet. Although the relationship between alcohol intake and obesity is controversial, regular consumption of alcohol, through its effects in suppressing fat oxidation, is regarded as a risk factor for weight gain, increased abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia. Indeed, alcohol taken with a meal leads to an increase in postprandial lipemia-an effect on postprandial metabolism that is opposite to that observed with exercise. Furthermore, although regular exercise training and/or a preprandial exercise session reduce postprandial lipemia independently of alcohol ingestion, the exercise-induced reduction in postprandial lipemia is nonetheless less pronounced when alcohol is also consumed with the meal. Whether or not alcohol influences exercise and sport performance remains contradictory. It is believed that alcohol has deleterious effects on the performance, although it may contribute to reduce pain and anxiety. The alcohol effects on sports performance depend on the type and dosage of alcohol, acute vs chronic administration, the alcohol elimination rate as well as the type of exercise.

### Clinical trial design, biomarkers and end points in metabolic and alcohol-related liver disease [^6c25d0bd]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic and alcohol-related liver disease (MetALD) is a newly defined entity within the spectrum of steatotic liver disease, characterized by the interplay of cardiometabolic risk factors and alcohol consumption. The evolving epidemiology and complex pathophysiology of MetALD present unique challenges and opportunities for clinical trial design. Inclusion criteria should require simultaneous evidence of metabolic dysfunction (at least two cardiometabolic features) and verified quantifiable alcohol exposure recorded over the preceding 3–6 months. Traditional histological end points are limited by invasiveness, sampling error and interpretative variability. Thus, imaging modalities, serum-based fibrosis biomarkers and quantitative measures of alcohol intake are gaining relevance as non-invasive, reproducible and patient-centric end points aiming to improve trial feasibility. Furthermore, incorporating alcohol biomarkers, stratifying patients by metabolic risk factor burden, and using adaptive designs of trials might enhance the precision and generalizability of MetALD clinical trials. Although uncertainties remain regarding optimal patient selection criteria, event rates and the dynamic interplay between metabolic dysfunction and alcohol intake, ongoing research efforts aim to refine diagnostic criteria, standardize methodologies and validate novel end points. These advances will ultimately accelerate drug development, improve trial efficiency and foster interventions to treat MetALD.

### Effect of ethanol on lipid metabolism [^9f91838f]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic lipid metabolism is a series of complex processes that control influx and efflux of not only hepatic lipid pools, but also organismal pools. Lipid homeostasis is usually tightly controlled by expression, substrate supply, oxidation and secretion that keep hepatic lipid pools relatively constant. However, perturbations of any of these processes can lead to lipid accumulation in the liver. Although it is thought that these responses are hepatic arms of the 'thrifty genome', they are maladaptive in the context of chronic fatty liver diseases. Ethanol is likely unique among toxins, in that it perturbs almost all aspects of hepatic lipid metabolism. This complex response is due in part to the large metabolic demand placed on the organ by alcohol metabolism, but also appears to involve more nuanced changes in expression and substrate supply. The net effect is that steatosis is a rapid response to alcohol abuse. Although transient steatosis is largely an inert pathology, the chronicity of alcohol-related liver disease seems to require steatosis. Better and more specific understanding of the mechanisms by which alcohol causes steatosis may therefore translate into targeted therapies to treat alcohol-related liver disease and/or prevent its progression.

### Circulating metabolites may illustrate relationship of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease [^4f297a65]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the study

Our study had several strengths. The most important advantage was that alcohol drinking data from five exams across around 20 years were utilized in the current study. Our study had several limitations. Because of the observational nature of our findings and no experimental validation, causality cannot be inferred. Despite that the sample size in our study was large, the population was primarily white, middle-aged participants. Therefore, the findings from our study may not be generalizable to populations of different races and age groups. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1, cumulative average consumption is a good proxy for long-term alcohol consumption. However, the analysis using total alcohol consumption at exam 5 yielded a similar alcohol–metabolite association. This observation may be driven by the possibility that many of our study participants maintained a low-to-moderate alcohol drinking habit. Future studies are needed to validate our findings in other populations with longitudinal alcohol measurements. Alcohol consumption was measured by questionnaires and calculated based on standard serving size. This approach is cost-effective; however, measurement errors may bias the observed association between alcohol intake and metabolite levels. We acknowledge that the metabolites data analyzed in our study are comprised of a targeted panel. Association between alcohol drinking and untargeted metabolites remained to be studied. Research utilizing metabolite platforms including those from exogenous sources, e.g. ethyl glucuronide and derivates of resveratrol, are needed to better understand the alcohol–metabolite relationship. We observed that sex may modify the association between total alcohol consumption and metabolite levels. Several other factors may also modify the observed associations. For example, the presence or absence of food in the stomach can change the rate of alcohol absorption and metabolism and subsequently affect the association of alcohol consumption with circulating metabolite profiles. In addition, the use of average alcohol consumption in the present analysis may not reflect participants' diverse drinking patterns. For example, the information on alcohol consumption patterns such as drinking alcohol with or without meals or weekend binge drinking was not collected. Participants' genetic background is a key factor that may modify alcohol metabolism, which may need further studies with larger sample size.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate (zohydro) [^a85b240e]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolism Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including N-demethylation, O-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-α-and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites. CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to norhydrocodone is the primary metabolic pathway of hydrocodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation to hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is formed from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone and may contribute to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Published in vitro studies have shown that N-demethylation of hydrocodone to form norhydrocodone can be attributed to CYP3A4 while O-demethylation of hydrocodone to hydromorphone is predominantly catalyzed by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by an unknown low affinity CYP enzyme.

Excretion Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys, with a mean apparent plasma half-life after ZOHYDRO ER administration of approximately 8 hours.

Interactions with Alcohol The rate of absorption of ZOHYDRO ER 50 mg was affected by co-administration with 40% alcohol in the fasted state, as exhibited by an increase in peak hydrocodone concentrations (on average 2.4-fold increase with maximum increase of 3.9-fold in one subject) and a decrease in the time to peak concentrations. The extent of absorption was increased on average 1.2-fold with maximum increase of 1.7-fold in one subject with 40% alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Alcohol dehydrogenase 1B genotype and fetal alcohol syndrome: a HuGE minireview [^2dbf6552]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 1 of the most common developmental disabilities in the United States, occurs at a rate of 0.5–2.0:1000 live births. Animal model, family, and twin studies suggest a genetic component to FAS susceptibility. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the rate-limiting step in alcohol metabolism. Studies of genetic associations with FAS have focused on the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) gene, comparing mothers and children with the alleles ADH1B✱2 or ADH1B✱3, associated with faster ethanol metabolism, with those homozygous for ADH1B✱1. While most studies have found a protective effect for genotypes containing ADH1B✱2 or ADH1B✱3, results have been conflicting, and further investigation into the association between the ADH1B genotype and FAS is needed. Whether increased alcohol intake accounts for the elevated risk reported for the ADH1B✱1/ADH1B✱1 genotype should be addressed, and future studies would benefit from consistent case definitions, enhanced exposure measurements, larger sample sizes, and careful study design.

### Alcohol-induced metabolomic differences in humans [^0ff017c7]. Translational Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption is the world's third largest risk factor for disease burden and is associated with diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, various cancers and fetal alcohol syndrome. Each year, an estimated 2.5 million people die from alcohol-related disease worldwide. Biomarkers for alcohol intake include direct blood alcohol concentration, γ-glutamyltransferase activity, carbohydrate deficient transferrinor mean corpuscular volume of erythrocytes. Nevertheless, further research is needed to understand alcohol-specific metabolic responses and the underlying pathophysiology. For example, identification of potential biomarkers for monitoring of alcohol consumption or determination of pharmacotherapy targets could facilitate early intervention for patients with specific alcohol-related disorders.

Targeted metabolomics is a promising method that can elucidate the effect of alcohol consumption on human metabolism. Metabolites are products of cellular processes, and their levels can be regarded as the ultimate response of biological systems to genetic or environmental changes. Recent advances in metabolomic technologies have enabled high-throughput measurement of not only one but several compound classes simultaneously (for example, amino acids, sugars, glycerophospholipids), resulting in a fast and more comprehensive identification of candidate biomarkers. As far as we are aware, no large-scale metabolic profiling analyses of humans with alcohol consumption have yet been conducted.

The aims of the underlying study were to (1) investigate the relation of alcohol intake and serum metabolite concentrations in German and UK studies and (2) identify potential biomarkers that could predict high levels of intake.

### Theoretical and retrograde calculation of blood alcohol: wide estimates using the academy standards board for calculations over an extended period of time [^64cd6a06]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is an essential part of many criminal cases and civil lawsuits, especially relating to assaults or motor vehicle accidents. When BAC testing data are available, forensic experts are often engaged to "back"-estimate the BAC (retrograde) to some earlier moment in time where the signature event took place. During the postabsorptive phase (ie, after all consumed alcohol has been absorbed from the stomach), ethanol exhibits zero-order metabolism. Therefore, a constant rate of metabolism, termed "β", is expressed in units of percentage alcohol declined per hour.

Forensic experts may also be engaged to "forward"-estimate the BAC (theoretical) after drinking to some future moment in time. Calculations are made given assumptions as to the amount of alcohol consumed, the ethanol percentage from those drinks, and the time of consumption by the individual in question. Estimates of postabsorptive blood alcohol levels are computed using the Widmark formula, where

where Vd is the volume of distribution for ethanol expressed in liters per kilogram of body weight.

The rate of ethanol metabolism is also used if time has lapsed between the end of drinking and the sentinel event. In both situations, an estimated BAC is used by counsel and jurists when drawing conclusions about the likelihood of impairment.

The American Academy of Forensic Sciences Academy Standards Board (ASB) has published recommendations for performing alcohol calculations in forensic cases. For theoretical calculations (predicting a BAC from drinking history), the ASB recommends using a range of Vd from 0.45 to 0.81 L/kg if the sex is unspecified, 0.58 to 0.83 L/kg for male individuals, and 0.43 to 0.73 L/kg for female individuals. If the person in question's height and weight are known, the total body water (TBW) can be calculated, thereby narrowing the range of Vd. The ASB recommends the following equation for male and female individual:

The individual Vd is determined as

For the retrograde calculations (back-calculating the BAC from a measured value), the ASB recommends calculating BAC using the range of β values 0.10 to 0.25 g/L/h.

### Endogenous ethanol production in health and disease [^69dd049e]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The gut microbiome exerts metabolic actions on distal tissues and organs outside the intestine, partly through microbial metabolites that diffuse into the circulation. The disruption of gut homeostasis results in changes to microbial metabolites, and more than half of the variance in the plasma metabolome can be explained by the gut microbiome. Ethanol is a major microbial metabolite that is produced in the intestine of nearly all individuals; however, elevated ethanol production is associated with pathological conditions such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and auto-brewery syndrome, in which the liver's capacity to metabolize ethanol is surpassed. In this Review, we describe the mechanisms underlying excessive ethanol production in the gut and the role of ethanol catabolism in mediating pathogenic effects of ethanol on the liver and host metabolism. We conclude by discussing approaches to target excessive ethanol production by gut bacteria.

### The link between inflammation, bugs, the intestine and the brain in alcohol dependence [^df2d9b36]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Animal models vs human studies in alcohol research

Animal models have proved very useful in addressing mechanistic questions on the role of inflammation in alcohol dependence and studies on germ-free (GF) mice have been extremely instrumental in introducing the concept that the gut microbiota may largely influence behavior. However, data obtained in animals should be interpreted with caution especially with regard to the changes in human behavior and the possibility to extrapolate them to human disease should carefully be checked in well-designed clinical studies. Overall, animals have a natural aversion for alcohol and do not develop a true addiction as observed in humans. Moreover, the rate of ethanol metabolism and elimination is five times greater in mice than in humans. Alcohol administration to rodents (for example, Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet, Tsukamoto–French model of continuous intragastric ethanol infusion via gastrostomy) requires artifices that do not directly mimic human drinking patterns, and the damages alcohol causes to the organs in animals represent only a part of the spectrum of that observed in humans (for example, induction of little or even no inflammation at all). In addition, numerous differences exist in the characteristics of the murine and human immune system, with, for instance, the balance of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils, the numbers of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed at the immune cell surface (13 in rodents and 10 in humans)and the species-specific differences in TLR regulation following, for example, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacteria considered a key factor in the development of alcoholic liver disease in rodent models by stimulating the TLR4–CD14 pathway. However, to our knowledge, it remains unknown whether differences in gut microbiota composition between mice and humans are consistent with a differential pattern of TLR expression and stimulation. Although imperfect, animal models are still useful if their limitations and weaknesses are understood and taken into consideration. We will hence present, in this review, data obtained in both animal and human studies.

### Kinetics and metabolism of fomepizole in healthy humans [^1949cfd2]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Context/Objective

Fomepizole, a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, has replaced ethanol as antidote for methanol and ethylene glycol intoxications because of a longer duration of action and fewer adverse effects. Prior human studies have indicated that single doses of fomepizole are eliminated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but two studies in poisoned patients have suggested that first order elimination occurs after multiple doses. Because of the contrast in fomepizole kinetics among existing studies and the lack of information regarding its metabolism in humans, kinetic and metabolic studies were conducted after single doses and after multiple oral doses in healthy human subjects.

Materials/Methods

In a single-dose, crossover study, healthy humans received fomepizole IV or orally (7 mg/kg). Also to define the metabolism and kinetics of fomepizole when administered over the presumed antidotal period, subjects were divided into three groups, which were given oral loading doses of 10–15 mg/kg, followed by supplemental doses of 3–10 mg/kg/12 h through 96 hours.

Results

The single dose study confirmed that fomepizole was eliminated by saturable, nonlinear kinetics, primarily by metabolism, and subsequent renal excretion of the metabolite 4-carboxypyrazole (4-CP). In the multi-dose study, the zero order elimination rate of fomepizole increased with increasing duration of treatment (from mean of 3 μmol/L/h after first dose to 14 μmol/L/h after 72 hours). Consistent with the enhanced elimination of fomepizole, the rate of urinary excretion of 4-CP increased with time. After 96 hours, fomepizole elimination apparently changed to first order kinetics with a t(½) of 1.5–2 hours.

Discussion/Conclusion

The results suggest that fomepizole induces its own metabolism via cytochrome P-450, leading to enhanced fomepizole elimination and 4-CP excretion. Thus, to maintain relatively constant plasma levels of fomepizole during therapy, increased supplemental doses at about 36–48 hours are needed to overcome the increased elimination of fomepizole. As such, these kinetic evaluations in healthy humans support the current dosing recommendations for fomepizole.

### A physiologically-based digital twin for alcohol consumption-predicting real-life drinking responses and long-term plasma PEth [^c21449b6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The validated model could predict PEth levels based on short-term consumption habits (Fig. 7b, d). The use of plasma PEth as a biomarker for alcohol consumption is widely used in clinical practice, sometimes as a validation to self-reporting systems (such as AUDIT). As a proof-of-concept, simulations of long-term PEth levels in response to different drinking patterns and anthropometrics were preformed (Fig. 7 b, d), as well as a tool to evaluate self-reported weekly drinking in combination with measured PEth levels (Fig. 7 e–g).

In the future, a personalized model capable of predicting the long-term PEth trajectories given short-term drinking habits might prove useful for physicians working with patients, where distinguishing between moderate, and heavy drinking is important, e.g. liver-transplant patients. In the future, we would like to further validate the long-term PEth model, as well as expanding the ethanol degradation pathways in the model by adding alcohol consumption driven changes of CYP2E1 expression. With the intention to show how long-term exposure might lead to dysregulated metabolism and alcohol related liver disease (ALD).

There are mathematical models that describe different processes related to alcohol consumption, each with their strengths and limitations. The first kind is the gastric emptying models, which currently do not detail any interactions with the BAC profile following consumption of alcohol –. On the other hand, the existing BAC models – fail to account for real-life drinking situations, (i) timing differences of gastric emptying, (ii) the influence of beverage caloric content, and (iii) meal effect on the BAC profile.

A second kind of already existing model type, are the minimal plasma ethanol models for determining kinetic parameters of ethanol dynamics. While these minimal plasma ethanol models can be used to estimate BAC, they are not useful when handling varying and combined ingestion of drinks and food. In contrast, there exist models of ethanol dynamics that include more detailed descriptions of the physiology. While these models describe the whole-body context of ethanol, they do not include a mechanistic description of gastric emptying and food consumption. A model by Moore et al.includes the dynamics of ethanol absorption and the effect of a meal in non-human primates but it lacks a mechanistic description of gastric emptying, and can thus not explain the different gastric emptying rates of drinks with different caloric content. Furthermore, the model by Moore et al. does not describe long-term markers like PEth.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1b13a689]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — biological testing and BAC-based risk assessment — A biological test for alcohol use (blood, breath, or urine) can identify if a patient recently used alcohol, and may be particularly helpful for those who are unable to communicate or otherwise give an alcohol use history. When conducting a biological test, consider the range time (window of detection) in which the test can detect alcohol use; for example, a breathalyzer can detect alcohol use at an approximate rate of 1 standard drink per hour. In general, high tolerance to heavy consumption can lead to increased rates of alcohol metabolism and clearance rates outside of expected ranges, meaning patients can have a negative breathalyzer test result and be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) combined with withdrawal signs can indicate risk for withdrawal, and patients with elevated BAC who are not clinically intoxicated should be considered at risk for withdrawal because their tolerance suggests dependence and the potential for severe alcohol withdrawal; there is no consensus about a specific threshold for predicting risk, but estimates include 100 mg/dL, 150 mg/dL, and 200 mg/dL. A diagnostic assessment for alcohol withdrawal/assessment of risk for developing alcohol withdrawal following cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol consumption is indicated if the clinician is aware that the patient's alcohol use patterns are consistent with risk of alcohol withdrawal or if they are displaying signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

### Mendelian randomization for cardiovascular diseases: principles and applications [^6c72fd23]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

How to select genetic variants?

There are two typical strategies for selection of genetic variants for use in a MR analysis. Genetic variant selection can be based on biological rationale or by including all independent genetic variants associated with the risk factor irrespective of biological function. For example, MR studies of the association between alcohol consumption and CVD have either used variants in genes that encode enzymes with a key role in alcohol metabolism, or all independent genetic variants associated with alcohol consumption at the genome-wide significance level in large consortium data. Alcohol (ethanol) is metabolized in the liver via two steps: firstly by alcohol dehydrogenases and secondly by acetaldehyde dehydrogenases. Genetic variants in the coding gene regions of these enzymes affect alcohol drinking behaviours as accumulation of the intermediate product of this two-step reaction (i.e. acetaldehyde) produces discomforts, such as facial flushing and increases of pulse rate and skin temperature, at sufficient concentrations. Mendelian randomization studies have demonstrated that higher alcohol consumption proxied by one or more variants in the coding gene regions for the alcohol or acetaldehyde dehydrogenases is associated with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), and increased risk of coronary heart disease, and stroke.

Alcohol drinking behaviour and many other phenotypes are polygenic, meaning that they are influenced by variants in many genes. When multiple genetic variants are available as instruments, with individual-level data, the variants can be combined into a polygenic score, which is the weighted sum of genotypes over many variants. This score can then be used as an instrumental variable. In a two-sample MR analysis based on summarized data, each variant provides its own MR ratio estimate that is combined by taking a weighted average of them. Similar to MR analyses of alcohol consumption proxied by variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism, a two-sample MR analysis showed that higher alcohol consumption proxied by 94 genetic variants was associated with higher SBP and stroke risk.

The two strategies to select genetic variants come with different strengths and limitations. The advantage of using few genetic variants with a clear biological role in influencing the putative risk factor is that the likelihood of pleiotropic effects is typically lower. For example, the instrument comprising all genetic variants associated with alcohol consumption was associated with smoking liability in UK Biobank.

An advantage of using all genetic variants associated with the risk factor is that statistical power can be greater as the proportion of variation in the risk factor increases with the number of genetic variants employed as instrumental variables. Furthermore, when many genetic variants are available, a broad range of sensitivity analyses can be employed to test the MR assumptions.

### Determinants of alcohol use and abuse: impact of quantity and frequency patterns on liver disease [^e14ace91]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

More than 70% of alcohol is consumed by 10% of the population in the United States. Implicit in this statistic is that tremendous variation in the pattern of drinking (quantity, frequency, and duration) exists among alcohol consumers. Individuals who are binge or chronic drinkers will have different health outcomes than social drinkers. Therefore, knowing the pattern of drinking will shed light on how severely individuals are alcohol-dependent and on the extent of liver damage. Thus, these parameters assume particular relevance for the treatment-providing physician. Genetic factors contribute substantially to differences in alcohol metabolism. Variations in the activities of the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, in part determine blood alcohol concentration, thereby contributing to the predisposition to becoming alcohol-dependent and to susceptibility to alcohol-induced liver damage. Chronic alcohol consumption induces cytochrome P450 2E1, a microsomal enzyme that metabolizes alcohol at high concentrations and also metabolizes medications such as acetaminophen and protease inhibitors. Alcohol metabolism changes the redox state of the liver, which leads to alterations in hepatic lipid, carbohydrate, protein, lactate, and uric acid metabolism. The quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption severely impact the liver in the presence of comorbid conditions such as infection with hepatitis B or C and/or human immunodeficiency virus, type 2 diabetes, hemochromatosis, or obesity and thus have implications with respect to the extent of injury and response to medications.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the relationships between the quantity, frequency, and patterns of drinking and alcoholic liver disease is limited. A better understanding of these relationships will guide hepatologists in managing alcoholic liver disease.

### Wearable continuous diffusion-based skin gas analysis [^452893ee]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A strength of this approach is the capability to capture multimodal emissions in the same spatial location. Stressors such as alcohol metabolism produce H 2 O, CO 2, ketone bodies, and many other VOCs, and ethanol in the bloodstream, which diffuses to the skin through previously described mechanisms. Previously published works on the impact of alcohol ingestion on sweat rate describe a minor or minimalincrease, with a characteristic temporal spike in sweat rate 10–15 min after ingestion of a 0.36 g/kg of subject body weight alcohol mixture. Also described in the literature upon ingestion of alcohol are measurable changes in VOC emissions from the skin. In Fig. 5h, we observe these prior described physiological effects. Specifically sweat modulation consistent with the results of Yoda et al. are present in Trial 1 and 2 (black arrows). Reportable VOC trends similar to those captured via an over-ear ethanol sensor, and similar-in-effect to a "bio-sniffer"where ingestion of alcohol causes a time-delayed reaction of roughly 10–15 min where VOC readings begin to increase drastically. Alcohol metabolism, plus the increase in blood alcohol levels, directly influences the production of transdermal VOC emission, specifically breakdown to acetaldehyde yielding increased acetone levels via indirect effects on lipid metabolism, additionally non-metabolized ethanol in the bloodstream affects VOC emission. These processes are shown in the data, where the highest blood alcohol concentration presents a spike representing a 171.2% increase (region between 1st and 2nd red arrow) in VOC emission from baseline of the 5 min before ingestion, and associated metabolic processes following this spike keep the VOC trend elevated at an average of 159.8% from baseline. Skin CO 2 emission in response to alcohol is uncharacterized in literature, however work related to pulmonary function measured through spirometry suggests that alcohol ingestion suppresses the function of this system, which would yield higher CO 2 concentrations in the bloodstream. This is corroborated by our experimental results, in which CO 2 skin emission is significantly increased by 22.1% (blue arrow) in Trial 1, starting 10 min following alcohol ingestion and peaking 2.5 min later. Trial 2 shows a lower slope, but a similar phenomenon, where the CO 2 peak occurs 12 min after ingestion (shown by the blue arrow), with a percent change from baseline of 4.2%. Clear indication of alcohol metabolism is shown in both reported results, with temporally matched peaks occurring within 30 s in independent testing, showcasing the DBGS platform's strength in capturing discrete physiological phenomena with high temporal resolution.

### Direct measurement of alcohol and its metabolites [^cdf95550]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ethanol can be easily and accurately measured in body fluids or vapours by several chemical and enzymatic methods. However, the persistence of ethanol in the body is short lived and ethanol's metabolism and distribution within the body are extremely complex.

Aim

This article discusses the complex pharmacokinetics of ethanol and how pharmacokinetics can affect measured ethanol concentrations when ethanol is sampled across different individuals or from different body fluids or vapors, such as whole blood, plasma, breath, urine, saliva, or transdermal ethanol.

Findings

Several physical methods for the quantification of ethanol concentrations are described, including gas chromatography, electrochemical detection, infrared detection and enzymatic methods, along with their advantages and limitations. Also discussed, is the utility of the measurement of several immediate metabolites of ethanol, including acetaldehyde. acetate, and fatty acid ethyl esters.

Conclusions

The complex distribution and metabolism of ethanol and its metabolites can obscure the relationship between the ethanol concentration that is measured in body fluids or vapours and the amount of ethanol that is actually taken into the body.

HFD-induced obesity and diabetes in rodents: relevance to human pathophysiology

In order for a rodent model to have relevance to human disease, it should effectively recapitulate the natural history, pathophysiology and complications in a manner similar to what is observed in humans. However, this does not appear to be the case for HFD-fed rodents trying to mimic human obesity and diabetes. First of all, the large number of diets used for HFD studies in rodents may not appropriately represent the general human diet, particularly the 'obesogenic' Western diet. For example, the US population on average consumes 30–40% dietary fat regardless of weight (whether normal, overweight or obese). Therefore, using 40–60% fat (that is, values significantly > 40%) in rodent dietary interventions is too extreme compared with the average Western diet. Moreover, human diets are much more complex than the carefully formulated rodent HFDs. According to the US National Cancer Institute, human foods and beverages can be divided into 97 categories, such as grain-based desserts, pasta and pasta dishes, beef and beef-mixed dishes and so on, with many subcategories. Humans also consume alcohol and excessive sodium, which are not found in rodent feed, but affect human pathophysiology. Therefore rodent diets differ from the diet that lead to human obesity and diabetes and associated complications.

Apart from the actual diet, consumptive behavior also differs between rodents and humans. Humans tend to have stress, emotions and cultural factors that affect their access to food, selection of diet and feeding behavior. For example, uncontrolled food intake can lead to overeating due to complex psychological factors in humans, which cannot be accurately mimicked in rodent models. In some rodent models, disruption of leptin signaling is the primary cause of hyperphagia rather than feeding behavior governed by emotional factors. Furthermore, unlike humans, mice consume most of their food at night. As a result, the routine overnight fasting of 16–18 h is an unhealthy long period of time that provokes a catabolic state capable of nearly depleting liver glycogen stores, a state more akin to starvation in mice. In lean mice, overnight fasting can reduce lean body mass by ∼15%. In addition, prolonged fasting in mice enhances insulin-stimulated glucose utilization, whereas it is impaired in humans. Moreover, mice can undergo reduced metabolic rate (physiological state of torpor), whereas humans cannot.

### Toxic alcohols [^6186a3a5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on toxic alcohol poisoning:

- **Definition**: Toxic alcohol poisoning refers to ingestion of short-chain alcohols such as methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropyl alcohol, whose toxic effects result primarily from their metabolites causing metabolic acidosis and end-organ injury. These compounds are distinct from ethanol in both metabolism and toxicity, with characteristic biochemical abnormalities including elevated anion and osmol gaps.
- **Pathophysiology**: Toxic alcohols exert their effects primarily through metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, generating highly toxic organic acids or ketones. Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, leading to cellular hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and selective optic nerve and basal ganglia injury. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids that cause severe metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia from calcium oxalate precipitation, and renal tubular injury. In contrast, isopropanol is converted to acetone, producing CNS depression and ketosis without acidosis. The degree of toxicity and organ involvement correlates with the rate of metabolic conversion and accumulation of these toxic metabolites.
- **Epidemiology**: Toxic alcohol exposures occur thousands of times annually in the US, with cases frequently reported to poison control centers and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Most poisonings are accidental or involve intentional ingestion, and patients often present without a clear exposure history, making laboratory assessment essential for diagnosis.
- **Disease course**: Toxic alcohol poisoning typically presents in several stages as the parent compound is metabolized to its toxic byproducts. Methanol is converted to formic acid, which produces high anion gap metabolic acidosis and characteristic visual disturbances such as blurred or "snowstorm" vision, often progressing to optic neuropathy and blindness if untreated. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic and oxalic acids, leading to severe metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, renal injury from calcium oxalate deposition, and multiorgan failure. Isopropanol, metabolized to acetone, causes profound CNS depression and gastrointestinal irritation but no acidosis. Diagnosis relies on recognizing these time-dependent clinical and biochemical changes, especially rising anion and osmol gaps in the absence of a clear exposure history.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Outcomes depend predominantly on the specific alcohol, ingested dose, and time to definitive therapy. Prompt administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor such as fomepizole and, when indicated, extracorporeal removal markedly reduces mortality and long-term morbidity. Delayed treatment permits accumulation of toxic metabolites and is associated with irreversible sequelae: formic acid from methanol causes optic nerve injury and potential permanent blindness, while glycolic and oxalic acids from ethylene glycol cause severe metabolic acidosis and renal failure that may progress to CKD. Isopropyl alcohol usually produces less metabolic acidosis but can cause profound CNS depression; very high levels or hemodynamic collapse predict worse outcomes.

### Site of alcohol first-pass metabolism among women [^ea3301be]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this study suggest that alcohol FPM occurs in the stomach in women. Despite the overnight fast, which minimizes alcohol FPM, the bioavailability of ingested alcohol increased by 34% in women who had undergone SG compared with women who had not undergone surgery. The increased bioavailability was not explained by systemic AER or rate of gastric emptying; differences between groups remained when matching Tmax. These data help clarify where alcohol FPM occurs and provide a plausible mechanism for the observed increased in alcohol-related disease, after bariatric surgery. Given that most patients who undergo metabolic surgery are women, this evaluation included solely women, which is a limitation of the study. Studies in male patients who have undergone SG are needed to better understand sex differences in FPM.

### Acetate reprograms gut microbiota during alcohol consumption [^056c08f2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Although high-alcohol-producing bacteria were identified in humans, whether alcohol-metabolizing strains exist in humans is not clear. Following acute administration of ethanol to germ-free and conventional rates, acetaldehyde concentrations were significantly lower in the rectum and cecum in germ-free mice compared with conventional animals, and this was paralleled by bacteria numbers in the two intestinal locations, suggesting that acetaldehyde could be generated by bacterial ethanol oxidation. However, our study provides no evidence that gut microbiota can metabolize ethanol directly, as demonstrated by ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Significant ethanol consumption was not detected ex vivo. Microbial alcohol dehydrogenase gene expression was not upregulated after ethanol-feeding in mice. In contrast, the relative expression of a microbial gene involved in acetate dissimilation, AMP acetyl-CoA synthetase, was significantly upregulated in alcohol-fed mice relative to controls. We demonstrate here that the gut microbiome altered by acetate and not ethanol, do not play a role in liver damage. Conventional mice exert relatively mild liver disease. Following microbiota transplantation with stool from patients with severe alcohol-associated liver disease, severity of ethanol-induced liver disease increases in microbiota-humanized mice. Virulence factors in pathobionts and pathogens are important determinants of liver disease in microbiota-humanized mice and patients, and they are likely independent from acetate. Moreover, we did not explore the possible role of the oral microbiota in the metabolism of ethanol, where potential bacterial community members have been shown to metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde in culture. Future work will be needed to address the role of these oral microbiota species in vivo, the possible role of bile acids, and to replicate these findings in larger human cohorts.

### Prenatal alcohol exposure, blood alcohol concentrations and alcohol elimination rates for the mother, fetus and newborn [^c3ddaa91]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a common cause of intellectual impairment and birth defects. More recently, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been found to be a risk factor for fetal mortality, stillbirth and infant and child mortality. This has led to increased concern about detection and management of PAE. One to 2h after maternal ingestion, fetal blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) reach levels nearly equivalent to maternal levels. Ethanol elimination by the fetus is impaired because of reduced metabolic capacity. Fetal exposure time is prolonged owing to the reuptake of amniotic-fluid containing ethanol by the fetus. Alcohol elimination from the fetus relies on the mother's metabolic capacity. Metabolic capacity among pregnant women varies eightfold (from 0.0025 to 0.02gdl(-1) h(-1)), which may help explain how similar amounts of ethanol consumption during pregnancy results in widely varying phenotypic presentations of FASD. At birth physiological changes alter the neonate's metabolic capacity and it rapidly rises to a mean value of 83.5% of the mother's capacity. FASDs are highly recurrent and younger siblings have increased risk. Detection of prenatal alcohol use offers an important opportunity for office-based interventions to decrease exposure for the remainder of pregnancy and identification of women who need substance abuse treatment. Mothers of children with FAS have been found to drink faster, get drunk quicker and to have higher BACs. A modest increase in the prevalence of a polymorphism of alcohol dehydrogenase, which increases susceptibility to adverse outcomes from PAE has been reported. Lastly, detection of alcohol use and appropriate management would decrease risk from PAE for subsequent pregnancies.

### The relationship between different dimensions of alcohol use and the burden of disease-an update [^f67f1d60]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Liver cirrhosis

Liver cirrhosis and the wider GBD category with other liver diseases is a major cause of death globally 200, even though it has not been included into the WHO targets for non‐communicable disease 276. Liver disease is linked clearly to alcohol 277, evidenced by several ICD codes for alcoholic liver diseases (Table 1), including simple alcoholic steatosis, hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis and superimposed hepatocellular carcinoma, which is part of alcohol‐attributable cancers (see above). Globally, approximately half of all liver cirrhosis deaths and disability‐adjusted life years were estimated to be attributable to alcohol in 2012 8.

The pathogenesis of specific forms of alcoholic liver disease can be summarized as follows 278, 279. Alcohol use, especially heavy drinking occasions, induces changes in lipid metabolism (increases lipogenesis and mobilization of lipids and simultaneously decreases hepatic lipid catabolism), resulting in the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes called fatty liver. Alcohol use can also cause an inflammatory response known as alcoholic hepatitis, or steatohepatitis if it is accompanied by hepatic lipid deposition. Although hepatic steatosis does not normally cause irreversible hepatic changes, persistence and severity of alcoholic hepatitis or steatohepatitis leads eventually to fibrosis and sclerotic changes in the liver that result in insidious replacement of hepatocytes with connective tissue (liver cirrhosis) and subsequent liver failure.

The dose–response relationship between average volume of alcohol use and liver cirrhosis is exponential, with the curve more pronounced for mortality than for non‐fatal morbidity 280. The more accelerated dose–response curve for mortality is due to the fact that liver damage can have different aetiologies (most prominently, hepatitis B or C 281), but if the liver is damaged continuation of alcohol use, even at relatively low quantities, can lead to death. Most research about the relationship between alcohol use and liver disease examined the overall tissue exposure (i.e. overall volume of alcohol consumption) following the tradition of Lelbach 282. However, there are also indications that patterns of drinking matter 283. More specifically, given the same amount of overall alcohol exposure, days without any alcohol consumption ('liver holidays') have been shown to be associated with a lower risk than daily drinking 284, 285.

### Effectiveness of genetic feedback on alcohol metabolism to reduce alcohol consumption in young adults: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^c927d0ac]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was the average daily alcohol consumption (g of pure alcohol equivalent) of participants, which was calculated using a generally accepted formula and the following procedure.

A drinking calendar showed drinking examples that were similar to those in the questionnaire, and participants were requested to record the content (type and concentration of alcohol) and amount of alcohol consumed on each drinking day during a 6-month period. From the calendar records, the net alcohol consumed (g) was calculated using the following generally accepted formula: net alcohol content (g) = volume of liquor (mL) × degree or %/100 × 0.8 (specific gravity). This formula was used to calculate the net alcohol content for each study period, which was divided by the number of drinking days, to calculate the average daily alcohol consumption (g of net alcohol).

The following examples are included in the alcohol consumption questionnaire.

Conversion for alcoholic beverages was as follows: sake: 15% alcohol content, 180 mL = 2 drinks; beer: 5% alcohol content, 500 mL [medium bottle, medium mug, or canned beer] = 2 drinks; whiskey and brandy: 43% alcohol by volume, 60 mL [double] = 2 drinks; shochu: 25% alcohol by volume, 100 mL [half cup] = 2 drinks; canned cocktail: 7% alcohol by volume, 350 mL = 2 drinks; cocktails, fruity tastes, etc.: 5% alcohol by volume, 350 mL [can] = 1.5 drinks, 500 mL [can] = 2 drinks; wine: 12% alcohol by volume, 150 mL [glass] = 1.5 drinks; and umeshu: 12% alcohol by volume, 90 mL [small glass] = 1 drink. In the survey, respondents were asked to indicate the average number of drinks they consumed per day (1 drink = 10 g pure alcohol) on their drinking days during the past month.

### Resting metabolic rate is an important predictor of serum adiponectin concentrations: potential implications for obesity-related disorders [^e74ba770]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the regulation of adiponectin. Animal studies suggest local regulation by adipocytokines or alterations in energy expenditure, and studies in humans suggest regulation by alcohol intake and ethnicity.

Objective

To identify regulators of adiponectin in humans, we measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), serum adiponectin, glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol, alcohol intake, and anthropometric indexes in 457 white patients with overweight or obesity.

Design

A cross-sectional design was used, and multivariate regression analysis was performed with adiponectin as the dependent variable and potential predictors as independent variables.

Results

Simple linear analyses showed significant associations between adiponectin and sex, with a standardized coefficient of -0.38 (women compared with men) and an explanation of variation of the model (R(2)) of 14%; age (0.21; 4%); RMR (-0.52; 27%); fat-free mass (-0.40; 16%); fat mass (-0.16; 2%); visceral fat (-0.24; 6%; computed tomography at L4-L5); fasting triacylglycerol (-0.28; 8%); and insulin resistance (-0.38; 14%; homeostasis model assessment). Adiponectin and alcohol were not associated (-0.04; 0%). Multivariate analyses, which allowed adjustment for confounding, showed that RMR is the most important predictor of adiponectin (-0.31; 29%), followed successively by insulin resistance (-0.16; 31%; model containing RMR and insulin resistance), fat mass (0.20; 34%), age (0.34; 35%), visceral fat (-0.34; 40%), and fasting triacylglycerol (-0.12, 41%).

Conclusions

Low resting metabolism (RMR) is associated with high serum adiponectin. We speculate that subjects with low RMR, who are theoretically at greater risk of obesity-related disorders, are especially protected by adiponectin.

### Major genetic components underlying alcoholism in Korean population [^5c4e7268]. Human Molecular Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol metabolism is one of the biological determinants that could significantly be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in alcohol-metabolism genes. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts alcohol to acetaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) converts acetaldehyde to acetate. The well-known genetic polymorphisms in ADH1B(His47Arg) and ALDH2(Glu487Lys) have dramatic effects on the rate of metabolizing alcohol and acetaldehyde, respectively. The protective allele of ADH1B (ADH1B✱47His) encodes for a rapid ethanol-metabolizing enzyme, and the susceptible allele of the ALDH2 (ALDH2✱487Lys) is strongly associated with decreased rate of metabolizing acetaldehyde. However, the combined genetic effects of both functional polymorphisms have not been clarified. The combined analysis of two polymorphisms among a Korean population (n = 1,032) revealed dramatic genetic effects on the risk of alcoholism. Individuals bearing susceptible alleles at both loci have 91 times greater risk for alcoholism [odds ratio (OR) = 91.43, P = 1.4 x 10(-32)] and individuals bearing one susceptible and one protective allele at either loci have 11 times greater risk (OR = 11.40, P = 3.5 x 10(-15)) compared with subjects who have both protective alleles. The attributable fraction of those genetic factors, calculated based on population controls, indicates that alcoholism in 86.5% of alcoholic patients can be attributed to the detrimental effect of ADH1B✱47Arg and/or ALDH2✱487Glu in Korean population.

### The effect of fructose on alcohol metabolism… [^6c5a5ab3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The blood level of alcohol reflects the tissue levels throughout the body, and in a general way indicates the degree of impairment of the individual with drunkenness. The blood level is most importantly determined by the size of the person and the amount of alcohol ingested, for it is distributed throughout the total body water. The removal of alcohol is remarkably constant in a given person, although severe alcoholics have a substantially higher rate of removal than abstinent persons or modest drinkers.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^7c26388e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Epidemiology and disease burden — alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease worldwide and is the leading cause of liver-related mortality in the United States, with harmful alcohol use responsible globally for 3 million deaths annually, accounting for 5.3% of all deaths and 13.5% of deaths in people aged 20–39 years. In U.S. data, cirrhosis was the 11th leading cause of death, with about half of cirrhosis-related deaths due to alcohol; the crude death rate from cirrhosis of any etiology was 14.6 deaths per 100,000 persons, whereas the rate from alcohol-associated cirrhosis was 7.3 per 100,000, and the World Health Organization has set a future goal to reduce cirrhosis mortality to below 8.2 deaths per 100,000, with a continued narrowing of the gender gap noted with increasing numbers of women with ALD.

### Genetics of alcoholism [^db46fd39]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review the search for genetic variants that affect the risk for alcohol dependence and alcohol consumption.

Recent Findings

Variations in genes affecting alcohol metabolism (ADH1B, ALDH2) are protective against both alcohol dependence and excessive consumption, but different variants are found in different populations. There are different patterns of risk variants for alcohol dependence vs. consumption. Variants for alcohol dependence, but not consumption, are associated with risk for other psychiatric illnesses. ADH1B and ALDH2 strongly affect both consumption and dependence. Variations in many other genes affect both consumption and dependence-or one or the other of these traits-but individual effect sizes are small. Evidence for other specific genes that affect dependence is not yet strong. Most current knowledge derives from studies of European-ancestry populations, and large studies of carefully phenotyped subjects from different populations are needed to understand the genetic contributions to alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (methylphenidate hydrochloride CD) [^29145351]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolism And Excretion

In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily via deesterification to alpha-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (ritalinic acid). The metabolite has little or no pharmacologic activity.

In vitro studies showed that methylphenidate was not metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, and did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at clinically observed plasma drug concentrations.

The mean terminal half-life (t½) of methylphenidate following administration of Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD (t½ = 6.8h) is longer than the mean terminal (t½) following administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride immediate-release tablets (t½ = 2.9h) and methylphenidate hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (t½ = 3.4h) in healthy adult volunteers. This suggests that the elimination process observed for Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD is controlled by the release rate of methylphenidate from the extended-release formulation, and that the drug absorption is the rate-limiting process.

Alcohol Effect

An in vitro study was conducted to explore the effect of alcohol on the release characteristics of methylphenidate from the Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD 60 mg capsule dosage form. At an alcohol concentration of 40% there was an increase in the release rate of methylphenidate in the first hour, resulting in 84% of the methylphenidate being released. The results with the 60 mg capsule are considered to be representative of the other available capsule strengths. Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD.

### HEPATOKIN1 is a biochemistry-based model of liver metabolism for applications in medicine and pharmacology [^b460bae7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The epidemic increase of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) requires a deeper understanding of the regulatory circuits controlling the response of liver metabolism to nutritional challenges, medical drugs, and genetic enzyme variants. As in vivo studies of human liver metabolism are encumbered with serious ethical and technical issues, we developed a comprehensive biochemistry-based kinetic model of the central liver metabolism including the regulation of enzyme activities by their reactants, allosteric effectors, and hormone-dependent phosphorylation. The utility of the model for basic research and applications in medicine and pharmacology is illustrated by simulating diurnal variations of the metabolic state of the liver at various perturbations caused by nutritional challenges (alcohol), drugs (valproate), and inherited enzyme disorders (galactosemia). Using proteomics data to scale maximal enzyme activities, the model is used to highlight differences in the metabolic functions of normal hepatocytes and malignant liver cells (adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma).

### Recent insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of chronic liver diseases [^ab94f863]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease

Alcohol abuse causes a wide spectrum of liver diseases ranging from steatosis, hepatitis, cirrhosis, to HCC. In 2019, alcohol accounted for an estimated 25% of cirrhosis deathsand 19% of liver cancer deaths globally. The per-capita alcohol consumption has been increasing from 1990 to 2017 worldwide and is predicted to increase further by 2030. Therefore, the burden of ALD might increase in parallel. In the liver, alcohol is primarily oxidised to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2E1. The oxidation of alcohol leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, which contributes to liver injury. Excessive acetaldehyde also contributes to tissue injury by reacting with various proteins to form acetaldehyde-protein adducts. Through aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)2 in the mitochondria, acetaldehyde is metabolised to acetate, which is exported into peripheral systems and can be metabolised in other tissues to acetyl-CoA, the substrate for lipid biosynthesis. In response to alcohol intoxication, hepatocytes undergo various forms of cell death, which triggers the inflammatory cascade involving distinct immune cells. Furthermore, alcohol contributes to gut dysbiosis and disruption of gut barrier integrity, subsequently inducing translocation of bacteria and their metabolites into system circulation, leading to liver injury. Currently, therapies for patients with ALD involve behavioural interventions, reducing inflammation and liver transplantation. Although emerging therapies are undergoing evaluation, available effective and safe treatments are still very few for patients with ALD. In this symposium, targeting alcohol metabolism, autophagy, and extrahepatic signalling were highlighted as novel potential treatment strategies for ALD.

### Alcoholism and alcohol drinking habits predicted from alcohol dehydrogenase genes [^6bd8eb61]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol drinking habits and alcoholism are partly genetically determined. Alcohol is degraded primarily by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) wherein genetic variation that affects the rate of alcohol degradation is found in ADH1B and ADH1C. It is biologically plausible that these variations may be associated with alcohol drinking habits and alcoholism. By genotyping 9080 white men and women from the general population, we found that men and women with ADH1B slow vs fast alcohol degradation drank more alcohol and had a higher risk of everyday drinking, heavy drinking, excessive drinking and of alcoholism. For example, the weekly alcohol intake was 9.8 drinks (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.1–11) among men with the ADH1B.1/1 genotype compared to 7.5 drinks (95% CI: 6.4–8.7) among men with the ADH1B.1/2 genotype, and the odds ratio (OR) for heavy drinking was 3.1 (95% CI: 1.7–5.7) among men with the ADH1B.1/1 genotype compared to men with the ADH1B.1/2 genotype. Furthermore, individuals with ADH1C slow vs fast alcohol degradation had a higher risk of heavy and excessive drinking. For example, the OR for heavy drinking was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1–1.8) among men with the ADH1C.1/2 genotype and 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0–1.9) among men with the ADH1B.2/2 genotype, compared with men with the ADH1C.1/1 genotype. Results for ADH1B and ADH1C genotypes among men and women were similar. Finally, because slow ADH1B alcohol degradation is found in more than 90% of the white population compared to less than 10% of East Asians, the population attributable risk of heavy drinking and alcoholism by ADH1B.1/1 genotype was 67 and 62% among the white population compared with 9 and 24% among the East Asian population.

### Effectiveness of genetic feedback on alcohol metabolism to reduce alcohol consumption in young adults: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^cfc129c9]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, data on alcohol consumption and AUDIT-C were self-reported by the participants; therefore, interpreting the results requires caution. Third, we did not compare the effect of SBI on alcohol-use behavior between the five types of alcohol-metabolizing enzyme genotypes or sexes because of the small sample size, whereas previous studies demonstrated that the responsiveness of alcohol-reducing interventions differed between the genotypes and sexes. In contrast, a significant reduction in alcohol consumption was observed in the intervention group, which had a relatively high proportion of women; this finding may be clinically important because alcohol-related health problems have been increased recently not only among men but also among women. Finally, we cannot ignore the unmeasurable confounding factors that may have affected the results of this study. Future studies should include larger populations with better outcomes.

### Variability in ethanol biodisposition in whites is modulated by polymorphisms in the ADH1B and ADH1C genes [^951dcb86]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Association between genetic variations in alcohol-related enzymes and impaired ethanol biodisposition has not been unambiguously proven, and the effect of many newly described polymorphisms remains to be explored. The aims of this study are to elucidate the influence of genetic factors in alcohol biodisposition and effects. We analyzed alcohol pharmacokinetics and biodisposition after the administration of 0.5 g/kg ethanol; we measured ethanol effects on reaction time and motor time in response to visual and acoustic signals, and we analyzed 13 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the genes coding for ADH1B, ADH1C, ALDH2, and CYP2E1 in 250 healthy white individuals. Variability in ethanol pharmacokinetics and biodisposition is related to sex, with women showing a higher area under the curve (AUC) (P = 0.002), maximum concentration (Cmax) (P < 0.001) and metabolic rate (P = 0.001). Four nonsynonymous SNPs are related to decreased alcohol metabolic rates: ADH1B rs6413413 (P = 0.012), ADH1C rs283413 (P < 0.001), rs1693482 (P < 0.001), and rs698 (P < 0.001). Individuals carrying diplotypes combining these mutations display statistically significant decrease in alcohol biodisposition as compared with individuals lacking these mutations. Alcohol effects displayed bimodal distribution independently of sex or pharmacokinetics. Most individuals had significant delays in reaction and motor times at alcohol blood concentrations under 500 mg/L, which are the driving limits for most countries.

Conclusion

Besides the identification of new genetic factors related to alcohol biodisposition relevant to whites, this study provides unambiguous identification of diplotypes related to variability in alcohol biodisposition.

Role of the liver and the intestine in ethanol metabolism

The liver is classically considered the major organ for ethanol metabolism (figure 1). Three oxidative pathways of ethanol metabolism in hepatocytes can convert ethanol to the production of acetaldehyde: (a) alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which is localised in the cytosol of hepatocytes is the major pathway of ethanol metabolism. Catalysis of this reaction requires the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD + to NADH; (b) catalase, which is localised in the peroxisomes of hepatocytes, can metabolise ethanol into acetaldehyde through the conversion of H 2 O 2 to 2H 2 O. This process catalyses a small proportion of remaining ethanol and (c) cytochrome P450-2E1, in the microsomes, also contributes to ethanol conversion to acetaldehyde but is only significant in situations of excessive chronic alcohol consumption. Oxidation of ethanol by this enzyme also leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethanol metabolism in individuals with AUD generates ROS that causes lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial glutathione depletion and S -adenosylmethionine depletion; all these products subsequently prime and sensitise hepatocytes to injury. Excess acetaldehyde can bind covalently to microtubules in the hepatocytes, resulting in the intracellular retention of normally excreted proteins and the subsequent cell swelling. Acetaldehyde is an extremely reactive compound; it is very toxic to hepatocytes because it reacts with a variety of proteins and DNAs to form adducts that promote glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial damage. Acetaldehyde is metabolised into acetate by the enzyme called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). Although acetate has no direct hepatotoxicity, it is believed to alter the inflammatory response by upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages.

### Interaction between alcohol dehydrogenase II gene, alcohol consumption, and risk for breast cancer [^e0907bf7]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Alcohol might very well be one of the few modifiable risk factors for breast cancer. Despite growing interest in genetic polymorphisms of the enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism for several diseases associated with alcohol comsumption, data regarding the role of these polymorphisms as to the risk for breast cancer are sparse. These polymorphisms are good candidates for gene-environment interactions, however, because they are likely to influence the most plausible biologic mechanism linking alcohol consumption to risk for breast cancer, i.e. endogenous oestrogens.

In humans, alcohol is almost entirely metabolised by oxidative detoxification, mainly dependent on two enzymes, class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both enzymes exhibit genetic polymorphisms influencing the rate of conversion from alcohol to acetaldehyde and to acetate. The class I ADH isoenzymes are formed by dimeric associations of α, β, and γ subunits controlled by three separate gene loci ADH1, ADH2, and ADH3, respectively. Despite recent reports regarding the ADH3 polymorphism and risk for breast cancer, nothing is known about the role of the less frequent but metabolically more relevant ADH2 polymorphism and its interaction with alcohol consumption for the risk of breast cancer.

The aim of the study was to test the a priori hypothesis of an interaction between the ADH2-2 polymorphism alone, alcohol consumption, and the risk for breast cancer in Caucasian women.

Binge drinking and alcoholism — genetic and environmental contributions and candidate regions are summarized: "approximately half the risk for alcoholism comes from genetic factors, and the other half comes from environmental risk factors", and susceptibility regions "have been found on chromosomes 1 and 7", with protective regions "found on chromosome 4", near alcohol dehydrogenase genes. Reflecting polygenicity, an ongoing study "recognizes that no single gene explains all facets of this condition". The metabolic enzymes are specified: "The primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of alcohol in the body are ADH and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)", and "Both of these enzymes occur in several forms encoded by different genes and influence both the level of consumption and the risk of alcoholism".

Acute response of liver metabolism to a bolus of ethanol

This example was chosen to illustrate how the model can be used to check the feasibility of hypotheses about the molecular basis of physiological or pathophysiological phenomena, in this case the interrelation between alcohol drinking and development of a fatty liver. The main detoxification route of alcohol comprises the subsequent action of the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) converting ethanol to acetate via the intermediate acetaldehyde (pathway #16, Fig. 1). Both reactions reduce NAD + to NADH. It is commonly argued that inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation due to the lowered NAD + /NADH ratio and the elevated de novo synthesis of fatty acids from massively formed acetate are the key factors contributing to the development of a fatty liver (see e.g.). We used our model to check the soundness of this reasoning by simulating the effect of a single bolus of ethanol added to the standard plasma profile (see Fig. 6). A steep rise of the plasma alcohol level occurred if the ethanol infusion rate approached 100 μM/g/h (red curves) indicating saturation of ADH. The alcohol challenge induced a transient increase of the cellular triglyceride content (Fig. 6d) that was paralleled by an increased release of and lactate into the plasma (Fig. 6b). However, up to high plasma peak values of 38 mM (corresponding to 1.75 per mille) these transient alterations disappeared within a few hours after cessation of the ethanol bolus. The simulations reveal that lowered ratios of NAD + /NADH and pyruvate/lactate decrease the availability of pyruvate for the carboxylation to oxaloacetate and thus diminish the formation of citrate by the citrate synthase. Hence, there is no significant citrate-dependent activation of the acetyl-CoA synthetase catalyzing the rate-limiting step of fatty acid synthesis. Notably, these model-based findings are in concordance with early experiments of Guynnwho observed a decrease of malonyl-CoA, citrate, and the activity of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase in response to acute ethanol administration. Hence, long-term changes in the expression of lipogenic enzymes remains the likely mechanism accounting for the development of an alcoholic fatty liver. Indeed, the transient increase of the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde (Fig. 6c) can activate the pro-lipogenic transcription factor SREB-1and inhibit the transcription factor PPAR-α controlling the expression of enzymes involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids.

### Genetics of alcohol dependence [^948a6e2e]. Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Alcohol dependence (AD), a genetically influenced phenotype, is extremely costly to individuals and to society in the United States and throughout the world, contributing to morbidity and mortality and a host of economic, interpersonal, and societal problems. Although until recently the only genes established to affect risk for AD were those encoding several alcohol metabolizing enzymes, there are now several other genes that can be regarded as confirmed risk loci, discovered through linkage and candidate gene association studies. While the mechanism of action of the effects of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes on AD risk is thought to be well understood, we are still in the early stages of understanding the physiology of other risk loci. Further, it is clear that only a small number of the many genes that influence risk for AD have been identified. Newer methodologies (e.g., genomewide association, study of copy number variation, and deep sequencing of candidate loci to identify rare risk variants) that have improved our understanding of other complex traits hold the promise of identifying a greater set of AD susceptibility loci.

### Alcohol and genetic polymorphisms: effect on risk of alcohol-related cancer [^cb3ea673]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Public health guidelines aim to limit the consumption of alcoholic beverages worldwide and the subsequent health burden. In particular, alcohol consumption is an avoidable risk factor for cancer. In human beings, ethanol in alcoholic drinks is mainly oxidised in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, and is further detoxified to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenases. Functional variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism result in differences between individuals in exposure to carcinogenic acetaldehyde, suggesting a possible interaction of genetic susceptibility and alcohol exposure in cancer. We reviewed available studies of the combined effects of alcohol drinking and genetic polymorphisms on alcohol-related cancer risk. Most available data were for polymorphisms in alcohol and folate metabolism. We give an overview of published studies on the combined effects of alcohol drinking and polymorphisms in genes for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), cytochrome P450 2E1, and methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase on the risk of alcohol-related cancer. Current data lend support to a role of polymorphisms ADH1B and ALDH2 combined with alcohol consumption in cancer. Other available data are insufficient or inconclusive, highlighting the need for additional studies.

### Translational opportunities in animal and human models to study alcohol use disorder [^29230e08]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

On the side of human experimentation, oral alcohol administration is a well-established paradigm. Early studies used predefined dosing methods based on body weight and sex, which resulted in wide variability in blood alcohol concentrations. More recent methods use mathematical models for more precise and standardized alcohol dosing regimens. The primary advantages of oral alcohol challenges are that they are easily implemented and ecologically valid. The target intoxicating dose is typically 0.08 g/dl; however, variability in blood alcohol concentrations, particularly time to peak BAC, is a notable disadvantage that adds methodological noise. Intravenous alcohol administration methods were developed to further enhance precision over BAC. In these experiments, a 5–6% alcohol solution is delivered intravenously at an infusion rate that considers participants' weight and sex. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model more accurately estimates BAC based on participant characteristics like sex, height, weight, and age. Model parameters can self-correct based on observed BAC values. The Computerized Alcohol Infusion System (CAIS) implements this model allowing fine-grained control over the ascending BAC limb trajectories and, to a lesser extent, descending limb trajectories. Furthermore, BAC can be maintained at a steady state over an extended period using alcohol clamp procedures. This paradigm allows for robust assessment of acute tolerance or sensitization to alcohol's effects, in addition to behavioral tasks while at a stable BAC. At the expense of ecological validity, intravenous administration allows for greater experimental control and the eliminations of alcohol-related sensory cues. Relative to oral alcohol administration, intravenous challenges are significantly more expensive largely due to medical costs.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^8dd8c4f2]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

GWAS of MCV stratified by alcohol intake

Analysis of the heterogenous effects between individuals with different alcohol intakes found that no variants reached the threshold for statistical significance (P < 2.4 × 10 −4). SNP rs218264 was the closest to this threshold at P = 5.2 × 10 −4, although both the low and heavy drinking groups showed significant associations with this variant (Table 3). No variants reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10 −8) when exploring the heterogeneity of allelic effects between the different drinking groups. Specific assessment of the alcohol metabolizing pathway found no evidence of an alcohol-related association between MCV and either the ADH or ALDH SNPs (Supplementary Material, Table S2).

Allele score for alcohol metabolism pathway

The genetic score used as a proxy for acetaldehyde accumulation rate/speed of clearance in drinkers only was independent of confounding factors (i.e. covariates included in multivariate model). The frequencies of the effect alleles contributing to the allele score were as follows: rs1229984_T = 0.021; rs698_T = 0.588 and rs2228093_T = 0.121. We found no evidence for an association between MCV and the allele score (P = 0.53). There was however evidence that the allele score was associated with alcohol intake (P < 2 × 10 −16). Categorization of the allele score demonstrated that this relationship with alcohol consumption was dose-dependent (negative direction), and thus, the score can be considered valid given current knowledge of alcohol metabolism and its relationship with intake (Supplementary Material, Table S3).

Figure 1
Schematic representation of ethanol metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract. Ethanol is metabolised first in the stomach and absorbed principally in the proximal small gut by simple diffusion. The liver is the major organ involved in ethanol metabolism. Acetaldehyde and acetate can potentially accumulate in the intestine and promote/contribute to ABD pathogenesis. ABD, alcohol-associated bowel disease; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ALDH, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; CYP2E1, cytochrome P450-2E1.

Ethanol is absorbed by simple diffusion through the mucosa of the GI tract. The amount of ethanol diffusing across the intestine depends on the concentration gradient between the gut lumen and the capillaries in the lamina propria, local blood flow and intestinal permeability. The highest levels of ethanol are reached in the duodenum and jejunum while luminal alcohol concentrations in the ileum, cecum and colon are similar to serum ethanol levels, suggesting that ethanol detected in the distal small intestine and colon is from the systemic circulation. Luminal ethanol can be metabolised by the intestinal epithelial cells because ethanol metabolising enzymes are expressed in the intestinal wall. ADH, the main enzyme involved in the first step of ethanol oxidation, is expressed in all parts of the intestine. However, to date no studies have mechanistically dissected how the intestine contributes to ethanol metabolism.

Alcohol-metabolizing enzymes related to genotype testing and five types of classification

All participants in the intervention group underwent genetic testing for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and received a report of their results. In the control group, those who requested testing were tested at the end of the study period, and they received their results.

Those with type A had low ADH1B activity and high ALDH2 activity, resulting in long-lasting effects of alcohol and rapid degradation of acetaldehyde. Therefore, those with type A had the highest preference for alcohol and were most likely to become dependent. Those with type B had both ADH1B and ALDH2 activities and were the most susceptible to drinking among the five types; therefore, such individuals needed to be careful not to drink excessively. Those with type C had slow decomposition of alcohol and acetaldehyde; therefore, it was difficult for them to be aware of acetaldehyde generation and discomfort, but they had a risk of carcinogenesis. Those with type D showed rapid alcohol decomposition and slow acetaldehyde decomposition. Therefore, their blood concentration of acetaldehyde increases, causing immediate facial redness, nausea, and other unpleasant symptoms and acetaldehyde-related health problems. Those with type E had inactive ALDH2, could not decompose acetaldehyde, and were at risk of acute alcohol intoxication, even with small amounts of alcohol.

### The risk relationships between alcohol consumption, alcohol use disorder and alcohol use disorder mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^859ce836]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Increasing levels of alcohol use are associated with a risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD), which, in turn, is associated with considerable burden. Our aim was to estimate the risk relationships between alcohol consumption and AUD incidence and mortality.

Method

A systematic literature search was conducted, using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science for case-control or cohort studies published between 1 January 2000 and 8 July 2022. These were required to report alcohol consumption, AUD incidence and/or AUD mortality (including 100% alcohol-attributable deaths). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022343201). Dose-response and random-effects meta-analyses were used to determine the risk relationships between alcohol consumption and AUD incidence and mortality and mortality rates in AUD patients, respectively.

Results

Of the 5904 reports identified, seven and three studies from high-income countries and Brazil met the inclusion criteria for quantitative and qualitative syntheses, respectively. In addition, two primary US data sources were analyzed. Higher levels of alcohol consumption increased the risk of developing or dying from an AUD exponentially. At an average consumption of four standard drinks (assuming 10 g of pure alcohol/standard drink) per day, the risk of developing an AUD was increased sevenfold [relative risk (RR) = 7.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.13–9.93] and the risk of dying fourfold (RR = 3.94, 95% CI = 3.53–4.40) compared with current non-drinkers. The mortality rate in AUD patients was 3.13 (95% CI = 1.07–9.13) per 1000 person-years.

Conclusions

There are exponential positive risk relationships between alcohol use and both alcohol use disorder incidence and mortality. Even at an average consumption of 20g/day (about one large beer), the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) is nearly threefold that of current non-drinkers and the risk of dying from an AUD is approximately double that of current non-drinkers.

### Vulnerability for alcohol use disorder and rate of alcohol consumption [^be4f31e3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Although several risk factors have been identified for alcohol use disorder, many individuals with these factors do not go on to develop the disorder. Identifying early phenotypic differences between vulnerable individuals and healthy control subjects could help identify those at higher risk. Binge drinking, defined as reaching a blood alcohol level of 80 mg%, carries a risk of negative legal and health outcomes and may be an early marker of vulnerability. Using a carefully controlled experimental paradigm, the authors tested the hypothesis that risk factors for alcohol use disorder, including family history of alcoholism, male sex, impulsivity, and low level of response to alcohol, would predict rate of binging during an individual alcohol consumption session.

Method

This cross-sectional study included 159 young social drinkers who completed a laboratory session in which they self-administered alcohol intravenously. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether risk factors for alcohol use disorder were associated with the rate of achieving a binge-level exposure.

Results

A greater percentage of relatives with alcoholism (hazard ratio: 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07), male sex (hazard ratio: 1.74, 95% CI = 1.03–2.93), and higher impulsivity (hazard ratio: 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.37) were associated with a higher rate of binging throughout the session. Participants with all three risk factors had the highest rate of binging throughout the session compared with the lowest risk group (hazard ratio: 5.27, 95% CI = 1.81–15.30).

Conclusions

Binge drinking may be an early indicator of vulnerability to alcohol use disorder and should be carefully assessed as part of a thorough clinical evaluation.

### Disulfiram [^3fa0b5fa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Disulfiram produces a sensitivity to alcohol which results in a highly unpleasant reaction when the patient under treatment ingests even small amounts of alcohol.

Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage. During alcohol metabolism following disulfiram intake, the concentration of acetaldehyde occurring in the blood may be 5 to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of alcohol alone.

Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood produces a complex of highly unpleasant symptoms referred to hereinafter as the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. This reaction, which is proportional to the dosage of both disulfiram and alcohol, will persist as long as alcohol is being metabolized. Disulfiram does not appear to influence the rate of alcohol elimination from the body.

Disulfiram is absorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated slowly from the body. One (or even two) weeks after a patient has taken his last dose of disulfiram, ingestion of alcohol may produce unpleasant symptoms.

Prolonged administration of disulfiram does not produce tolerance; the longer a patient remains on therapy, the more exquisitely sensitive he becomes to alcohol.

### Cell-to-cell and organ-to-organ crosstalk in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease [^e24169f4]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatocytes

Alcohol metabolism predominantly occurs in the liver, where key enzymes such as ADH1, CYP2E1, catalase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) are responsible for converting alcohol into acetaldehyde and then into acetate. This metabolic process generates ROS and shifts the cellular NAD+/NADH ratio by increasing NADH levels, leading to a reduction in NAD+, a crucial cofactor in numerous metabolic pathways. This imbalance promotes hepatic steatosis, as the excess NADH favours fatty acid synthesis over oxidation.

The increased metabolic activity in the liver during ethanol breakdown also results in higher oxygen consumption, especially in the pericentral zone of the liver lobule, where oxygen tension is already lower. This localised hypoxia exacerbates liver damage by generating additional ROS, which further impairs mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, while simultaneously upregulating genes involved in lipid synthesis.

Acetaldehyde, a highly reactive intermediate produced during alcohol metabolism, compounds liver injury by forming adducts with proteins, DNA and lipids. These acetaldehyde-protein and acetaldehyde-DNA adducts disrupt cellular functions by inhibiting DNA repair, protein synthesis and enzymatic activities, thereby triggering oxidative stress and inflammation. Acetaldehyde also depletes glutathione, a critical antioxidant in hepatocytes, rendering them more vulnerable to ROS-induced damage. Moreover, acetaldehyde acts as a signalling molecule that activates HSCs, contributing to liver fibrosis.

The oxidative stress induced by ROS causes direct hepatocellular damage and leads to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These DAMPs activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors, which initiate inflammatory responses and recruit immune cells to the site of injury. In particular, HMGB1 has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALD. Studies have demonstrated that hepatocyte-specific knockout of HMGB1 ameliorates alcohol-induced liver injury, highlighting its importance in promoting liver inflammation. Similarly, TLR4 signalling within hepatocytes has been implicated in ALD progression. Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of TLR4 exhibit reduced steatosis and inflammation following chronic or acute ethanol exposure.

### Acute obtundation in a 9-month-old patient: ethanol ingestion [^3727e874]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Alcohol ingestion in the pediatric patient can be life threatening. Younger patients consume larger volumes per body weight with accidental ingestions, and children have more serious adverse effects at lower blood alcohol levels. Complications of alcohol poisoning can include hypothermia, hypoglycemia, seizures, coma, and death. We present the course of a 9-month-old female infant who became unresponsive at home and presented to the emergency department comatose. When her blood alcohol level registered 489 mg/dL, it was revealed that she had accidentally been given a bottle of formula mixed with vodka rather than water. The infant required intubation for severely depressed level of consciousness and aggressive fluid resuscitation for hemodynamic instability. She had a peak lactate level of 24 mmol/L and a peak blood alcohol level of 524 mg/dL. Based on the severity of her initial presentation, preparations were made for hemodialysis. The infant responded to supportive measures including mechanical ventilation, fluids, and dextrose, and hemodialysis was not necessary. Her alcohol clearance followed zero-order kinetics at an average rate of 28.6 mg/dL per hour over 15.5 hours from her peak level of 524 mg/dL to the lowest measured value of 80 mg/dL. The kinetics of ethanol clearance at this level of toxicity, which is the highest reported in an infant to date, enhance our knowledge of ethanol metabolism and will assist in management decisions in cases of severe intoxication.

Panel
Alcohol, acetaldehyde, and the east Asian flushing syndrome

The major clearance pathway for blood alcohol is that an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), mainly ADH1, oxidises it to acetaldehyde, which causes discomfort at sufficient concentrations. An aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), mainly ALDH2, then detoxifies the acetaldehyde (oxidising it to acetate, which does not cause discomfort). Fast clearance of alcohol or, particularly, slow breakdown of acetaldehyde can cause individuals to limit alcohol intake.

In African and European populations, acetaldehyde is broken down quickly enough to maintain tolerably low concentrations in drinkers. In east Asian populations, there is a common loss-of-function variant of the ALDH2 gene on chromosome 12 (rs671). Even a single copy decreases acetaldehyde breakdown enough for the concentration to become uncomfortably high after drinking alcohol. This variant is an important determinant of the east Asian flushing reaction to alcohol, and of alcohol intake. Less importantly, a genetic variant of the ADH1B gene on chromosome 4 (rs1229984) that is common in east Asia increases alcohol clearance rates. Together, these two single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly affect alcohol exposure (table 1), and each has been shown to decrease substantially the incidence of alcoholism.

Both variants involve a G→A mutation, with the A allele decreasing alcohol exposure. Each variant has three possible genotypes, AA, AG, and GG, so the two variants define nine possible genotypes. Alcohol intake is affected more by the decreased rate of breakdown of acetaldehyde than by the increased alcohol clearance rate. Hence, when describing these nine genotypes the rs671 genotype is given first and the rs1229984 genotype second, and alphabetic order corresponds to increasing alcohol intake: AA/AA, AA/AG, AA/GG; then AG/AA, AG/AG, AG/GG; then GG/AA, GG/AG, GG/GG.

Table 1
Two east Asian genetic variants that alter alcohol metabolism

The ALDH2 -rs671 variant, which is common only in east Asian populations, greatly slows acetaldehyde breakdown, and the resulting accumulation of acetaldehyde can cause severe discomfort that strongly reduces alcohol intake. Studies of this variant have confirmed the trial evidence that alcohol causally affects blood pressure and some other physiological traits. A less important genetic variant, ADH1B -rs1229984, accelerates alcohol conversion to acetaldehyde and reduces alcohol intake.

### Validation and characterisation of a DNA methylation alcohol biomarker across the life course [^c26599c4]. Clinical Epigenetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use and misuse are responsible for a large proportion of the global burden of disease; however, measuring alcohol exposure in epidemiological studies presents a number of challenges. Self-reported alcohol intake is the most commonly used source of information, but such measurements are fraught with both error and bias, and generally underestimate exposure. The latter is often more pronounced at higher levels of exposure as heavy drinkers can lose track of their intake or differentially under-report their consumption compared to light drinkers, which may result in an overestimation of the effects of alcohol and an underestimation of the burden of disease. Similar bias can occur in retrospective studies where the quality of self-reported alcohol use can vary between cases and controls.

Objective biomarkers of alcohol intake are useful tools for epidemiology and public health because they have the potential to improve exposure assessment, especially when reporting bias may be a major issue, and inform screening and risk prediction strategies. Currently, alcohol biomarkers exist for exposure assessment over short-term windows (e.g. breathalysers in toxicology) or at high doses (e.g. liver enzymes and other blood-based laboratory markers for excessive alcohol use). What is lacking is a reliable biomarker reflecting the distribution of alcohol intake across the range observed in the general population and that is capable of capturing exposure over months and years.

### Accidental acute alcohol intoxication in infants: review and case report [^92e817d4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute alcohol intoxication in children younger than 18 months old is both rarely documented and rarely fatal. Previous case reports suggest hypoglycemia and faster than normal rates of alcohol elimination found in children with acute alcohol intoxication compared with adults, but data are lacking.

Case Report

A 2-month-old infant presented with a decreased mental status after accidental ingestion of alcohol. He was diagnosed with acute alcohol intoxication, with a blood alcohol level of 330 mg/dL and was hyperglycemic (167 mg/dL). Alcohol elimination rate was calculated to be 21.6 mg/dL/h, similar to that in adults. To our knowledge, this case is the second youngest documented patient with accidental alcohol intoxication via ingestion in the United States. We present a rare case report of acute alcohol intoxication in an infant and a review of the literature. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although rare in the literature, poison control data suggests that alcohol poisoning in very young children is not rare. Emergency physicians should be prepared for the management of infants with alcohol poisoning. This case report and review brings attention to this subject and briefly discusses ethanol metabolism in infants.

### Oxidants and antioxidants in alcohol-induced liver disease [^e5da2cce]. Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Although there are numerous experimental data indicating that oxidative stress plays a role in the initiation and progression of alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD), this work has yet to translate into an accepted antioxidant therapy for ALD in humans. With a better understanding of the mechanisms by which oxidative stress leads to liver damage during alcohol exposure, therapies that are more targeted at the cellular/molecular level may be applied in the clinic with potentially greater success. This article discusses the general concepts of oxidative stress and how it relates to current hypotheses in alcohol-induced liver injury, as well as lists several key questions that remain to be addressed in this field: (1) Which prooxidants are involved in ALD? (2) What are the sources of prooxidants in the liver during alcohol exposure? (3) How are oxidants involved in alcohol-induced liver injury? (4) Can a rational and effective antioxidant therapy against ALD be developed?

### Allelic variation at alcohol metabolism genes (ADH1B, ADH1C, ALDH2) and alcohol dependence in an American Indian population [^d2ff9f07]. Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Enzymes encoded by two gene families, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), mediate alcohol metabolism in humans. Allelic variants have been identified that alter metabolic rates and influence risk for alcoholism. Specifically, ADH1B✱47His (previously ADH2-2) and ALDH2-2 have been shown to confer protection against alcoholism, presumably through accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood and a resultant 'flushing response' to alcohol consumption. In the current study, variants at ADH1B (previously ADH2), ADH1C (previously ADH3), and ALDH2 were assayed in DNA extracts from participants belonging to a Southwest American Indian tribe (n = 490) with a high prevalence of alcoholism. Each subject underwent a clinical interview for diagnosis of alcohol dependence, as well as evaluation of intermediate phenotypes such as binge drinking and flushing response to alcohol consumption. Detailed haplotypes were constructed and tested against alcohol dependence and related intermediate phenotypes using both association and linkage analysis. ADH and ALDH variants were also assayed in three Asian and one African population (no clinical data) in order to provide an evolutionary context for the haplotype data. Both linkage and association analysis identified several ADH1C alleles and a neighboring microsatellite marker that affected risk of alcohol dependence and were also related to binge drinking. These data strengthen the support for ADH as a candidate locus for alcohol dependence and suggest further productive study.

### Genetics of alcoholism [^423b00fc]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Alcohol use and alcohol use disorders are substantially heritable. Variants in genes coding for alcohol metabolic enzymes have long been known to influence consumption. More recent studies in family-based samples have implicated GABRA2, nicotinic receptor genes such as CHRNB3, and a number of other specific single genes as associated with alcohol use disorders. The growing use of genetic analyses, in particular studies using polygenic risk scores; neurobiologic pathways; and methods for quantifying gene × gene and gene × environment interactions have also contributed to an evolving understanding of the genetic architecture of alcohol use disorders. Additionally, the study of behavioral traits associated with alcohol dependence such as impulsivity and sensation seeking, and the influences of demographic factors (i.e., sex and ethnicity) have significantly enhanced the genetics of alcoholism literature. This article provides a brief overview of the current topically relevant findings in the field to date and includes areas of research still requiring attention.

### The genetics of alcohol dependence [^feda6355]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Alcohol dependence is a common, complex disorder, which affects millions of people worldwide and causes considerable burden in terms of interpersonal and societal costs. Family, twin, and adoption studies have convincingly demonstrated that genes play an important role in the development of alcohol dependence, with heritability estimates in the range of 50% to 60% for both men and women. A number of studies are under way to identify specific genes involved in the predisposition toward alcohol dependence, and there is reason to be enthusiastic about recent progress. Several associated susceptibility genes are reviewed here, including genes involved in alcohol metabolism, as well as genes involved in GABAergic, endogenous opioid, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic transmission. The next challenge will be to further characterize the risk associated with these susceptibility genes, examining how they may be related to comorbid disorders, developmental trajectories of risk, and potential moderation by environmental factors.

### Mefloquine hydrochloride [^97de8df7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mefloquine crosses the placenta. Excretion into breast milk appears to be minimal (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).

Metabolism: Mefloquine is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system. In vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggested that CYP3A4 is the major isoform involved.

Two metabolites of mefloquine have been identified in humans. The main metabolite, 2,8- bis -trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid, is inactive in Plasmodium falciparum. In a study in healthy volunteers, the carboxylic acid metabolite appeared in plasma 2 to 4 hours after a single oral dose. Maximum plasma concentrations of the metabolite, which were about 50% higher than those of mefloquine, were reached after 2 weeks. Thereafter, plasma levels of the main metabolite and mefloquine declined at a similar rate. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of the main metabolite was 3 to 5 times larger than that of the parent drug. The other metabolite, an alcohol, was present in minute quantities only.

Elimination: In several studies in healthy adults, the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine varied between 2 and 4 weeks, with an average of about 3 weeks. Total clearance, which is essentially hepatic, is in the order of 30 mL/min. There is evidence that mefloquine is excreted mainly in the bile and feces. In volunteers, urinary excretion of unchanged mefloquine and its main metabolite under steady-state condition accounted for about 9% and 4% of the dose, respectively. Concentrations of other metabolites could not be measured in the urine.

Exceptions to fasting for healthy adults undergoing resting metabolic rate (RMR) measurement — if a seven-hour fast is not clinically feasible, the RDN should instruct the individual that a small meal (300kcal or less) may be consumed four hours prior to the measurement, and one study reported that the TEF, when consuming approximately 300kcal, was negligible after 3.5 hours post-consumption in healthy adults. Clinical judgment is needed to determine if fasting is contraindicated, these recommendations do not address the effect of alcohol, non-caloric beverages or water on RMR, independent of meals, these recommendations do not consider the effect of continuous feeding, macronutrient composition, overeating, etc. on RMR, clinical judgment should be used in applying these recommendations to healthy children and non-critically ill children and adults, and an overnight fast is preferred.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction and liver disease: role, relevance, and potential for therapeutic modulation [^7db271ab]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease

Mitochondrial dysfunction in alcohol-related liver disease

Mitochondria play a key role in alcohol metabolism. Alcohol is metabolised to acetaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), CYP2E1 and catalase. Acetaldehyde is then detoxified to acetate via mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). ADH and ALDH2 both require NAD + to act as a hydrogen acceptor in the oxidation of alcohol and acetaldehyde, respectively. In conditions of increased alcohol exposure, the cell ratio of NADH/NAD + is increased (Figure 2).NADH must be recycled to NAD + to allow ongoing metabolism of alcohol and acetaldehyde. This occurs through electron donation to the ETC. Hepatocyte mitochondria are found to respond to acute exposure to alcohol with an adaptive metabolic response termed the swift increase in alcohol metabolism, which shifts mitochondria function from oxidation phosphorylation to rapid cycling of NADH to NAD + to facilitate alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolism. This is shown by an increase in oxygen consumption with a reduction in ATP production. Alcohol-stimulated increase in mitochondrial metabolism can lead to mitochondrial stress and dysfunction.

Figure 2.
Hepatocyte mitochondrial dysfunction reported in alcohol-related liver disease models and human tissue. Ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde via ADH, then via mitochondrial ALDH2 to acetate. This process reduces NAD + to NADH and increases the NADH/NAD + ratio within the cell. NADH is oxidised to NAD + within the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Alcohol boluses are associated with increase mitochondrial ROS production, which is associated with mtDNA damage. Impaired complex I–V function is reported with reduction in mitochondrial polarisation (ΔΨm) and ATP production. Alcohol exposure is associated with upregulation of MCU and increased mitochondrial calcium uptake. Increased mitochondrial fission is reported as well as increased fusion resulting in large megamitochondrion. Upregulation of mitochondrial fusion is associated with a more favourable outcome. Removal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy is impaired.

### All cause mortality and the case for age specific alcohol consumption guidelines: pooled analyses of up to 10 population based cohorts [^b63158ce]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Physiological changes to the aging body are understood to adversely affect the timely elimination of blood ethanol after consumption, with decreases in body water, hepatic function, and blood flow all implicated. Given the increased duration and peak concentration of blood ethanol that may be experienced by drinkers of advancing age, increasing consumption among older populations presents an area of potential public health concern. This is especially so given age related increases in morbidities known to be worsened in response to alcohol use, as well as age related increases in the use of prescription drugs potentially contraindicated with alcohol. Although potentially the product of a lag effect from drinking over the limits earlier in life, the number of alcohol related hospital admissions and wholly attributable deaths are greatest among older age groups.

Taken together, such factors suggest that older populations may benefit most from a reduction in alcohol consumption. In response, the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists recently advised a reduction in the recommended limits for those aged 65 years or more, from 21 units (about 165.9 g of ethanol) per week for men and 14 units (110.6 g) per week for women, to 11 units (86.9 g) per week or 1.5 units per day for both men and women aged 65 years or more. Evidence underpinning such an age specific threshold is, however, lacking.

### The relationship between different dimensions of alcohol use and the burden of disease-an update [^32fc4c8c]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

The increase in the risk of developing cancer (stratified by cancer site) for increasing average daily amounts of alcohol consumed (measured in grams of pure alcohol consumed per day) has been observed to be linear on an exponentiated scale; however, the magnitude of these risk increases varies by cancer site 169, 170, 171. Furthermore, as with other diseases related causally to alcohol consumption, the relative risks for cancer are dependent upon the systematic search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, reference group (and if this includes former drinkers) of the underlying studies 172, 173, 174, use of case–control and/or cohort studies 175 and use of categorical or continuous estimates for alcohol consumption 169 (for relative risk graphs see 176 and Supporting information, Appendix S2).

No threshold for the effects of alcohol use on the risk of cancer has been detected; however, especially for breast cancer, there is ample evidence of alcohol's effects even at low levels of average consumption 177, 178, 179. This results in a large breast cancer burden from relatively low doses (< 21 g per day) of alcohol 179. Furthermore, there is currently not enough epidemiological evidence to assess if the pattern of alcohol consumption modifies the risk of breast cancer 151. The main biological pathway seems to be through overall tissue exposure to acetaldehyde, which may not be affected by drinking patterns; however, through modifications of insulin‐like growth factor (IGF) serum levels, drinking patterns may have an effect on the risk of developing breast cancer (as well as other cancers, where modifications to IGF serum levels play a role 180).

### Increased rate of tolbutamide metabolism in alcoholic patients… [^a4b51dee]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In a controlled human study the biological half-life of tolbutamide was found to be reduced more than twofold in alcoholic patients. We suggest that this effect is the result of stimulation by alcohol of a hepatic microsomal enzyme system in the human liver responsible for the metabolism of tolbutamide. The metabolism of other therapeutic agents could be similarly affected by alcohol, and this might lead to irregularities in response to drug treatment. Kater RMH, Tobon F, Iber FL. Increased Rate of Tolbutamide Metabolism in Alcoholic Patients. JAMA. 1969; 207: 363–365.

### Fomepizole [^f851102f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action:

Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Alcohol dehydrogenase also catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites.

Ethylene glycol, the main component of most antifreezes and coolants, is metabolized to glycoaldehyde, which undergoes subsequent sequential oxidations to yield glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. Glycolate and oxalate are the metabolic byproducts primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and renal damage seen in ethylene glycol toxicosis. The lethal dose of ethylene glycol in humans is approximately 1.4mL/kg.

Methanol, the main component of windshield wiper fluid, is slowly metabolized via alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde with subsequent oxidation via formaldehyde dehydrogenase to yield formic acid. Formic acid is primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances (e.g., decreased visual acuity and potential blindness) associated with methanol poisoning. A lethal dose of methanol in humans is approximately 1 to 2mL/kg.

Fomepizole has been shown in vitro to block alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity in dog, monkey, and human liver. The concentration of fomepizole at which alcohol dehydrogenase is inhibited by 50% in vitro is approximately 0.1µmol/L.

In a study of dogs given a lethal dose of ethylene glycol, three animals each were administered fomepizole, ethanol, or left untreated (control group). The three animals in the untreated group became progressively obtunded, moribund, and died. At necropsy, all three dogs had severe renal tubular damage. Fomepizole or ethanol, given 3 hours after ethylene glycol ingestion, attenuated the metabolic acidosis and prevented the renal tubular damage associated with ethylene glycol intoxication.

Several studies have demonstrated that fomepizole plasma concentrations of approximately 10 µmol/L (0.82 mg/L) in monkeys are sufficient to inhibit methanol metabolism to formate, which is also mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase. Based on these results, concentrations of fomepizole in humans in the range of 100 to 300 µmol/L (8.6 to 24.6 mg/L) have been targeted to assure adequate plasma concentrations for the effective inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase.

In healthy volunteers, oral doses of fomepizole (10 to 20 mg/kg) significantly reduced the rate of elimination of moderate doses of ethanol, which is also metabolized through the action of alcohol dehydrogenase (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^429aa131]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcohol consumption thresholds in suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — By definition, NAFLD indicates the lack of evidence for ongoing or recent consumption of significant amounts of alcohol. For NASH clinical trials eligibility, significant alcohol consumption was recommended as > 21 standard drinks per week in men and > 14 standard drinks per week in women over a 2-year period preceding baseline liver histology, and a standard alcoholic drink contains about 14 g of pure alcohol. Ongoing or recent alcohol consumption > 21 standard drinks on average per week in men and > 14 standard drinks on average per week in women is a reasonable threshold for significant alcohol consumption when evaluating patients with suspected NAFLD.

### Blood alcohol levels for American Indian mothers and newborns [^80a86051]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Very little is known about the alcohol elimination rates of newborns who have had chronic alcohol exposure in utero. In these case reports, blood alcohol levels were taken immediately before delivery, at delivery, and postdelivery for 2 mothers who drank alcohol during their pregnancies and 3 single-birth newborns. Newborn A1 of Mother A had no physical characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The initial blood alcohol level for this newborn was 38.4 mg/dL 129 minutes after birth, with a subsequent blood alcohol level of 5.5 mg/dL 304 minutes after delivery, resulting in an alcohol elimination rate of 11.3 mg/dL per hour. The blood alcohol level for Mother A was 87.4 mg/dL 66 minutes before delivery. Newborn A2 of mother A had FAS. Sixty minutes after delivery, the blood alcohol level for this newborn was 39.5 mg/dL, and the alcohol level of the mother was 42.1 mg/dL. Newborn B1 of mother B had FAS. At 67 minutes after birth, newborn B1 had a blood alcohol level of 246.5 mg/dL, which dropped to 178.7 mg/dL 302 minutes after birth, resulting in an alcohol elimination rate of 17.3 mg/dL per hour. This alcohol elimination rate is within the metabolism range (15–49 mg/dL per hour) of adults with alcoholism. The maternal blood alcohol level was 265.9 mg/dL 27 minutes before delivery. Blood alcohol levels drawn on both the mother and newborn at delivery and 2 or 3 hourly follow-up levels can provide evidence that fetal alcohol dehydrogenase activity is induced by chronic maternal alcohol use.

### Italy's health performance, 1990–2017: findings from the global burden of disease study 2017 [^fcf42091]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Table 4
Age-standardised life expectancy and HALE at birth and at age 65 years in 1990 and 2017, both sexes combined, for Italy and selected western European countries (EU15)

In terms of life expectancy and HALE at age 65 years, in 2017 Italy ranked third highest among the EU15, just after France and Spain, and seventh for life expectancy and eighth for HALE globally (data not shown). In 2017, life expectancy in Italy at age 65 years was 21.0 years (95% UI 20.7–21.3), an increase of more than 3.5 years compared with 1990 (table 4).

Looking at risk factor categories attributed to DALYs, a similar distribution is seen for Italy as for the other EU15 countries (appendix p7). Magnitude and time trends of the burden attributable to the three main Level 1 categories of risk (environmental and occupational, behavioural, metabolic), in terms of DALY rates, are similar between Italy and the average of the EU15 countries (appendix p 8), with slightly higher than average levels of metabolic and environmental risks compensated by lower levels of behavioural risks. Behavioural risks attributable to DALY rates in Italy had consistently less of an effect between 1990 and 2017, while metabolic, environmental, and occupational risks had more of an effect than the average of the GBD region of western Europe (appendix p 8). In particular, the burden on DALY rates attributable to alcohol use decreased in Italy by 60.7% (95% UI −75.6 to −42.0) from 1990 to 2017, whereas in western Europe it decreased by 37.5% (−46.2 to −28.5).

### Disulfiram (Antabuse) [^d5e48524]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:

Disulfiram produces a sensitivity to alcohol which results in a highly unpleasant reaction when the patient under treatment ingests even small amounts of alcohol.

Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage. During alcohol metabolism following disulfiram intake, the concentration of acetaldehyde occurring in the blood may be 5 to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of alcohol alone.

Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood produces a complex of highly unpleasant symptoms referred to hereinafter as the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. This reaction, which is proportional to the dosage of both disulfiram and alcohol, will persist as long as alcohol is being metabolized. Disulfiram does not appear to influence the rate of alcohol elimination from the body.

Disulfiram is absorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated slowly from the body. One (or even two) weeks after a patient has taken his last dose of disulfiram, ingestion of alcohol may produce unpleasant symptoms.

Prolonged administration of disulfiram does not produce tolerance; the longer a patient remains on therapy, the more exquisitely sensitive he becomes to alcohol.

### Alcohol and mitochondria: a dysfunctional relationship [^53317a71]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Mitochondria are intimately involved in the generation of and defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are themselves targets of oxidative stress and also contribute to mechanisms by which oxidative stress-related signals control cell fate. Ethanol promotes oxidative stress, both by increasing ROS formation and by decreasing cellular defense mechanisms. These effects of ethanol are prominent in the liver, the major site of ethanol metabolism in the body. The question remains to what extent this contributes to ethanol-dependent tissue damage or the susceptibility of cells to other stressors. In this review, we consider how mitochondrial actions of ethanol influence oxidative stress management of liver cells. Mitochondrial electron transport constitutes the major intracellular source of ROS, and ethanol treatment imposes conditions that promote ROS formation by mitochondria, the effects of which may be enhanced by a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative stress defenses. A significant target of ethanol-related increases in oxidative stress is mitochondrial DNA. Ethanol-induced damage to mitochondrial DNA, if not adequately repaired, impairs mitochondrial function, which further increases oxidative stress in the cell, leading to a vicious cycle of accumulating cell damage that is more apparent with advancing age. Uncontrolled mitochondrial formation of ROS promotes the inappropriate activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition, increasing the sensitivity of cells to other pro-apoptotic or damage signals. In combination with ethanol-induced defects in mitochondrial function, these alterations may promote both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in response to otherwise benign or beneficial challenges and contribute to the onset or progression of alcohol-induced liver diseases.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^9a67155b]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD alcohol intake classification and monitoring — Alcohol use can be an important contributor to fatty liver disease progression and should be quantified in all patients, with intake classified as mild (up to 20 g (women) and 30 g (men) per day), moderate (21–39 g (women) and 31–59 g (men) per day), or heavy (≥ 40 g (women) and ≥ 60 g (men) per day); moderate alcohol use increases the probability of advanced fibrosis, particularly in patients with obesity or T2DM, heavy alcohol consumption accelerates liver injury and fibrosis progression and should be avoided in patients with NAFLD/NASH, and moderate alcohol use (defined broadly as > 20 g/d) has been associated with less improvement in steatosis and AST and lower odds of NASH resolution, with daily alcohol potentially increasing risks for extrahepatic malignancies and HCC and with substantial variability in individual susceptibility and uncertainty about dose thresholds, indicating that the impact of alcohol use characteristics on the natural history of NAFLD/NASH requires further investigation.

### Alcohol and the liver [^6e639e36]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To update the reader with advances in epidemiology, genetics, detection, pathogenesis and therapy of alcohol-related liver disease.

Recent Findings

Ill-health due to alcohol abuse is improving in some nations but deteriorating in others. Oxidative and nitrosative stress are key to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease, and there is now greater emphasis than previously on their development and role of cytochrome P450 2E1, on mitochondrial stress and disruption, (including elucidation of mitochondrial protection mechanisms) disturbance of signaling pathways and involvement of extrahepatic mediators like adiponectin. Treatment of alcoholic liver disease has stagnated, but transplantation is still favored and debated for end-stage cirrhosis.

Summary

Basic and clinical research into the mechanisms of alcoholic liver disease is making headway, but has yet to produce safe and effective therapies for alcoholic hepatitis and for reversing cirrhosis.

### Acetate reprograms gut microbiota during alcohol consumption [^bdb6793a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol-related liver disease is among the most prevalent liver diseases in the United States and Europe. Excessive alcohol consumption causes a range of liver injuries, progressing from steatosis, to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis. During alcohol consumption, alcohol is rapidly absorbed by diffusion, mainly in the upper gastrointestinal tract and then enters the liver via the portal vein. The effect of alcohol on the distal small intestine and colon largely comes from circulatory alcohol during the equilibration process between the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and vascular space. Alcohol consumption has been shown to alter the stool microbiota composition, and function, but how relatively small concentrations of ethanol in the large intestine cause the profound changes of the stool microbiota with which they have been associated is currently poorly understood.

Ethanol is predominantly metabolized in hepatocytes, where alcohol dehydrogenase converts it to acetaldehyde, then acetaldehyde dehydrogenase further metabolizes it to acetate. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase plays a key role in determining peripheral acetaldehyde levels. A systemic increase of acetate, but not acetaldehyde, has been observed after alcohol intake in humans. Ethanol can also be metabolized into acetaldehyde by cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily e, polypeptide 1 (Cyp2e1), associated with production of radical oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Although most alcohol metabolism occurs in hepatocytes, the intestinal mucosa also expresses enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism of alcohol. This is of particular interest, as we recently demonstrated that ethanol-feeding increases intestinal acetate levels.

Methods

A 22-year-old woman drank 144.1 g of alcohol over 8.25 hours at work. Precise details of her drinking (time, volume, and alcohol content) were provided. At her shift's end, her supervisor allowed her to drive home, during which time she caused the death of another driver. Her blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 2.20 g/L, tested a few hours later. She did not drink alcohol after her work discharge. The decedent's family sued her employer for failure to recognize intoxication. An expert was engaged to perform both theoretical and retrograde BAC estimates based on consumption and the reported BAC, respectively.

Results

Blood alcohol concentration calculations require use of the volume of distribution and the alcohol metabolism rate. The Academy Standards Board recommends reporting a range of BAC calculations. The theoretical and retrograde calculations in this case largely matched each other, suggesting that the driver did not drink after work. Due to the long interval between alcohol intake and her work dismissal, the theoretical calculation produced a wide BAC range (1.4–4.6 g/L). The retrograde calculation range was tighter (2.6–3.1 g/L).

Discussion

A prolonged duration between drinking and testing produces a range of BAC results that can cause ambiguities in legal proceedings.

Abstract

Introduction

Toxicologists defend alcohol testing from their laboratories for medicolegal cases.

Methods

A 22-year-old woman drank 144.1 g of alcohol over 8.25 hours at work. Precise details of her drinking (time, volume, and alcohol content) were provided. At her shift's end, her supervisor allowed her to drive home, during which time she caused the death of another driver. Her blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 2.20 g/L, tested a few hours later. She did not drink alcohol after her work discharge. The decedent's family sued her employer for failure to recognize intoxication. An expert was engaged to perform both theoretical and retrograde BAC estimates based on consumption and the reported BAC, respectively.

Results

Blood alcohol concentration calculations require use of the volume of distribution and the alcohol metabolism rate. The Academy Standards Board recommends reporting a range of BAC calculations. The theoretical and retrograde calculations in this case largely matched each other, suggesting that the driver did not drink after work. Due to the long interval between alcohol intake and her work dismissal, the theoretical calculation produced a wide BAC range (1.4–4.6 g/L). The retrograde calculation range was tighter (2.6–3.1 g/L).

Discussion

Alcohol-related risk patterns and epidemiology — It is estimated that only 10%–20% of individuals with chronic heavy alcohol use develop cirrhosis; binge drinking is reported in 26% of individuals aged 18 years or older in the United States; women are at a higher risk for ALD at a lower daily intake of alcohol compared with men; and binge drinking in patients with underlying metabolic syndrome has been associated with higher likelihood of cirrhosis.

### Mendelian randomization analysis in three Japanese populations supports a causal role of alcohol consumption in lowering low-density lipid cholesterol levels and particle numbers [^7ba156de]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

While alcohol consumption is known to increase plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, its relationship with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels is unclear. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a rate-controlling enzyme in alcohol metabolism, but a large number of Japanese people have the inactive allele. Here, we conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis using the ALDH2 genotype to clarify a causal role of alcohol on circulating cholesterol levels and lipoprotein particle numbers.

Methods

This study was conducted in three independent general Japanese populations (men, n = 2289; women, n = 1940; mean age 63.3 ± 11.2 years). Alcohol consumption was assessed using a questionnaire. Lipoprotein particle numbers were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Results

Alcohol consumption increased linearly in proportion to the number of subjects carrying the enzymatically active *1 allele in men (p < 0.001). The *1 allele was also positively associated with HDL cholesterol level (adjusted mean ± standard error, *1*1: 60 ± 0.5, *1*2: 56 ± 0.6, *2*2: 55 ± 1.3 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and inversely associated with LDL cholesterol level (116 ± 0.9, 124 ± 1.1, 130 ± 2.6 mg/dl, p < 0.001). The *1 allele was also positively associated with HDL particle numbers (per-allele: 2.60 ± 0.32 μmol/l, p < 0.001) and inversely associated with LDL particle numbers (-67.8 ± 19.6 nmol/l, p = 0.001). Additional Mendelian randomization analysis failed to clarify the involvement of cholesteryl ester transfer protein in alcohol-related changes in lipoprotein cholesterol levels. No significant association was observed in women, presumably due to their small amount of alcohol intake.

Conclusions

Alcohol consumption has a causal role in not only increasing HDL cholesterol levels but also decreasing LDL cholesterol levels and particle numbers.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^7d7416a0]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Alcohol use is an important preventable and modifiable cause of non‐communicable disease, and has complex effects on the cardiovascular system that vary with dose. Observational and prospective studies have consistently shown a lower risk of cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality in people with low levels of alcohol consumption when compared to abstainers (the 'J'‐shaped curve). Maximum potential benefit occurs at 0.5 to one standard drinks (7–14 g pure ethanol) per day for women (18% lower all‐cause mortality, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 13–22%) and one to two standard drinks (14–28 g ethanol) per day for men (17% lower all‐cause mortality, 95% CI = 15–19%). However, this evidence is contested, and overall the detrimental effects of alcohol far outweigh the beneficial effects, with the risk of premature mortality increasing steadily after an average consumption of 10 g ethanol/day. Blood pressure (BP) is increased by regular alcohol consumption in a dose‐dependent manner, with a relative risk for hypertension (systolic BP > 140 mm Hg or diastolic > 90 mm Hg) of 1.7 for 50 g ethanol/day and 2.5 at 100 g/day. Important reductions in BP readings can be expected after as little as 1 month of abstinence from alcohol. Heavy alcohol consumption in a binge pattern is associated with the development of acute cardiac arrhythmia, even in people with normal heart function. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia associated with chronic high‐volume alcohol intake, and above 14 g alcohol/day the relative risk increases 10% for every extra standard drink (14 g ethanol). Ethanol and its metabolites have toxic effects on cardiac myocytes, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) accounts for a third of all cases of non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Screening people drinking alcohol above low‐volume levels and delivering a brief intervention may prevent the development of cardiovascular complications. Although people with established cardiovascular disease show improved outcomes with a reduction to low‐volume alcohol consumption, there is no safe amount of alcohol to drink and patients with ACM should aim for abstinence in order to optimize medical treatment.

### Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020 [^1fa415f4]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our results are consistent with previous findings at the global level, and at the same time the more nuanced analysis done in this study strongly suggests that statements, guidelines, and recommendations on the optimal level of alcohol consumption need to take into consideration the background rates of diseases and injuries for each population. We provide clear evidence that the level of alcohol consumption that minimises health loss varies significantly across populations and remains zero or very close to zero for several population groups, particularly young adults. At the same time, small amounts of alcohol consumption are associated with improved health outcomes in populations that predominantly face a high burden of cardiovascular diseases, particularly older adults in many world regions. Given these findings, we recommend a modification of existing policy guidelines to focus on emphasising differential optimal consumption levels by age, rather than the current practice of recommending different consumption levels by sex. This study highlights the importance of prioritising interventions targeted at minimising alcohol consumption among young adults.

Importantly, no study to date has examined the variation in the theoretical minimum risk of alcohol consumption by geography, age, sex, and time, conditioned on background rates of disease. National dietary guidelines on low-risk drinking, such as those in the USA, UK, France, and Australia, base recommendations on studies of the risk of alcohol use on all-cause mortality and some cause-specific outcomes. This complicates interpretation of the risk of alcohol use on mortality, given three aspects of all-cause mortality. First, causal pathways between alcohol use and cause-specific outcomes can differ, creating multiple confounding structures that are not readily adjustable when embedded within models analysing the effects of alcohol use on all-cause mortality. Second, all-cause mortality includes non-causally related outcomes, further increasing the threat to internal validity for evidence produced from analysing the effects of alcohol use on all-cause mortality. Third, and most importantly for the present study, the composition of causes within all-cause mortality can differ substantially between populations, changing the proportional risk of mortality due to alcohol use across these populations. In tandem, these features limit the applicability of determining minimum risk exposures on the basis of observational data on alcohol use and all-cause mortality.

### Alcohol and the liver [^de19ba02]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to acquaint the reader with advances in 2006 in the epidemiology, genetics, detection, pathogenesis and treatment of alcoholic liver disease.

Recent Findings

Important discoveries have been made in pathogenesis and mechanism of disease, with great emphasis on the many pathways leading to oxidative stress, and the novel mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress that is proving to be important in the pathogenesis of many liver diseases. The reliability of ethyl glucuronide and other biomarkers for the detection of alcohol abuse is being better established. There have been no treatment advances for alcoholic liver disease but, on balance, steroids are still favored for carefully selected patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Many compounds tested in rodents may now be available for consideration for clinical trials. Criteria for patient selection and refusal for liver transplantation are being established but the 6 months abstinence rule still holds.

Summary

Insights are being made into the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease but safe and effective therapies for both alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis have yet to be discovered.

### Alcohol consumption and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^99c30a32]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In the past two decades, the metabolic syndrome has given rise to much clinical and research interest. The broad overlap of alcohol consumption with different components of metabolic syndrome makes alcohol-metabolic syndrome relationship a controversial topic.

Objectives

To support the evidence available about the relationship between alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome as a comprehensive clinical entity, as well as to identify the gender-specific dose-response, by performing a meta-analysis based on information from published data.

Methods

Manual and computer searches in different bibliographic databases were performed to identify the relevant scientific publications, on the relation between alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome. Alcohol intake was converted into a same unit (g/day) and then categorized using standard classification in order to provide relevant comparisons. Fixed and random effects models were used to aggregate individual odds ratios and to derive pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Fourteen relevant publications were identified on the relation between alcohol consumption and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. 7 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that alcohol consumption of less than 40 g/day in men and 20 g/day in women significantly reduced the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.

Conclusion

"Responsible alcohol intake" appears to be associated with a reduced prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Favorable metabolic effect seemed to be restricted to alcohol consumption of less than 20 g/day among women, and of less than 40 g/day among men. These findings support the actual recommendations regarding alcohol consumption among apparently healthy people.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^d6afe802]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol-related liver disease:

- **Definition**: ALD encompasses a spectrum of disorders that may take an acute form (alcoholic hepatitis) or present as a chronic disease (steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis).
- **Pathophysiology**: ALD is caused by heavy alcohol use.
- **Disease course**: Alcohol abuse results in steatosis followed by steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis due to inflammation, hepatocellular damage, and liver fibrosis. Disease progression may also cause liver decompensation and HCC.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year mortality of ALD as a single group is around 20%.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^4deb5bb0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) burden, risk thresholds, and diagnostic principles are outlined as follows: ALD is "a leading cause of preventable liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, including the United States". Harmful drinking "(≥ 3 drinks/d or ≥ 21/wk in men and ≥ 2 drinks/d or ≥ 14/wk in women) is a risk factor for liver damage and ALD". "The diagnosis of ALD requires identification of chronic, harmful alcohol use, by patient report or detection of alcohol biomarkers, and exclusion of other diseases affecting the liver". Management emphasizes that "Treatment of AUD with achievement of sustained abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression and improve long-term outcomes at any stage of ALD", and "Liver transplantation (LT) remains a definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease due to alcohol-associated cirrhosis and/or HCC".

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: update and impact of new nomenclature on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^34260dc4]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol use thresholds and MetALD classification within MASLD nomenclature — The definition of MASLD excludes patients with consumption of > 20 g/30 g of alcohol per day in females and males, respectively; under the new nomenclature, patients with hepatic steatosis, cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF), and alcohol use at weekly intake of 140–350 g in women and 210–420 g in men or an average daily 20–50 g in women and 30–60 g in men are classified as having MetALD. Clinically, the overlay between ALD and MASLD represents a dynamic spectrum ranging from MASLD predominant at lower alcohol use (weekly intake closer to 140 g in women and 210 g in men) to ALD predominant at higher alcohol use (weekly intake of up to 350 g in women and 420 g in men); these dual-pathology patients are considered to have a dual pathology and should be studied separately, and patients with MetALD should be studied separately as they may have faster disease progression than those with MASLD.

### Sex-specific associations between alcohol consumption and incidence of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^f7353d13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, the results are consistent in showing a dose‐response relationship between level of consumption and risk of hypertension based on observational data, corroborated by randomized controlled trials. For men, there seems to be no lower threshold, whereas for women, the dose‐response seems to emerge only beyond 2 drinks a day. For both sexes, no protective effect could be found (and was not expected given the biological pathways 10). What could explain the differences between men and women? One explanation could be the difference in heavy drinking occasions within an overall average intake of alcohol of less than 2 drinks. An average of 2 drinks/day could be achieved by actually drinking 2 drinks every day, or by drinking 7 drinks each on Saturday and Sunday. The latter has different effects on blood pressure 66 and thus on risk of hypertension. Further research (both observational and experimental) is necessary, however, to ascertain the effects of pattern of drinking (including peak blood alcohol level) on hypertension and thus the repeated plea to include more measures on patterns of drinking into all epidemiological work. 67, 68

### Coordinated action of a gut-liver pathway drives alcohol detoxification and consumption [^e148f2cd]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects millions of people worldwide, causing extensive morbidity and mortality with limited pharmacological treatments. The liver is considered as the principal site for the detoxification of ethanol metabolite, acetaldehyde (AcH), by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and as a target for AUD treatment, however, our recent data indicate that the liver only plays a partial role in clearing systemic AcH. Here we show that a liver-gut axis, rather than liver alone, synergistically drives systemic AcH clearance and voluntary alcohol drinking. Mechanistically, we find that after ethanol intake, a substantial proportion of AcH generated in the liver is excreted via the bile into the gastrointestinal tract where AcH is further metabolized by gut ALDH2. Modulating bile flow significantly affects serum AcH level and drinking behaviour. Thus, combined targeting of liver and gut ALDH2, and manipulation of bile flow and secretion are potential therapeutic strategies to treat AUD.

### A systematic review of the evidence for acute tolerance to alcohol-the "Mellanby effect" [^fc7b1f98]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for "the Mellanby effect", that is, whether the response to a given blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is more marked when BAC is rising than at the same concentration when BAC is falling.

Methods

We systematically searched the databases EMBASE, Medline, and Scopus up to and including December 2016 using text words "tolerance", "ascending", "descending" or "Mellanby" with Medline term "exp *alcohol/" or "exp *drinking behavior/" or equivalent. Articles were identified for further examination by title or abstract; full text articles were retained for analysis if they dealt with acute (within dose) alcohol tolerance in human subjects and provided quantitative data on both the ascending and descending parts of the BAC-time curve. Reference lists of identified works were scanned for other potentially relevant material. We extracted and analyzed data on the subjective and objective assessment of alcohol effects.

Results

We identified and screened 386 unique articles, of which 127 full-text articles were assessed; one provided no qualitative results, 62 involved no human study, 25 did not consider acute tolerance within dose, and 13 failed to provide data on both ascending and descending BAC. We extracted data from the 26 remaining articles. The studies were highly heterogeneous. Most were small, examining a total of 770 subjects, of whom 564 received alcohol and were analyzed in groups of median size 10 (range 5–38), sometimes subdivided on the basis of drinking or family history. Subjects were often young white men. Doses of alcohol and rates of administration differed. Performance was assessed by at least 26 different methods, some of which measured many variables. We examined only results of studies which compared results for a given alcohol concentration (C) measured on the ascending limb (C up) and the descending limb (C down) of the BAC-time curve, whether in paired or parallel-group studies. When subjects were given alcohol in more than one session, we considered results from the first session only. Rating at C down was better than at C up for some measures, as expected if the Mellanby effect were operating. For example, subjects rated themselves less intoxicated on the descending limb than at the same concentration on the ascending limb in 12/13 trials including 229 subjects that gave statistically significant results. In 9 trials with a total of 139 subjects, mean difference could be calculated; weighted for study size, it was 29% [range 24–74%]. Willingness to drive was significantly greater in 4 of 6 studies including a total of 105 subjects; weighted mean difference increased by 207% [range 79–300%]. By contrast, measure of driving ability in three groups of a total of 200 trials in 57 subjects showed worse performance by a weighted mean of 96% [range 3–566%]. In three trials that tested inhibitory control (cued go or no-go response times), weighted mean performance was 30% [range 14–65%] worse on the descending limb.

Conclusions

The "Mellanby effect" has been demonstrated for subjective intoxication and willingness to drive, both of which are more affected at a stated ethanol concentration when BAC is rising than at the same concentration when BAC is falling. By contrast, objective measures of skills necessary for safe driving, such as response to inhibitory cues and skills measured on driving simulators, were generally worse on the descending part of the BAC-time curve for the same BAC.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^ffeb8058]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy

Chronic excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of secondary dilated cardiomyopathy. However, partial or total recovery of cardiac function can occur if the disease is diagnosed early and further alcohol intake is reduced or halted. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) accounts for 33% of all cases of non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy 40, and the prevalence is similar in males and females (alcohol consumption is higher in men, but women are more susceptible to its effects) 41.

Alcohol can lead to excess free‐radical generation and oxidative stress through at least three mechanisms: ethanol metabolism to acetaldehyde and ethyl esters; effects on anti‐oxidant proteins and enzymes; and activation or alteration of neurohormonal systems such as the sympathetic nervous system or the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) 14. Cardiac myocytes are excitable cells with complex signalling structures, and as such are highly sensitive to oxidative stress. Experimental models of chronic heart damage have many limitations, but over time heavy alcohol use directly impairs myocardial function by interfering with calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and the structure and function of contractile proteins 41. Myocyte apoptosis and necrosis occurs, and although there is a low rate of regeneration after cell death, repair mechanisms involving hypertrophy of remaining cells can initially offset the effect of myocyte death 11. However, reduced levels of myofibrillar proteins, combined with the expression of different isoforms of myosin, result in depressed contraction 41. These changes eventually translate into increased left ventricular dilatation and mass, thinning and left ventricular dysfunction 34. Genetic variants in certain proteins/enzymes, variability in nutrition, ethnic and sex differences may also influence the occurrence of ACM 14, 41, 42 (see Fig. 3).
