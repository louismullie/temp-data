## Question

An 84-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of lower back pain and lower extremity weakness for 3 weeks. Over the past week, he has also found it increasingly difficult to urinate. He has a history of prostate cancer, for which he underwent radical prostatectomy 8 years ago. His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was undetectable until a routine follow-up visit last year, when it began to increase from 0.8 ng/mL to its present value of 64.3 ng/mL (N < 4). An MRI of the spine shows infiltrative vertebral lesions with a collapse of the L5 vertebral body, resulting in cord compression at L4–L5. The patient receives one dose of intravenous dexamethasone and subsequently undergoes external beam radiation. Which of the following cellular changes is most likely to occur as a result of this treatment?
A. Formation of pyrimidine dimers
B. Intercalation of neighbouring DNA base pairs
C. Generation of hydroxyl radicals
D. Formation of DNA crosslinks

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cellular change is most likely to occur as a result of external beam radiation therapy for a prostate cancer metastasis causing spinal cord compression, with options including pyrimidine dimers, DNA intercalation, hydroxyl radicals, and DNA crosslinks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental mechanism of ionizing radiation at clinically used energies. Then, I should verify the relative contributions of direct versus indirect DNA damage. Next, I will examine each option against that mechanistic framework. Finally, I will confirm which option best matches the dominant indirect mechanism and why the others are less likely or mechanistically inconsistent with EBRT physics and chemistry [^116pfGHC].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism relevance. External beam radiation therapy in this setting delivers high-energy photons that interact with tissue primarily via the Compton effect, producing energetic electrons and secondary ionizations that drive biological damage; this is the standard framework for clinical radiobiology and applies regardless of tumor histology, including prostate cancer metastases treated for palliation and decompression [^116pfGHC].

> I need to check the balance between direct and indirect DNA damage. Wait, let me verify the dominant pathway at therapeutic photon energies. Most DNA damage from ionizing radiation is indirect, mediated by reactive oxygen species generated when radiation ionizes water, with hydroxyl radicals being the principal species that attack DNA and create strand breaks and base damage; direct ionization of DNA contributes but is less frequent in the cellular milieu, which aligns with textbook radiobiology and mechanistic reviews [^116pfGHC] [^111o3zaR].

> Now, I will examine Option A, pyrimidine dimers. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; pyrimidine dimers are a hallmark of ultraviolet radiation damage, not ionizing radiation. UV creates cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers via excitation of bases, whereas ionizing radiation primarily causes strand breaks and base oxidation rather than cyclobutane dimers; so this option is mechanistically mismatched to EBRT [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option B, intercalation of neighboring DNA base pairs. Hmm, wait a minute, intercalation is a drug-DNA interaction seen with agents like anthracyclines or acridines that slip between base pairs and distort the helix; it is not a recognized mechanism of ionizing radiation, which does not insert planar molecules between base pairs, so this is not the correct answer for EBRT-induced damage [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option C, generation of hydroxyl radicals. Let me think about this carefully. High-energy photons ionize water to produce hydroxyl radicals, which rapidly attack the deoxyribose backbone and bases, producing single- and double-strand breaks and clustered damage; this indirect, ROS-mediated pathway is the predominant mechanism of DNA injury from clinical EBRT and fits the scenario precisely [^116pfGHC] [^111o3zaR].

> Next, I should review Option D, formation of DNA crosslinks. I should double-check whether crosslinks are a primary EBRT effect. While radiation can produce various DNA lesions including rare crosslinks, crosslinking is classically associated with chemotherapeutic alkylating agents rather than being a dominant mechanism of ionizing radiation; thus, among the choices provided, this is less likely than hydroxyl radical–mediated damage as the most characteristic effect of EBRT [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the best answer. The most likely cellular change from external beam radiation in this setting is the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which mediate indirect DNA damage leading to strand breaks and base modifications; this aligns with the Compton-dominated physics and ROS chemistry at therapeutic photon energies and is the mechanistic foundation for radiation's therapeutic effect in metastatic prostate cancer to bone with cord compromise [^116pfGHC] [^111o3zaR].

---

The most likely cellular change from external beam radiation in this patient is **hydroxyl radical generation** [^116pfGHC], which causes DNA damage and cell death via indirect ionization of water [^notfound]. This mechanism underpins radiation's therapeutic effect in metastatic prostate cancer with spinal cord compression [^116kjdDY].

---

## Mechanism of action of external beam radiation therapy

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) delivers high-energy photons that interact with tissue to produce **ionization and free radicals**, predominantly hydroxyl radicals (·OH) from water radiolysis [^116pfGHC]. These radicals rapidly damage DNA, proteins, and membranes, with DNA lesions — single- and double-strand breaks, base damage, and clustered damage — driving lethal effects [^111o3zaR].

---

## Cellular effects of hydroxyl radicals

Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and cause **oxidative DNA damage** — base modifications, abasic sites, and strand breaks — that impair replication and transcription, trigger checkpoint activation, and lead to apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe [^116pfGHC]. This indirect DNA damage is the dominant mechanism of EBRT cytotoxicity [^111o3zaR].

---

## Relevance to prostate cancer metastases

Prostate cancer metastases, including spinal lesions, respond to EBRT via **hydroxyl radical–mediated DNA damage** that induces tumor cell death and reduces pain, improves neurologic function, and lowers skeletal-related events [^115uhydY] [^116vzTiA]. EBRT is a cornerstone of palliative care for symptomatic bone metastases, including cord compression [^114LfMQp] [^115xFqy4].

---

## Comparison with other options

- **Pyrimidine dimers**: UV-induced lesions, not produced by ionizing radiation [^notfound].
- **Intercalation**: A chemotherapy mechanism, not EBRT [^notfound].
- **DNA crosslinks**: Alkylating agents cause crosslinks, not EBRT [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding hydroxyl radical generation clarifies EBRT's therapeutic and adverse effects. Tumor control depends on **ROS-induced DNA damage**, while normal tissue toxicity reflects similar oxidative injury; this underpins dose-fractionation strategies and supportive care [^115uhydY].

---

The most likely cellular change from EBRT in this patient is **hydroxyl radical generation**, which mediates DNA damage and tumor cell death in metastatic prostate cancer with spinal cord compression [^notfound].

### Radiation therapy for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer [^117Eov3E]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Radiation therapy for locally advanced PCa continues to evolve. A current treatment recommendation for nonmetastatic, high-risk disease includes AS combined with RT. The precise duration and sequencing of AS has not been established but most frequently includes treatment in the neoadjuvant, concomitant and, occasionally, adjuvant periods. As technology allows higher doses without significant increases in morbidity and as clinical data provide proof of a radiation dose response, RT doses continue to escalate. The goal of therapy for metastatic disease continues to focus on the relief of pain and the improvement in quality of life. Multiple studies document the significant role RT plays in achieving these goals. Focal RT and systemic radioisotopes have become the mainstay of management in this patient group and the development of newer isotopes that cause less marrow toxicity will improve the therapeutic ratio and provide an opportunity for their use with systemic chemotherapy. As molecular and genomic technologies advance, directed targeting of critical cellular radiation-response pathways hold the promise of improved radiation response and individualized, tailored therapy.

Despite highly successful treatments for localized prostate cancer, approximately 35% to 40% of men will eventually experience a detectable rise in serum prostate specific antigen. A portion of these men will go on to experience clinically expressed extracapsular disease, with as many as two-thirds having evidence of bone involvement. Diagnosis of skeletal involvement involves serum markers of disease progression and radiological evaluation. Skeletal-related events are numerous and include bone pain, spinal cord compression, vertebral collapse, and pathological fractures. Current treatments for advanced prostate cancer include individual or combined hormonal therapies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical treatments, and most recently, antiresorptive medications.

indication to stop treatment

The panel stressed the fact that treatments with a proven survival benefit should in general not be stopped for PSA progression alone (in the absence of radiographic or clinical progression). There was consensus (82% of the panel) that at least two of three criteria (PSA progression, radiographic progression and clinical deterioration) should be fulfilled to stop treatment. In the case of unequivocal progression of visceral disease without clinical deterioration or PSA progression, treatment should be stopped and a biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary malignancy or small-cell histology. In case of significant clinical progression that is very likely related to disease without a rise in PSA or radiographic progression, treatment should be changed. It should be recognised that men with CRPC can often have worsening bone pain related to non-malignant processes such as degenerative disorders or osteoporotic fractures. Similarly, fatigue/asthenia can be a side-effect of treatment and may therefore not be a sign of disease progression.

use of osteoclast-targeted agents for reducing risk of SREs and SSEs in men with CRPC

In men with CRPC and bone metastases, two agents (zoledronic acid and denosumab) have been approved for reducing risk of SREs defined as: radiation to the bone, surgery to the bone, fractures, spinal cord compression and (for zoledronic acid only) change in antineoplastic therapy. In the pivotal trial by Saad et al. zoledronic acid was given at a dose of 4 mg every 3 weeks for a total of 20 cycles (15 months) with an option to continue for an additional 9 months extension (24 months). It is of note that the trial included a third arm using 8 mg every 3 weeks, which was reduced subsequently to 4 mg because of renal toxicity, and this arm did not show significant reduction of SREs compared with controls.

### Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases? [^112d5G9M]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and to investigate whether patients with ≤ 5 lesions had an improved outcome relative to patients with > 5 lesions.

Methods and Materials

The treatment and outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival.

Results

The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p < 0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with ≤ 5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with > 5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with ≤ 5 lesions compared with patients with > 5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, respectively).

Conclusions

Patients with ≤ 5 metastatic sites had significantly better survival rates than patients with > 5 lesions. Because existing sites of metastatic disease may be the primary sites of origin for additional metastases, our findings suggest that early detection and aggressive treatment of patients with a small number of metastatic lesions is worth testing as an approach to improving long-term survival.

### Bone-targeted agents: preventing skeletal complications in prostate cancer [^113tghs5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

In men, prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death. Skeletal complications occur at various points during the disease course, either due to bone metastases directly, or as an unintended consequence of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Bone metastases are associated with pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and bone pain and can require narcotics or palliative radiation for pain relief. ADT results in bone loss and fragility fractures. This review describes the biology of bone metastases, skeletal morbidity, and recent advances in bone-targeted therapies to prevent skeletal complications of prostate cancer.

### Skeletal-related events significantly impact health-related quality of life in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: data from PREVAIL and AFFIRM trials [^112YRczh]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The more pronounced effect of spinal cord compression on HRQoL likely reflects not only its magnitude of effect on HRQoL but also the timing of HRQoL measurement. As HRQoL data is only measured every 12 weeks, SREs may occur up to 3 months beforehand. Thus, for example, patients undergoing radiotherapy for pain may experience some resolution of symptoms and some level of recovery and relief before their next HRQoL assessment. Also, for example, in the case of a moderate fracture, many of its effects also may have resolved when HRQoL is next measured. In contrast, spinal cord compression has a longer duration of impact and sequelae are often still present when patients undergo HRQoL assessment.

Radiation or surgery to bone was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful declines in FACT-P and FACT-G total scores in AFFIRM; however, in PREVAIL, none of the changes in FACT-P outcomes were clinically meaningful, although several showed statistically significant changes. These results are consistent with a previous study in advanced prostate cancer, where radiation to bone was associated with statistically significant declines in four of five FACT-G domains and a statistically significant reduction in EQ-5D utility index and EQ visual analog scale scores. However, although radiotherapy has the potential for beneficial effects such as alleviating bone pain, it can be associated with pervasive negative effects on HRQoL such as adverse events and the negative psychological effect of a patient realizing that the cancer is sufficiently severe to require radiotherapy and repeated hospital visits for treatment.

Pathologic bone fractures were not associated with statistically significant changes in any FACT-P outcomes in either study, although in PREVAIL they were associated with significant declines in EQ-5D utility index. In AFFIRM, although changes in FACT-P/FACT-G outcomes associated with pathologic bone fractures were not statistically significant, they were clinically significant; the lack of statistical significance perhaps reflects the small sample size. This contrasts with the study by Weinfurt et al. where pathologic fractures were associated with significant declines in two of five FACT-G domains and in EQ visual analog scale and EQ-5D utility index in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (some of whom were receiving antineoplastic therapy). Pathologic fractures can seriously affect HRQoL of cancer patientsand have been correlated with reduced survival in malignant bone disease. It may be that, in the context of the effect sizes associated with this variable, the small sample size caused the 95% CIs to include zero in this subgroup and precluded detection of statistical significance. Furthermore, pathologic fractures vary considerably in severity; it may be that the fractures in our analysis were not particularly severe.

### Radiation for treatment of painful bone metastases [^1167eMEr]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Several variables may be considered when deciding on optimal modality of radiation therapy for each cancer patient with bone pain, including prognosis, tumor histology, location and extent of metastases, and association with cord compression. Hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy is as effective as a multiple fraction radiotherapy course in most cases, although retreatment rates are higher after a single dose of radiation. Stereotactic body radiation may be used in cases of oligometastatic disease, repeat irradiation, and radiation-resistant tumors. Radiopharmaceuticals may be used for pain from diffuse bone metastases and have an overall survival benefit in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

### Percutaneous cryoablation in the management of spinal metastases: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uVFXw]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spinal metastases are common in cancer patients, causing severe pain and disability. Conventional external beam radiotherapy (cEBRT) is widely used but has limitations due to its toxicity to the spinal cord and, rarely, to surrounding organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. This necessitates dose fractionation, which can lead to radiation resistance in solid tumors. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers a more precise approach, reducing exposure to adjacent organs and allowing higher doses per fraction to overcome resistance. SBRT carries risks, such as vertebral compression fractures; however, this risk is potentially preventable with appropriate post-SBRT consolidation procedures. Additionally, adequate tumor clearance from the spinal cord is essential for effectiveness. Minimally invasive percutaneous ablation techniques, including alcohol, laser, microwave (MWA), and radiofrequency (RFA), have been explored for tumor destruction. While beneficial for frail patients who cannot tolerate surgery, these methods pose risks such as vascular injury and neural damage. These challenges highlight the need for improved treatment strategies for spinal tumors.

Percutaneous cryoablation (PCA) is an emerging treatment used to destroy both superficial and deep-seated tumors by alternating cycles of freezing and thawing. PCA works by inducing direct and indirect cold-induced effects on the intra- and extra-cellular microenvironment. These effects include cellular dehydration due to water movement, intracellular crystal formation leading to membrane and organelle damage, and apoptosis activation. Additionally, PCA damages capillaries, causes thrombus formation, and increases inflammatory cytokines and edema through ice crystal formation. A key advantage of PCA is real-time monitoring via computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing for precise tumor targeting while preserving adjacent vital organs. It can be performed as an outpatient procedure without general anesthesia and supports multi-probe capabilities similar to laser interstitial therapy (LITT). Additionally, cryoablation excels in pain management by directly targeting nociceptive pathways through denervation of periosteal and tumor-associated nerves, leading to rapid and sustained reductions in pain scores and opioid dependence.

While PCA shows promise in treating spinal metastatic lesions, challenges remain regarding optimal patient selection and treatment protocols.

### Risks and benefits of bisphosphonates [^111zwrhA]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Bone is a common site for metastasis in patients with solid tumours arising from the breast, prostate, lung, thyroid and kidney. Approximately 70% of patients with advanced prostate cancer or breast cancer and up to 40% of patients with other advanced solid tumours will develop bone metastases. Additionally, in more than 50% of men with advanced prostate cancer and around 20% of women with advanced breast cancer, metastatic disease appears clinically confined to the skeleton.

Bone metastases are typically referred to as osteoblastic, osteolytic or mixed, based on the radiographic appearance of the lesions. However, osteoblastic and osteolytic bone lesions represent two extremes of a spectrum and osteoclast activity is increased in most bone metastases, including the typical osteoblastic metastases from prostate cancer. Pathological activation of osteoclasts appears to play a central role in most disease-related skeletal complications and is, thus, a rational therapeutic target and the basis for the use of bisphosphonates across the range of cancers affecting bone.

Metastatic bone disease disrupts the normal homeostasis of bone, a dynamic process that involves the coupled and balanced osteoclast-mediated osteolysis and osteogenesis by osteoblasts. The resulting increased and unbalanced bone metabolism leads to a loss of bone integrity, which may result in skeletal morbidity. This includes bone pain, pathological fractures, a need for orthopaedic surgery to prevent or repair major structural damage, spinal cord and nerve root compression and hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Bone pain is the most prevalent of all cancer-associated types of pain, and may be severe, necessitating opiate analgesics and palliative radiation therapy and often accompanied by a substantial decline in patient-reported quality of life. Despite the many advances in the treatment of advanced cancer over recent decades, skeletal morbidity remains a major clinical problem with annual fracture rates of 20–40% and the occurrence of a significant skeletal complication every 3–6 months in the absence of bone-targeted therapies, such as bisphosphonates.

### Bone health management in endocrine-treated patients with prostate cancer: a summary of evidence [^116kjdDY]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Many individuals suffering from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) endure painful metastatic bone involvement. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is proven to be highly effective, even when given as a single dose. In cases where radiation therapy is not feasible, a single administration of third-generation bisphosphonates can serve as an alternative treatment. Research indicates that third-generation bisphosphonates, such as ibandronate, are notably effective in treating patients with bone metastatic prostate cancer, particularly in alleviating pain. A study conducted by Peter Hoskin examined the outcomes of a single intravenous infusion of ibandronate compared to a single dose of radiation therapy in the management of metastatic bone pain. The findings revealed that radiation therapy produced a quicker initial response; however, no statistically significant difference in pain relief was observed between the two methods at both the 4-week and 12-week assessments. This suggests that while single-dose radiation therapy may offer superior pain control during the initial four weeks, effective overall pain management can also be achieved with a single dose of third-generation bisphosphonates. Common issues linked to bone metastases include vertebral collapse or deformity, pathological fractures, and spinal cord compression. The use of cementation can provide effective relief for painful spinal fractures, irrespective of their cause, significantly enhancing both pain relief and quality of life (QoL). It is essential to provide standard palliative surgical interventions, which can be beneficial in treating osteoblastic metastases. Recognizing impending spinal cord compression is a medical emergency that should be identified promptly; patients need to be informed about warning signs. If suspected, high-dose corticosteroids should be given, and an MRI should be performed as quickly as possible. A coordinated consultation with a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon should be set up to consider possible decompression, followed by EBRT. Alternatively, EBRT combined with or without systemic treatment remains the preferred therapeutic approach.

### Radiosensitization in prostate cancer: mechanisms and targets [^116Pq3BB]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Radiation therapy continues to be one of the more popular treatment options for the definitive treatment of localized prostate cancer. Recent research has helped understand and identify maximal tolerated radiation doses needed to treat prostate cancer. Thus, continuing to increase radiation doses may not show a clinical benefit and may be fraught with toxicity. Another way to improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiation is to sensitize the cells to the effects of radiation at current or even lower radiation doses. Different strategies are being pursued at this time to achieve these goals. Further development in this field will come as we gain more understanding of the cellular pathways leading to radiation resistance and how to best selectively block these pathways. Though limited clinical trials in prostate cancer patients support radiosensitizing agents, the field holds promise and should be aggressively explored further.

### Radium-223 as an approved modality for treatment of bone metastases [^116f4jfy]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Radium-223 dichloride (223 Ra) is an α-emitter radionuclide approved for treatment of osteoblastic metastases in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. 223 Ra increases overall survival, improves bone pain, increases the median time to the first skeletal-related event, reduces the use of external beam radiation therapy for bone pain palliation, reduces the rates of spinal cord compression, and hospitalization. 223 Ra therapy has minimal side effects; the most common hematological side effects are anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia while the nonhematological side effects that may occur are bone pain flare, nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea. Alongside 223 Ra therapy there are currently a variety of first-line therapeutic options available to treat mCRPC patients and much debate regarding the appropriate treatment algorithm for these patients and the possible combination of therapies among the ones available. In this article, we review the rationale behind 223 Ra therapy as well as 223 Ra mechanisms of action, biodistribution and dosimetry, optimal timing possibilities to initiate 223 Ra in contrast to other treatments available, the association of 223 Ra with other therapies and the means of evaluating patients in order to properly deliver to 223 Ra therapy. Furthermore, we will discuss 223 Ra dose administration possibilities, patient and dose preparation and the challenges of treatment response evaluation during and after 223 Ra.

### External beam radiation therapy for palliation of symptomatic bone metastases: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^114gTdtZ]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). High credibility.

ASTRO KQ3 — spine bone metastases with spinal cord or cauda equina compression in patients not eligible for initial surgical decompression treated with conventional palliative RT have the following recommended regimens: 800 cGy in 1 fraction, 1600 cGy in 2 fractions, 2000 cGy in 5 fractions, or 3000 cGy in 10 fractions, and clinicians are advised to consider patient and disease factors in dose-fractionation selection (eg, prognosis and radiosensitivity).

His next line of therapy was enzalutamide, a potent AR antagonist, and peripheral blood was collected for cfDNA (WCM63_1). He experienced a PSA response with decline of > 90%, reflected in an estimated tumor fraction of 0.002, yet with rising PSA he was treated after 13 months with the addition of unconjugated anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody J591 on study (NCT02552394). With clinical progression (bone pain) and rising PSA, the bone-seeking alpha-emitting radiotherapy Radium-223 was administered with enzalutamide. Upon development of worsening back pain and immediate associated PSA rise, imaging revealed enlarging retroperitoneal nodes and a mid-thoracic spinal mass with soft tissue component. At this transition, a second plasma sample was collected for cfDNA analysis (WCM63_2), yielding a tumor fraction of 0.375, a 187-fold increase from the first plasma sample. Given extraosseous progression, systemic therapy was switched to the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AAP). Biopsy of the soft tissue and bone spinal mass (WCM63_B) unexpectedly was found to be a carcinoma with squamous features (Fig. 1b (middle)). Suspicion was highest for a second primary of a squamous tissue origin, now metastatic to spine, although the possibility of this tumor being derived from a prostate primary was considered. A third cfDNA sample (WCM63_3) was collected during this interval prior to progression with a corresponding decrease in tumor fraction to 0.193. Following a brief PSA decline of nearly 50%, his PSA rose and radiographic progression was noted within 6 months of AAP initiation, including in viscera (liver and lungs), as well as prior sites of disease. A liver biopsy (WCM63_C) showed adenocarcinoma without variant histologic features and a fourth cfDNA sample was collected (WCM63_4)(Fig. 1b (bottom)), showing an increase in tumor fraction to 0.347. Abiraterone acetate was held and, given visceral disease and prior therapies, he was initiated on combination chemotherapy with cabazitaxel and carboplatin. PSA continued to rise with radiographic progression in liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones, prompting empiric initiation of chemotherapy with a small cell lung cancer-like regimen of cisplatin and etoposide, followed by progression in pulmonary metastases. The patient received carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab, the last added given evidence of HER2 amplification on WCM63_C via FISH (ratio > 2.0). After three cycles, the patient developed hemoptysis requiring hospitalization and bronchoscopy. Following discharge a single cycle of vinorelbine was attempted. cfDNA was collected (WCM63_5) with the tumor fraction peaking at 0.704, and the patient expiring 3 days later. A rapid autopsy was completed, as part of the WCM Rapid Autopsy program, which corresponds to samples WCM63_D-L (prostate, lymph node, soft tissue, lung [3], and liver [3]). A diagram of all anatomical sites sampled as part of this study is shown in Fig. 1c.

### Serum testosterone changes in patients treated with radiation therapy alone for prostate cancer on NRG oncology RTOG 9408 [^114o3nFW]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Various studies in the contemporary radiation therapy (RT) literature have evaluated changes in serum testosterone (ST) levels for patients receiving external beam RT for prostate cancer, and other pelvic malignancies. The majority of these studies have indicated that these patients experience a decline in ST after RT. Low-dose scatter radiation to the testicular Leydig cells is believed to be the most likely explanation for this phenomenon. The current study evaluates the changes in ST observed in patients who were enrolled and treated in the NRG oncology RTOG 9408 study.

Radiation for distant metastases — external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for bone pain palliation: EBRT "is an effective means of palliating isolated bone metastases from prostate cancer", and "a short course of 8 Gy x 1 is as effective as, and less costly than, 30 Gy in 10 fractions". In a randomized trial of 898 patients, grade 2–4 acute toxicity occurred less often in the 8-Gy arm (10%) than in the 30-Gy arm (17%) (P = .002), but retreatment was higher in the 8-Gy group (18%) than in the 30-Gy group (9%) (P < .001). Another study of 425 patients found a single 8 Gy dose was non-inferior to 20 Gy in multiple fractions for overall pain response, whereas the SCORAD randomized trial did not show non-inferiority for ambulatory status of single-fraction 8-Gy EBRT to 20 Gy in 5 fractions. The Panel notes that 8 Gy as a single dose is as effective for pain palliation at any bony site as longer courses of radiation, but re-treatment rates are higher; other regimens, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions, may be used as alternative palliative dosing depending on clinical scenario (both category 2B).

### Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression among elderly patients with advanced prostate cancer [^1178sNi6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A recent randomized trial demonstrated that for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC), a complication of advanced prostate cancer, surgical decompression may be more effective than external beam radiation therapy (RT). We investigated predictors of MESCC, its treatment, and its impact on hospital length of stay for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Methods

We used the SEER-Medicare database to identify patients > 65 years with stage IV (n = 14,800) prostate cancer. We used polytomous logistic regression to compare those with and without MESCC and those hospitalized for treatment with surgical decompression and/or RT.

Results

MESCC developed in 711 (5%) of patients, among whom 359 (50%) received RT and 107 (15%) underwent surgery ± RT. Median survival was 10 months. MESCC was more likely among patients who were black (OR 1.75, 95%CI 1.39–2.19 vs. white) and had high-grade tumors (OR 3.01, 95%CI 1.14–7.94), and less likely in those younger; with prior hormonal therapy (OR 0.73, 95%CI 0.62–0.86); or with osteoporosis (OR 0.63, 95%CI 0.47–0.83). Older patients were less likely to undergo either RT or surgery, as were those with ≥ 1 comorbidity. Patients with high-grade tumors were more likely to undergo RT (OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.25–2.96). Those who underwent RT or surgery spent an additional 11 and 29 days, respectively, hospitalized.

Conclusions

We found that black men with metastatic prostate cancer are more likely to develop MESCC than whites. RT was more commonly utilized for treatment than surgery, but the elderly and those with comorbidities were unlikely to receive either treatment.

### EANM guideline for radionuclide therapy with radium-223 of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^116KCJyd]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Radium Ra-223 dichloride (radium-223, Xofigo®) is a targeted alpha therapy approved for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. Radium-223 is the first targeted alpha therapy in this indication providing a new treatment option, with evidence of a significant survival benefit, both in overall survival and in the time to the first symptomatic skeletal-related event. The skeleton is the most common metastatic site in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Bone metastases are a clinically significant cause of morbidity and mortality, often resulting in bone pain, pathologic fracture, or spinal cord compression necessitating treatment. Radium-223 is selectively accumulated in the bone, specifically in areas of high bone turnover, by forming complexes with the mineral hydroxyapatite (the inorganic matrix of the bone). The alpha radiation generated during the radioactive decay of radium-223 produces a palliative anti-tumour effect on the bone metastases. The purpose of this guideline is to assist nuclear medicine specialists in evaluating patients who might be candidates for treatment using radium-223, planning and performing this treatment, understanding and evaluating its consequences, and improving patient management during therapy and follow-up.

Introduction

The approval of several agents that prolong survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has provided physicians with the opportunity to select treatment based on patient preference, disease characteristics, accessibility, cost, and clinician experience. Because these agents have different mechanisms of action, strategies for combining or sequencing them may provide improved outcomes for select patients; however, prospective data supporting the efficacy and safety of these strategies are currently limited.

Radium-223 is a targeted alpha therapy that prolonged overall survival (OS) and time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE; defined as occurrence of new symptomatic pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] to relieve bone pain, or orthopedic surgical intervention) in patients with mCRPC and bone metastases in the phase 3 ALSYMPCA trial. Early- or expanded-access programs reported that radium-223 could be safely used in combination with abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC. However, findings from the phase 3 ERA 223 trial indicated that concurrent treatment with abiraterone/prednisone and radium-223 did not prolong SSE-free survival but rather led to an increase in the incidence of fractures in uninvolved bone compared with abiraterone/prednisone.

### Assessing response in bone metastases in prostate cancer with diffusion weighted MRI [^116awxU7]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether changes in ADC of bone metastases secondary to prostate carcinoma are significantly different in responders compared with progressors on chemotherapy.

Methods

Twenty-six patients with known bone metastases secondary to prostate carcinoma underwent diffusion-weighted MRI of the lumbar spine and pelvis at baseline and 12 weeks following chemotherapy. RECIST assessment of staging CT and PSA taken at the same time points were used to classify patients as responders, progressors or stable. ADC (from b = 0,50,100,250,500,750 smm⁻²) and ADC(slow) (from b = 100,250,500,750 smm⁻²) were calculated for up to 5 lesions per patient.

Results

Mean ADC/ADC(slow) in lesions from responders and progressors showed a significant increase. Although the majority of lesions demonstrated an ADC/ADC(slow) rise, some lesions in both responders and progressors demonstrated a fall in ADC beyond the limits of reproducibility.

Conclusions

Mean ADC is not an appropriate measure of response in bone metastases. The heterogeneity of changes in ADC is likely to be related to the composition of bone marrow with changes that have opposing effects on ADC.

### Radiosensitization in prostate cancer: mechanisms and targets [^111o3zaR]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Cellular Effects of Ionizing Radiation. Photons of radiation produce direct DNA damage, but it is less likely than indirect damage, where photons eject electrons from target biomolecules in the cytoplasm, creating multiple ionizations, especially in oxygen compounds and producing free radicals, which break DNA.

According to the Compton effect, multiple ionizations are created and this leads to multiple free radical formation. It is believed that these radicals are produced in clusters and in discrete areas. Thus, it is thought that the multiple broken bonds and subsequent nucleic acids damage are likely to be clustered as well. Often, the term "locally multiply damaged site" is used to refer to this phenomenon. It has been suggested that clustered DNA damage is critical to clinically significant effects. These effects truly depend on the cellular response following a radiation insult, including the ability to repair DNA damage and to activate survival mechanisms.

### Symptoms predicting health-related quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with localized radiation therapy [^115sbJeA]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

With increased survival rates and advanced treatment techniques, general well-being and functional performance have become important outcomes for oncology treatments. For example, patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become a key outcome measure in evaluating the effectiveness of cancer treatments. In addition, patient-reported HRQOL measures can guide treatment planning as well as symptom management for oncology patients.

In 2017, prostate cancer is the second most prevalent malignancy for American men, with 161,360 new diagnoses, and is the third leading cause of overall cancer death. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is one of the standard and effective treatments offered as curative therapy for men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Although radiation techniques have improved and EBRT has increased survival for men with prostate cancer, these advances still adversely affect physical, urinary, bowel, and sexual functions during treatment, and into survivorship following treatment completion, they negatively impacting their HRQOL.

A recent study reported significant urinary (i.e. frequency, nocturia) and bowel (i.e. diarrhea, urgency) issues experienced by men who had undergone or not undergone prior prostatectomy during the course of their EBRT. These symptoms persist for 12–24 months following EBRT completion. However, the reported short-term and long-term effects of these symptoms on HRQOL for this clinical population are inconsistent, most likely related to differences in the instruments and approaches used to measure HRQOL.

Clustering of symptoms related to cancer therapy has been associated with inflammation and an altered immune response. EBRT alters expression of genes and proteins associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics and biogenesis in prostate cancer patients receiving EBRT, which can impair cellular energy supply and possibly lead to inflammation under hypoxic conditions. Alterations in the expression of genes and proteins related to inflammation and mitochondrial function have been associated with symptoms related to EBRT. Investigation of the association of the expression of these genes and proteins with HRQOL of men undergoing EBRT may help us further understand the biologic underpinning of the relationship of symptoms and HRQOL.

Understanding specific symptoms that can predict overall HRQOL during cancer treatments can help patients and their clinicians better plan care during treatment, as well as the timing and design of optimal treatment options. The primary goal of this study was to identify symptoms that can predict changes in overall HRQOL during EBRT in patients with localized prostate cancer.

Dose fractionation for initial palliative external beam RT in adults with symptomatic bone metastases — multiple RCTs determined that 800 cGy in 1 fraction was superior to other single-fraction dose regimens (eg, 400 cGy), and more than 10 RCTs have evaluated multifraction regimens with 2000 cGy in 5 fractions and 3000 cGy in 10 fractions among the most commonly used; most trials were limited to "uncomplicated" bone metastases without existing or impending fracture, spinal cord or cauda equina compression, or history of prior RT. Other multifraction regimens used included 2250 cGy in 5 fractions, 4000 cGy in 20 fractions, and 2400 cGy in 6 fractions, with 2400 cGy in 6 tested in the largest multicenter RCT (n = 1117) of single versus multifraction RT. Across 9 RCTs, overall pain response at 4 weeks ranged from 49% to 83% for single-fraction versus 53% to 89% for multifraction, after which there was no statistically significant difference in pain reduction, and shorter fractionation regimens (eg, 800 cGy in 1 fraction) are preferred given equivalence in pain outcomes.

### The role of intravenous zoledronic acid in the management of high-risk prostate cancer [^1155visp]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are limited effective therapies that would persuade most urologists actively to screen for and treat patients who have developed asymptomatic bone metastases.

Recent Findings

Recently published trials regarding new treatment options for patients with high-risk metastatic prostate cancer are now available, which describe the utility of the intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acid.

Summary

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in the United States. Many prostate cancer patients, especially those with aggressive and advanced disease, are at increased risk of developing bone metastases and, subsequently, skeletal-related events. Skeletal-related events may result both from disease and/or treatment of disease, and include bone pain, pathological fractures and spinal cord compressions. Furthermore, bone radiation and surgery to address bone-related pain, prevent pathological fractures and/or spinal cord compression are also considered skeletal-related events. These sequelae of bone metastases are both painful and debilitating, and severely compromise a patient's quality of life.

### Solitary leptomeningeal recurrence from prostate adenocarcinoma after treatment with cytotoxic gene therapy, radiation therapy, and androgen deprivation therapy [^114aanms]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Leptomeningeal disease in prostate adenocarcinoma is very rare. Solitary leptomeningeal recurrence from prostate adenocarcinoma has only been previously reported once in the published literature.

Methods and Materials

A 63-year-old man with high-risk prostate cancer was treated in a phase I-II trial with androgen deprivation, radiation therapy, and cytotoxic gene therapy. He initially had biochemical control but experienced solitary leptomeningeal recurrence 47 months after diagnosis.

Results

He received androgen deprivation, radiation therapy to the lumbar and sacral spine, and stereotactic radiosurgery to 3 intracranial foci of disease. He died 14 months after leptomeningeal recurrence. Autopsy showed diffuse spinal leptomeningeal disease, leptomeningeal based intracranial lesions, and no other metastasis.

Conclusions

The cause for solitary leptomeningeal recurrence in this patient is unknown. Although there may be many possible mechanisms, we speculate that it could be related to his initial treatment with cytotoxic gene therapy along with radiation therapy and androgen deprivation.

### Prostate cancer: role of SPECT and PET in imaging bone metastases [^114xVQ9S]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In prostate cancer, bone is the second most common site of metastatic disease after lymph nodes. This is related to a poor prognosis and is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in such patients. Early detection of metastatic bone disease and the definition of its extent, pattern, and aggressiveness are crucial for proper staging and restaging; it is particularly important in high-risk primary disease before initiating radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Different patterns of bone metastases, such as early marrow-based involvement, osteoblastic, osteolytic, and mixed changes can be seen. These types of metastases differ in their effect on bone, and consequently, the choice of imaging modalities that best depict the lesions may vary. During the last decades, bone scintigraphy has been used routinely in the evaluation of prostate cancer patients. However, it shows limited sensitivity and specificity. Single-photon emission computed tomography increases the sensitivity and specificity of planar bone scanning, especially for the evaluation of the spine. Positron emission tomography is increasing in popularity for staging newly diagnosed prostate cancer and for assessing response to therapy. Many positron emission tomography tracers have been tested for use in the evaluation of prostate cancer patients based on increased glycolysis ((18)F-FDG), cell membrane proliferation by radiolabeled phospholipids ((11)C and (18)F choline), fatty acid synthesis ((11)C acetate), amino acid transport and protein synthesis ((11)C methionine), androgen receptor expression ((18)F-FDHT), and osteoblastic activity ((18)F-fluoride). However, there are presently no accurate imaging modalities to directly, reproducibly, and effectively delineate bone metastases in prostate cancer.

### Antagonizing CD105 enhances radiation sensitivity in prostate cancer [^111fHjpF]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men. The standard of care for localized prostate cancer is radiotherapy or surgical resection. Radiation is also used as an adjuvant therapy following surgery, salvage therapy after biochemical recurrence, and for palliation in the setting of distant metastasis. Up to 30% of localized prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiation therapy develop recurrent radio-resistant disease and the most common anatomic site of recurrence is within the prostate itself, even in patients at high risk of metastasis. Further, 50% of patients that undergo salvage radiation therapy after biochemical recurrence will have disease progression. Although dose escalation improves biochemical control, toxicity remains a significant obstacle in optimizing local control. Accordingly, sensitizing agents are needed to improve tumor eradication and minimize toxicity to normal structures. With the rational that targeting mechanisms of radio-resistance can yield durable sensitization, we identified a novel pathway affecting both DNA repair and energy demands manifested by irradiation of prostate cancer cells.

### Planning for the effect of the SC.24 trial on spine stereotactic body radiation therapy utilization at a tertiary cancer center [^116MxdeQ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bone metastases are common among patients with cancer, occurring in up to 70% of those with certain solid tumors such as breast and prostate cancer. It is the most common cause of pain in patients with cancer and can cause other debilitating manifestations including spinal cord compression and hypercalcemia. Conventional radiation therapy (CRT) is most often used to palliate symptoms related to bone metastases, though the complete response rate of pain with CRT is unsatisfactory. A 2007 systematic review of clinical trials evaluating palliative CRT for bone metastases showed both single fraction and multiple fraction regimens were correlated with overall response rates of 58% and 59%, respectively, and complete response rates of 23% and 24%, respectively.

Compared with CRT, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) plans are more conformal and higher in biological effective dose. This can confer improved local control, especially in radioresistant disease, and is a particularly important outcome for spinal metastases where local recurrences can result in significant morbidity. Furthermore, within the oligometastatic paradigm where all sites of limited metastases are treated, the capability of administering spine SBRT is integral. In the SABR-COMET trial, which demonstrated an overall survival benefit with delivering SBRT to all sites of oligometastases, bone metastases were common with 35% of the patients receiving SBRT to ≥ 1 bony targets. Therefore, the comprehensive treatment of oligometastatic patients depends on an established spine SBRT program.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of Xofigo were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases. Patients with visceral metastases and malignant lymphadenopathy exceeding 3 cm were excluded. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. A key secondary efficacy endpoint was time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) defined as external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic pathologic bone fracture, occurrence of spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention. There were no scheduled radiographic assessments performed on study. All patients were to continue androgen deprivation therapy. At the cut-off date of the pre-planned interim analysis, a total of 809 patients had been randomized 2:1 to receive Xofigo 55 kBq (1.49 microcurie)/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (n = 541) plus best standard of care or matching placebo plus best standard of care (n = 268). Best standard of care included local EBRT, corticosteroids, antiandrogens, estrogens, estramustine or ketoconazole. Therapy was continued until unacceptable toxicity or initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotope, hemi-body EBRT or other investigational drug. Patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, prior hemibody radiation or untreated imminent spinal cord compression were excluded from the study. In patients with bone fractures, orthopedic stabilization was performed before starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo.

Review

Introduction

In 2012 it is estimated that 241,740 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 28,170 men will succumb to prostate cancer. The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is 1 in 6. Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men over the age of 45 years and is the third most common cause of cancer related deaths in American men. The majority of men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer may be eligible for active surveillance, surgery (prostatectomy or cryoablation), or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy) either alone or in combination with androgen deprivation therapy. This review will focus on radiation therapy, which is a common treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Radiation therapies, external beam, proton beam, and interstitial brachytherapy, are becoming increasingly in demand by patients as a means to avoid major surgery and the side effects and convalescence associated with surgery.

Radiation therapy in prostate cancer is by no means innocuous and is associated with urinary and bowel side effects. Furthermore, it has been reported that based on the clinical presentation of the cancer, only 33–66% of patients undergoing radiation therapy are disease-free five years after the initial procedure, this includes more contemporary series addressing dose escalation (i.e. ≥ 78 Gy). The varying response rates to radiation may be due to 1) modality used to deliver radiation, 2) dose of radiation, 3) tumor stage/grade, 4) confounding medical co-morbidities and 4) intrinsic microenvironment of the tumor. Herein, we will discuss the intrinsic microenvironment of tumors and how radiosensitizing agents (i.e. drugs that can enhance the effectiveness of radiation, kill to the target tissue) may be used to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy.

### Bone health management in endocrine-treated patients with prostate cancer: a summary of evidence [^114ozFN5]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Novel endocrine agents targeting the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway and cell cycle-related cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are the two standard treatment modalities for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Long-acting LHRH agonists currently represent the primary forms of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). These synthetic analogues of LHRH are administered via depot injections at intervals of one, two, three, six months, or annually. Decreased androgen levels in prostate cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy can result in adverse effects such as hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures, cognitive changes, and depression. These effects can impact the physical and psychological well-being of the patient, ultimately leading to a diminished quality of life. Over 85% of CRPC patients develop distant metastases, specifically metastatic denervation-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with bone being the most common site of metastasis. Bone metastasis-related adverse events (SRE), including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, and bone pain, can significantly impact patients' quality of life and decrease survival rates. The focus on bone health in prostate cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy has been growing, with increasing attention in recent years. Effective management of this chronic condition necessitates patient self-management, though discrepancies exist in healthcare professionals' knowledge regarding bone health management in patients receiving endocrine therapy for prostate cancer. Nursing staff may lack a comprehensive assessment of osteoporosis and fracture, leading to challenges in accurately identifying patients at high risk of fracture. Additionally, doctors may not have evaluated the bone health of their patients or implemented targeted measures based on their bone health status. Currently, there are clear practice recommendations for managing bone health in endocrine-treated prostate cancer patients. This study aims to consolidate the best evidence on bone health management in this patient population, drawing from guidelines, systematic evaluations, and expert consensus. The findings will serve as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals in enhancing the management of bone health in endocrine-treated patients with prostate cancer and improving the overall quality of clinical nursing practice.

### Challenges and recommendations for early identification of metastatic disease in prostate cancer [^111LXegD]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is often associated with metastases to bone and/or soft tissue. The progression to metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is a seminal event in disease progression affecting treatment decisions. A multidisciplinary group was convened to review the currently available imaging guidelines for metastatic disease in prostate cancer and found no consensus on eligibility criteria, type of imaging modality, and the frequency of scanning for detecting metastatic disease. The aim of this review was to present the recommendations from the group to identify optimal strategies for early identification of metastases in patients with prostate cancer.

Materials and methods

Patients

Cases of prostate cancer were identified from three cancer registries in Great Britain. Within each region, collaborating hospitals were sought, and cases from these hospitals were reviewed. Men were included in this study if they were aged < 76 years at the date of diagnosis and had clinically localised prostate cancer diagnosed by needle biopsy in 1990–2003 inclusive. The median date of diagnosis was May 2002. Patients treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy within 6 months of diagnosis were excluded. This was a practical measure to ensure that all men were not initially treated with radical therapy. Only initial hormone therapy was permitted. In addition, those with objective evidence of metastatic disease (by bone scan, X‐ray, radiograph, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, bone biopsy, lymph node biopsy, or pelvic lymph node dissection) or clinical indications of metastatic disease (including pathological fracture, soft tissue metastases, spinal compression, or bone pain), or a prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) measurement of > 100 ng/ml at or within 6 months of diagnosis, were also excluded. Men who had received hormone therapy prior to the diagnostic biopsy were also excluded, because of the influence of hormone treatment on Gleason pattern. We also excluded men who died within 6 months of diagnosis or had < 6 months of follow‐up.

Limitations of the study focus on the design (nonrandomized), and the fact that patients were selected for non‐bone progression during their first course of radium‐223 and for their continued good performance status and good hematologic parameters at baseline before the repeat course of radium‐223. Outcomes for a control population with similar parameters are not available. DNA repair alterations were not assessed in this study in a systematic manner, but such studies could be informative with regard to understanding those individuals having more favorable responses to radium‐223. Patients with DNA‐repair defects have tumors that may be more susceptible to DNA‐damaging agents, such as radium‐223 or platinum‐based chemotherapy. 9, 10, 11, 12

3.3 Exploratory efficacy

All patients in the safety data set (N = 44) were included in the exploratory efficacy analysis. Radiographic bone progression occurred in 5 (11%) patients. The median time to radiographic bone progression was not estimated because 39 (89%) patients were censored (Figure 4 A). The maximum follow‐up time for radiographic bone progression was 16.3 months. Median rPFS was 9.9 months (Figure 4 B), and 19 (43%) patients had an rPFS event (radiographic progression or death), 6 of which occurred during the active follow‐up period, including 2 in bone, 1 non‐bone event, and 3 deaths. Censoring affected 25 (57%) patients. The maximum follow‐up time for rPFS was 17.7 months. Median OS was 24.4 months (Figure 4 C), and 28 of 44 (64%) patients died. The median follow‐up for OS was 31.6 months. OS was estimated at 78% at 12 months and 50% at 24 months.

The median time to first SSE was 16.7 months (Figure 4 D); 14 of 44 (32%) patients experienced at least 1 SSE, although 3 patients were censored due to new cancer treatment, leaving 11 for inclusion in the Kaplan‐Meier analysis. First SSEs were EBRT for bone pain in 10 (23%) patients, pathologic bone fracture in 3 (7%), and spinal cord compression in 1 (2%). Median SSE‐free survival was 12.8 months (Figure 4 E), and 18 (41%) patients had an SSE‐free survival event, which included 7 deaths. Maximum follow‐up time for first SSE or SSE‐free survival was 27.8 months.

### Radiosensitization in prostate cancer: mechanisms and targets [^116pfGHC]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Cellular effects of ionizing radiation

To understand the mechanism and role of various radiosensitizing agents, it is important to review briefly the cellular response to radiation. Radiation is clinically administered either by an external source, linear accelerator, directed toward the tumor or an internal source, radioactive decay from within the tumor. Five mechanisms have been described to explain the way radiation interacts with matter, including coherent scattering, the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, the pair production, and the photodisintegration. However, the Compton effect is widely viewed as the mode of interaction most relevant for the range of energies used in clinical radiation therapy. In the Compton effect, the observed biologic effect results from photons creating multiple ionizations by ejection of electrons from the target biomolecule. In this regard, the extent of biologic effects in cells after exposure to ionized radiation is largely due to oxygen with the subsequent production of free radicals. These free radicals can break chemical bonds present in critical cell structures and molecules, namely cellular DNA.

DNA is by far the critical target for the biologic effects of radiation. Cell death is strongly associated with the extent of DNA damage with radiosensitivity being more pronounced in cells that cannot effectively repair DNA damage. Furthermore, cell death occurs at a higher rate when radiation is focused on the nucleus as opposed to the cytoplasm. Disruption of DNA takes place via both direct and indirect effect of radiation. Taking into account the size of the cell and the small amount of DNA in the cell, most of the damage occurs indirectly. This means that the photons of radiation are less likely to directly damage the DNA, but more likely to ionize surrounding molecules, which subsequently destabilize nucleic acids. The mechanism behind oxygen radiosensitizing is related to this process of indirect damage (Figure 1). The presence of oxygen in irradiated tissues prevents repair of free radical-induced damage by forming irreversible peroxides in the fractured molecules. This process is sometimes called "fixing" the radiation. Many types of damage to DNA molecules, dimers, adducts, oxidative base damage, intra- and intercross-links, DNA-protein cross-links, single- and double-strand breaks can be detected after radiation exposure.

### A 64-year-old man with low-risk prostate cancer: review of prostate cancer treatment [^116kmLsj]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Earlier detection of prostate cancer in the past decade has been accompanied by greater reduction in US prostate cancer mortality than that seen with any other cancer. Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed at early stages and is most commonly treated by prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. For intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancers, randomized clinical trials have shown survival benefit subsequent to prostatectomy or to combined radiation with androgen-suppressive therapy. However, prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and brachytherapy each can lead to distinct adverse effects. Moreover, for the lowest-risk categories of early stage prostate cancer, evidence supporting an intervention is only indirect. New approaches to surveillance of prostate cancer have consequently emerged that do not eschew treatment altogether. Instead "active" surveillance aims to implement definitive intervention effectively for those low-risk cancers that show a propensity for progression as evidenced by histopathological or serological change during the surveillance interval.

### Radiation therapy in oligometastatic prostate cancer [^116jbeey]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer ranges from localized, low risk to metastatic, morbid disease. Although radiation therapy (RT) is commonly incorporated in the treatment of early disease or for palliation of symptomatic lesions, its role in extending survival in metastatic disease is less well-established. Here, we review the available evidence surrounding localized RT in the presence of oligometastatic disease and metastasis-directed therapy in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant prostate cancer. We further outline potential future incorporation of RT as an immune-sensitizing therapy and the importance of highly sensitive imaging modalities in considering RT in metastatic disease.

2.3 Endpoints

The primary endpoint was safety. During the active follow‐up period, AEs and serious AEs were recorded if considered to be related to the study medication or if related to an SSE, and all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, primary bone cancer, or any other new primary malignancy were recorded.

Exploratory time‐to‐event endpoints included rPFS defined as the time from treatment start to radiographic progression or death by any cause, time to radiographic bone progression, time to tALP progression defined as greater than or equal to 25% increase above the nadir value to at least 1.5 × upper limit of normal, time to PSA progression defined as greater than or equal to 25% increase above nadir and an increase in absolute value greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL above nadir, OS, time to ﬁrst SSE, and SSE‐free survival defined as time from treatment start to first SSE or death. SSEs included external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to relieve skeletal pain, new symptomatic pathologic bone fractures, spinal cord compression, and tumor‐related orthopedic surgical intervention. Time‐to‐event exploratory efficacy endpoints were calculated from the day of first radium‐223 injection (day 1) to the end of the 2‐year follow‐up period.

2.4 Assessments

Assessments conducted during treatment were described in the initial report. 8 Assessments during active follow‐up were vital signs, physical condition, complete blood counts, blood chemistries including tALP and PSA, ECOG PS, and SSE evaluations every 4 weeks for 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks until 2 years after the last dose of radium‐223 was received. Radiographic progression was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x‐ray, and whole‐body technetium‐99 bone scans every 12 weeks until disease progression, start of a new anticancer treatment, or as needed to confirm suspected lesions. If progression was detected by bone scan, a confirmatory bone scan was required greater than or equal to 6 weeks later per PCWG2 criteria to confirm radiographic bone progression.

### Clinical approaches to osseous metastases in prostate cancer [^112KMnHq]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer is unique among solid tumors in its proclivity to metastasize primarily to bone. Osseous metastases pose a formidable health threat to patients with metastatic disease, putting them at risk for pain, marrow crowding, fracture, and other sequelae. Treatments directed against bone disease have the potential both to palliate pain and to increase survival.

Conclusions

A number of agents exist that have the potential to palliate the effects of osseous metastases and should be routinely applied in the clinical care of the patient with advanced prostate cancer. These include hormones, bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals, chemotherapy, and bisphosphonates. Strategies under investigation aim to eradicate bone disease, and not merely palliate symptoms. These approaches combine those listed above with tumor-directed targeting of osseous disease and manipulation of the biology that underlies the cancer's relationship to bone.

Spinal metastases with radiographic spinal cord compression — management includes steroid initiation and surgery or radiotherapy according to stability and histology. For tumors occurring below L1, any canal compression of 50% or more should be considered of equal importance as spinal cord compression, and patients with radiographic cord compression should start on dexamethasone (10–100 mg) to alleviate symptoms. Decompressive surgery (concomitant stabilization if indicated) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is the preferred treatment (category 1) where there is spinal instability and no surgical contraindication; primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone is appropriate for patients with radiosensitive cancers (hematologic malignancies) and without evidence of spinal instability. Many fractionation schemes are available (8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 30 Gy in 10 fractions); the most common is a total of 30 Gy in 3-Gy daily fractions for 10 days. Primary systemic therapy is also an option for chemo-responsive tumors in the absence of clinical myelopathy, with close neurologic monitoring, and in general, a treatment interval of at least 6 months is recommended.

### Radiation therapy in malignant spinal cord compression: what is the current knowledge on fractionation schedules? A systematic literature review [^115Hf4j7]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) in patients with short life expectancy is most frequently treated with radiotherapy and/or corticosteroids. Hypofractionation has been proven to be efficient in metastatic bone pain, but the level of evidence for hypofractionation in MSCC is limited. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library for all relevant articles. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. The first RCT compared hypofractionation (8 gray (Gy)×2) with a more fractionated regimen. No differences in symptom control, duration of response or survival were detected. The second RCT compared 8 Gy×2 with 8 Gy×1. No significant differences in symptom control, duration of response or survival were detected. Five prospective non-randomised studies identified no differences in post-treatment motor function. Of 17 identified retrospective studies the largest included 1304 patients, treated with five different regimens ranging from 8 Gy×1 to 2 Gy×20, and found similar post-treatment ambulatory status. A Cochrane review based on the first published RCT concluded that short courses of radiotherapy appear to be justified in patients with a poor prognosis.

### Targeting osseous metastases: rationale and development of radio-immunotherapy for prostate cancer [^112YjhhB]. Current Oncology Reports (2004). Low credibility.

For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, bone is the primary site of tumor localization and the major cause of disease-related morbidity and mortality. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy alone cannot eradicate disease harbored in bone. The delivery of radiotherapy to the reservoir of disease is an approach previously only achievable using bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals. Now, however, with the identification of tumor-specific targets, antibodies are being used to deliver radiotherapy to these sites. In this article, we review the rationale behind this approach, the targets being explored, the radiation sources available, and the antibodies currently under clinical development.

### Denosumab for the prevention of skeletal complications in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: comparison of skeletal-related events and symptomatic skeletal events [^1165Xfo5]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

SSEs include symptomatic pathologic fractures but not asymptomatic, radiographically identified fractures, and it has therefore been argued that SSEs may be a more clinically relevant end point. However, evidence from an analysis of a multicenter, randomized trial of zoledronic acid in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases suggested that any SRE (radiation to bone, pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, or change in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain) ultimately has the potential to decrease patient-reported quality of life. In this population of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases, we have shown that both SSEs and SREs overall were associated with an increased risk of moderate or severe pain among patients with no/mild pain at baseline.

Several studies have shown evidence of benefit from bone-targeted therapy in patients with bone metastases. In an analysis of phase III trials in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors (other than breast or prostate cancer), treatment with denosumab was associated with a reduced risk of SREs, as well as delayed time to moderate or severe pain, worsened pain, and increased pain interference versus zoledronic acid among patients without pain at baseline. Similarly, in a combined analysis of three phase III trials in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or other solid tumors, treatment with denosumab was associated with delayed time to moderate or severe pain and pain interference among patients without pain at baseline, and a reduced risk of worsened health-related quality of life versus zoledronic acid. Treatment with denosumab was associated with delayed time to increased pain interference, as well as greater cancer-specific quality of life versus zoledronic acid. The benefit of denosumab has also been demonstrated in patients previously treated with a bisphosphonate.

Prostate cancer — fractionation and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) use specifies that fractionation schedules are grouped into conventional fractionation (1.8–2 Gy/fraction), moderate hypofractionation (> 2.5 to 4 Gy/fraction), and ultra-hypofractionation (> 6 Gy/fraction). In general, iso-effective moderate hypofractionation dosing has demonstrated noninferior tumor control, toxicity, and QOL over conventional fractionation and is more convenient for patients and thus preferred; similarly, ultra-hypofractionation has been demonstrated to be noninferior to both moderate hypofractionation and conventional fractionation, and use of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is no longer preferred for localized prostate cancer. Ultra-hypofractionation encompasses SBRT, and SBRT is recommended and preferred specifically when performing metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDRT), when there is limited progression or limited residual disease and the patient is on otherwise effective systemic therapy, when the lesion occurs in or immediately adjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field, and at physician discretion for more durable control of pain than achieved with typical palliative regimens.

### Prostate cancer and bone metastases: medical treatment [^113Wd5Wd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in the United States. With the long natural history of the disease, management of skeletal morbidity related to advanced prostate cancer becomes a major public health issue. The standard of care in advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy. This may accelerate the development of osteoporosis and further exacerbate the risks of having adverse skeletal-related events develop. Recently, the use of bisphosphonates in men who have not responded to androgen deprivation therapy has been shown to reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events with time. Questions remain as to whether bisphosphonates should be broadly applied to earlier stages of the disease or tailored to men at higher risk of having bone-related morbidity. Work is ongoing to improve other approaches to the medical treatment of bone metastases in patients with advanced prostate cancer including the use of radiopharmaceuticals and combined chemotherapy.

The biological basis of the selective outgrowth of disseminated prostate cancer cells within the hematopoietic bone microenvironment remains a compelling biological mystery. A major proportion of the morbidity and mortality related to prostate cancer can be traced to the burden of bone metastases. The optimal management of bone health in men with prostate cancer requires control of the underlying epithelial neoplasm, attenuation of the subverted bone remodeling process that accompanies disease progression, reduction in the bone complications of disease-directed therapy, and management of co-existing comorbidities that enhance bone fragility. While bone-homing radioisotopes, bisphosphonates, and RANK ligand inhibitors have demonstrated reduction in bone pain and/or other skeletal-related events, further advances into definitive improvements in survival and/or global quality of life are required. A deeper understanding of the biology of bone metastases will likely facilitate a bone-directed therapeutic approach toward a major impact on the survival of men with this important disease.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^114VQ7YV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — management of metastatic or myelomatous lesions of the femur — provides a practical and vetted set of recommendations based on a systematic review and expert consensus, and the goal is not to dictate patient care; although final surgical decision-making resides with surgeons, the guideline will assist medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and primary care physicians, and recommendations are relevant regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, or socioeconomic status. The skeleton is a frequent site of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma, with National Cancer Institute estimates of new cases in 2017 at 252,710 for breast, 222,500 for lung, 161,360 for prostate, and 63,990 for kidney; autopsy studies report bone metastases of approximately 70% in patients with breast or prostate cancer and 35% in patients with lung or kidney cancer, and the annual incidence of multiple myeloma in the United States is 3–4 cases/100,000 people. Skeletal related events (SREs) are typically defined as pathologic fracture (vertebral and/or nonvertebral), radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression, and the definition may or may not include hypercalcemia of malignancy; SREs have been seen in 43% of breast cancer patients with bone metastases and 20–50% of patients with bone metastases from lung cancer. In patients with breast cancer bone metastases, studies have shown a fracture rate of 17% and mortality rates in the post-SRE period of 21% for patients with a single SRE and 33.5% for patients with multiple SREs.

### Metastatic spinal cord compression [^1136f1UV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 70% of cancer patients have metastatic disease at death. The spine is involved in up to 40% of those patients. Spinal cord compression may develop in 5% to 10% of cancer patients and up to 40% of patients with preexisting nonspinal bone metastasis (> 25,000 cases/y). Given the increasing survival times of patients with cancer, greater numbers of patients are likely to develop this complication. The role of surgery in the management of metastatic spinal cord compression is expanding. The management of metastatic spine disease can consist of a combination of surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Treatment modalities are not mutually exclusive and must be individualized for patients evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting.

### Surgical decompression of high-grade spinal cord compression from hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer [^1152Jwsq]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Spine and nonspine skeletal metastases occur in more than 80% of patients with prostate cancer.

Objective

To examine the characteristics of the patient population undergoing surgery for the treatment of prostate cancer metastatic to the spine.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients treated at our institution from June 1993 to August 2014 for surgical management of metastatic spine disease from prostate cancer.

Results

During the study period, 139 patients with 157 surgical lesions underwent surgery for metastatic spine disease. Decompression for high-grade epidural spinal cord compression was required for 126 patients with 143 lesions. Preoperatively, 69% had a motor deficit and 21% were nonambulatory, with 32% due to motor weakness. At surgery, 87% of patients had hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and 61% failed prior radiation. Median overall survival for HRPC patients was 6.6 mo (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.6–8.6) while the median overall survival for hormone-sensitive patients was 16.3 mo (95% CI: 4.0–26.6).

Conclusion

The majority of patients undergoing surgery for prostate cancer metastases to the spine were refractory to hormone therapy, indicating that patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer are unlikely to develop symptomatic spinal cord compression or spinal instability. A significant number of HRPC patients presented with neurological deficits attributable to spinal cord compression. Vigilant monitoring for the development of signs and symptoms of epidural spinal cord compression and spinal instability in hormone-refractory patients is recommended. Surgical decision making may be affected by the much shorter postoperative survival for HRPC patients as compared to patients with hormone-sensitive cancer.

### Real-world evaluation of primary versus secondary prevention of skeletal-related events in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^1177NuV1]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study may lack generalizability to other health care systems, as it was performed within a single Canadian province. That said, Ontario is Canada's largest province (over 14 million people) and BTAs are universally funded at the age of 65 and over, making it a desirable study population to evaluate real-world practice patterns without limitations of funding. Bone metastases were captured at the time of diagnosis but could not be captured if they developed during a patient's course. It was assumed that patients in this study who are all known to receive mCRPC systemic therapy had developed bone metastases if they were receiving bone radiotherapy prior to death. It is estimated 90% of patients dying of prostate cancer have evidence of bone metastasis. Regarding SREs, in this study, we used palliative bone radiation therapy as a surrogate of other SREs that were not captured in our study such as spinal cord compression, pathological fracture, or hypercalcemia. Data from prior Canadian studies suggest proportional occurrence of these other SREs to palliative bone radiation therapy which represents 83% of bone events across different centers. Finally, this cohort excluded patients less than 65 years, as they do not automatically qualify for Ontario Drug Benefit, the primary medication funding program in Ontario. The results may not reflect clinical practices in younger males.

### Persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and mortality risk… [^115VvR4f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Estimates were adjusted for known prostate cancer prognostic factors, age at RP, year of RP, and the time-dependent use of post-RP radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy. To convert PSA to μg/L, multiply by 1. pPSA indicates persistent prostate-specific antigen; uPSA, undetectable prostate-specific antigen. Question How long should prostate-specific antigen be monitored following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer to accurately document a persistent PSA, and does an increasing level portend a worse prognosis. Findings. In this cohort study of 43 298 patients with PC, among patients with a persistent PSA level but not those with an undetectable PSA level, a pre–radical prostatectomy PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less was significantly associated with reduced all.

-cause and PC-specific mortality risk, which can be explained by a higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less who could have reached an undetectable PSA level if additional time for PSA assessment occurred before initiating post-RP therapy for a presumed persistent PSA. Meaning PSA level should be assessed for at least 3 months postoperatively to minimize overtreatment, and a higher persistent PSA level was associated with a worse prognosis. Importance Whether the conventional 1. 5-month to
2. 0-month time interval following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer is sufficient to accurately document a persistent prostate-specific antigen remains unanswered. Objective To evaluate the time necessary to accurately document a persistent PSA level after RP. Design, Setting, and Participants.

This result remained after adjustment for prostate volume and was confirmed in the validation cohort for PCSM risk and may represent a higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less who could have reached an undetectable PSA level if additional time for PSA assessment occurred before initiating post-RP therapy for presumed persistent PSA. Conclusions and Relevance PSA level assessed for at least 3 months after RP may minimize overtreatment, and in this study, a higher persistent PSA level was associated with a worse prognosis. A persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer is associated with a worse prognosis compared with achieving an undetectable PSA level. 1, 2 While 1. 5 to
2. 0 months following RP is considered an acceptable interval to assess for persistent PSA. ,3 it may be too short to allow for clearance of the PSA from the serum, particularly at higher pre-RP PSA levels.

4 If true, then patients with a higher compared with a lower pre-RP level could have a more favorable prognosis than would be expected and may experience overtreatment when offered post-RP therapy for presumed persistent PSA before the time when an undetectable PSA level could be reached. Between January 28, 1992, and June 19, 2020, patients who underwent RP for clinical stage T1N0M0 to T3N0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, were included in the study cohort. Patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL or a biopsy Gleason score of 8 to 10 underwent staging with computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdominal pelvic region and bone scan prior to RP. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the distribution of the clinical factors among patients who achieved an undetectable PSA or a persistent PSA at first post-RP assessment dichotomized by the median persistent PSA level.

### Proper definition of postprostatectomy prostate-specific antigen persistence-reply… [^112A95XV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Tilki D, Chen M, D'Amico AV. Proper Definition of Postprostatectomy Prostate-Specific Antigen Persistence — Reply. JAMA Oncol. Published online July 17, 2025. doi:
10. 1001/jamaoncol.
2025. 2120. In Reply We agree with Lane et al that a standardized approach to assess for a persistent prostate-specific antigen post–radical prostatectomy would be beneficial in the clinical trial setting to advance our knowledge of how to improve cancer control outcomes for patients with a persistent PSA who have undergone RP for prostate cancer and moreover, to avoid the potential for overtreatment in patients who are entering our practice today. In our study1 we observed that the median time to an undetectable PSA for the patients with a persistent PSA assessed at 1. 5 to
2. 0 months post-RP and then observed without initiation of salvage treatment until at least 6 months post-RP was 3. 22 months with an upper quartile of
4. 04 months.

Therefore, one could consider the following approach to accurately document a persistent PSA post-RP. Obtain the first PSA assessment 3. 0 months after RP and, if detectable as Lane et al suggest, performing a confirmatory PSA to see if it is still detectable
1. 0 to 2. 0 months later before initiating salvage therapy for a persistent PSA. This should significantly reduce overtreatment and provide a more robust definition of a persistent PSA by reducing the false-positive rate.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI-national cancer institute… [^114hmhTx]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. This test is used in several different ways:

- to monitor the progression of prostate cancer in men who have already been diagnosed with the disease
- to follow up on prostate symptoms, such as painful or frequent urination, blood in urine or semen, and pelvic and/or back pain
- to screen for prostate cancer in men who do not have symptoms of the disease. Currently, Medicare provides coverage for an annual PSA test for all Medicare-eligible individuals over 50. Many private insurers cover PSA screening as well. What is a normal PSA test result. There is no single threshold that distinguishes a normal versus an abnormal PSA result. This is in part because there is no specific PSA level that means that someone has prostate cancer. However, the higher someone's PSA level, the likelier it is that prostate cancer is present. In general, a PSA level above 4.

0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy. However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. In addition, a lower cutoff for abnormal is used in men taking certain drugs, including finasteride and dutasteride, which are used to treat BPH. These drugs lower the PSA level. Various factors can increase someone's PSA level temporarily. An infection or inflammation of the prostate or having had a recent prostate biopsy can cause PSA levels to be raised for a month or two. Vigorous exercise and ejaculation can also increase the PSA level transiently. People are generally recommended to wait until any conditions that can change PSA level resolve before they have testing and to avoid activities that may raise the PSA level for 2 days before testing. What is done if a screening test shows an elevated PSA level.

If someone who has no symptoms of prostate cancer chooses to undergo prostate cancer screening and is found to have an abnormal PSA level, the doctor may recommend another PSA test in 6 to 8 weeks to confirm the original finding. If the PSA level is still elevated, the doctor may recommend continued observation with repeat PSA tests along with digital rectal exams to watch for any changes over time. If the PSA level continues to rise — especially if it rises quickly — or if a lump is detected during a DRE, the doctor may recommend additional tests. These may include additional blood- or urine-based tests, or imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging or high-resolution micro-ultrasound. Alternatively, the doctor may recommend a prostate biopsy without further testing. During this procedure, multiple samples of prostate tissue are collected by inserting hollow needles into the prostate and then withdrawing them.

The biopsy needle may be inserted through the wall of the rectum or through the perineum. A pathologist then examines the collected tissue under a microscope. Although both biopsy techniques are guided by ultrasound imaging so the doctor can view the prostate during the biopsy procedure, ultrasound cannot be used alone to diagnose prostate cancer. An MRI-guided biopsy may be performed for patients with suspicious areas seen on MRI. Overtreatment exposes a person unnecessarily to potential complications. These include urinary, bowel, and sexual side effects, such as leaking of urine following surgery; increased frequency and urgency of urination following radiation; loose stools or, less commonly, rectal bleeding, following radiation; and loss of erections or decreased erections, following both surgery and radiation. **Detecting prostate cancer earlier does not always result in cure.

### Prostate-specific antigen… [^113Va95F]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Medical diagnostic uses Prostate cancer Screening Clinical practice guidelines for prostate cancer screening vary and are controversial, in part due to uncertainty as to whether the benefits of screening ultimately outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient is required to be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA testing prior to performing the test. PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/mL are considered to be suspicious, and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, prostate biopsy is performed to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological analysis. Use of PSA screening tests is also controversial due to questionable test accuracy.

The screening can present abnormal results even when a man does not have cancer, or normal results even when a man does have cancer. False-positive test results can cause confusion and anxiety in men, and can lead to unnecessary prostate biopsies, a procedure which causes risk of pain, infection, and hemorrhage. False-negative results can give men a false sense of security, though they may actually have cancer. Of those found to have prostate cancer, overtreatment is common because most cases of prostate cancer are not expected to cause any symptoms due to low rate of growth of the prostate tumor. Therefore, many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will develop urinary incontinence, two will have serious cardiovascular events, one will develop pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis, and one perioperative death.

Risk stratification and staging Men with prostate cancer may be characterized as low, intermediate, or high risk for having/developing metastatic disease or dying of prostate cancer. PSA level is one of three variables on which the risk stratification is based; the others are the grade of prostate cancer and the stage of cancer based on physical examination and imaging studies. D'Amico criteria for each risk category are: Post-treatment monitoring PSA levels are monitored periodically after treatment for prostate cancer – more frequently in patients with high-risk disease, less frequently in patients with lower-risk disease. If surgical therapy is successful at removing all prostate tissue, PSA becomes undetectable within a few weeks. A subsequent rise in PSA level above 0.

2 ng/mL L is generally regarded as evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy; less commonly, it may simply indicate residual benign prostate tissue. Following radiation therapy of any type for prostate cancer, some PSA levels might be detected, even when the treatment ultimately proves to be successful. This makes interpreting the relationship between PSA levels and recurrence/persistence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy more difficult. PSA levels may continue to decrease for several years after radiation therapy. The lowest level is referred to as the PSA nadir. A subsequent increase in PSA levels by 2. 0 ng/mL above the nadir is the currently accepted definition of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy. Recurrent prostate cancer detected by a rise in PSA levels after curative treatment is referred to as a "biochemical recurrence".

### Proper definition of postprostatectomy prostate-specific antigen persistence… [^112XGw9w]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Lane BR, Ginsburg KB, Borza T. Proper Definition of Postprostatectomy Prostate-Specific Antigen Persistence. JAMA Oncol. Published online July 17, 2025. doi:
10. 1001/jamaoncol.
2025. 2117. To the Editor Patients with post–radical prostatectomy prostate-specific antigen persistence represent an understudied population. In their recent article, Tilki et al1 assessed the association between timing of postoperative PSA and secondary treatment. They concluded higher persistent PSA levels were associated with a worse prognosis and that PSA should be assessed for at least 3 months to minimize overtreatment. We commend the authors for investigating this important topic and agree with these conclusions to some extent but note that a more precise PPP definition is needed to inform research reproducibility and clinical trial design.

We propose that PPP requires an initial PSA between 35 and 90 days after surgery, and a second, confirmatory PSA test be obtained when the initial value is detectable. The false-positive rate for PSAs within 5 weeks is high — given the 2- to 3-day half-life of PSA — and a likely explanation for the paradoxical findings in the study by Tilki et al1 of lower all-cause mortality for patients with PSA levels higher than 20 ng/mL, generally considered a high-risk feature, compared with those with lower PSA levels. Their results indicate approximately 20% of PSAs were obtained within 5 weeks without mention of repeated testing.

Similarly, in the MUSIC registry, we note that approximately 15% of patients have a PSA obtained outside the 35- to 90-day window and therefore, cannot be adequately characterized because they represent a mixed population consisting of detectable post-RP PSA with early false-positive testing results, true PPP, or early biochemical recurrence with late PSA testing. We suspect that adoption of our more precise PPP definition will confirm the authors' findings that higher post-RP PSA value is associated with PCSM and additionally show that higher pre-RP PSA will be associated with both increased incidence of PPP and ACM, as one would expect based on clinical risk. It is possible that men with undefined PPP status meet criteria for adjuvant treatment, and one could argue that early treatment was reasonable. But Tilki et al1 demonstrate poorer outcomes in this subgroup, suggesting many are overtreated even if ART was assumed to be reasonable.

In addition, recent trials and guidelines support early salvage RT over adjuvant RT, 2, 3 yet patients with PPP do not meet the definition of either adjuvant or salvage therapy and should more accurately be considered as receiving consolidative therapy, as we previously described.
4. The problem of incomplete post-RP evaluation with PSA is common. Future studies and clinical trials should maintain a standard definition of PPP, separating these particularly at-risk patients from those with biochemical recurrence. Corresponding Author: Brian R.

### Prostate-specific antigen level at the time of salvage therapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and the risk of death… [^114Lfedn]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results P = 0.008) compared with men who received sRT when the PSA was ≤ 0. 25 mg/mL. This elevated ACM-risk remained significant for all PSA cutpoints up to 0. 50 ng/mL but was not significant at PSA cutpoint values below
0. 25 ng/mL. Conclusion. Introduction 1and is US Food and Drug Administration approved. The approval was supported by findings from the phase III CONDOR trial, 1in which 63. 9% of men with PSA failure who did not have definitive evidence of recurrence using standard imaging had a change in management on the basis of the. Yet, at lower PSA levels < 0. 2 ng/mL, a meta-analysis 2where only histopathology was used to confirm the CLR found this value to be only 40% using 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. We would expect a similar CLR using the 18F-PSMA-11 tracer given that in a prospective double blinded randomized cross over study design the tracer.

18F-PSMA-11 was found to be noninferior to 68Ga-PSMA-11 in detecting PC in men with newly diagnosed or biochemically recurrent PC after RP. 3With only a 40% chance of correctly identifying recurrent disease at PSA levels < 0. 2 ng/mL, many insurers in the United States will not reimburse a PSMA-PET scan unless the patient has documented PSA failure as per the American Urological Association/American Society for Radiation Oncology/Society of Urologic Oncology definition. 4, 5.

7To assign PC-specific mortality as the cause of death, castrate-resistant metastatic PC on the basis of a rising PSA level in the setting of a testosterone level < 20 ng/dL before death needed to be confirmed and in addition the treating oncologist or urologist at the time of death needed to assign PC as the primary cause of death and record this on the death certificate. 12age at and year of RP which were treated as continuous covariates, and the established prognostic factors of the pre-RP PSA level, 7, 8–10] and margin status compared with men who received sRT when the PSA was ≤ 0. 25 mg/mL as shown in Table

Second, many insurers will not reimburse a PSMA PET scan until the PSA level exceeds a prespecified PSA threshold that is insurance specific. The results of the current study provide evidence to support that by waiting to initiate sRT after PSA failure may place some patients at increased ACM-risk.
