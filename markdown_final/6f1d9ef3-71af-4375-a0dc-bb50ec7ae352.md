## Question

Name of topical emolient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the names of topical emollients, including definitions, formulations, safety, effectiveness, and practical prescribing guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining emollients and distinguishing them from moisturizers. Then, I should categorize formulation types and their clinical implications. Next, I will review safety signals and adverse event reporting. After that, I need to appraise effectiveness data, including head-to-head comparisons and barrier effects. Finally, I will synthesize guideline recommendations and translate them into a pragmatic prescribing approach with examples and caveats, while verifying any conflicting statements along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Emollients are lipid-based topical preparations that soften and smooth the skin, whereas moisturizers hydrate the stratum corneum and may contain humectants; in practice, the terms are often used interchangeably, but the distinction matters when discussing mechanisms and formulation design [^111hncuv] [^111zZnAc].

> I will now examine formulation types and their clinical implications. Leave-on emollients include lotions, creams, gels, ointments, sprays, and balms, with creams and ointments most commonly recommended first-line in formularies; gels and lotions are also widely available, and sprays or balms are less common but present in some formularies [^113FkF7u]. Wait, let me verify the status of bath additives, because I recall conflicting guidance. Initially, I thought bath additives were universally discouraged, but hold on, I should double-check: the BATHE randomized trial showed no additional benefit of bath additives beyond standard care, and contemporary English formularies largely moved away from recommending them, yet some formularies still list bath additives with restrictions, so I should not overstate universality here [^116NCVkP] [^113Zfx1v] [^113w114R] [^1148k3DD].

> Next, I should review safety signals and adverse event reporting. Let me consider the frequency and nature of adverse effects. The most commonly reported adverse effects are pruritus, erythema, and burning or stinging on application; importantly, stinging is less frequent with ointments than with lotions, creams, or gels in the BEE trial, and in some studies up to about a third of participants stopped a product due to tolerability issues, underscoring that "mild" does not mean "insignificant" for adherence [^116GCgb3]. Hold on, I should verify the reporting quality claim. Multiple systematic reviews highlight inconsistent and incomplete adverse event reporting in emollient trials, with unclear methodologies and variable terminology, which complicates cross-product comparisons and patient counseling [^1157GtA9] [^113EFRJ3] [^112G8927].

> I need to check specific safety concerns and formulation cautions. Aqueous cream is frequently not recommended due to sodium lauryl sulfate, which can impair the barrier and provoke irritation, especially with leave-on use; conversely, simple petrolatum-based emollients are generally well tolerated and have a strong safety record, though patient acceptability can be limited by greasiness, which can be mitigated with application techniques [^113FkF7u] [^112trtbz] [^111nh4DK] [^112uUE4N]. But wait, what about antimicrobial emollients like Dermol? Formularies often restrict their use to short-term courses when infection risk is present, reflecting stewardship concerns, so I should avoid implying routine use [^113w114R] [^113FkF7u].

> Now, I will appraise effectiveness. Head-to-head evidence from the BEE trial shows no clinically meaningful difference in effectiveness among lotion, cream, gel, and ointment for childhood eczema over 16 weeks, supporting a patient-centered choice model rather than a hierarchy of emollient types [^116GCgb3]. Let me verify barrier effects, because not all emollients are equal physiologically. A within-subject RCT demonstrated that a urea–glycerol cream improved barrier function and reduced irritant susceptibility compared with a simple paraffin cream and glycerol-only cream, whereas the paraffin cream had no barrier benefit and reduced natural moisturizing factor, highlighting that formulation specifics matter beyond vehicle category [^111Epge4] [^117R7x9A]. I should also confirm that moisturizers reduce flares and steroid requirement; Cochrane data suggest fewer and later flares and less topical corticosteroid use with moisturizers versus no moisturizer, though heterogeneity is high and head-to-head ingredient comparisons remain limited [^117CgQgd].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with standards of care. Multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend liberal, frequent emollients as foundational therapy for atopic dermatitis, without endorsing a specific brand or ingredient, emphasizing individualized selection and adherence as key drivers of benefit [^11381LWh] [^117XGrw5] [^114xj2Qu] [^111Z5o2K]. Hold on, I should verify whether any specialty contexts modify this. In psoriasis, emollients are recommended adjuncts to reduce scale, improve comfort, and potentially enhance penetration or tolerability of anti-inflammatory topicals, again without specifying a product, reinforcing the general principle of routine emollient use [^117LvASS] [^113ihgGg].

> Translating this into practice, I need to ensure the approach is patient-centered and evidence-aligned. Let me first confirm the principle: the "best" emollient is the one the patient will use consistently, so matching texture preference, ease of application, and tolerability is paramount. Satisfaction and continuation are higher with lotions and gels than with ointments in pediatric cohorts, though individual preferences vary and should be trialed pragmatically [^114vwTBZ]. I should double-check that cost and access considerations are reasonable, as formularies often list many options and may rank by cost. However, given equivalent effectiveness across types, allowing patients to switch within types for acceptability is sensible while monitoring for irritation or poor control [^113FkF7u].

> Let me provide concrete examples while being careful not to overgeneralize. Simple, fragrance-free petrolatum-based ointments or white soft/liquid paraffin mixes are good starting points for high occlusion and low irritancy, though some find them cosmetically unacceptable; creams and lotions may be preferred for ease of spread, and gels can be acceptable alternatives, with trial-and-error guided by tolerability and adherence rather than presumed superiority of a vehicle [^113FkF7u] [^116GCgb3]. I should confirm that I'm not implying any single brand is superior; indeed, guidelines explicitly state that evidence is insufficient to recommend a specific moisturizer or active ingredient, so product choice should remain individualized and preference-driven [^11381LWh] [^111FJ2DM].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts briefly. For preterm infants, WHO suggests considering topical oils to support skin barrier maturation, but this is a different question than treating established eczema and should not be conflated with leave-on emollient therapy in older children or adults. For chronic hand eczema, emollients remain foundational, with no evidence favoring a specific moisturizer, so selection should integrate patient preference and exposure risks [^113dWRjQ] [^1112naRi]. But wait, what about prevention of atopic dermatitis in high-risk infants? The large BEEP trial found no preventive benefit and a possible increase in infections with daily emollients from birth, so routine neonatal prophylaxis should not be recommended outside trials, despite earlier mechanistic enthusiasm [^115Qb8WU] [^112trtbz].

> I should double-check a potential inconsistency I almost introduced. Earlier I implied bath additives are universally discouraged. However, while BATHE and subsequent formulary shifts led many systems to stop recommending bath additives, some formularies still list them with restrictions, so I should correct that overstatement and emphasize that routine bath additive use lacks supportive evidence and is generally not advised where formularies have updated to reflect BATHE and cost-effectiveness data [^116NCVkP] [^113Zfx1v] [^113w114R] [^1148k3DD].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. Emollients are a core component of atopic dermatitis care. No emollient type is consistently superior in effectiveness. Safety is generally favorable but not trivial, with stinging and irritation driving discontinuation. The most effective emollient is the one the patient uses liberally and regularly, chosen through shared decision-making and adjusted based on tolerability, season, and disease activity, with explicit attention to avoiding leave-on products with potential irritants like SLS in sensitive skin [^116GCgb3] [^115cSRme] [^11381LWh] [^113FkF7u].

Topical emollients are moisturizers applied to the skin to soften, hydrate, and restore barrier function [^111zZnAc], and are essential in managing dry skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and ichthyosis [^117XGrw5] [^117LvASS] [^113VvodK]. They are available as creams, ointments, lotions, gels, and sprays, with **creams and ointments most commonly recommended** for eczema care [^113FkF7u]. Regular, liberal use reduces itch, improves barrier function, and decreases flare frequency [^117CgQgd]; however, product choice should be individualized based on patient preference, skin type, and cost, as no single emollient is superior for all patients [^116GCgb3] [^113w114R].

## Common ingredients in topical emollients

Topical emollients contain various ingredients that contribute to their moisturizing and barrier-restoring properties:

- **Occlusives**: Petrolatum, dimethicone, beeswax, lanolin, mineral oil, and paraffin wax form a protective barrier, reducing transepidermal water loss (TEWL) [^115fWoSJ].

- **Humectants**: Glycerin, urea, propylene glycol, and hyaluronic acid attract and retain moisture, enhancing skin hydration [^115fWoSJ].

- **Emollients**: Ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol restore the skin barrier by replenishing lipids and improving skin elasticity [^111zZnAc].

- **Additives**: Preservatives, fragrances, and colorants may be included but can cause irritation or allergic reactions in sensitive individuals [^notfound].

---

## Clinical indications and benefits

Topical emollients are indicated for **various dermatological conditions**, including:

- **Atopic dermatitis (eczema)**: Regular emollient use reduces itch, improves barrier function, and decreases flare frequency [^117XGrw5] [^117CgQgd].

- **Psoriasis**: Emollients soften scales, reduce irritation, and enhance the penetration of topical medications [^117LvASS] [^115SMrYj].

- **Ichthyosis**: Emollients are essential for managing hyperkeratosis and reducing scaling [^113VvodK].

- **Chronic pruritus**: Emollients provide symptomatic relief by hydrating the skin and reducing itch sensation [^111BRfTw] [^111yrqmd].

---

## Application techniques and frequency

Effective emollient use requires **proper application techniques** and adherence:

- **Application method**: Apply emollients in the direction of hair growth to minimize folliculitis risk [^notfound].

- **Frequency**: Liberal and frequent application is recommended, typically 2–3 times daily or as needed [^notfound].

- **Timing**: Apply emollients after bathing or showering to lock in moisture [^111Z5o2K].

- **Quantity**: Use generous amounts, approximately 500g per week for adults with eczema [^notfound].

---

## Potential side effects and precautions

While generally safe, topical emollients may cause **mild side effects**, including:

- **Irritation**: Burning, stinging, or redness, particularly on broken or inflamed skin [^116GCgb3].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but possible, especially with fragranced or preservative-containing formulations [^113ihgGg].

- **Folliculitis**: Inflammation of hair follicles due to occlusive formulations [^117CgQgd].

- **Contact dermatitis**: Sensitivity to specific ingredients, such as lanolin or preservatives [^113ihgGg].

Precautions include **avoiding emollients with potential irritants** (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate) in patients with sensitive skin and monitoring for adverse reactions, especially in pediatric populations [^113FkF7u] [^114kaASt].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Emollient selection should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors:

- **Age**: Pediatric patients may require gentler formulations, while adults may tolerate thicker ointments [^notfound].

- **Skin type**: Oily skin may benefit from lighter lotions or gels, whereas dry skin may require richer creams or ointments [^notfound].

- **Preferences**: Patient acceptability and adherence significantly influence treatment success [^116GCgb3] [^114vwTBZ].

- **Cost**: Affordability and accessibility are important considerations, particularly for long-term use [^113w114R].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting emollient use

Robust clinical evidence supports the **regular use of emollients** in dermatological care:

- **Eczema management**: Emollients reduce disease severity, itch, and flare frequency, and improve quality of life [^117CgQgd] [^117XGrw5].

- **Psoriasis care**: Emollients enhance the efficacy of topical corticosteroids and improve patient comfort [^117LvASS] [^112sSMnw].

- **Ichthyosis treatment**: Emollients are essential for managing hyperkeratosis and maintaining skin hydration [^113VvodK].

---

## Conclusion

Topical emollients are essential in dermatological care, providing hydration, restoring the **skin barrier**, and alleviating symptoms of dry skin conditions. Regular, liberal use is recommended, with product selection tailored to **patient-specific factors** such as age, skin type, preferences, and cost. While generally safe, clinicians should monitor for **mild side effects** and adjust treatment accordingly.

### A comparison of myribase and doublebase gel: does qualitative similarity of emollient products imply their direct interchangeability in everyday practice? [^117HS226]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Taking into account that both emollient preparations appear to have similar compositions, and the fact that quantitative formulation and employed manufacturing processes were unknown to the investigators, the observed difference in skin moisturization performance may be attributed to the difference in the two emulsion systems' microstructure. This is in line with the three levels of product equivalence commonly controlled by the regulatory agencies: qualitative (Q1) and quantitative (Q2) composition and the arrangement of matter and microstructure of topical formulations. 3 Namely, according to the composition declared by both manufacturers, their similarity is evident at the Q1 level, but the Q2 level equivalence cannot be assumed.

The quantitative aspect of particular ingredients, alongside the selection of specific manufacturing parameters, determine the final microstructure and sensory properties of an emulsion type product. 26, 27 Within the investigated products, stabilized via the combination of a typical hydrophilic polymer (Carbomer) and a predominantly lipophilic surfactant (Sorbitan laurate), a unique emulsion system is formed, offering the possibility for diverse modes of water immobilization and plenty of variations in textural and rheological behavior. This scope for diversion is further complicated by the absence of data standardizing the quality of each ingredient. The names of the ingredients may be identical, but that provides no guarantee of interchangeability as regards chemical and physical conformity.

Obtained results are useful and relevant within the scope of our investigation, but it is important to mention that they may not necessarily apply to people with certain dry skin conditions, and achieved differences in SCM may not be translated into clinically important for some skin disorders, since our studies comprised healthy participants.

### Chronic hand eczema [^1112naRi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Treating HE depends on the severity, etiology, morphology, and location of HE, comorbidities, and, if possible, identification and avoidance of causal exogenous factors such as allergens and irritants (Table 3). Acute HE should be treated immediately to avoid chronicity, using topical anti-inflammatory agents and emollients. Full regeneration of the epidermal barrier takes several weeks or months. Patients must be advised to avoid re-exposing the skin before complete healing and stabilization of HE, and that prolonged exposure to potent topical corticosteroids may further impair the skin barrier function. The skin barrier on the palms needs more time for recovery compared with palmar locations. Treating CHE means a multimodal treatment concept including topical and systemic treatment together with general measures such as continuing use of emollients. Patients tend not to use topicals when receiving a systemic treatment, and not to use emollients when topical treatment is started with glucocorticoids and immunomodulators. A Cochrane review identified 60 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a considerable heterogeneity in the use and duration of treatments, outcome measures, and long-term control. Only 24 studies included a follow-up period.

Treatment recommendations for hand eczema (adapted from Thyssen et al.)

HE hand eczema

a Off-label systemic treatment, except for atopic HE in some countries

b Off-label systemic treatment for HE

c Off-label topical treatment, except for HE of atopic etiology

Topical Treatments

Emollients/moisturizers are used for the treatment of HE but evidence of their efficacy is limited. A Cochrane review included two small studies on the protective use of emollients but no conclusions were drawn on efficacy. Three additional studies showed that emollients may reduce severity and itch. There is no evidence that supports the use of any specific moisturizers in HE, however emollients are used in HE to maintain and/or improve skin barrier function. The preference of the patient as well as existing (contact) allergies must be considered. Use, acceptance, and compliance with emollients/moisturizers can be improved when easy accessibility (for example, in a dispenser in an easily accessible place) along with clear instructions on how, when, and which product to choose are provided.

Depending on national practices, tanning substances (lotion, cream, bath, e.g. Tannolakt ®, Tannosynt ®) and topical antipruritic substances such as menthanol and urea (preferentially in hyperkeratotic CHE) complement topical treatment modalities.

### Capturing and reporting topical treatment use in childhood eczema: lessons for data collection in eczema trials [^113q4L5w]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCS) prevent and treat flares in eczema. However, topical treatment use is poorly recorded and reported in clinical trials. There is no clear consensus of how best to capture and summarize topical treatment use.

Objectives

To explore different ways of capturing and reporting topical treatment use in childhood eczema.

Methods

This was a secondary data analysis using 450 participants from the Best Emollients for Eczema (BEE) trial. Participants were allocated to use one type of emollient (lotion, cream, gel or ointment) 'twice daily and when required' for 16 weeks. Otherwise, clinical management remained unchanged. Parents completed weekly questions about topical therapy use and eczema symptoms. Two versions of topical treatment use questionnaires were used. The first (n = 202, 44.9%) asked parents to report treatment use on days 1–7, starting completion on the day they were randomized. The second (n = 248, 55.1%) reported use by day of the week (Monday to Sunday), starting completion the first Monday after randomization. Both underwent patient and public involvement review but the second version was tested more thoroughly using cognitive interviewing techniques, following parent feedback that questions on the first version were confusing. Descriptive statistics compared questionnaire completion and differences in emollient and TCS use.

Results

Overall, questionnaire completion for both emollient and TCS use decreased with time, but at weeks 1 and 16, it was 84.7% (381/450) and 58.9% (265/450) for emollient use, and 94.2% (424/450) and 80.4% (362/450) for TCS use, respectively. Fewer emollient use questionnaires were completed with the first (33.5%, 1082/3232 patient-weeks) than the second (87.9%, 3489/3968 patient-weeks) version (P < 0.001). TCS use questionnaire completion were similar for both (84.9%, 2744/3232 patient-weeks and 87.4%, 3468/3968 patient-weeks, P = 0.002). We present different ways of summarizing topical treatment use.

Conclusions

Although questionnaire completion was similar for TCS use, emollient-use data completeness was higher in the second version. When designing questionnaires, balancing the detail and complexity of questions is important, especially if being collected as a secondary outcome measure. Numerous ways of summarizing the same data can provide different information. Future collection and reporting of treatment use should reflect specific trial aims.

### Skin antisepsis in the neonate: what should we use? [^111bHLPZ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neonates in intensive care are more susceptible to sepsis. Infection is commonly acquired via the transcutaneous portal. It is necessary to identify the most effective yet safest topical antiseptics for use in neonates to reduce nosocomial sepsis.

Recent Findings

Recent national surveys indicate that a wide range of topical antiseptic preparations are used in the neonatal nursery. There are very few comparative studies in neonates and no robust evidence in favour of any particular antiseptic. There are significant safety and potential toxicity issues for neonates with all the commonly used antiseptics, particularly in very small immature babies. There are no convincing roles for routine application of emollient creams on the skin, topical antiseptics on the umbilical stump, or maternal vaginal washes with chlorhexidine for the prevention of neonatal infection.

Summary

Large multicentre trials are needed to determine the optimal antiseptic to use for neonates undergoing intensive care, especially for extremely preterm infants.

### Emollient prescribing formularies and guidelines in england, 2021: a cross-sectional study [^115LmU1h]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Emollient formularies and guidelines should be easily accessible and clear to follow, in order to suit time‐pressured GPs, who manage most people with dry skin conditions. There have been some notable changes since 2017, both in respect to the number of formularies and their recommendations. Although CCG mergers have led to greater sharing of fewer formularies, there was limited improvement in emollient formulary/guideline consistency across the country. The formularies and guidelines still differ greatly in their formats and level of detail, and some even contradict themselves. The bewildering number of emollients is still poorly substantiated. There has been a dramatic shift in the recommendation of bath additives in England following the BATHE trial results, and now the majority of formularies do not recommend their use. There is a need for better evidence to guide emollient prescribing and improve resource use.

### Safety of petroleum-based emollients in pediatric atopic dermatitis [^111nh4DK]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that severely impacts the quality of life of both children and adults. Effectively managing AD entails addressing acute inflammatory symptoms, avoiding triggers, and preserving the homeostasis of the skin barrier with emollients. Petrolatum-based emollients are affordable occlusive agents that prevent moisture loss and create a protective layer on the skin to support healing; however, apprehensions, often stemming from safety-related information circulating on social media and mobile applications, have led to increased reluctance among parents and caregivers to use these products to treat their child's AD. This review aims to consolidate the available information in the literature concerning the safety of petrolatum-based emollients while comparing this with the information found in popular mobile applications used to check product safety and health information.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^116NCVkP]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Childhood eczema (also known as atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) is a common condition that can have a substantial impact on quality of life for children and their families. Guidelines suggest that complete emollient therapy forms the mainstay of treatment for eczema and should be used regularly with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors, used in addition for flare-ups.

Emollients are thought to act by providing a barrier over the skin, decreasing moisture loss, and protecting against skin irritants. Emollients are applied in one of three ways: leave-on, where emollients are directly applied to the skin; soap substitutes, where emollients are used instead of soap or other wash products; and bath additives, comprising oil or emulsifiers, or both designed to be added to bath water and thought to leave a film of oil over the skin. Some emollients can be used in more than one way. We therefore use the term "emollient bath additives" or "bath additives" rather than bath emollients to emphasise the differences between the three methods of application in recognition that products may have more than one method of application.

Although there is evidence for the need for leave-on emollientsand widespread clinical consensus around soap substitutes, there is less agreement about the potential additional benefits of bath additivesand a dearth of evidence on their effectiveness. Systematic reviews have found no evidence of effectiveness, and one small study suggested bath additives might actually worsen eczema outcomes. Bath additives are, however, widely prescribed at a cost of more than £23m ($33m; €26m) annually to the National Health Service in England.

We determined both the clinical effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of including emollient bath additives in the standard management of eczema in children.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^111FJ2DM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — moisturizers: Severity improvements have been observed on the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) tool and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), with a standardized mean difference [SMD] of 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17–0.85; an SMD of 0.2 to 0.5 is considered to represent a small effect, while an SMD of 0.5 to 0.8 represents a moderate effect. One study reported a small but significant improvement in AD severity with a moisturizer, as mean EASI score decreased from 28.3 to 24.3, P = 0.024. Analysis of 5 studies showed patient assessment of disease severity improved in experimental groups (79% vs 42.9%), though not statistically significant (Risk ratio [RR]: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.89–5.64). Moisturizers may also reduce itch; a lipopolysaccharide-containing cream demonstrated a significant difference at week 4 (P < .01). The literature supports a strong recommendation for moisturizer use based on moderate certainty evidence; however, the use of any particular moisturizer or active ingredient in an emollient cannot be recommended based on the limited available evidence. Safety data from 5 studies found adverse events occurring in 34.3% of treatment arms versus 22.1% of control arms (RR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01–1.74), and moisturizers are generally safe, with rare serious adverse effects.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^116QrLfv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multi-system disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In this third of 6 sections of the guidelines of care for psoriasis, we discuss the use of topical medications for the treatment of psoriasis. The majority of patients with psoriasis have limited disease (< 5% body surface area involvement) and can be treated with topical agents, which generally provide a high efficacy-to-safety ratio. Topical agents may also be used adjunctively for patients with more extensive psoriasis undergoing therapy with either ultraviolet light, systemic or biologic medications. However, the use of topical agents as monotherapy in the setting of extensive disease or in the setting of limited, but recalcitrant, disease is not routinely recommended. Treatment should be tailored to meet individual patients' needs. We will discuss the efficacy and safety of as well as offer recommendations for the use of topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, tazarotene, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, emollients, salicylic acid, anthralin, coal tar, as well as combination therapy.

The results of the studies of products described above cannot necessarily be extrapolated to all similarly described products. To help guide the manufacturers of baby skin care products, "ideal" product attributes have been recommended (Table 9). It is hoped that these recommendations will serve as a benchmark for the future development of cleansers, wipes, and emollients. Translation of these recommendations into practical guidance to aid product recommendation and selection could warrant the development of a system by which individual products are rated for suitability for infant skin according to a set of predefined criteria. Such a system, if clear and widely adopted, has the potential to simplify choice and help protect infants from suboptimal products.

### Different types of emollient cream exhibit diverse physiological effects on the skin barrier in adults with atopic dermatitis [^114kaASt]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema, AD) is a common inflammatory disease of the skin, characterized by persistent skin dryness and a reduced function of the skin as a barrier to the outside environment. The liberal use of moisturizers (emollients) is encouraged as a baseline therapy for AD, with anti‐inflammatory treatments added as required. A growing, albeit still small, body of evidence has suggested that regular use of moisturizers can prolong the flare‐free period and reduce the amount of anti‐inflammatory treatment needed. This has stoked interest in moisturizers and supported the compelling hypothesis that, by correcting the skin barrier defect, the primary development of AD can be delayed or even prevented. In recent years, a number of studies have investigated this hypothesis with varying results, and have raised important questions about the intervention itself. Importantly, not all moisturizers have the same effect on the skin; some moisturizers impart superior hydration, while some appear to exert no positive (or negative) biophysical effects, and others appear to increase skin permeability to irritants and increase skin infections. Aqueous cream, for example, is associated with a high rate of adverse cutaneous reactions in children. The variability of moisturizer effects could go a long way to explain the challenges patients experience in controlling the condition and the poor overall adherence with topical therapy. In light of this, the aim of this work was to determine the barrier‐strengthening properties of a new moisturizer, containing the active ingredients urea and glycerol (urea–glycerol cream; UGC), compared with two reference creams, a glycerol‐containing moisturizer (glycerol cream; GC) and a simple paraffin cream [PC; containing no humectant, and with a no‐treatment control (NTC)].

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^115cSRme]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

This review collected data on the adverse events that were reported. If adverse events were experienced but there was no method to collect this information then it would have been missed. This review was also limited by only including papers published in English and only searching one database (MEDLINE). This review only focused on RCTs, which means that other study types with relevant information will have been missed.

The van Zuuren et al. Cochrane review of trials comparing moisturizers in the treatment of eczema, concluded that adverse event reporting for emollients needed to be more 'complete'. This more in-depth assessment highlights a lack of consistency in the methodology used to collect data on adverse events.

Previous research has also highlighted that adverse events were generally mild in nature and uncommon with emollients and moisturizers. Yet 31% of the papers in this review had a participant stop using a product because of treatment-related side-effects. Adverse events maybe mild but they are not insignificant. It is therefore important that adverse events are accurately recorded and reported to improve clinical practice. Since running the searches, the Best Emollients for Eczema (BEE) trial has been published, which reported that 37% of children experienced one or more adverse event, although (with the exception of stinging) this did not differ between lotions, creams, gels or ointments.

A study looking at unwanted side-effects of emollients also found stinging or burning on application to be one of the more commonly experienced adverse events; however, this symptom could be considered a normal response to an emollient and associated with the severity of the eczema rather than an adverse event.

### Clinical evaluation of a diaper containing a shea butter-based emollient and impact on diapered skin erythema [^112nkNJL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Skin, the body's largest organ, is one of nature's key biological sensors to the outside world, with touch being the first sense to develop in utero. Skin development in utero relies in part on a skin coating, called vernix caseosa, a waxy‐like substance composed of water associated with cells (~80%), proteins (~10%) and lipids (~10%) like ceramides, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Newborn skin care protocols recommend retaining vernix based on positive effects in temperature control, as a physical barrier to protect the skin, to maintain skin's moisture balance, establish the skin's acidic pH and establishment of the skin microbiome. Attempts to recapitulate vernix's function via topical emollients have been safely used for over a century.

Topical therapeutics are often used to prevent or treat dermatitis in the diapered area (DDA), characterized predominantly by erythema (redness) and rarely papules and/or pustules. DDA identification and prevention is a top concern of parents as it is the most common skin ailment during the first years of life with an incidence rate of 16%–65%, although all babies will experience DDA at some point. The prevalence and severity of DDA is impacted by skin hygiene routines including topical interventions. Attempts to simulate the skin benefits of vernix are apparent in marketed powders, creams, oils, ointments, and lotions, many of which contain petrolatum. Skin care ingredients also include glycerin, mineral oil, panthenol, shea butter or various "natural oils" (e.g. coconut, sunflower). These topical products play an important role in providing a physical barrier on skin to lower the risk of overhydration in the wet diaper environment. This is especially important in the diapered area as more hydrated skin has a higher coefficient of friction and is more easily damaged. They also help reduce skin contact with irritants in the urine and feces, including proteases (enzymes that digest skin proteins) and lipases (enzymes that digest skin lipids), many of which have increased activity at neutral/alkaline pH, but low activity in an acidic environment. Urine can be especially irritating in the presence of urease‐containing bacteria (living on skin or from stool) which convert urea to ammonia (pH = 11), resulting in elevated skin pH and elevated fecal enzyme activity.

Adverse events data capture and methodology

The majority of reports, 89% (31/35), did capture data on adverse events related to the treatment, although only 58% (18/31) provided a specific report into the nature of the adverse events experienced. The other papers provided a broad summary of adverse events explaining either there were no adverse events experienced or highlighting that the product was deemed safe.

The methods used to capture the data on adverse events were poorly explained. Most reports (14/35; 40%) were unclear. Where stated, 26% (9/35) were investigator assessed, 6% (2/35) were patient reported, and 1 studyused both the investigator and the patient to capture adverse event data (Table 1).

Table 1
Methodology and reporting on adverse events (AEs) (n = 35)

A range of other methods were mentioned such as patient diaries, case report forms, and questionnaires. Two studies shared their questionnaire on adverse events. One focused on the frequency of adverse events, the other had a graph, which showed the question used for data capture ('How bothered were you by the study regime's side effects?') and the results. Angelova-Fischer et al. did not share their questionnaire, but present the results of the frequency and nature of the adverse events for the three products used in the trial.

Nature of adverse events

In 31% (11/35) of the studies, one or more patients stopped using the product because of treatment-related adverse events. In each of these studies a more detailed report of adverse events experienced was reported. In five of the studies, it was unclear if patients stopped using the product or not.,

Where studies did provide information on the type of side-effects experienced from the emollient the most common were 'pruritis', 'burning on application', and 'erythema' (Table 2).,​, Eleven studies mentioned 'other' symptoms, of these 'irritation' was the most common, followed by 'papule' (Figure 2).,

### Emollient prescribing formularies and guidelines in england, 2021: a cross-sectional study [^112t7VoR]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Emollients are universally recommended as first‐line treatment for eczema in children and adults. They can be used as 'leave‐on' treatments, soap substitutes and bath additives, and are grouped according to their formulation. The majority are creams, ointments, gels or lotions, which vary in their level of greasiness, i.e. their oil/water ratios. A minority are available as sprays (e.g. Dermamist; Alliance Pharmaceuticals, Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK) or balms (e.g. Flexitol® Heel Balm; Thornton & Ross, Linthwaite, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK).

In the UK, as in other countries, clinical care is supported by national (e.g. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) and local guidelines and by emollient formularies. In 2018, Chan et al.summarized the emollient formularies for all 216 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and local Health Boards in England and Wales. They identified 102 formularies, which named 109 emollients and 24 bath additives, with poor consensus over which emollient should be used as first‐line treatments. Since then, the Bath Additives for the Treatment of ChildHood Eczema (BATHE) trial has been published, which demonstrated no additional benefit from bath additives for children. The Best Emollients for Eczema trial, comparing the four main types of emollients, has just reported. It is therefore an opportune time to update the 2018 review, to see what changes have been made to emollient formularies in England since 2017.

### Emollient satisfaction questionnaire: validation study in children with eczema [^1112AtbM]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests that the 'best' emollient is the one that patients prefer after a period of testing. An emollient may be effective but only if acceptable and used by the patient. Our study suggests that, compared with Diprobase cream and Hydromol ointment, Aveeno lotion was preferred by parents. However, as only one of each emollient type were used in this trial, the findings may be specific to these particular emollients and not generalizable to a wider range of emollients.

Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed with patch testing. If irritation develops, Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections

If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

### Emollient prescribing formularies and guidelines in england, 2021: a cross-sectional study [^112cBArA]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emollients are a mainstay of treatment for dry skin conditions. In the UK, prescribers are usually expected to follow local National Health Service (NHS) formularies. A previous study in 2018 showed that the recommended emollients across England and Wales varied widely. Evidence has since emerged that bath additives provide no additional clinical benefit in eczema.

Aim

To compare emollient formularies and guidelines in England.

Methods

Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) formularies and guidelines were identified in April-May 2021, compiled and then analysed descriptively.

Results

In total, 105 CCGs, 72 emollient formularies and 47 emollient prescribing guidelines were identified. There were internal inconsistencies between formularies and their accompanying guidelines in 19% of cases. The majority (68%) of formularies/guidelines were organized using a ranking system. In total, 126 different leave-on emollients were named. Creams and ointments were universally available and were the most recommended first-line types. Cost was more likely than patient choice to be recommended as a criterion for selecting which emollient to prescribe. Aqueous cream was the leave-on emollient most commonly not recommended. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of formularies stated that bath additives should not be prescribed.

Conclusion

All CCGs in England have an emollient formulary/guideline, but there is still great variability between them in their recommendations. Although the number of formularies/guidelines has reduced since 2017, there has been an increase in the total number of unique recommended leave-on emollients. Most CCGs are no longer recommending bath emollients for eczema.

### A comparison of myribase and doublebase gel: does qualitative similarity of emollient products imply their direct interchangeability in everyday practice? [^117L45kJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Emollients are acknowledged as a part of standard care in therapeutic and prevention protocols as well as a part of everyday skin care routine. When it comes to making a final decision between two emollient products, the ingredient list, that is, the formulation composition could be the determining factor. In such cases the consumer, and some healthcare providers, believe that products with the same qualitative composition (ingredient list) must have the same efficacy. In this study, we have investigated the skin hydration performance of two emollient preparations (DBG and MBG), which appear to contain the same ingredients, and hence, could be considered interchangeable in everyday practice. Our studies showed that the effects of DBG were overall superior to the ones attributed to MBG at each investigated time point (1, 2, 4, and 24h post application) when tested on normal and dry skin. Consequently, it is shown that two apparently qualitatively identical products do not necessarily provide matching efficacy.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^1117bEMa]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review highlights a lack of consistency in the methods used to assess and report on adverse events. One way to reduce the variability in methodology would be to agree on a list of events to be routinely reported and create standardized tools to aid their collection. The BEE trial summarized the findings from patient-completed questionnaires by symptom and emollient type, clearly demonstrating the frequency and nature of the adverse event. This was similar to Angelova-Fischer et al. but included a more extensive list of symptoms such as worsening of eczema, peeling of skin and swelling.

Further research into the nature of adverse events from use of emollients would be welcome to help shed light on what could be considered a 'normal' but unpleasant effect of an emollient on the skin and what is an adverse event. This will improve the ability of clinicians to educate patients as to what to expect from their emollient and hopefully improve adherence to treatment.

Adverse events in RCTs about emollients used in the treatment of eczema are poorly reported. The methodology used to collect data on adverse events varies and often was unclear. Improving the quality of data collection and reporting using standardized tools could help improve our understanding of the relative merits of different emollients.

### Effectiveness and safety of lotion, cream, gel, and ointment emollients for childhood eczema: a pragmatic, randomised, phase 4, superiority trial [^116GCgb3]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

To our knowledge, there are no trials comparing emollients commonly used for childhood eczema. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of the four main emollient types: lotions, creams, gels, and ointments.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, individually randomised, parallel group, phase 4 superiority trial in 77 general practice surgeries in England. Children aged between 6 months and 12 years with eczema (Patient Orientated Eczema Measure [POEM] score > 2) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1; stratified by centre and minimised by baseline POEM score and age, using a web-based system) to lotions, creams, gels, or ointments. Clinicians and parents were unmasked. The initial emollient prescription was for 500 g or 500 mL, to be applied twice daily and as required. Subsequent prescriptions were determined by the family. The primary outcome was parent-reported eczema severity over 16 weeks (weekly POEM), with analysis as randomly assigned regardless of adherence, adjusting for baseline and stratification variables. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants. This trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN84540529.

Findings

Between Jan 19, 2018, and Oct 31, 2019, 12417 children were assessed for eligibility, 550 of whom were randomly assigned to a treatment group (137 to lotion, 140 to cream, 135 to gel, and 138 to ointment). The numbers of participants who contributed at least two POEM scores and were included in the primary analysis were 131 in the lotion group, 137 in the cream group, 130 in the gel group, and 126 in the ointment group. Baseline median age was 4 years (IQR 2–8); 255 (46%) participants were girls, 295 (54%) were boys; 473 (86%) participants were White; and the mean POEM score was 9.3 (SD 5.5). There was no difference in eczema severity between emollient types over 16 weeks (global p value = 0.77), with adjusted POEM pairwise differences of: cream versus lotion 0.42 (95% CI -0.48 to 1.32), gel versus lotion 0.17 (-0.75 to 1.09), ointment versus lotion -0.01 (-0.93 to 0.91), gel versus cream -0.25 (-1.15 to 0.65), ointment versus cream -0.43 (-1.34 to 0.48), and ointment versus gel -0.18 (-1.11 to 0.75). This result remained unchanged following multiple imputation, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses. The total number of adverse events did not significantly differ between the treatment groups (lotions 49 [36%], creams 54 [39%], gels 54 [40%], and ointments 48 [35%]; p = 0.79), although stinging was less common with ointments (12 [9%] of 138 participants) than lotions (28 [20%] of 137), creams (24 [17%] of 140), or gels (25 [19%] of 135).

Interpretation

We found no difference in effectiveness between the four main types of emollients for childhood eczema. Users need to be able to choose from a range of emollients to find one that they are more likely to use effectively.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^113EFRJ3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

What is already known about this topic?

Emollients use in people with eczema is determined by effectiveness and acceptability.
Adverse events associated with emollient use are usually mild but estimates of their frequency vary widely.

What does this study add?

Adverse event reporting in trials of emollients for eczema is poor and data are collected inconsistently across randomized controlled trials.
Standardization of the methods of collecting and reporting emollient adverse effects would help with comparisons across different studies and products.

Atopic dermatitis/eczema ('eczema') is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition, affecting children and adults. Its global prevalence is steadily increasing. It is characterized by dry and itchy skin, prone to lichenification and skin infections. Emollients are recommended in the treatment of eczema; to soothe pruritis, to improve the skin's barrier function and to help reduce the recurrence of disease flares. However, underuse is common and may be related to the acceptability of different products, including any adverse effects. A 2017 Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing emollients in eczema reported that adverse events were only reported in half of studies (41/77), and these were uninformative. A more recent systematic review (2019) that included RCTs, cohort studies, case–control studies and case reports, also concluded that adverse events were poorly reported, with estimates of how common adverse events were widely varying (2–59% of patients).

Extending the above work, the aim of this systematic review was to look at how RCTs captured data on adverse events associated with emollient use and what symptoms they discussed and reported on when they did.

### Emollient prescribing formularies and guidelines in england, 2021: a cross-sectional study [^113w114R]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

There has been an increase in uniquely named emollients between 2017 and 2021, from 109 to 126 different products. Creams and ointments remain the most recommended formulation types. Interestingly, the top two most recommended leave‐on emollients (Dermol 500 lotion and Dermol cream) possess antimicrobial properties. However, most formularies (81% for Dermol 500 lotion, 72% for Dermol cream) listing these qualify their use by indication. In 1998, Whitefield wrote about a new antimicrobial emollient on the market, which was liked by most patients and consequently clinicians, but two decades later, a paper published in 2019 counselled prescribers to think carefully about the use of topical antimicrobials, in order to reduce antimicrobial resistance.

A notable change since 2017 is the increase in formularies/guidelines not recommending the use of bath additives. Nearly three‐quarters (74%) of the formularies/guidelines did not recommend the use of bath additives, compared with in 2017, when 82% of formularies in England and Wales recommended them. In 2018, 75% of the formularies recommending bath additives did not provide any rationale, contrasting with 63%, who now give a reason for their recommendation against them, referencing specific research evidence and/or NHS England guidance. While acknowledging that the BATHE study population were children, the NHS guidance felt able to extrapolate the findings to adolescents and adults with eczema as well.

This is the English version of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis 2021. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. In Japan, from the perspective of evidence-based medicine, the current strategies for the treatment of AD consist of three primary measures: (i) use of topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus ointment, and delgocitinib ointment as the main treatment of the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling, and advice about daily life. In the present revised guidelines, descriptions of three new drugs, namely, dupilumab, delgocitinib, and baricitinib, have been added. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Daily emollient during infancy for prevention of eczema: the BEEP randomised controlled trial [^115Qb8WU]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

We found 102 systematic reviews on eczema prevention but none dealing with barrier enhancement. Two randomised controlled trials of emollients for prevention of eczema have been published since our search: one from Japan including 459 infants (which tested Locobase REPAIR cream, Daiichi Sankyo, Japan) and the second from the USA including 100 infants (which tested Cetaphil Restoraderm, Galderma Laboratories, TX, USA). These two studies used ceramide-containing emollients, neither of which showed any significant preventive effect against development of eczema. Several additional ongoing trials investigating skin barrier interventions for eczema prevention have been identified, one of which (PreventADALL) is reported in this issue.

Added value of this study

The BEEP study of 1394 infants, the first large randomised controlled trial to specifically investigate whether emollients could prevent eczema, found no evidence to support the hypothesis that advice to use daily emollients can prevent eczema (primary outcome), food allergy, sensitisation, allergic rhinitis, or wheezing (secondary outcomes), and some evidence to suggest an increase in skin infections in those using emollients. Given the demanding nature of asking parents to apply emollients to the whole body for 12 months, we were pleased with reported adherence proportions of 88%, 82%, and 74% at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months respectively.

Implications of all the available evidence

Since the publication of the two small efficacy studies, health-care professionals have started to recommend emollient for the primary prevention of eczema in high-risk families. This large, pragmatic study suggests that emollients used in this way do not prevent eczema and might be associated with harm, and that such practices should be stopped unless new evidence suggests otherwise. Knowledge of the neonatal skin barrier and optimal emollient formulation has progressed since the BEEP study was initiated, so new products might potentially exert a protective effect, which could be enhanced if accompanied by additional measures such as soft water and avoidance of soap.

Simple emollient formulations are inexpensive, widely available, and used extensively for treating eczema, and if effective in preventing eczema, could represent a breakthrough in reducing eczema incidence globally. We undertook this large, pragmatic trial to test the hypothesis that emollient use in the first year of life in high-risk infants (ie, with a family history of atopic disease) can prevent eczema and other atopic diseases including food allergy.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^111hncuv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

In this review we included all interventions designed to improve the skin barrier in infants, either by enhancement or by promotion of the barrier through hydration via directly applied topical products, such as emollients or moisturisers, or through the reduction of potential damage to the skin barrier and consequent dryness through various means such as avoiding soaps or reducing water hardness. We expected that promotion of the skin barrier and skin hydration through topical emollients would be the most widely used intervention. Emollients are described as mainly lipid‐based products that smooth the skin, whereas moisturisers give water and moisture to the skin (Penzer 2012). However, sometimes 'emollient' is referred to as an ingredient of 'moisturisers' (Lodén 2012). There is not yet a clear nomenclature for topical preparations for the skin. The terms 'moisturiser' and 'emollient' are used interchangeably in different settings to describe directly applied topical products. Several different 'classes' or 'formulations' of emollients and moisturisers are available, including oil‐in‐water creams, water‐in‐oil creams, ointments, lotions, oils, gels, sprays, and emulsions (Van Zuuren 2017). However, these may not accurately reflect the format, ingredient, and effects of the product. Further complicating this is the fact that many skin care products are classed as cosmetics and are therefore not subjected to the same regulations as medicines. A recently proposed classification includes considering the vehicle, formulation, and active ingredients (Surber 2017).

### Emollient satisfaction questionnaire: validation study in children with eczema [^1131TXy7]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eczema (also termed atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition predominately affecting children. Treatment guidelines recommend a stepped approach to management, tailoring treatment to disease severity. Leave‐on emollients are recommended as maintenance therapy for all severities of the disease. There is a wide variety of emollients available, which vary in consistency from watery lotions, through creams and gels, to solid ointments. The most common reason for treatment failure is underuse of topical therapies.

There is reasonable evidence that emollients improve disease severity, and may reduce the need for corticosteroids, but there are limited data on the relative effectiveness (and user acceptability) of different types. A Cochrane review identified 77 trials evaluating the effectiveness of emollients, but the authors were unable to conclude whether some of the emollients, or their ingredients, are better than others. Head‐to‐head comparisons in clinical randomized controlled trials can be challenging, and are expensive to undertake. While satisfaction questionnaires can be included as outcomes in trials, they can also be used in cross‐sectional studies as an economical means of obtaining opinions. However, the few published 'emollient satisfaction' questionnaires lack evidence of their validity, i.e. 'the degree to which an instrument truly measures the construct(s) it purports to measure'. Therefore, we aimed to assess the validity of a questionnaire designed to assess user satisfaction with a given emollient, the Emollient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ESQ), which was used in the Choice of Moisturiser for Eczema Treatment (COMET) trial.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^116N7QTD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The review was prospectively registered on Research Registry (unique number: reviewregistry1441) and conducted/reported in line with PRISMA guidance (Appendix S1; see the Supporting Information).

Literature search

The MEDLINE database (Ovid) was searched from 1946 to May 2022. The search strategy used is given in Appendix S2; see the Supporting Information.

The citations were exported into Microsoft Excel, and their eligibility assessed. Firstly, they were screened using the title and abstract. Next, the remaining papers were read in full to create a list of eligible papers. Lastly, these were then reviewed for any additional papers, which were then added to create the final list to be used for data extraction and analysis. Papers were independently screened by two authors (E.R.E. and S.C. or M. A.) and any questions were discussed with a fourth author (M.J.R.) until a decision was made.

Quality assessment

An overall quality assessment of the papers included was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for RCTs.M. A. led this assessment and ambiguities were resolved with E.R.E. and M.J.R.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were: RCTs of moisturizers or emollients used as a leave-on treatment (as the intervention or control) in adults or children with atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis. Papers were excluded if: they did not study leave-on emollients or moisturizers (e.g. bath additives or soap substitutes); were not RCTs; included patients with other diagnoses; the use of emollients as preventative treatments; were not published in English; and were not in humans.

Emollients or moisturizers used in the treatment of eczema do not have a strict definition, but for the purposes of this review were defined as products applied directly to the skin to help retain moisture. They did not contain recognized anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors.

The adverse events focused on in this report are those related to the treatment.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^114Q3WTu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

A Cochrane Skin prioritisation process in 2017, which included the involvement of people with eczema, identified 'network meta‐analysis of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for treating eczema' as a key priority for a Cochrane Skin review (Presley 2019). This research question was prioritised because there is currently inadequate evidence to guide treatment decisions for topical anti‐inflammatory agents in eczema. Most new topical therapies are initially compared against vehicle (a carrier system for an active treatment, which can also be used on its own as an emollient). This makes it difficult for healthcare professionals and people with eczema to make a judgement on how the new treatment compares with existing active treatments in terms of benefits and potential harms and cost (Williams 2021). The relative absence of reliable comparative clinical trial data means that treatment decisions when using topical anti‐inflammatory products for eczema are sometimes not evidence‐based.

Defining the most effective and safest topical treatments would ensure that resources are best allocated in eczema management. Commencing safe, effective topical therapy may also reduce the need for repeat primary care visits and secondary care referrals resulting from uncontrolled disease, an inability to start a certain medication, or a lack of confidence in the safety profile of certain medications.

To our knowledge, there are no large, well‐conducted and transparently reported platform trials with multiple topical anti‐inflammatory treatments to compare efficacy and safety. A well‐conducted network meta‐analysis (NMA) is therefore the best method available to make direct and indirect comparisons between the many treatments available for eczema. Our review is especially timely due to the large number of new therapeutics emerging in this area. Without undertaking this planned work, there will likely be confusion surrounding the best topical treatment for eczema, and potentially an associated increase in prescription costs without a positive impact on patient outcomes.

### Emollient satisfaction questionnaire: validation study in children with eczema [^111nZXCW]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Analysed version of the Emollient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ESQ) from the Choice of Moisturiser for Eczema Treatment (COMET) trial. This is the version of the questionnaire we recommend be used in future studies.

A total scaled emollient satisfaction score was calculated by summing the individual scores (0–4) of Questions 1–7. We used unweighted scores for each item as we deemed each item to equally represent the construct of interest (emollient satisfaction). Only participants who had completed all seven questions without any 'don't know' responses were included in total score calculations. Therefore, total scaled emollient satisfaction scores ranged from 0 to 28 (low to high satisfaction).

Hypotheses formulation

To assess the construct validity of the ESQ, we formulated and tested the following two hypotheses.

Hypothesis 1

Emollient satisfaction is higher for participants who give a higher overall rating for their allocated emollient. We assessed this by comparing total scaled emollient satisfaction score with overall emollient satisfaction item: 'Overall, how satisfied were you with the emollient that you were given as part of this study?'.

Hypothesis 2

Emollient satisfaction is higher for participants who intend to continue using their allocated emollient; we assessed this by comparing total scaled emollient satisfaction score and overall emollient satisfaction item with intention for continued emollient use item: 'Will you carry on using this emollient?'.

Free‐text comments were sought to support or refute the validity of individual items or of the questionnaire overall.

Data analysis

Data were imported into using STATA software (V16.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and all analyses were performed using this software. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the baseline characteristics of participants, and the distributions of individual and total scaled satisfaction scores (both overall distribution and by emollient type). Mean ± SD or median and interquartile range (IQR) were used for continuous data. Frequencies and percentages were used for categorical data. Completion rates of individual questionnaire items were assessed. Each item was assessed for floor and ceiling effects by calculating the proportion of participants selecting the lowest and highest response options, respectively, for each item. We did not prespecify what constituted a floor/ceiling effect, but conventionally this can be between 5% and 15% of responses. The χ² test, Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Kruskal–Wallis tests with Bonferroni correction were performed as appropriate to explore associations.

### Emollient product design: objective measurements of formulation structure, texture and performance, and subjective assessments of user acceptability [^112Wazeq]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The choice of prescribed emollients is usually based on cost and patient preference. Differences in formulations can affect user acceptability.

Aim

To compare the physical performance, user acceptability and various product design features of two emollient gels that are prescribed in the UK and alleged to be therapeutically interchangeable because their formulations are described as having the same contents of oily ingredients.

Results

We found that here are in fact significant measurable differences between the structure and performance of the two formulations, which materially affect their user acceptability. These differences are attributed to the use of different types of gelling agents and other ingredients of differing grades/quality and concentrations, and probably due to the formulations being made by different manufacturing processes. We also identified other product design features that are important to user appeal, including the type of container in which the formulations are presented, the type of dispensing devices provided, and the nature and form of the supplied user instructions.

Conclusion

Patients and prescribers should be aware that there can be important differences in performance and user appeal between emollients, even between products that, superficially, may appear to be very similar. These important performance aspects should be characterized for new emollient introductions to encourage better informed product selection.

### Quantitative analysis of topical treatments in atopic dermatitis: unexpectedly low use of emollients and strong correlation of topical corticosteroid use both with depression and concurrent asthma [^112AVGJe]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite decades of use, the actual amounts of topical corticosteroids (TCS) and emollients used in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) under real-world conditions are unknown. Thus, it remains unclear whether inadequate use is widespread.

Objectives

To quantify the use of TCS and emollients in moderate-to-severe AD.

Methods

Double-blinded drug prescribing was recorded prospectively at the point of drug dispensing within a catchment area of approximately 450 000 people over a 31-year period in a population-based cohort marked by failure of disease control in primary care (n = 844). For each patient, prescribing was recorded over a 12-month period in order to minimize fluctuations.

Results

This approach resulted in a near-complete dataset, which was essentially free of reporting bias and recording bias. Atopic comorbidities matched expected frequencies. Median use of TCS was statistically significantly higher in juvenile patients (age < 16 years) compared with adult patients (49.2 vs. 38.1 g per month), in male vs. female patients (46.8 vs. 29.7 g per month) and in patients receiving concurrent asthma treatment (40.4 vs. 26.7 g per month). TCS use was strongly associated with antidepressant treatment. Emollient use was unexpectedly low with a median of 9.6 g per day (range 1.4–30.1). Results were replicated in an independent validation cohort.

Conclusions

Deficient use of emollients may be a factor contributing to AD severity. Our analysis showed that the use of TCS does not exceed current guidelines. Accurate quantification of topical treatments provides a widely accessible strategy to measure the real-world impact of novel AD treatments. What's already known about this topic? Both emollient and topical corticosteroid (TCS) use have been a mainstay of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment for over 60 years. The actual quantities used by patients under real-world conditions are unknown. What does this study add? The real-world use of emollients is fourfold lower than the amount recommended in current guidelines. Underuse of emollients may be a significant factor in disease exacerbation. The use of TCS is significantly higher in male patients and is higher in patients with AD who also have asthma. The use of TCS is strongly associated with concurrent antidepressant treatment.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis 2018 [^111LeAVZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. The current strategies to treat AD in Japan from the perspective of evidence-based medicine consist of three primary measures: (i) the use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment as the main treatment for the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling and advice about daily life. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Emollient prescribing formularies and guidelines in england, 2021: a cross-sectional study [^113FkF7u]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Leave‐on emollients

In total, 126 unique types of leave‐on emollients were recommended across all the formularies and guidelines. Each formulary had an average of 23 different emollients available, with 51 being the highest number on a single formulary and 8 the lowest. All 72 formularies/guidelines recommended cream(s) or ointment(s), 94% recommended gel(s), 83% recommended lotion(s) and 79% recommended others (sprays, balms). Of the 49 formularies that used a ranking system (numbered or 'traffic light' systems), first‐line recommendations by type were as follows: 100% cream, 94% ointment, 69% gel, 41% lotion and 14% others.

Table 1 shows the top five most recommended creams, lotions, ointments and gels. Overall, the top five most recommended emollients were Dermol 500 lotion (59 of 72), Dermol cream (52 of 72), emulsifying ointment BP (51 of 72), Epimax cream (50 of 72) and white soft/liquid paraffin 50/50 (51 of 72). However, Dermol cream and Dermol 500 lotion both contain antimicrobials: 77% (35 of 52) and 68% (40 of 59) of formularies respectively recommended their use only in the short term in cases of eczema complicated by infection.

Table 1
Top 5 most recommended creams, lotions, ointments and gels.

The emollient most commonly and specifically not recommended was aqueous cream (6 of 72 formularies), the most stated reason being that it contains sodium lauryl sulfate, which is known to have an adverse effect on skin. Only 16 of 72 had aqueous cream on their formularies: 2 recommended it as first line, 2 required specialist knowledge, 1 outlined its use in specific patient populations, 1 outlined a self‐care policy and 10 had no additional guidance.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1179VWA9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Completeness of interventions

Our search included all topical corticosteroids and had no date restrictions. Therefore, it is likely that some of the topical corticosteroids tested are either no longer commonly used or are used in some areas of the world more than others. However, we grouped topical corticosteroids by potency for the purposes of this review, rather than looking at individual topical corticosteroids, which minimises the impact of this.

Owing to the lack of trials that met the inclusion criteria, we did not find sufficient evidence addressing several comparisons of interest. In particular, there were no trials addressing our key comparison of longer‐ compared to shorter‐term duration of use of topical corticosteroids to treat flare‐ups. More generally, of the three broad categories of comparison of 1. which topical corticosteroid to use, 2. how often to apply topical corticosteroids, and 3. how to use the topical corticosteroid, only 10 of 104 trials addressed the third category, how to use the topical corticosteroid. One trial in 45 participants looked at topical corticosteroid applied to wet versus dry skin; one trial in 46 participants looked at whether topical corticosteroid should be applied before emollient versus after emollient; and no trials looked at the optimum time between application of emollient and application of topical corticosteroid. Furthermore, when considering strategies for treatment of a flare (getting control) versus flare‐prevention (keeping control), only one comparison addressed the latter in nine trials of weekend therapy (proactive topical corticosteroid) versus no proactive topical corticosteroid in 1344 participants. We discuss evidence gaps highlighted by this review further under Implications for research.

In this review we included a comparison of concentrations of topical corticosteroid where we included a trial that compared 0.05% fluticasone cream with 0.005% fluticasone ointment (Berth‐Jones 2003). As the vehicle in which the topical corticosteroid is delivered influences the solubility (Oakley 2021), and therefore the effectiveness, then this could be the reason for the difference in concentrations within the formulation. Therefore, the comparison of concentrations within this trial may not be applicable to formulations of the same type.

### Moisturizer technology versus clinical performance [^115fWoSJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The principles of humectancy, emolliency, and occlusion, all central to stratum corneum (SC) maintenance, continue to drive the development of novel moisturizing technologies. Humectants promote water retention within the SC, whereas occlusives generally minimize water loss to the external environment. The complementary occlusive activity of emollients contributes to SC hydration as well. Moisturization technologies, ranging from face care to hand and body care, vary in the types and levels of humectants, emollients (including lipids), and occlusives; accordingly, their therapeutic effects differ as well. Emulsification of these components into a single formulation-the technologies of which are as varied as their individual components-is thought to enhance the aesthetics of the moisturizer and its overall moisturization efficiency. The present article reviews the current approaches to SC moisturization, increasingly viewed as critical to its structural and functional integrity, and to fundamental skin care.

### A comparison of myribase and doublebase gel: does qualitative similarity of emollient products imply their direct interchangeability in everyday practice? [^112BLQKA]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In topical products, the formulation itself and the specific microstructure, which is the result of complex interplay of formulation compounds, is recognized as one of the products critical quality attributes. 1, 2, 3, 4 For emollients, which lack in conventional therapeutically "active" substances, efficacy depends on the performance of the whole formulation.

The use of emollients in everyday life is extensive and their importance is well recognized for both medical and cosmetic purposes. 5, 6, 7 Emollients are acknowledged as a part of certain therapeutic protocols such as atopic dermatitis and various dry skin conditions. 6, 8, 9, 10 Nevertheless, there are no specific requirements and/or recommendations regarding vehicle systems and types of moisturizers used in dermatological therapy. 11, 12

For the prescribed emollients, it is a physician who commonly defines its use and their decision making is usually supported by the best‐practice statements and guidelines. 13, 14 On the other hand, for an average consumer of cosmetic products, decision making is based on a range of different attributes and marketing information. However, when it comes to making a final decision between two emollient products, the ingredient list, that is, the formulation composition is likely to have a major impact. In such cases not only that consumers/patients but also clinicians/policy makers believe that the products with the same ingredient list have the same efficacy.

In the light of emollient importance in dry skin condition treatment, the majority of studies involving emollients address dry skin, but the normal skin, which can also experience occasional episodes of dryness, deserves the same consideration. 15, 16 Also, studies concerning efficacy of emollients are mainly focused on the efficacy of an "active" in emollient products or on the correlation between different types of vehicles, but there is a lack of relevant, published data addressing both well‐established emollients and new emollient formulations. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116QcV4r]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

This systematic review and NMA was conducted using standard Cochrane methodology, and according to its own pre‐published protocol and statistical analysis plan. In brief, we included within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible trials evaluated people of any age with a clinical diagnosis of eczema (also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema) of any severity. Specific, non‐atopic forms of eczema such as contact dermatitis, hand eczema or seborrheic eczema and clinically infected eczema were excluded. Eligible interventions included any well‐characterised topical anti‐inflammatory treatment. Emollients alone, topical antibiotics alone, complementary therapies, wet wraps, systemic treatment and phototherapy were excluded. In general, non‐licensed or non‐standard treatment regimens were excluded — for example application less than once daily or more than twice daily, or treatment durations of under 1 week. Comparison was to other topical anti‐inflammatory treatments, placebo/vehicle/emollient or no treatment. TCS were classified as mild, moderate, potent or very potent, as previously described. Outcomes and outcome measures were prioritised according to the Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative; and informed by patient and public involvement during preliminary surveys and workshops as part of trial protocol development. Outcomes evaluated are summarised below:

2.1 Primary Outcomes

Patient‐reported symptoms of eczema. Data were extracted based on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) or, if not available, alternative instruments ranked in order of preference in the protocol, most commonly a visual analogue scale of pruritus.
Clinician‐reported signs of eczema. Data were extracted based on the Eczema Area and Severity Index or, if not available, alternative instruments ranked in order of preference in the protocol, most commonly the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) was considered separately from other clinician‐reported signs of eczema, since the construct of IGA as a single global assessment is emphasised by some regulatory authorities and may differ from other measures of eczema signs.

Reanalysis of Existing Systematic Reviews

Recent, high-quality reviews already existed concerning HAI prevention, topical emollient therapy for preterm newborns and term newborns, probiotic supplementation, and synbiotic supplementation, and we extracted and pooled data from all studies conducted only in LMICs to produce effect estimates specific to the LMIC context. For topical emollients, probiotic supplementation, and synbiotic supplementation, we included additional studies based on expert consensus, where large and well-designed trials conducted in LMICs were known (see online supplementary Appendix 1, for the search strategies employed in as-is reviews). Subgroup analyses were replicated where possible, with additional subgroup analyses by level of care for all topics. The Cochrane RoB-1 tool was used to assess the quality of the studies included within the topical emollients, probiotics, and synbiotic reviews.

HAI Prevention

The HAI prevention topic examined hospitalized neonates in the neonatal ward or NICU receiving various interventions compared to standard of care. HAI prevention studies included RCT, controlled and noncontrolled before-after, controlled and noncontrolled interrupted time series, and cohort study designs. A summary of the eligibility criteria for all reviews is included in online supplementary Appendix 2, alongside the outcomes of interest. For this topic, the study designs, interventions, and outcomes captured for review were highly heterogeneous; therefore, we report the original review authors' narrative synthesis. The HAI prevention review used the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs (ICROMS) tool to assess study quality, and studies included in that review met the minimum score and mandatory ICROMS criteria to be considered for inclusion.

Topical Emollients for Preterm and Term Newborns

For the topical emollients review, we included RCTs and quasi-experimental studies to examine the effect of oil and cream emollient applications in comparison to routine skin care on outcomes including all-cause neonatal mortality, invasive infection, and NEC in the preterm and term newborn populations.

Probiotic Supplementation

The probiotic topic included trial data for neonates receiving enteral or oral administration of probiotic supplementation in neonates, in comparison to no supplementation or placebo feeds. In addition to subgroup analysis by level of care, we ran subgroup analyses by duration of intervention, by funding source, and by study quality based on a risk of bias assessment.

Synbiotic Supplementation

Similarly, for the synbiotic topic, trial data was included across two reviews to evaluate the effect of synbiotic supplementation in comparison to no supplementation. In addition to subgroup analysis by level of care, we ran subgroup analyses by duration of intervention, funding source, and synbiotics' volume.

Bath additives

The majority (74%; 53 of 72) of formularies/guidelines specifically stated that bath additives should not be prescribed, with 63% (45 of 72) of formularies justifying their recommendation: 35% referred to NHS England guidance and 29% cited research evidence (the BATHE trial). Of the 53 formularies not recommending bath additives, 7 still had one or more type of bath additive as an 'on formulary' item, but 5 of the 7 specified either that use should only be initiated by specialists or general practitioners (GPs) for patients with severe eczema.

In total, 29 different products were named on the 19 of 72 formularies that either recommended bath additives or listed them as 'on formulary' items with no added information discouraging their use. The five most recommended are shown in Table 2, and included two antimicrobial bath additives, Dermol 600 and Emulsiderm. Dermol 600 was recommended on 13 formularies; 46% (6 of 13) specified its short‐term use in those with severe/infected eczema, and 2 of these specified its use strictly in children. Emulsiderm was listed on seven formularies, two of which outlined its short‐term use in those with severe infective eczema. As an alternative to bath additives, several formularies recommended the use of soap substitutes instead. Balneum plus bath oil is a urea‐containing bath additive, which was listed on seven formularies, of which three formularies specified its use in exceptional circumstances or for severe eczema and refractory pruritis.

### Role of topical emollients and moisturizers in the treatment of dry skin barrier disorders [^111zZnAc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Emollients and moisturizing creams are used to break the dry skin cycle and to maintain the smoothness of the skin. The term 'moisturizer' is often used synonymously with emollient, but moisturizers often contain humectants in order to hydrate the stratum corneum. Dryness is frequently linked to an impaired barrier function observed, for example, in atopic skin, psoriasis, ichthyosis, and contact dermatitis. Dryness and skin barrier disorders are not a single entity, but are characterized by differences in chemistry and morphology in the epidermis. Large differences also exist between moisturizing creams. Moisturizers have multiple functions apart from moistening the skin. Similar to other actives, the efficacy is likely to depend on the dosage, where compliance is a great challenge faced in the management of skin diseases. Strong odor from ingredients and greasy compositions may be disagreeable to the patients. Furthermore, low pH and sensory reactions, from lactic acid and urea for example, may reduce patient acceptance. Once applied to the skin, the ingredients can stay on the surface, be absorbed into the skin, be metabolized, or disappear from the surface by evaporation, sloughing off, or by contact with other materials. In addition to substances considered as actives, e.g. fats and humectants, moisturizers contain substances conventionally considered as excipients (e.g. emulsifiers, antioxidants, preservatives). Recent findings indicate that actives and excipients may have more pronounced effects in the skin than previously considered. Some formulations may deteriorate the skin condition, whereas others improve the clinical appearance and skin barrier function. For example, emulsifiers may weaken the barrier. On the other hand, petrolatum has an immediate barrier-repairing effect in delipidized stratum corneum. Moreover, one ceramide-dominant lipid mixture improved atopic dermatitis and decreased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in an open-label study in children. In double-blind studies moisturizers with urea have been shown to reduce TEWL in atopic and ichthyotic patients. Urea also makes normal and atopic skin less susceptible against irritation to sodium laurilsulfate. Treatments improving the barrier function may reduce the likelihood of further aggravation of the disease. In order to have optimum effect it is conceivable that moisturizers should be tailored with respect to the epidermal abnormality. New biochemical approaches and non-invasive instruments will increase our understanding of skin barrier disorders and facilitate optimum treatments. The chemistry and function of dry skin and moisturizers is a challenging subject for the practicing dermatologist, as well as for the chemist developing these agents in the pharmaceutical/cosmetic industry.

### Topical treatment of atopic dermatitis [^112B2Hiq]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Topical therapy of atopic dermatitis should incorporate an understanding of the underlying immune abnormalities of this complex chronic skin disease. Avoidance of irritants and proven allergens, skin hydration, and use of emollients and anti-inflammatory therapy help maintain a normal skin barrier. Topical calcineurin inhibitors have been added to the topical treatment armamentarium. Although the optimal treatment approach remains to be defined, several studies suggest the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors as early intervention therapy and topical corticosteroids as rescue therapy.

### A randomized comparison of an emollient containing skin-related lipids with a petrolatum-based emollient as adjunct in the treatment of chronic hand dermatitis [^114vt85r]. Contact Dermatitis (2003). Low credibility.

Hand dermatitis is a multifactorial skin disorder in which skin barrier impairment is involved in the pathogenesis. The development of topical agents that improve skin barrier function is therefore a promising approach for the management of hand dermatitis. Topically applied lipids may interfere with skin barrier function, and emollients containing skin-related lipids have been suggested to facilitate repair of the skin barrier. However, evidence for the superiority of emollients containing skin-related lipids over the more traditional emollients is still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare an emollient containing skin-related lipids (Locobase Repair) with a traditional petrolatum-based emollient for the management of hand dermatitis. Adult males and females (n = 30) with mild to moderate chronic hand dermatitis were treated twice daily for 2 months either with an emollient containing skin-related lipids or with a pet.-based emollient. In the case of exacerbation, the patients of both treatment groups were allowed to use a mild corticosteroid according to instructions. Both treatment regimes significantly improved clinical signs of hand dermatitis as assessed by the investigator global assessment, hand eczema area and severity score. We did not observe significant differences in the improvement of clinical signs, itching, patients' assessment of efficacy, cosmetic acceptability or usage of topical corticosteroids between both treatment groups. In conclusion, this study confirms that the frequent use of emollients may be useful in the therapy of hand dermatitis. However, we could not demonstrate the superiority of this particular emollient containing skin-related lipids in patients with chronic hand dermatitis.

### Different types of emollient cream exhibit diverse physiological effects on the skin barrier in adults with atopic dermatitis [^111Epge4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis; AD) is a very common itchy skin condition affecting 1 in 5 children and up to 1 in 10 adults worldwide. The skin of eczema sufferers is prone to redness, irritation and dryness because it does not form an effective barrier, i.e. the ability of the skin to stop irritants, allergens and microorganisms getting into the body. Skin barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of AD. The regular and liberal (600g/week for an adult) use of emollients is recommended for all patients with eczema), even between episodes of itching and redness, to soften and soothe the skin. In England alone, almost 9million prescriptions for emollient creams were issued in 2018, at a cost of over £50million. Despite this widespread use, relatively little is known about how commonly prescribed emollient creams affect the skin's barrier, and thus the role of moisturizers in AD development and progression remains unclear. We set out to compare three different types of emollient cream and a no-treatment control.

Aim

To compare the barrier-strengthening properties of a new moisturizer containing urea and glycerol (urea-glycerol cream; UGC), with those of a glycerol-containing moisturizer (glycerol cream; GC), a simple paraffin cream (PC) with no humectant, and a no-treatment control (NTC).

Methods

This was an observer-blinded prospective Phase 2 within-subject multilateral single-centre randomized controlled trial in adults with AD (Clinical Trials #NCT03901144). The intervention involved 4weeks of treatment, twice daily, with the three products applied to one of four areas on the forearms the (the fourth area was the untreated control, randomized allocation). Skin properties [dryness, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), hydration and natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels] were assessed before, during and after treatment to see what happened to the skin's barrier. The primary outcome was skin sensitivity to the irritant sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) after treatment. We performed tests on the skin before and after treatment to see what happened to the skin's barrier.

Results

In total, 49 patients were randomized, completed treatment and included in the analysis. UGC significantly reduced the response to SLS as indicated by a reduction in TEWL compared with NTC (-9.0g/m²/h; 95% CI -12.56 to -5.49), with PC (-9.0g/m²/h; 95% CI -12.60 to -5.44) and with GC -4.2g/m²/h; 95% CI 7.76 to -0.63). Skin moisturization improved at sites treated with UGC compared with NTC and PC, and this was accompanied by concordant changes in dryness and NMF levels. Subgroup analysis suggested FLG-dependent enhancement of treatment effects.

Conclusion

The study showed that not all emollient creams for eczema are equal. The simple paraffin-based emollient, which represents the most widely prescribed type of emollient cream in England, had no effect on the skin's barrier and reduced the skin's NMF. UGC markedly improved the skin's barrier and protected against irritation. GC performed better than PC, but not as well as UGC. UGC strengthened the skin barrier through a mechanism involving increased NMF levels in the skin, and imparted protection from SLS-induced irritation. By helping correct a major pathophysiological process, UGC has the potential to improve the long-term control of AD. The results show that different emollient creams have different effects on our skin, and only certain types have the ability to improve the skin's barrier and protect against irritants that trigger eczema.

Summary

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis; AD) is a very common itchy skin condition affecting 1 in 5 children and up to 1 in 10 adults worldwide. The skin of eczema sufferers is prone to redness, irritation and dryness because it does not form an effective barrier, i.e. the ability of the skin to stop irritants, allergens and microorganisms getting into the body. Skin barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of AD. The regular and liberal (600 g/week for an adult) use of emollients is recommended for all patients with eczema), even between episodes of itching and redness, to soften and soothe the skin. In England alone, almost 9 million prescriptions for emollient creams were issued in 2018, at a cost of over £50 million. Despite this widespread use, relatively little is known about how commonly prescribed emollient creams affect the skin's barrier, and thus the role of moisturizers in AD development and progression remains unclear. We set out to compare three different types of emollient cream and a no‐treatment control.

Aim

To compare the barrier‐strengthening properties of a new moisturizer containing urea and glycerol (urea–glycerol cream; UGC), with those of a glycerol‐containing moisturizer (glycerol cream; GC), a simple paraffin cream (PC) with no humectant, and a no‐treatment control (NTC).

Methods

This was an observer‐blinded prospective Phase 2 within‐subject multilateral single‐centre randomized controlled trial in adults with AD (Clinical Trials #NCT03901144). The intervention involved 4 weeks of treatment, twice daily, with the three products applied to one of four areas on the forearms the (the fourth area was the untreated control, randomized allocation).

### Does order of application of emollient and topical corticosteroids make a difference in the severity of atopic eczema in children? [^116irt5T]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder in children, with emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) commonly prescribed as treatment. There is no published guidance on the correct order of application of emollient and TCS in children with AE.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether the order of application of emollient and TCS makes a difference in the severity of AE in children.

Methods

Forty-six patients ages 4 months to 5 years with moderate to severe AE were randomized to two groups: group A applied emollient followed by TCS 15 minutes later twice daily, and group B applied TCS followed by emollient 15 minutes later twice daily for 2 weeks.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected, or itch score between groups A and B (p > 0.05). Group A had statistically significant improvement in the EASI score, percentage BSA affected, and itch score from baseline to weeks 1 and 2; group B demonstrated statistically significant improvement only in the EASI score from baseline to week 1 and in itch score from baseline to week 2. There was no difference in adverse events between the groups.

Conclusion

This study suggests that the order of application of emollient and TCS does not matter in the treatment of AE in children and that parents can apply topical medications in whichever order they prefer.

### Mohs surgeons' use of topical emollients in postoperative wound care [^114q52dE]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although there is no universally accepted topical emollient recommended for wound care, there has been a trend toward minimizing exposure to common culprits of allergic contact dermatitis.

Objective

To assess the current practices of postoperative emollient use of dermatologic surgeons.

Methods and Materials

An anonymous 10-question survey on postoperative emollient use for clean surgical wounds was e-mailed to 857 members of the American College of Mohs Surgery.

Results

Two hundred ninety-four members (34.3%) responded. After routine closure, the most commonly used topical emollient placed immediately postoperatively was petroleum jelly (53.1%), followed by Aquaphor (Beiersdorf Inc, Wilton, CT) (19.4%) and bacitracin (8.2%) (p < .001). Respondents recommended that patients use the following topical emollients at home to keep the wound moist: petroleum jelly (69.4%), Aquaphor (38.4%), bacitracin (10.0%), mupirocin (9.2%), polymyxin (8.8%), neomycin (2.0%), and gentamicin (1.0%) (p < .001). The three most common topical emollients that were requested not to be used were neomycin (92.8%), polymyxin (44.3%), and bacitracin (44.3%) (p < .001).

Conclusion

Although emollients with low risk for contact allergy such as petroleum jelly are used more frequently, topical antimicrobials with known sensitizing potential are being applied and recommended for clean surgical wounds. A change in practice is needed to avoid these allergens.

### A comparison of myribase and doublebase gel: does qualitative similarity of emollient products imply their direct interchangeability in everyday practice? [^111anAbP]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Here, we highlight important efficacy shortcomings of the assumption that two quantitatively the same emollient products can be used therapeutically interchangeable by presenting the results of our studies. It was our aim to compare the human skin moisturisation effects of two qualitatively the same emollients within different products categories prescribed by UK doctors. As representative products which satisfied this aim, Doublebase Gel (Diomed Developments Ltd — a licensed medicine) and Myribase Gel (Penlan Healthcare — a Class I medical device and branded generic), were investigated. To the best of our knowledge, similar studies that may be relevant to everyday physicians' practice have not been published.

### Parent satisfaction with lotion, cream, gel and ointment emollient types: secondary analysis of the best emollients for eczema study [^114vwTBZ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The main determinant of emollient effectiveness is whether it is used, which in turn is linked with user satisfaction.

Objectives

To compare parental satisfaction with emollient type for the treatment of childhood eczema.

Methods

Secondary analysis of data from the Best Emollients for Eczema (BEE) trial was undertaken. In total, 550 children aged between 6months and 12years were recruited from primary care in England and randomized to use a lotion, cream, gel or ointment as their main emollient for 16 weeks. At week, 16 parents were asked to complete an Emollient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ESQ). Completion rates and scores were compared, using χ2 test, t-test calculations and one-way Anova as appropriate.

Results

Data on 378 participants (68.7% of those randomized) were analysed. Mean ESQ scores were gel 20.9 (SD 5.3), lotion 20.4 (SD 5.6), cream 18.8 (SD 6.3) and ointment 15.2 (SD 6.8) (P < 0.001). In pairwise comparisons, there was a statistically significant difference in mean ESQ scores between ointment and lotion (P < 0.001), ointment and cream (P < 0.001) and ointment and gel (P < 0.001) but not between lotion, cream and gel. Participants using lotions had highest overall satisfaction and were most likely to continue using their emollient. ESQ scores were correlated with reported emollient use and improvements in parent-reported eczema severity.

Conclusions

Overall, lotions and gels were favoured over creams and ointments. Although satisfaction is determined by personal preference, these results will aid parents, clinicians and children to find the right emollient(s) for them.

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^113VvodK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment — What's New?

A systematic review of clinical trials of various treatments for congenital ichthyosis has recently been published. Adding to previous reviews, an updated overview of common and more unorthodox and innovative therapies is given below.

Emollients and Other Topical Treatments

Symptomatic treatment with emollients and topical keratolytics remains the mainstay therapy for ichthyosis, and should be maintained also when adjuvant systemic agents are prescribed. Intuitively, one may think that a therapeutic removal of hyperkeratosis — the intrinsic response to increased TEWL in ichthyosis — might further exaggerate the barrier defect and thus enhance the pathophysiology of the disease. However, in real life this appears to be a minor problem as long as the TEWL values remain within reasonable limits and the risk of increased transcutaneous penetration of topically applied agents is taken into consideration.

Individualized therapy, taking into account the type and severity of ichthyosis and the patient's own preferences, is essential for the successful outcome of all topical treatments. Glycerol, urea, and propylene glycol are the most commonly used hydrating ingredients, usually in cream formulations. By mixing hydrating and keratolytic agents in the right combinations, surprisingly effective creams can be obtained. However, the risk of systemic absorption of the ingredient, especially in infants treated over the whole body, must always be considered. This is not just the case for salicylic acid, but also for α-hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid, which if used too frequently and in high concentrations may produce severe and even lethal intoxications.

### Different types of emollient cream exhibit diverse physiological effects on the skin barrier in adults with atopic dermatitis [^117A1uWG]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The West Midlands–Edgbaston Research Ethics Committee approved the study (18/WM/0311), which was sponsored and funded by Perrigo Nordic. The study was pre‐registered on(NCT03901144) and performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, and its later amendments. No changes to the study design were made following commencement. All subjects provided informed consent to participate. Further details pertaining to the design and conduct of the study can be found in Supplementary Data S1. The study data are available from the authors on request.

Study design

This was an observer‐blinded prospective phase 2 within‐subject multilateral single‐centre randomized controlled trial to determine the superiority of the test treatment at strengthening the skin barrier compared with no treatment and two reference treatments in adults with a recent history of AD. All participants undertook all four treatment conditions. Each forearm (volar face) was divided into two areas, providing four possible treatment areas per subject (Supplementary Table S1). All treatment areas were clear of the signs of eczema at the start of treatment. Participants were required to treat each area for 28 days with the allocated study treatment (Table 1) or no treatment, according to a randomized scheme. Dosing was one fingertip unit (approximately 0.5 g) of each cream applied twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening. The properties of the skin were assessed before (Day 1), during (Day 15, for tolerability only) and after (Day 29) treatment.

### The role of a midpotency topical corticosteroid and the clinical relevance of formulation characteristics in the management of commonly encountered eczematous and inflammatory dermatoses in adults and children: focus on the pharmacologic properties of clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream [^111SwKH9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Midpotency topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are frequently used for the treatment of common eczematous and inflammatory skin disorders in both adults and children. There are several commercially available products in this category, and many vehicles and formulations for the clinician to choose from. Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream is a midpotency TCS formulated in an emollient formulation that has been shown to be effective and well tolerated when used appropriately in the management of several corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. This article discusses the physiochemical properties of the compound; the characteristics of its emollient cream formulation; the functions of individual excipients; and the efficacy, tolerability, and safety data supporting its use in adults and children, including for facial involvement.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^112G8927]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Emollients are universally recommended for atopic dermatitis/eczema ('eczema'), to improve the skin barrier and reduce symptoms. However, our knowledge of the frequency and nature of adverse effects associated with their use is limited.

Objectives

We sought to determine how well adverse events are reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of emollients for eczema.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched from inception (1946) to May 2022. Inclusion criteria were RCTs of moisturizers or emollients used as a leave-on treatment (as the intervention or control) in adults or children with eczema. Exclusion criteria were non-RCTs; patients with other diagnoses included; use of emollient as bath additives, soap substitutes or as preventative; and not published in English. References of eligible papers were reviewed for any additional, relevant research. Data were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and analysed descriptively. An assessment of study quality was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for RCTs.

Results

From 369 potential papers, 35 papers (reporting on 34 studies) were included. Most research was conducted in research centres or hospitals (unclear in 34%). In total, 89% reported collecting data on adverse events related to emollient treatment use but the methods used were poorly reported (40% unclear). Four papers used patient questionnaires/diaries. However, it was unclear how and what was collected as only two studies showed the questionnaires used.

Conclusions

Reporting of adverse events related to emollient use in trials of patients with eczema is poor and inconsistent. Agreement should be reached on how and what adverse events should be collected, to standardize reporting across studies.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^113GZ1xs]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Microsoft Excel was used to extract and analyse the data. One author, E.R.E, piloted the data extraction tables, before they were finalized. E.R.E. first completed the data extraction then, a second author, M. A. independently checked them. Discrepancies were discussed with a third author, M.J.R. The main outcomes assessed were: how many studies reported on adverse events, if and how those studies collected these data and what the adverse events as a result of emollients were. Data extraction focused on treatment-related adverse events, specifically localized skin reactions. Data about the study characteristics were also collected including: patient demographics, setting, type of emollient and if they reported broad or detailed data on adverse events.

We collected data on any of the treatment-related adverse events because of either the emollient used as the control or intervention on the assumption (where not stated) that the same methodology was used in all trial arms.

### Daily emollient during infancy for prevention of eczema: the BEEP randomised controlled trial [^112trtbz]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study emollients were chosen because they are commonly used in the UK National Health Service and have a high degree of acceptability to parents, established during preparatory work. Both emollients are a basic formulation containing petrolatum and no ingredients known to have a detrimental effect on the skin barrier, in particular sodium lauryl sulphate. Mechanistic studies showed that these emollients were appropriate to use in such a trial, compared with aqueous cream, which has adverse effects on the skin barrier if used as a leave-on emollient. We did not use a more complex emollient formulation — for example, one containing ingredients such as ceramides and pH modulators — because when the barrier enhancement for eczema prevention (BEEP) trial was designed, they were not generally available and had a much higher purchase cost. However, a more sophisticated emollient formulation might potentially have a protective effect.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^113pyhRb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How to use the topical corticosteroid?

Timing of application of topical corticosteroid (2 trials in 158 participants)
Wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials in 221 participants)
Topical corticosteroid applied to wet versus dry skin (1 trial in 45 participants)
Topical corticosteroid applied before emollient versus topical corticosteroid applied after emollient (1 trial in 46 participants)
Time between application of emollient and steroid (no trials)

*Key comparisons for which summary of findings tables are presented.

Several included trials tested a combination of the above, reflecting how topical corticosteroids might be used in clinical practice, therefore, are found in more than one results section. For instance, Rafanelli 1993 compares a newer, second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (mometasone furoate) applied once daily with a moderate‐potency, older topical corticosteroid (clobetasone butyrate) used twice daily. As a result, Rafanelli 1993 is included in three separate meta‐analyses; 1. potency versus moderate topical corticosteroid; 2. second‐generation versus older topical corticosteroid; and 3. frequency of application, and the comparison of interest changes for each.

Trials that compared treatment strategies designed to treat eczema flares were generally short‐term (range 1 to 6 weeks) and rarely conducted any follow‐up. Trials included in the comparison of weekend (proactive) therapy with topical corticosteroid versus no topical corticosteroid, where the intervention aimed to prolong time to new flare (i.e. prevent relapse), were longer in duration. These trials involved a two‐ to four‐week stabilisation phase where both groups received topical corticosteroid, followed by a 16‐ to 20‐week maintenance phase, with the exceptions of Fukuie 2012 and Fukuie 2016, which observed participants at 6 and 12 months, respectively.

Emollient preparations play a central role in the treatment of people with dry skin associated with conditions such as atopic eczema.1,2 As well as being advised to apply emollient creams or ointments directly to the skin, people with atopic eczema are commonly prescribed bath emollients.3 Each year, the NHS spends over pound16million on bath emollients (at an average cost of pound6.29 per item).4 This represents 38% of the total cost of treatments prescribed for preschool children with eczema, matching the proportion spent on emollients for application directly to the skin.5 What clinical contribution do bath emollients make in the treatment of people with atopic eczema?

### Emollient prescribing formularies and guidelines in england, 2021: a cross-sectional study [^113nkQ8Z]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Emollients are a mainstay of treatment for dry skin conditions. In the UK, prescribers are usually expected to follow local National Health Service (NHS) formularies. A previous study in 2018 showed that the recommended emollients across England and Wales varied widely. Evidence has since emerged that bath additives provide no additional clinical benefit in eczema.

Aim

To compare emollient formularies and guidelines in England.

Methods

Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) formularies and guidelines were identified in April–May 2021, compiled and then analysed descriptively.

Results

In total, 105 CCGs, 72 emollient formularies and 47 emollient prescribing guidelines were identified. There were internal inconsistencies between formularies and their accompanying guidelines in 19% of cases. The majority (68%) of formularies/guidelines were organized using a ranking system. In total, 126 different leave‐on emollients were named. Creams and ointments were universally available and were the most recommended first‐line types. Cost was more likely than patient choice to be recommended as a criterion for selecting which emollient to prescribe. Aqueous cream was the leave‐on emollient most commonly not recommended. Nearly three‐quarters (74%) of formularies stated that bath additives should not be prescribed.

Conclusion

All CCGs in England have an emollient formulary/guideline, but there is still great variability between them in their recommendations. Although the number of formularies/guidelines has reduced since 2017, there has been an increase in the total number of unique recommended leave‐on emollients. Most CCGs are no longer recommending bath emollients for eczema.

### Clobetasol propionate — clobetasol propionate — emollient [^1126PPgW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) is in the super-high range of potency as demonstrated in a vasoconstrictor study in healthy subjects when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

Assessment of overall study quality

In 57% (20/35) of the papers studied, allocation was either not concealed or it was unclear. In 26% (9/35) of the total papers included, patients were not blind to allocation, and for 9% (3/35) it was unclear if any participants were blind to allocation or not. In two papers – one using a patient diaryand another a questionnaire– the participants were not blind to allocation. In 14% (5/35) the assessor was not blind to allocation, and in 9% (3/35) it was unclear. In three papers with investigator assessed data collection, the investigators were not blinded.

In all but one of the papersit was unclear whether outcomes were measured in a reliable way as the number and training of the assessors was not mentioned (Table S2; see Supporting Information).

Emollients studied

The 35 papers included 46 different emollients (Appendix S3; see Supporting Information). Atopiclair TM was the most commonly used emollient (three papers). The emollients used included a range of formulations, the most common was cream (41%; 19/46), followed by lotion (13%; 6/46). The ingredients in the emollients varied from botanicals, ceramides and 'active' ingredients (Appendix S3).

### Emollients and moisturisers for eczema [^117CgQgd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a chronic skin disease characterised by dry skin, intense itching, inflammatory skin lesions, and a considerable impact on quality of life. Moisturisation is an integral part of treatment, but it is unclear if moisturisers are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of moisturisers for eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to December 2015: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the GREAT database. We searched five trials registers and checked references of included and excluded studies for further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with eczema.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 77 studies (6603 participants, mean age: 18.6 years, mean duration: 6.7 weeks). We assessed 36 studies as at a high risk of bias, 34 at unclear risk, and seven at low risk. Twenty-four studies assessed our primary outcome 'participant-assessed disease severity', 13 assessed 'satisfaction', and 41 assessed 'adverse events'. Secondary outcomes included investigator-assessed disease severity (addressed in 65 studies), skin barrier function (29), flare prevention (16), quality of life (10), and corticosteroid use (eight). Adverse events reporting was limited (smarting, stinging, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis). Six studies evaluated moisturiser versus no moisturiser. 'Participant-assessed disease severity' and 'satisfaction' were not assessed. Moisturiser use yielded lower SCORAD than no moisturiser (three studies, 276 participants, mean difference (MD) -2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.55 to -0.28), but the minimal important difference (MID) (8.7) was unmet. There were fewer flares with moisturisers (two studies, 87 participants, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.70), time to flare was prolonged (median: 180 versus 30 days), and less topical corticosteroids were needed (two studies, 222 participants, MD -9.30 g, 95% CI -15.3 to -3.27). There was no statistically significant difference in adverse events (one study, 173 participants, risk ratio (RR) 15.34, 95% CI 0.90 to 261.64). Evidence for these outcomes was low quality. With Atopiclair (three studies), 174/232 participants experienced improvement in participant-assessed disease severity versus 27/158 allocated to vehicle (RR 4.51, 95% CI 2.19 to 9.29). Atopiclair decreased itching (four studies, 396 participants, MD -2.65, 95% CI -4.21 to -1.09) and achieved more frequent satisfaction (two studies, 248 participants, RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.89), fewer flares (three studies, 397 participants, RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.31), and lower EASI (four studies, 426 participants, MD -4.0, 95% CI -5.42 to -2.57), but MID (6.6) was unmet. The number of participants reporting adverse events was not statistically different (four studies, 430 participants, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.33). Evidence for these outcomes was moderate quality. Participants reported skin improvement more frequently with urea-containing cream than placebo (one study, 129 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.53; low-quality evidence), with equal satisfaction between the two groups (one study, 38 participants, low-quality evidence). Urea-containing cream improved dryness (investigator-assessed) more frequently (one study, 128 participants, RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.71; moderate-quality evidence) with fewer flares (one study, 44 participants, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.92; low-quality evidence), but more participants in this group reported adverse events (one study, 129 participants, RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.34; moderate-quality evidence). Three studies assessed glycerol-containing moisturiser versus vehicle or placebo. More participants in the glycerol group noticed skin improvement (one study, 134 participants, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.48; moderate-quality evidence), and this group saw improved investigator-assessed SCORAD (one study, 249 participants, MD -2.20, 95% CI -3.44 to -0.96; high-quality evidence), but MID was unmet. Participant satisfaction was not addressed. The number of participants reporting adverse events was not statistically significant (two studies, 385 participants, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.19; moderate-quality evidence). Four studies investigated oat-containing moisturisers versus no treatment or vehicle. No significant differences between groups were reported for participant-assessed disease severity (one study, 50 participants, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.46; low-quality evidence), satisfaction (one study, 50 participants, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.52; very low-quality evidence), and investigator-assessed disease severity (three studies, 272 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.21; low-quality evidence). In the oat group, there were fewer flares (one study, 43 participants, RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.7; low-quality evidence) and less topical corticosteroids needed (two studies, 222 participants, MD -9.30g, 95% CI 15.3 to -3.27; low-quality evidence), but more adverse events were reported (one study, 173 participants; Peto odds ratio (OR) 7.26, 95% CI 1.76 to 29.92; low-quality evidence). All moisturisers above were compared to placebo, vehicle, or no moisturiser. Participants considered moisturisers more effective in reducing eczema (five studies, 572 participants, RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.23; low-quality evidence) and itch (seven studies, 749 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.38) than control. Participants in both treatment arms reported comparable satisfaction (three studies, 296 participants, RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.26; low-quality evidence). Moisturisers led to lower investigator-assessed disease severity (12 studies, 1281 participants, SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.57 to -0.51; high-quality evidence) and fewer flares (six studies, 607 participants, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.62; moderate-quality evidence), but there was no difference in adverse events (10 studies, 1275 participants, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; moderate-quality evidence). Topical active treatment combined with moisturiser was more effective than active treatment alone in reducing investigator-assessed disease severity (three studies, 192 participants, SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.57; moderate-quality evidence) and flares (one study, 105 participants, RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.93), and was preferred by participants (both low-quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in number of adverse events (one study, 125 participants, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.19; very low-quality evidence). Participant-assessed disease severity was not addressed.

Authors' Conclusions

Most moisturisers showed some beneficial effects, producing better results when used with active treatment, prolonging time to flare, and reducing the number of flares and amount of topical corticosteroids needed to achieve similar reductions in eczema severity. We did not find reliable evidence that one moisturiser is better than another.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^113Zfx1v]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This trial provides strong evidence that emollient bath additives provide minimal or no additional benefit beyond standard eczema care in the management of eczema in children.

The BATHE trial was an adequately powered trial, with high follow-up rates and good adherence to trial intervention allocations. The study has strong external validity as it was pragmatic in design to reflect normal practice, and, despite the relatively low response rate, participants were broadly reflective of children with eczema seen in primary care. We used a participant reported outcome measure with good validity that has been accepted by international consensus. A participant reported outcome could be biased in favour of finding a positive effect of trial intervention owing to a perception of benefits of treatment. However, the negative result of the trial suggests that this was not the case.

This trial was large; previous reviews of the literature have not been able to draw conclusions owing to the small size of existing trials.

We cannot exclude the possibility of a small benefit among children bathing more than five times a week or among children aged less than 5 years, but differences are sufficiently small to be unlikely to be clinically useful. Furthermore, caution is needed in interpreting these underpowered subgroup analyses as statistically significant results might arise because the data have been tested multiple times rather than because a genuine difference exists between the groups.

These findings are timely for clinicians and prescribing advisers, as prescribing guidelines vary widely in their advice on the use of bath additives, and pressure on budgets has led to formularies becoming increasingly restrictive. Reviews have estimated that bath additives might contribute to up to one third of the costs of eczema in the United Kingdom. Our findings provide evidence that can contribute to effective prescribing in this area, where there is currently little research evidence to guide decision making. These findings are also useful for families with members who have eczema as they have more certainty about directing their efforts towards more effective treatments.

Our findings are only relevant to the use of emollient bath additives. More research is needed into optimal regimens for other emollients, although there is strong evidence that regular use of leave-on emollients prevents flare-ups in eczema, and there is widespread clinical consensus around the role of emollients as soap substitutes.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^111k58YU]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified 35 papers reporting on 34 trials of 46 emollients. They primarily included children and took place in research centres and secondary care sites. Four papers did not discuss adverse events at all, and of the remaining 31 papers, 58% provided detail on the adverse events experienced. The methodology to collect data on adverse events was unclear in 40% of the papers and only two papers shared their data-collection tools. Where studies provided detailed information about the type of adverse events experienced with emollients, pruritis, erythema and burning on application were the most common, whereas 'irritation' was the most commonly mentioned 'other' symptom.

This study has some limitations in addition to its strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to focus on how and what adverse events are reported in trials of emollients used in the treatment of eczema. Because of the lack of consensus about how or what symptoms should be sought and reported, and variation across countries and cultures in how terms are understood or used, there is likely to be inconsistency in the use of terminology. For instance, one study may have referred to 'stinging' and another study may have referred to 'burning' in reference to the same side-effect. The generally poor reporting of adverse events was also reflected in poor reporting generally, as noted by the overall quality assessment.

### Use of emollients in dry-skin conditions: consensus statement [^116A8WPo]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Emollients can perform an important role in the treatment of a number of dermatological conditions. Currently, the use of emollient therapy in the UK is supported only by limited guidelines and a best-practice statement, although guidelines do exist for specific conditions such as childhood eczema. To address this need, a group of clinical professionals covering acute community-care settings and medicines management met to review current data and practice. Their aim was to support other professionals in their approach to the use of emollient therapies in dry-skin conditions.

### Emollients, moisturizers, and keratolytic agents in psoriasis [^115SMrYj]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Emollients, moisturizers, and keratolytic agents are essential in the topical treatment of psoriasis. They are adjuvants for classic treatments and help to reduce the scale load of individual patients. The major role for emollients and moisturizers is the supportive role in normalizing hyperproliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; furthermore, they exert anti-inflammatory effects, for example, through physiologic lipids. Subsequently, an improved barrier function and stratum corneum hydration makes the epidermis more resistant to external stressors and reduces the induction of Koebner phenomena. Most of the emollients are lipid-rich (sometimes oily). The keratolytic agents, especially salicylic acid, and higher concentration of urea should be used in the initial keratolytic phase, whereas moisturizing products and emollients are especially suitable in the intermediate phase and the chronic/remission phase of psoriasis. They should be combined with bath oils.

### The impact of emollients on phototherapy: a review [^116PCD9K]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

When treating psoriasis, various topical emollients exist that can affect the penetration of ultraviolet radiation in phototherapy. Compared with normal-appearing skin with a reflectance of 4% to 5%, psoriatic skin has higher reflectance as a result of its increased air-to-corneocyte interfaces. Studies have tested the effect of emollients on light penetration by assessing psoriatic plaque clearance, differences in minimal erythema dose, and physical properties of the emollient (eg, monochromatic protection factor and absorbance). Psoriatic plaque clearance was found to improve with serous (thin liquid)-based emollients (eg, Vaseline oil [Unilever, Blackfriars, London, UK], mineral oil, and glycerol), whereas clearance decreased with salicylic acid and viscous-based emollients (eg, petrolatum). Emollients with high ultraviolet absorbance properties increased minimal erythema dose, and those with low absorbance properties decreased minimal erythema dose. Interestingly, when a liquid emollient with a refractive index close to that of normal-appearing skin was applied, there was a net increase in light absorption, or a reduction in reflection that exceeded the emollient's innate ability to absorb light.

Topical retinoids, targeted phototherapy, tacrolimus, and emollients — Topical tazarotene is an additional corticosteroid-sparing agent, with irritation as its major limitation that can be minimized by applying it sparingly, avoiding perilesional areas, and/or combining with a topical corticosteroid to produce a synergistic effect and longer duration of benefit and remission. For limited disease, the 308-nm monochromatic xenon-chloride (excimer) laser delivers UV radiation to localized areas; topical tacrolimus may also be considered a first line of therapy for intertriginous psoriasis; emollients and ointments are widely used but evidence is limited, though one study showed a water-in-oil cream or lotion combined with betamethasone dipropionate cream increased efficacy with fewer steroid applications, and emollients remain an important part of routine skin care.

### Clobetasol propionate for psoriasis: are ointments really more potent? [^1136b6ou]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Clobetasol propionate is the most common topical therapy used for psoriasis in the US. Conventional dermatologic wisdom is that ointment preparations provide the highest potency (due to their occlusive nature and moisturizing ability) and are best suited for psoriasis. However, patients often find application of ointment to be messy, raising concerns about both short-term and long-term adherence to treatment. This article reviews the current literature and assesses the relative potency of clobetasol propionate ointment compared to other clobetasol propionate preparations in the treatment of psoriasis. Relevant literature was identified by PubMed and Google searches. We included studies of psoriasis that reported the percentage of subjects that achieved desired efficacy endpoints, as well as studies that reported the subjects' mean change in symptoms from baseline. We excluded studies conducted before 1980 and those that allowed concomitant treatments.

Observations

Efficacy rates ranged from 17% to 80% for the different vehicles: ointment, solution, foam, cream, lotion, shampoo, and emollient.

Conclusions

Clobetasol propionate is a very effective treatment for psoriasis. Ointment preparations have similar efficacy to other preparations in clinical trial situations. In clinical practice, a situation in which patient preferences are more likely to affect compliance, it may be best to choose whichever vehicle patients find preferable.
