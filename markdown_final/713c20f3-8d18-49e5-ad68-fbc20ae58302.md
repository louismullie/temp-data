## Question

Can pregnant women take Paxlovid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pregnant women can take Paxlovid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline maternal and fetal risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy to anchor the risk-benefit analysis. Then, I should review the preclinical and human safety data for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Next, I will verify current guideline recommendations from trusted bodies and the FDA label, including dosing and timing. After that, I need to check pregnancy-specific pharmacokinetic considerations and whether dose adjustments are needed. I should confirm lactation considerations. Finally, I will examine data gaps, reconcile any conflicting statements, and synthesize a decision pathway with follow-up and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk context, because I need to ensure the benefit side of the equation is properly weighted. Pregnancy increases the risk of severe COVID-19 and adverse obstetric outcomes, including higher rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight, so untreated infection poses meaningful maternal and fetal risks that must be mitigated when effective therapy exists [^113bj4nd] [^117NpZgN].

> Now, I should review safety data for Paxlovid components, and I need to be precise here. The FDA label reports that animal studies showed no adverse developmental outcomes for nirmatrelvir at exposures at least threefold above clinical levels, with reduced fetal weights only at about elevenfold exposure in rabbits, and no adverse developmental outcomes for ritonavir at five to eightfold exposures in rats and rabbits; human data for nirmatrelvir remain limited, while decades of observational data for ritonavir in pregnancy have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, although these studies are not definitive for all outcomes [^117NpZgN].

> Wait, let me verify human pregnancy experience specific to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Observational studies and case series in 2024 described pregnant patients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, reporting few associated complications, no medication discontinuations for adverse effects, and similar antenatal and neonatal outcomes compared with controls in the available cohorts, though small numbers limit detection of rare events and some signals such as preeclampsia and surgical site infection require cautious interpretation and further study [^114VcuEt] [^117Vozid] [^112h62Lz].

> Next, I should review authoritative recommendations, and I need to check for any nuances. The WHO Living Guideline, summarized by Cochrane, strongly recommends nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for non-severe COVID-19 in patients at highest risk of hospitalization and explicitly includes pregnant and lactating people, with alternative options such as remdesivir when appropriate, whereas molnupiravir is not recommended in pregnancy; ACOG guidance also supports offering nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to pregnant patients, including those coinfected with influenza, and the FDA label does not contraindicate use in pregnancy and provides standard adult dosing instructions [^115D5xaw] [^116CcT97] [^115ymEJP] [^111aaoUJ].

> I will now examine dosing and timing, and I should double-check renal adjustments. Standard adult dosing is 300 mg nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg ritonavir taken together twice daily for 5 days, and efficacy depends on starting as soon as possible and within 5 days of symptom onset; dose reduction is required for severe renal impairment per the FDA label, and there is no pregnancy-specific dose adjustment recommended at this time [^111aaoUJ] [^116VSfjT] [^117NpZgN].

> Hold on, I should verify pregnancy pharmacokinetic issues because pregnancy can alter exposure. Physiologic changes in pregnancy can change absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, and for other ritonavir-boosted regimens such as darunavir or atazanavir, total exposures are often lower during pregnancy though virologic outcomes can remain preserved; despite these shifts, there is no current recommendation to alter Paxlovid dosing in pregnancy, so standard dosing is used while maintaining vigilance for effectiveness and tolerability [^116AtdXy] [^115rJoHs] [^112AJqj2] [^117NpZgN].

> I need to check lactation considerations as well. In a clinical lactation study, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were present in human milk at low levels, corresponding to estimated infant exposures of about 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted doses, respectively; although infant effects are not well characterized, these low relative doses and WHO's inclusion of lactating people in its recommendation suggest that breastfeeding can generally continue with counseling on infection control and monitoring [^111W7CNN] [^115D5xaw].

> But wait, what about rebound and adverse effects that might change counseling. Reports of symptom and test positivity rebound have occurred after Paxlovid, with survey data in pregnant or lactating cohorts suggesting notable rates of rebound and dysgeusia, and modeling work proposing immune-dynamics mechanisms in vaccinated individuals; this does not negate benefit in preventing severe outcomes, but it should be discussed during shared decision-making and monitored during follow-up [^116iPmXa] [^117Fs8Ci].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I see an apparent contradiction across sources regarding pregnancy-specific endorsement. Some reviews highlight sparse and inconsistent pregnancy data for COVID-19 therapeutics and even state that WHO had not approved drug therapy as safe and effective in pregnancy, which reflects the reality of limited prospective pregnancy data and the evolving literature; however, the more current WHO living guideline, as summarized by Cochrane, does strongly recommend nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for high-risk patients and explicitly includes pregnant and lactating individuals, so I should privilege the most up-to-date guideline statements while still emphasizing data gaps and encouraging registry participation when available [^111b2wuP] [^113bj4nd] [^115D5xaw] [^111wJywQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway, and I should confirm each step. Eligibility hinges on confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset in a pregnant patient, who by definition is at higher risk of progression; after screening for contraindicated drug-drug interactions and renal dosing needs, prescribe standard adult dosing, counsel on expected side effects and the possibility of rebound, and arrange follow-up for maternal and fetal well-being, with consideration of remdesivir if Paxlovid is unsuitable or unavailable and with shared decision-making that acknowledges limited but reassuring pregnancy data [^111aaoUJ] [^115D5xaw] [^115LLaEX] [^112h62Lz].

> Final check before concluding: the balance of evidence and guidelines favors treatment. Pregnant patients should be offered Paxlovid when indicated, since preventing severe maternal disease likely outweighs theoretical fetal risks based on animal data, extensive ritonavir experience, emerging human pregnancy reports, and strong guideline support, with standard adult dosing, early initiation, attention to renal dosing, lactation counseling, and close follow-up to monitor outcomes and contribute to registries where possible [^115D5xaw] [^112h62Lz] [^117NpZgN] [^111aaoUJ].

---

Pregnant patients can take **Paxlovid** (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) [^117NpZgN] when benefits outweigh risks, consistent with FDA and WHO guidance [^115D5xaw]. Human pregnancy data are limited [^112h62Lz]; animal studies show no major teratogenicity at clinically relevant exposures, and observational data do not indicate a clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage [^117NpZgN]. Paxlovid is recommended for pregnant patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at **high risk of progression** [^115D5xaw], started within 5 days of symptom onset [^111aaoUJ], with careful review of drug interactions and close monitoring [^117NpZgN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **FDA guidance**: The FDA states [^117NpZgN] that available human data are insufficient to assess risks of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal/fetal outcomes with nirmatrelvir; ritonavir data do not show increased major birth defects, but miscarriage risk remains uncertain.

- **WHO guidance**: The WHO strongly recommends nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for non-severe COVID-19 in patients at highest risk of hospitalization, explicitly including pregnant and breastfeeding women [^115D5xaw].

- **ACOG guidance**: ACOG advises that pregnant patients with COVID-19 who meet criteria may receive nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; assess drug–drug interactions before prescribing.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Observational studies in pregnant patients are limited [^112h62Lz] but show **no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage**; animal studies likewise show no major teratogenicity at clinically relevant exposures [^117NpZgN]. Clinical outcomes from a cohort of 114 pregnant patients indicate **nirmatrelvir/ritonavir** was well tolerated [^117Vozid] with no medication discontinuations, and most obstetric and medical outcomes were similar to those of untreated patients, although small sample size precluded multivariable modeling [^114VcuEt].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

The **benefits** of Paxlovid include reductions in COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and death in high-risk patients, including pregnant individuals [^116CcT97] [^115D5xaw]. The **risks** are not fully characterized due to limited human pregnancy data [^117NpZgN]; animal studies show reduced fetal body weight at high exposures but no major teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Pregnancy-related changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion may affect Paxlovid pharmacokinetics [^116AtdXy]; however, **no pregnancy-specific dosing adjustments are currently recommended** [^117NpZgN].

---

## Clinical monitoring and precautions

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor for adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms and potential hepatic effects [^117NpZgN].

- **Drug interactions**: Review all medications for interactions [^117NpZgN], as ritonavir is a strong CYP3A inhibitor.

- **Patient counseling**: Discuss potential risks and benefits, and advise reporting any adverse effects promptly.

---

## Alternative treatments

Alternative treatments include **Remdesivir** [^115LLaEX], an antiviral with limited pregnancy data but no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage in available reports, and **Supportive care**, with symptomatic management and close monitoring remaining essential [^115D5xaw].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Use in pregnancy | Recommended when benefits outweigh risks [^117NpZgN] [^112h62Lz] |
| Timing | Initiate within 5 days of symptom onset [^111aaoUJ] |
| Monitoring | Close monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^117NpZgN] |
| Alternative treatments | Remdesivir or supportive care if Paxlovid is contraindicated [^115LLaEX] [^115D5xaw] |

---

Pregnant patients can take **Paxlovid** when benefits outweigh risks, supported by limited human data and supportive animal and observational evidence [^117NpZgN]. It is recommended for high-risk pregnant patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [^112h62Lz], initiated within 5 days of symptom onset [^111aaoUJ], with careful monitoring and review of potential drug interactions [^117NpZgN].

## References

### Paxlovid [^117NpZgN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects. However, these studies are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.

In an embryo-fetal development study with nirmatrelvir, reduced fetal body weights were observed in pregnant rabbits following oral administration of nirmatrelvir at systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 11 times higher than clinical exposure at the approved human dose of Paxlovid. No other adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with nirmatrelvir at systemic exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 3 times higher than clinical exposure at the approved human dose of Paxlovid.

In embryo-fetal developmental studies with ritonavir, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed following oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits at systemic exposures (AUC) 5 times (in rats) or 8 times (in rabbits) higher than clinical exposure at the approved human dose of Paxlovid.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^115D5xaw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

There are several therapeutic options for people with COVID‐19. The choice of therapy depends on the severity of the illness, drug availability, route of administration, time from onset of symptoms to starting treatment, co‐administered medication, and patient‐specific factors such as age, pregnancy, or lactation.

- **Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recommendation**: In people who are at the highest risk of hospitalization or progression to severe illness, including consideration for women who are pregnant or lactating, the WHO Living Guideline for Therapeutics and COVID‐19 includes a strong recommendation for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, in addition to symptomatic management (WHO 2023b).

- **Alternative therapies**: Alternative therapeutics for people in this group include remdesivir, which requires intravenous administration, and in some countries, the oral antiviral molnupiravir. Molnupiravir has a conditional recommendation for use by the WHO in people with non‐severe COVID‐19 at highest risk of hospitalization, excluding pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children. It is noted that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization of molnupiravir. However, this drug is available outside the EU.

- **Severe COVID-19 recommendations**: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not recommended by the WHO for people with severe COVID‐19. Recommended therapeutics in these patients include corticosteroids, interleukin‐6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab and sarilumab), remdesivir (an antiviral), and the janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib, in addition to cardiorespiratory support measures as indicated (WHO 2023b).

### Paxlovid [^111aaoUJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The 5-day treatment course of Paxlovid should be initiated as soon as possible following a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made, and within 5 days of symptom onset even if baseline COVID-19 symptoms are mild. Should a patient require hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with Paxlovid, the patient should complete the full 5-day treatment course per the healthcare provider's discretion.

If the patient misses a dose of Paxlovid within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

Paxlovid, comprising both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets, can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed.

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended dosage for Paxlovid is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet), with all 3 tablets taken together orally twice daily in the morning and at bedtime for 5 days.

- **Dosage in patients with renal impairment**: Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within Paxlovid. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment.

### Salvage regimens containing darunavir, etravirine, raltegravir, or enfuvirtide in highly treatment-experienced perinatally infected pregnant women [^111intJD]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Combination antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women with human immunodeficiency virus has dramatically decreased maternal-to-child transmission. Highly treatment-experienced pregnant patients have limited effective treatment options due to past toxicities and viral resistance. We present eight pregnancies in seven perinatally infected women successfully treated with salvage regimens containing darunavir, etravirine, raltegravir, or enfuvirtide.

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^116Ky6zp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

Drug use in pregnancy and lactation is challenging, particularly in pregnant and lactating women with critical clinical conditions such as COVID-19, due to inconsistent drug safety data. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate various drug information resources for the scope, completeness, and consistency of information related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation.

- **Methods**: Data related to COVID-19 medications from various drug information resources, such as text references, subscription databases, and free online tools, were used for comparison. The congregated data were analyzed for scope, completeness, and consistency.

- **Results**: Scope scores were highest for Portable Electronic Physician Information Database (PEPID), Up-to-date, and drugs.com compared to other resources. The overall completeness scores were higher for Micromedex and drugs.com (p < 0.05 compared to all other resources). The inter-reliability analysis for overall components by Fleiss kappa among all resources was found to be 'slight' (k < 0.20, p < 0.0001). Information related to older drugs in most resources provided in-depth details on various components such as pregnancy safety, clinical data related to lactation, the effect of drug distribution into breast milk, reproductive potential/infertility risk, and pregnancy category/recommendations. However, the information related to these components for newer drugs was superficial and incomplete, with insufficient data and inconclusive evidence.

### Importance of inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in COVID-19 therapeutic trials [^1116yRKc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Investigators are employing unprecedented innovation in the design of clinical trials to rapidly and rigorously assess potentially promising therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); this is in stark contrast to the continued near-universal regressive practice of excluding pregnant and breastfeeding women from these trials. The few trials that allow their inclusion focus on postexposure prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of milder disease, limiting the options available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to compassionate use of remdesivir or off-label drug use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies. These restrictions were put in place despite experience with these drugs in pregnant women.

In this Viewpoint, we call attention to the need and urgency to engage pregnant women in COVID-19 treatment trials now in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies in this unique but not uncommon population.

### "If I know I am on the pill and I get pregnant, it is an act of God": Women's views on fatalism, agency and pregnancy [^112z5LYQ]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

I: Do you feel like when it is kind of that time — do you feel like there's anything you can do to prevent a pregnancy sort of when it is your time?

R: Well, of course, I can use birth control or contraceptives, and probably wouldn't get pregnant.

Some women clearly articulated how contraceptives needed to be used to avoid pregnancy but still allowed that fate played a role. Inconsistent contraceptive use and contraceptive failures were often perceived as a gray area, where destiny could coexist with control. "I mean, I play a big part in whether or not I get pregnant, in the sense that it is my choice whether or not to have sex with this person, it is my choice whether or not to protect myself by wearing a condom, it is my — you know, so it is, like, my choice whether I want to go through with it or not, and the ending outcome — I mean, I don't have control over whether or not I get pregnant, of course. But I have control over what steps I take. Am I taking my — you know, am I taking my pill regularly? So, there might, God might know. God knows, I don't know. I don't know when I'm meant to have a baby, but there are certain steps that I can take to prevent me necessarily having a baby right now".

The above quote shows how agentic beliefs can be nested within fatalistic ones. This respondent related that she has the ability to exert some control over her reproductive outcomes by using contraception, but, ultimately God has control over whether she actually gets pregnant.

In another example of the interplay between fatalism and agency, contraceptive failure was sometimes

### Should pregnant women be included in phase IV clinical drug trials [^114kgCBF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Relatively few drugs, especially those recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have published human pregnancy experience. Although all drugs contain animal reproduction data, these are usually not predictive of human risk. Clinical trials in pregnant women are rarely conducted because of ethical and legal concerns, and it may be many years before sufficient observational data are collected to guide clinical treatment decisions. Because many of these drugs will be used in pregnancy, human data are needed shortly after the drugs come to the market. Lack of human data leads to uncertainty over whether a drug can be safely prescribed for a pregnant patient. Unless there are compelling scientific and ethical reasons to exclude them, pregnant women should be included in phase IV clinical trials (postmarketing studies to obtain additional information, including the risks, benefits, and optimal use of a drug). This paper examines how physicians currently counsel pregnant women when there are no human data and proposes an alternative method in which knowledge regarding risks associated with the use of drugs during pregnancy can be enhanced in a clinical trial setting.

### Prezista [^115rJoHs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The exposure to total darunavir and ritonavir after intake of Prezista/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily and Prezista/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (see Table 13, Table 14, and Figure 1).

Due to an increase in the unbound fraction of darunavir during pregnancy compared to postpartum, unbound darunavir exposures were less reduced during pregnancy as compared to postpartum. Exposure reductions during pregnancy were greater for the once daily regimen as compared to the twice daily regimen (see Figure 1).

- **Pharmacokinetic results**: Within-subject comparison of total and unbound darunavir after administration of Prezista/ritonavir at 600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy compared to postpartum.

Please refer to Figure 1, which illustrates this comparison.

### A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 immunity predicts Paxlovid rebound [^117Fs8Ci]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were conducted in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of "Paxlovid rebound", a phenomenon where symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity initially resolve, but after completing treatment, symptoms and test positivity return. We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to simulate the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients.

Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-CoV-2 naïve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.

### Reyataz [^112tHDaT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

REYATAZ must be administered with ritonavir in pregnant patients. For pregnant patients, no dosage adjustment is required for REYATAZ with the following exceptions: For treatment-experienced pregnant women during the second or third trimester, when REYATAZ is coadministered with either an H2-receptor antagonist or tenofovir DF, REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily is recommended. There are insufficient data to recommend a REYATAZ dose for use with both an H2-receptor antagonist and tenofovir DF in treatment-experienced pregnant patients. No dosage adjustment is required for postpartum patients; however, patients should be closely monitored for adverse events because atazanavir exposures could be higher during the first 2 months after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Maternal adverse reactions**: Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome, sometimes fatal, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia have occurred in pregnant women using REYATAZ in combination with nucleoside analogues, which are associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis syndrome. Hyperbilirubinemia occurs frequently in patients who take REYATAZ [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)], including those who are pregnant [see Data]. Advise pregnant women of the potential risks of lactic acidosis syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia.

- **Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions**: All infants, including neonates exposed to REYATAZ in utero, should be monitored for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia.

### Edarbi [^112BS2Xg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling for Edarbi.

- **Pregnancy**: Inform female patients of childbearing potential about the consequences of exposure to Edarbi during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Encourage patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.

### SPL drug information for sofosbuvir [^113PN4JZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of sofosbuvir PO (also known as Sovaldi) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, there is insufficient evidence. Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm, and there are no controlled data in human pregnancy. Monotherapy is not recommended. In certain patient populations, sofosbuvir must be administered with ribavirin, which is contraindicated during pregnancy (FDA pregnancy risk category X) and in females who may become pregnant.

Sofosbuvir PO (also known as Sovaldi) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^111b2wuP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Drug use in pregnancy and lactation is challenging, particularly in pregnant and lactating women with critical clinical conditions such as COVID-19, due to inconsistent drug safety data. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate various drug information resources for their scope, completeness, and consistency concerning COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation.

Information related to older drugs in most of the resources provides in-depth details on various components such as pregnancy safety, clinical data related to lactation, the effect of drug distribution into breast milk, reproductive potential/infertility risk, and the pregnancy category/recommendations. However, information for newer drugs was superficial and incomplete, with insufficient data and inconclusive evidence, which is statistically significant.

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^113bj4nd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread globally at an accelerated rate and poses a significant threat to human health. Concerns were raised worldwide when the first case of COVID-19 was reported, leading to adverse outcomes and increased mortality rates in pregnant women. A woman's physiological and immunological changes during pregnancy predispose her to significant respiratory complications and susceptibility to specific intracellular pathogens. Evidence shows that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 experience severe health impacts, with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, preterm birth, and other adverse obstetrical outcomes. Furthermore, critical cases of pregnant women and newborn infants infected with COVID-19 might require intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to manage severe respiratory failure conditions.

Despite remarkable advances in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and lactation, data remain sparse regarding the safe use of COVID-19 medications in this special population. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not approved any drug therapy interventions as safe and effective for treating COVID-19 during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, many investigational drugs have been experimented with intermittently and as required for managing COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, healthcare professionals must be informed about the adverse outcomes of drugs used in pregnancy and lactation.

### Veklury [^115LLaEX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data from a clinical trial (IMPAACT 2032), published reports, the COVID-PR pregnancy exposure registry, and compassionate use of remdesivir in pregnant individuals have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes following exposure in the second and third trimester. However, there are insufficient pregnancy data available to evaluate the risk of remdesivir exposure during the first trimester. A study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir during pregnancy demonstrated no clinically relevant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant individuals. No dose adjustments are recommended in patients who receive Veklury during pregnancy [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies, remdesivir demonstrated no adverse effect on embryo-fetal development when administered to pregnant animals at systemic exposures (AUC) of the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were 4 times (rats and rabbits) the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data]. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to…

### Pharmacological considerations on the use of antiretrovirals in pregnancy [^114Hf2CX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy reduces the chance of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Physiological changes during pregnancy can lead to lower exposure to antiretrovirals, possibly resulting in virological failure. For most antiretrovirals, data on exposure during pregnancy and transplacental passage are limited. This review summarizes the most recent information on pharmacokinetics (including transplacental passage), efficacy, as well as the safety of antiretrovirals during pregnancy.

- **Recent findings**: Intensive-sampling pharmacokinetic studies as well as observational studies using sparse sampling were performed to explore the exposure to antiretrovirals during pregnancy. Transplacental passage, efficacy (viral load at delivery and infection status of the newborn), and safety information were evaluated for several antiretrovirals.

For most nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, recent research shows decreased exposure during pregnancy. However, the advantage of a general dose increase during pregnancy still remains unclear. For newer compounds and efavirenz, limited or no data on pharmacokinetics during pregnancy or transplacental passage are available, and the mechanisms of transplacental passage also remain unknown. For safety reasons, it will be important to monitor pregnancy outcomes in resource-limited settings during the implementation of the WHO guidelines, including the use of efavirenz during pregnancy.

### SPL drug information for saquinavir mesylate [^114k4BQv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of saquinavir PO (also known as Invirase) during pregnancy, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. It is crucial to monitor CD4 counts and plasma HIV RNA levels. Viral load should be assessed, and standard glucose screening should be performed. A first trimester ultrasound is necessary for gestational age assessment. A second trimester ultrasound can be used for both an anatomical survey and determination of gestational age.

Antiretroviral therapy should be provided to all patients during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count. The use of highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. HAART should begin as soon as pregnancy is recognized or HIV is diagnosed.

HIV guidelines recommend against using saquinavir-containing regimens during pregnancy. Patients who become pregnant while taking saquinavir should transition to an alternative treatment regimen. The drug saquinavir PO (also known as Invirase) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. It has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Paxlovid [^111W7CNN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Risk summary: Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are present in human breast milk in small amounts (less than 2%). In a clinical lactation study involving eight lactating women, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were estimated to be present in human milk at a mean weight-normalized infant daily dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (1.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose) and 0.006 mg/kg/day (0.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose), respectively [see Data].

There are no available data on the effects of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Paxlovid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Paxlovid or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

Data: In a clinical pharmacokinetics study, eight healthy lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum were administered three oral doses every 12 hours (steady-state dosing) of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The mean daily amount of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir recovered in breast milk was 0.752 mg and 0.027 mg, respectively, representing 0.13% and 0.014% of the corresponding administered daily maternal doses (unadjusted for weight). The estimated daily infant dose (assuming average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) was 0.16 mg/kg/day and 0.006 mg/kg/day, 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal dose, respectively, for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

### Optimizing pharmacology studies in pregnant and lactating women using lessons from HIV: A consensus statement [^114w3WFW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Pregnancy is associated with profound physiologic, immunologic, structural, and inflammatory changes. These dynamic changes occur in the maternal and feto-placental units during pregnancy and significantly influence the pharmacokinetic (PK) processes of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. For women living with HIV, altered pharmacokinetics during pregnancy can often result in lower antiretroviral (ARV) drug exposures, possibly increasing the risk of treatment failure, maternal HIV disease progression, perinatal transmission, drug resistance, and maternal death. Some guidelines recommend dose adaptation of certain ARVs in pregnancy because of lower drug exposures, such as lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir.

There is a median gap of six years between regulatory approval of an ARV and availability of pregnancy PK data to inform dosing in pregnant women, putting pregnant women and their unborn infants at risk. A recent example underscoring the clinical importance of defining pregnancy-related changes in drug disposition was evident in the November 2018 revised product labeling of cobicistat-containing ARV regimens. Despite cobicistat-containing regimens being potent, convenient, and well tolerated, cobicistat exposure and its boosting effect are substantially reduced during pregnancy, resulting in the recommendation that cobicistat-containing fixed-dose combinations should not be used during pregnancy. These revisions were made three to six years after these drugs were first approved for use in nonpregnant adults in the United States.

### Covid-19 antiviral medication use among pregnant and recently pregnant US outpatients [^114Ja7yg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Pregnant individuals are at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated complications. Although it is not recommended to withhold treatment from pregnant patients, there is limited information regarding the frequency of antiviral medication use during pregnancy.

Using Medicaid and commercial insurance databases, a national claims-based cohort study was constructed. This study focused on pregnant, recently pregnant, and nonpregnant female patients aged 18–49 years who received an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19 between December 21, 2021, and September 30, 2022. Outpatient treatment with recommended antiviral medication was identified within five days of diagnosis, utilizing national drug codes in outpatient prescription drug claims. Propensity score–matched prevalence ratios (PRs) were employed to compare antiviral treatment by pregnancy status.

A total of 412,755 publicly and privately insured patients with COVID-19 were identified, including 33,855 currently pregnant, 2,460 recently pregnant, and 376,440 nonpregnant female patients. Among these patients, 6.8% had a record of antiviral medication use, including 1.3% of pregnant, 5.4% of recently pregnant, and 7.3% of nonpregnant women. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir was the most commonly administered antiviral. The prevalence of antiviral medication use was 67% lower among pregnant patients compared to nonpregnant patients (PR 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.30–0.36), even among patients with one or more high-risk medical conditions (PR 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.25–0.33). Antiviral medication use was slightly lower among recently pregnant women with one or more high-risk medical conditions than among nonpregnant women.

### SPL drug information for fosamprenavir calcium [^114c5qWG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fosamprenavir PO (also known as Lexiva) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals.

- **Plasma HIV RNA monitoring**: Viral load should be assessed. Monitor CD4 counts and perform standard glucose screening.

- **Ultrasound monitoring**: A first-trimester ultrasound should be used for gestational age determination. A second-trimester ultrasound can be conducted for both an anatomical survey and further gestational age determination.

Antiretroviral therapy is recommended for all patients during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell counts. Utilizing highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and to minimize the risk of perinatal transmission.

The drug fosamprenavir PO (also known as Lexiva) is categorized under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This medication has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an observed increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### SPL drug information for atazanavir sulfate [^115iFE2j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of atazanavir PO (also known as Reyataz) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Monitor CD4 counts and plasma HIV RNA. Viral load should be assessed. Monitor neonates for hyperbilirubinemia and signs of lactic acidosis. Conduct a first trimester ultrasound for gestational age. Atazanavir-containing regimens are recommended as alternative treatment options for use in pregnant patients and those trying to conceive. This drug must be administered with ritonavir during pregnancy. No dose adjustment is required during pregnancy with one exception: therapy-experienced patients during the second/third trimester coadministered either an H2-receptor antagonist or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should receive atazanavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once a day. No dose adjustment is required postpartum; however, closely monitor for side effects as drug exposures may be higher during the first two months after delivery. The drug atazanavir PO (also known as Reyataz) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Covid-19 antiviral medication use among pregnant and recently pregnant US outpatients [^114iGiSw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Pregnant people are at risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated complications. While withholding treatment from pregnant patients is not recommended, little is known about the frequency of antiviral medication use during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Using Medicaid and commercial insurance databases, we constructed a national claims-based cohort study of pregnant, recently pregnant, and nonpregnant female patients aged 18–49 years with an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19 between 21 December 2021 and 30 September 2022. Outpatient treatment with recommended antiviral medication was identified within 5 days of diagnosis, using national drug codes in outpatient prescription drug claims. Propensity score-matched prevalence ratios (PRs) were used to compare antiviral treatment by pregnancy status.

- **Results**: A total of 412,755 publicly and privately insured patients with COVID-19 were identified, including 33,855 currently pregnant, 2,460 recently pregnant, and 376,440 nonpregnant female patients; 6.8% had a record of antiviral medication use, including 1.3% of pregnant, 5.4% of recently pregnant, and 7.3% of nonpregnant women. Most commonly, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir was administered. The prevalence of antiviral medication use was 67% lower among pregnant patients compared with nonpregnant patients (PR, 0.33 [95% confidence interval, .30-.36]), even among patients with ≥ 1 high-risk medical condition (0.29 [.25-.33]). Antiviral medication use was slightly lower among recently pregnant women with ≥ 1 high-risk medical condition than among nonpregnant women.

### Oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir use and clinical outcomes in pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^114VcuEt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

We documented the receipt of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir in 114 pregnant patients, with few associated complications. There were no cases of medication discontinuation due to side effects. There were few differences in obstetric complications associated with nirmatrelvir–ritonavir. In the nirmatrelvir–ritonavir group, there was a significant increase in rates of surgical site infection and preeclampsia. This is one of the largest reports of pregnant individuals taking nirmatrelvir–ritonavir at the time of writing.

A strength of this study is that it is a comparative analysis between those who did and did not receive nirmatrelvir–ritonavir. We were able to assess obstetric and COVID-19 outcomes. We cannot rule out differences in the reasons for testing or types and severity of symptoms; however, 99.3% of patients had symptoms documented in the medical record. The observed lack of severe disease, as indicated by only one COVID-19–related hospital admission, may have been related to the high rate of COVID-19 vaccination in the cohort. We are unable to comment on the efficacy of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir in pregnant people without a history of vaccination. We had an insufficient sample size to evaluate for an association between the use of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and more rare adverse outcomes. We were also unable to perform multivariable modeling to evaluate the association between nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and pregnancy outcomes given the small number of individuals with the outcomes of interest.

### Prescription medications for use in pregnancy-perspective from the US Food and Drug Administration [^1127v51N]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Obstetrical healthcare providers frequently field questions about the safety of medications recommended or prescribed to their pregnant patients. Most women use at least one medication during pregnancy; however, there is little information about the safety or appropriate dosing of many medications during this phase of life. Additionally, the development of drugs for use in pregnant women trails behind the development of drugs intended for other sectors of the population.

Our goal is to inform the obstetrics community about the US Food and Drug Administration's authority and their role in approving drugs for marketing. We begin with the statutes that led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration and its organization. We then cover drug development and the Food and Drug Administration review process, including the role of the advisory committee. The different types of drug approvals are discussed, with some specific examples. Finally, we enumerate the drugs specifically approved for use in obstetrics and contrast them with drugs commonly used by pregnant women and those used "off-label" during pregnancy.

The Food and Drug Administration is committed to protecting and advancing the public health of pregnant women by guiding the development and ensuring the availability of effective and safe therapeutics for obstetrical indications and for medical conditions during pregnancy. We hope this review will inspire more research addressing drug use during pregnancy.

### Antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women living with HIV: A clinical practice guideline [^115WghPU]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Approximately 1.4 million women living with HIV become pregnant every year. Most women use antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of vertical transmission or for personal health reasons. Using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, we make recommendations for the optimal choice of combination antiretroviral regimens, considering patient values and preferences, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, their uncertainty, and practical issues.

- **Weak recommendation**: We suggest a zidovudine and lamivudine-based regimen over one that includes tenofovir or emtricitabine.

- **Strong recommendation**: We recommend alternatives over the combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and lopinavir/ritonavir.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^116CcT97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

One meta-analysis, published as a letter to the editor and including 12 studies (one published RCT, one unpublished RCT, and 10 observational studies), found that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is likely effective in reducing mortality and probably decreases the risk of hospitalization; however, both outcomes had high levels of heterogeneity across studies. Moreover, due to the lack of RCTs, most of the evidence came from observational studies and hence is susceptible to confounding bias.

Another systematic review with meta-analysis, published in April 2023, compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to other antiviral drugs for the treatment of people with COVID-19. The meta-analysis results showed that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir decreased the risk of long-term mortality, hospitalization, and disease progression while showing little difference in safety compared to other antivirals.

The WHO living guideline strongly recommends treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for people with non-severe COVID-19 at the highest risk of hospitalization (including pregnant and breastfeeding women) and advises against treatment in people with non-severe COVID-19 at low risk of hospitalization. The evidence summary was last updated on 13 January 2023 and informed by two trials (EPIC-HR 2021; EPIC-SR 2021), of which the second one is at the time of writing only published as a press release with results from an interim analysis.

In vitro efficacy of nirmatrelvir against VOC

Infected cells were incubated with serial dilutions of nirmatrelvir in media containing 2 µM CP-100356, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor added to limit rapid compound efflux. Nirmatrelvir exhibited nanomolar potency against all VOCs tested, returning half-maximal (EC 50) and 90% maximal (EC 90) concentrations ranging from 21.1 to 327.6 nM and 32.8 to 421.4 nM, respectively, which recapitulated results of previous in vitro dose-response studies.

Prevention of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease in Roborovski dwarf hamsters

We determined single-oral dose pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of nirmatrelvir delivered alone or in combination with ritonavir. Hamsters were administered 250 mg/kg nirmatrelvir with or without 83.3 mg/kg ritonavir. In the absence of ritonavir, 250 mg/kg nirmatrelvir delivered a plasma exposure level of 22,400 h × ng/ml (Fig. 2a, Table 1). When combined with ritonavir, nirmatrelvir plasma exposure was 215,000 h × ng/ml, confirming that ritonavir, equivalent to its effect in human patients, efficiently slows nirmatrelvir metabolism in the dwarf hamsters. Previously, we have demonstrated that 250 mg/kg molnupiravir yields plasma exposure of N 4 -hydroxycytidine, the systemic metabolite of molnupiravir, of 376 h × ng/ml in dwarf hamsters. Human patients taking paxlovid or molnupiravir show nirmatrelvir exposure of 28,220 h × ng/ml, and N 4 -hydroxycytidine exposure of 8200 h × ng/ml, respectively.

### SPL drug information for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir [^113N1Qpx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Use of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir PO (also known as Viekira Pak) is not recommended in pregnant patients during any trimester due to the evidence of fetal harm in humans. Ribavirin, in particular, is contraindicated during pregnancy (FDA pregnancy risk category X) and should not be used by women who may become pregnant or by men whose female partners are pregnant. Patients and their partners are required to use two reliable forms of effective contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices, barrier methods) during treatment and for 6 months following therapy.

Patients who are not willing to adhere to strict contraception should not be treated with dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and ribavirin. Women must also undergo a pregnancy test before starting therapy, monthly during therapy, and for 6 months after therapy. The combination drug ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir PO is classified under category X in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy, indicating a high risk of causing permanent fetal damage. Therefore, it should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

Rilpivirine: Based on prospective reports to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) of over 870 exposures to rilpivirine-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 660 exposed during the first trimester and over 210 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no significant difference between the overall risk of birth defects for rilpivirine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP). The prevalence of defects in live births was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 3.5%) and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.1% to 3.4%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to rilpivirine-containing regimens.

Rilpivirine in combination with a background regimen was evaluated in a clinical trial of 19 HIV-1-infected pregnant subjects during the second and third trimesters and postpartum. Each of the subjects was on a rilpivirine-based regimen at the time of enrollment. Twelve subjects completed the trial through the postpartum period (6 to 12 weeks after delivery), and pregnancy outcomes are missing for 6 subjects. The exposure (C0hand AUC) of total rilpivirine was approximately 30% to 40% lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6 to 12 weeks). The protein binding of rilpivirine was similar (> 99%) during the second trimester, third trimester, and the postpartum period [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. One subject discontinued the trial following fetal death at 25 weeks' gestation due to suspected premature rupture of membranes. Among the 12 subjects who were virologically suppressed at baseline (less than 50 copies/

### Pharmacokinetic studies in pregnant women [^114q86wy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Prescription and over-the-counter drug use during pregnancy is necessary for many women today. A study of US and Canadian women found that, on average, 2.3 drugs were used during pregnancy; however, 28% reported using more than four. For some women, this is because they become pregnant with preexisting conditions that require ongoing or intermittent pharmacotherapy. For others, pregnancy itself can give rise to new medical conditions, such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The principal concern of prescribing physicians is whether or not agents will harm the fetus, i.e. have teratogenic effects. This concern rose to prominence primarily as a result of the thalidomide disaster. Marketed for use in morning sickness, thalidomide was found to be a potent teratogen capable of producing a variety of birth defects related to development. Consequently, determining the teratogenicity of new drugs currently dominates the objectives of pregnancy-relevant experiments conducted throughout drug development. This often comes at the expense of valuable pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, which are seldom performed pre-market.

Sex differences in PK parameters have been demonstrated in animals and humans since the 1930s. It is, therefore, not surprising that differences also arise in pregnancy. A wide array of physiological and hormonal changes occur during pregnancy; most begin early in the first trimester and increase linearly until parturition. Physicians lacking adequate PK information typically prescribe the standard adult dose in pregnancy, and this can be either inadequate or inappropriate.

### Efficacy and safety of dolutegravir with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate HIV antiretroviral therapy regimens started in pregnancy (IMPAACT 2010/VESTED): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^117GmQYG]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is important for both maternal health and the prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission; however, adequate data on the safety and efficacy of different ART regimens likely to be used by pregnant women are scarce. In this trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of three antiretroviral regimens started in pregnancy: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the United States, and Zimbabwe). Pregnant women (aged ≥ 18 years) with confirmed HIV-1 infection and at 14–28 weeks' gestation were eligible. Women who had previously taken antiretrovirals were excluded (up to 14 days of ART during the pregnancy was permitted), as were women known to be pregnant with multiple fetuses, or those with a known fetal anomaly or a history of psychiatric illness. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a central computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was done using permuted blocks (size six) stratified by gestational age (14–18, 19–23, and 24–28 weeks' gestation) and country. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg, and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumar.

### Oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir use and clinical outcomes in pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^117Vozid]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

The mean age of pregnant patients receiving nirmatrelvir–ritonavir was 36.1 years. The majority were non-Hispanic White patients who had private insurance, were primiparous, and were diagnosed after the first trimester; most had received at least three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (primary series plus booster). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between those who started and did not start nirmatrelvir–ritonavir. One patient in the nirmatrelvir–ritonavir group did not have symptoms recorded in the medical record but was initiated on medication within 5 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Ten individuals (8.7%) receiving nirmatrelvir–ritonavir noted side effects; none resulted in medication discontinuation. Four patients (3.5%) had symptomatic COVID-19 rebound, and one had a recurrence of positive test results. There were no intensive care unit admissions in either group. One patient in the nirmatrelvir–ritonavir group was hospitalized before delivery with palpitations and worsening shortness of breath; there were no hospital admissions in the no medication group. Reported side effects are shown in Appendix 1, available online. Rates of most antenatal complications were similar between groups.

Delivery data were available for 111 (97.3%) individuals in the nirmatrelvir–ritonavir group and 309 (95.6%) in the no medication group. There were no differences in rates of prematurity or low birth weight.

### Optimizing pharmacology studies in pregnant and lactating women using lessons from HIV: A consensus statement [^113xq4a8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Dapivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to be used for pre-exposure prophylaxis as a 25 mg dapivirine vaginal ring, is expected to be used in lactating women as breastfeeding is supported in countries with high HIV incidence. Therefore, breastmilk and maternal concentrations during breastfeeding were assessed in a short course pharmacokinetic (PK) study in 16 healthy women. In both breastmilk and maternal plasma, low dapivirine levels were detectable. Terminal half-life of 39 hours in milk and 35.2 hours in plasma were reported, resulting in an estimated infant exposure of 65 ng/kg/day through breastmilk. A study on the safety and drug detection of the dapivirine vaginal ring in breastfeeding mother–infant pairs (NCT04140266) is planned, and a study of the safety of the dapivirine vaginal ring in pregnancy (NCT03965923) is recruiting. The latter study evaluates the maternal and infant safety of two pre-exposure prophylaxis methods: the dapivirine vaginal ring and daily oral Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in 750 HIV-uninfected pregnant women and their infants. Safety of the mother and child are the primary objectives, but also include dapivirine levels in the mother during pregnancy and the infant after delivery.

For all other new antiretrovirals (ARVs), no information on planned pregnancy or lactation studies is available, to our knowledge. It is imperative that this population, people living with HIV (PLWHIV), be included in planned studies of new agents as described in Figure 3 where optimal timing and steps are proposed. This is especially important for long-acting ARVs; a PK in pregnancy substudy should be part of all studies with participant.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: Workshop summary [^113tN6cY]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

- **The expert panel's recommendations for clinical care**: Clinicians and patients must make decisions incorporating the available data on the maternal, fetal, and neonatal impact of disease; drug pharmacokinetics; maternal and neonatal safety; limitations of the data sources; and guidelines from scientific bodies if they exist. Panelists used examples of commonly used drugs such as acetaminophen, pseudoephedrine, and antihypertensive agents to illustrate the risk-benefit analysis undertaken to inform clinical practice.

When clinicians utilize any drug or counsel women about OTC medications, there needs to be a risk-benefit analysis. When there are multiple options, the drug with the most favorable benefit-risk ratio is utilized, considering the health of both the mother and her baby. There should be readily accessible information on drugs that addresses the critical components needed to make clinical decisions for clinicians to apply this risk-benefit analysis.

In the last 30 years, providers have relied heavily on the FDA's pregnancy labeling that classified drugs as A, B, C, D, and X. However, these categories were vague and often misleading. As of June 2015, all new medications approved by the FDA have a new pregnancy label with a narrative section that includes a risk summary, clinical considerations, and supporting data. A section on lactation provides data on the neonatal effects of the drug. In addition, the existence of drug registries is displayed. While the new label should represent a vast improvement in providing useful information, most drugs will no longer use the old classification system.

### Cyred Eq [^114kUT6J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Important points to remember**: Before you start taking your pills, be sure to read these directions anytime you are not sure what to do.

- **The right way to take the pill**: Take one pill every day at the same time. If you miss pills, you could get pregnant, which includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.

- **Common side effects**: Many women experience spotting, light bleeding, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first 1 to 3 packs of pills. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your healthcare professional.

### Comparative safety of antiretroviral treatment regimens in pregnancy [^115bP3K6]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Maternal antiretroviral treatment (ART) started before conception may increase the risk for adverse birth outcomes among women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but whether the risk differs by ART regimen is unknown.

- **Objective**: To compare the risk for selected birth outcomes by maternal ART regimen.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This observational birth outcomes surveillance study compared all live births and stillbirths with a gestational age of at least 24 weeks in 8 geographically dispersed government hospitals throughout Botswana (approximately 45% of births nationwide). Data were collected from August 15, 2014, through August 15, 2016.

- **Exposures**: Births among HIV-infected women who started 3-drug ART regimens before their last menstrual period and did not switch or stop ART in pregnancy were considered to be ART exposed from conception.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were any adverse birth outcome, including stillbirth, preterm birth (< 37 weeks), small size for gestational age (SGA; < 10th percentile of weight for gestational age) or neonatal death (< 28 days from delivery), and any severe adverse outcome, including very preterm birth (< 32 weeks), very SGA (< 3rd percentile of weight for gestational age), stillbirth, and neonatal death.

- **Results**: Information was available for 47,027 of 47,124 births (99.8%) at surveillance maternity hospitals (mean [SD] age of mothers, 26.86 [6.45] years). Among 11,932 HIV-exposed infants, 5,780 (48.4%) were ART exposed from conception. Adverse birth outcomes were more common among HIV-exposed infants.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs commonly used in pregnancy and parturition [^116v8SJg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The majority of pregnant women will be treated with a medication other than a vitamin supplement during their pregnancy. Almost half of these medications will be categorized as C or D, according to the former U.S. Food and Drug Administration classification system. This indicates a lack of human studies with animal studies suggesting adverse fetal effects (category C) or evidence of risk in humans (category D). Changes in maternal physiology alter drug bioavailability, distribution, and clearance, thus affecting the drug half-life in often unpredictable ways.

For many drugs, good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in pregnancy and parturition are lacking. However, for other drugs, recent studies demonstrate significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic changes that require dose adjustment in pregnancy, but dosing guidelines do not yet reflect these data. In this review, we address the principles that underlie changes in pharmacology and physiology during pregnancy and provide information on drugs that anesthesiologists commonly encounter when treating pregnant patients.

### Paxlovid [^116VSfjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

To ensure appropriate dosing in patients with severe renal impairment, including those requiring hemodialysis, instruct patients to take two 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablets with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together once on Day 1, followed by one 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together once daily on Days 2–5. Instruct patients to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. On days when patients undergo hemodialysis, instruct them to take the PAXLOVID dose after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Inform patients to take PAXLOVID with or without food at approximately the same time each day as instructed. Advise patients to swallow all tablets for PAXLOVID whole and not to chew, break, or crush the tablets. Alert the patient of the importance of completing the full 5-day treatment course and continuing isolation in accordance with public health recommendations to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If the patient misses a dose of PAXLOVID within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy and lactation [^116iPmXa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Data on its use in pregnancy, including prescribing patterns and patient experience (adverse effects, incidence of rebound), are limited. We performed a cross-sectional study in which we surveyed a cohort of vaccinated pregnant or lactating individuals with breakthrough COVID-19. Of 35 pregnant respondents, 51.4% were prescribed and 34.3% took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; of these, 91.7% experienced dysgeusia and 50.0% had rebound (50.0% positive test result, 33.3% return of symptoms). Three of five lactating respondents were prescribed the medication, and two took it. There were no significant adverse outcomes. Unknown risk was the most common reason for declining nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. More research is needed to establish the safety of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in pregnancy and lactation, to improve public health messaging, and to increase uptake of this treatment.

### Optimizing pharmacology studies in pregnant and lactating women using lessons from HIV: A consensus statement [^117BB3UD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

The most objective index of infant exposure to maternal drug is drug concentration in infant plasma. Repeated dosing of the infant through frequent breastfeeding often results in limited changes in infant plasma concentration during the maternal dosing interval. Therefore, it is generally sufficient to collect 2–3 blood samples during a single dosing interval. Data describing the specific time of feeds and their duration are often difficult to collect and may be unnecessary. Other matrices to consider in assessing infant exposure are urine and intracellular drug concentrations. The use of dried blood spot and dried breastmilk spot as micro sampling techniques are acceptable if validated assays are available, as reported for some non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors.

The preferred metric to describe infant dosing is the relative infant dose estimated from drug dosage from maternal breastmilk (milk drug concentration * milk volume, where the average milk volume ingested is set to 150 mL/kg/day) and the usual weight-adjusted therapeutic dose in infants (where available) or adults. However, since the bioavailability of drugs in breastmilk is generally different from other standard vehicles, the relative infant dose should be interpreted with caution.

### FDA's proposed rule for pregnancy and lactation labeling: Improving maternal child health through well-informed medicine use [^117NhSej]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

For the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the May 29, 2008 publication of the Proposed Rule for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products heralded both an end and a beginning. It marked an end to the labeling initiative process that produced the Proposed Rule and the beginning of the FDA's second-generation approach to labeling drugs and biologics for use during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and the childbearing years. These proposed changes reflect the extensive input and feedback the FDA collected from clinicians and experts, and are designed to facilitate informed counseling about, and prescribing of, medicines for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing potential.

The prescription drug label is the FDA's communication tool - it is the place to clearly convey what is known about the safe and effective use of a drug in various populations. With the development and implementation of the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR), the FDA transformed the prescription drug label into a better communication tool in which information is better organized, clearly presented, and more easily located. The Proposed Rule for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling is the final piece of the PLR, creating a detailed and defined framework in which to present what is and is not known about the use of drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^116u4Cy8]. Department of Health and Human Services (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ritonavir PO (also known as Norvir) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Enroll patients in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. Monitor blood glucose. Initiate antiretroviral therapy in all patients during pregnancy, regardless of human immunodeficiency RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count.

Initiate ritonavir at low doses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in combination with other protease inhibitors. Do not use ritonavir oral solution during pregnancy, as it contains ethanol. The drug ritonavir PO (also known as Norvir) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Rationale and design for an investigation to optimize selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment for pregnant women with depression [^116P8ApR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The physiological changes of pregnancy can affect the pharmacokinetics of a drug, thereby affecting its dose requirements. Because pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in pregnant women have rarely been conducted, evidence-based dosing adjustments are seldom available. In particular, despite the fact that the use of antidepressants has become increasingly common, pregnancy-associated PK changes of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are largely unknown.

### FDA drug labeling for pregnancy and lactation drug safety monitoring systems [^111wJywQ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

The product label required by the FDA for every drug approved for marketing in the US is a legal document originating with the company that wants to market the drug, but it must be approved by the FDA. Despite the recognized limitations of registries, the FDA's new labeling rule, effective from July 1, 2015, has prioritized the data available from post-marketing surveillance in the new label. For this information to be maximally useful to both providers and consumers, providers must refer as many exposed consumers as possible to the registries, preferably prior to knowledge of the outcomes of the pregnancies. Consumers need to cooperate with the registries to share their health information with as much detail as possible. It will take years to accumulate a meaningful quantity of information in many of the registries, but they promise to be our best hope for useful counseling information in the future.

### Availability of safe and effective therapeutic options to pregnant and lactating individuals following the United States Food and Drug Administration Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule [^115ar8nT]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The objective is to explore the extent and type of pregnancy and lactation data of newly approved prescription drugs and assess whether the presented recommendations are data-driven, as required by the US Food and Drug Administration Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule implemented in 2015.

In this descriptive analysis, we reviewed pregnancy and lactation data of all new molecular entities approved between 2001 and 2020 in their most updated labeling. Information was collected regarding the pregnancy and lactation risk statements, the source of pregnancy and lactation data, and the design and methods of pregnancy and lactation studies in the labeling.

Of the 422 new molecular entities, the key advisory statement for use of 133 (32%) drugs in pregnancy and 194 (46%) drugs in lactation were classified as "against use". Less than 2% of all drugs had a key advisory statement that supported their use during pregnancy or lactation. The sources of data regarding use in pregnancy were studies in human and animals in 46 (11%) and 348 (82%) drugs, respectively. For use during lactation, data included studies in human and animals in 23 (5%) and 251 (59%) drugs, respectively. The key advisory recommendation was consistent with the available human information in 4 (8%) drugs in pregnancy and 3 (13%) drugs in lactation. Prescription drug labeling contains limited data to support informed decision-making for the use of prescription drugs during pregnancy/lactation. Close collaboration among stakeholders is required to enhance the availability of data in this population.

### SPL drug information for darunavir ethanolate [^114ZfAWW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of darunavir ethanolate PO (also known as Prezista, Prezista) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: it is generally acceptable for use. Use 600 mg PO BID. Consider using 800 mg PO once daily in patients already stable on that dose before pregnancy. The drug darunavir ethanolate PO (also known as Prezista, Prezista) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### SPL drug information for indinavir sulfate [^111VHHZP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of indinavir sulfate PO (also known as Crixivan) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals.

Monitor CD4 counts, plasma HIV RNA, and viral load. Perform standard glucose screening and monitor neonates for hyperbilirubinemia. A second trimester ultrasound can be used for both anatomical survey and determination of gestational age. A first trimester ultrasound can determine gestational age. Antiretroviral therapy should be provided to all women during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count.

Using highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and to minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. The drug indinavir sulfate PO (also known as Crixivan) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed.

Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Prezista [^112AJqj2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Human data

Prezista/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily) in combination with a background regimen was evaluated in a clinical trial of 36 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters, and postpartum. Eighteen subjects were enrolled in each BID and QD treatment arms. Twenty-nine subjects completed the trial through the postpartum period (6–12 weeks after delivery) and 7 subjects discontinued before trial completion, 5 subjects in the BID arm and 2 subjects in the QD arm.

The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that exposure to darunavir and ritonavir as part of an antiretroviral regimen was lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6–12 weeks). Exposure reductions during pregnancy were greater for the once daily regimen as compared to the twice daily regimen [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Virologic response was preserved for the participants. In the BID arm, the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL was 39% (7/18) at baseline, 61% (11/18) through the third trimester visit, and 61% (11/18) through the 6–12 week postpartum visit. Virologic outcomes during the third trimester visit showed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL for 11% (2/18) of subjects and were missing for 5 subjects (1 subject discontinued prematurely due to virologic failure). In the QD arm, the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL was 61% (11/18) at baseline, 83% (15/18) through the third trimester visit, and 78% (14/18) through the 6–12 week postpartum visit. Virologic outcomes during the third trimester visit showed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL for none of the subjects.

### The pharmacokinetics of abacavir 600 mg once daily in HIV-1-positive pregnant women [^112Lbgr2]. AIDS (2016). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the pharmacokinetics of abacavir 600 mg once daily (q.d.) in HIV-1-positive women during pregnancy and postpartum.

- **Design**: A nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, phase IV study.

- **Methods**: HIV-positive pregnant women receiving abacavir 600 mg q.d. as part of clinical care were included. Intensive 24-hour pharmacokinetic sampling was performed during the third trimester and at least 2 weeks after delivery. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. Paired cord blood and maternal blood samples were taken at delivery when feasible.

- **Results**: A total of 14 women were included in the analysis. Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) of the third trimester versus postpartum were 1.05 (0.92–1.19) for AUC0–24h and 1.00 (0.83–1.21) for Cmax. The median (range) ratio of abacavir cord plasma to maternal plasma was 1.0 (0.7–1.0, n = 3). Viral load at the third trimester visit was less than 50 copies/ml in 13 participants (93%; one unknown). In total, 13 (93%; one unknown) children were tested HIV-negative.

The conclusion drawn is that the pharmacokinetics of abacavir 600 mg q.d. during pregnancy are equivalent to postpartum. No dose adjustments are required during pregnancy, and similar antiviral activity is expected.

### Keytruda [^1158PgYu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise females of reproductive potential about the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Advise these females to use effective contraception during treatment with Keytruda and for 4 months after the last dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

- **Lactation**: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Keytruda and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Laboratory tests**: Advise patients of the importance of keeping scheduled appointments for blood work or other laboratory tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Pharmacokinetics of drugs in pregnancy [^116AtdXy]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pregnancy is a complex state where changes in maternal physiology have evolved to favor the development and growth of the placenta and the fetus. These adaptations may affect preexisting disease or result in pregnancy-specific disorders. Similarly, variations in physiology may alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics that determine drug dosing and effect. It follows that detailed pharmacologic information is required to adjust therapeutic treatment strategies during pregnancy. Understanding both pregnancy physiology and the gestation-specific pharmacology of different agents is necessary to achieve effective treatment and limit maternal and fetal risk.

Unfortunately, most drug studies have excluded pregnant women based on often-mistaken concerns regarding fetal risk. Furthermore, over two-thirds of women receive prescription drugs while pregnant, with treatment and dosing strategies based on data from healthy male volunteers and non-pregnant women, and with little adjustment for the complex physiology of pregnancy and its unique disease states. This review will describe basic concepts in pharmacokinetics and their clinical relevance, and highlight the variations in pregnancy that may impact the pharmacokinetic properties of medications.
