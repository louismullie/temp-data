## Question

What are the benefits of vitamin D three

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) across different populations and health outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core distinction between vitamin D3 and other forms and why that matters. Then, I should verify the highest-certainty evidence for mortality. Next, I will examine skeletal outcomes, including fractures and falls, and reconcile conflicting guidance. After that, I will review extraskeletal domains such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory infections, cardiovascular disease, and immune modulation. Finally, I will stratify by population, consider dosing and safety, and synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations with explicit uncertainties and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the formulation issue, because I need to ensure we are attributing benefits to the right molecule. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is generally more potent and sustained than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, particularly with bolus dosing, which can influence pharmacokinetics and clinical interpretation of trials; this pharmacologic difference underpins why many contemporary guidelines prefer D3 when supplementation is indicated [^114bMinG] [^11639dQb].

> Now, I should verify the most consistent and clinically important signal: all-cause mortality. Multiple meta-analyses and the 2024 Endocrine Society guideline converge on a small but credible reduction in all-cause mortality with vitamin D3, on the order of roughly 3–5% relative risk reduction, with the clearest signal in older adults. For example, the Cochrane analysis found an RR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91–0.98) for D3, and the Endocrine Society estimates about 6 fewer deaths per 1000 people over the median follow-up, with community-based trials showing RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.90–0.99) [^113Gd1nz] [^111J9m4h] [^115gnERY]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction across sources; yes, the direction is consistent, though the absolute effect is modest and likely modified by baseline status and follow-up duration, which I will revisit shortly [^115gnERY].

> Next, I will examine skeletal outcomes, and I need to be careful not to overstate. For fracture prevention, large contemporary trials in generally replete populations (for example, VITAL and D-Health) have not shown reductions in fractures with vitamin D3 alone, and the USPSTF issues an I statement for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling adults. Benefits appear confined to settings with high baseline deficiency and when calcium is co-administered, particularly in institutionalized older adults, with meta-analytic estimates around a 10–20% reduction in such contexts [^111Wwyny] [^114Q6qvz] [^117Dv1th] [^1165kh6X]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance about falls; the Endocrine Society notes that while some meta-analyses show no overall fracture benefit, subgroup and dose-pattern analyses suggest fall risk may be reduced with standard daily dosing, whereas intermittent high-dose regimens may increase falls, which reconciles seemingly conflicting statements across reviews and guidelines [^111f8jEM] [^1153hWLu].

> I will now examine cancer outcomes, and I should double-check the distinction between incidence and mortality. High-quality RCTs have not demonstrated a reduction in overall cancer incidence with vitamin D3, but several meta-analyses suggest a modest reduction in cancer mortality, on the order of about 12–13% in some analyses; this pattern implies possible effects on tumor biology or late outcomes rather than primary prevention of new cancers, and the certainty remains limited by trial design and follow-up [^116VfQDV] [^1167SsYH]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude; yes, the Cochrane cancer review and subsequent syntheses align with a cancer mortality signal around RR 0.88, albeit with low to moderate certainty and potential type I error, so I should frame this as a probable but small effect needing replication [^116VfQDV] [^1167SsYH].

> Turning to diabetes, I need to check whether prediabetes is where benefit exists. Meta-analyses of diabetes prevention trials indicate that vitamin D reduces progression from prediabetes to diabetes by about 12–15%, with stronger signals in those with very low baseline 25(OH)D, including a notable hazard ratio near 0.38 in individuals with baseline levels below 12 ng/mL. This is why the Endocrine Society suggests empiric vitamin D for high-risk prediabetes, while acknowledging that optimal dosing remains uncertain [^1125G2hs] [^115648Jz] [^111J9m4h]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the effect is modest on average and likely concentrated in the deficient subgroup, so universal supplementation for diabetes prevention in replete adults is not supported [^111J9m4h].

> For respiratory tract infections, I should confirm age-specific effects. In children and adolescents, empiric vitamin D is associated with fewer respiratory infections, whereas in adults the evidence is mixed and likely dependent on baseline status; military and athletic cohorts suggest shorter URTI duration when starting 25(OH)D is below 50 nmol/L, reinforcing a "treat the deficient" paradigm rather than blanket supplementation for immune outcomes [^111J9m4h] [^1128KZaN]. Let me reconsider whether higher thresholds confer added benefit; current data do not show incremental protection beyond achieving at least 50 nmol/L, which tempers calls for very high targets in this domain [^1128KZaN].

> Cardiovascular disease is an area where I need to be precise and avoid over-interpretation. Large primary prevention trials (for example, VITAL and ViDA) have not shown reductions in major cardiovascular events with vitamin D3, and Mendelian randomization and meta-analyses generally do not support a causal cardiovascular benefit. Thus, vitamin D should not be used for CVD prevention outside of correcting deficiency, despite biologic plausibility [^1143jjMs] [^1159HZ5X]. Hmm, wait a minute, could subgroups with severe deficiency behave differently? Possibly, but current RCTs have not validated that hypothesis, so clinical practice should not rely on CVD benefit expectations [^1143jjMs].

> Immune modulation beyond respiratory infections remains investigational. Observational and mechanistic data link vitamin D status to autoimmunity and inflammatory signaling, but high-quality RCTs have not consistently demonstrated clinically meaningful immunologic benefits in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, where trials have shown no effect on relapse or disability; thus, any immune benefits remain unproven for routine supplementation in the general population [^112efLqS] [^113UqxEs]. I should confirm that ongoing studies may clarify thresholds and populations, but current guidance does not support supplementation solely for immune modulation outside specific contexts like deficiency correction [^113UqxEs].

> Let me now stratify by population, because baseline risk and status modify absolute benefit. In adults aged 75 years and older, empiric daily vitamin D3 is suggested by the Endocrine Society due to a small but meaningful mortality reduction and potential fall benefit with standard dosing; routine 25(OH)D testing is not recommended in this group given lack of a validated threshold and potential equity barriers [^111J9m4h] [^1127DaJc]. In pregnancy, vitamin D is suggested to lower risks of preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age birth, and possibly neonatal mortality, though optimal dosing remains uncertain and many trials allowed background supplements, so shared decision-making is prudent [^111J9m4h]. In children and adolescents, vitamin D prevents rickets and may reduce respiratory infections, supporting empiric supplementation in 1–18 year olds; for infants, 400 IU/day is standard to prevent deficiency when breastfed [^111J9m4h] [^112sVwNY]. For adults aged 50–74, the panel finds little to no benefit and suggests against empiric supplementation above DRI and against routine screening, except in those with prediabetes where benefit is plausible [^111FnWfU] [^111J9m4h].

> I should confirm dosing principles and safety, and here I need to correct a common pitfall. Initially, I thought "more is better" for musculoskeletal outcomes, but wait, intermittent high-dose bolus regimens (for example, monthly or annual mega-doses) have been associated with increased falls and possibly fractures in older adults, so daily dosing in the 800–2000 IU range is preferred when supplementation is indicated. The Endocrine Society explicitly recommends daily lower-dose rather than non-daily high-dose in adults ≥ 50 years [^111tCW7g] [^1153hWLu] [^115txpG3]. I should double-check safety ceilings; chronic intakes up to 4000 IU/day are generally within tolerable limits for most adults, and very high bolus dosing should be avoided outside specific protocols, with attention to calcium co-administration because combined vitamin D and calcium increases nephrolithiasis risk in some populations [^111HyF5g] [^113Gd1nz].

> Next, I should review screening recommendations, because this often drives unnecessary testing. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults, and the 2024 Endocrine Society guideline similarly suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the general population, emphasizing that outcome-linked thresholds have not been established and that testing may impede equity and access without proven benefit [^111UJRQk] [^113VHJ8R]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions; yes, targeted testing remains appropriate for patients with conditions that alter vitamin D metabolism or calcium-phosphate homeostasis, but empiric supplementation decisions should not hinge on screening in otherwise healthy adults [^113VHJ8R].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not overstating. The most consistent and clinically meaningful benefit of vitamin D3 is a modest reduction in all-cause mortality in older adults, with the clearest signal in those aged 75 years and above; fracture prevention is not achieved by vitamin D3 alone in replete, community-dwelling adults but emerges when vitamin D is combined with calcium in institutionalized or severely deficient elders; cancer incidence is unaffected, but cancer mortality may be modestly reduced; diabetes progression is slowed in prediabetes, especially when baseline 25(OH)D is very low; respiratory infections may decrease in children; and cardiovascular benefits have not been demonstrated in RCTs of generally replete populations [^111J9m4h] [^111Wwyny] [^116VfQDV] [^1125G2hs] [^1128KZaN] [^1143jjMs]. I should confirm that the overarching principle is to "treat deficiency" and to use daily, moderate dosing when supplementation is indicated, rather than pursuing high-dose bolus strategies or routine screening in the general population [^115txpG3] [^113VHJ8R].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical guidance is clear and aligned with guidelines. For adults 75 years and older, consider empiric daily vitamin D3 in the 800–2000 IU range without routine testing; for pregnancy, discuss supplementation with prenatal care given potential maternal-fetal benefits; for children 1–18 years, support empiric vitamin D for rickets prevention and possible infection reduction; for adults 50–74 without prediabetes, avoid empiric supplementation above DRI and avoid screening; for individuals with prediabetes, especially if 25(OH)D is low, consider supplementation to reduce diabetes progression; and across all groups, prefer daily D3, avoid intermittent high-dose boluses, and co-administer calcium only when there is a clear indication and after discussing nephrolithiasis risk [^111J9m4h] [^115txpG3] [^113Gd1nz]. But wait, what if baseline status is unknown? Given the low risk and cost of daily D3 at standard doses, empiric supplementation in the groups where benefit is suggested is reasonable, while recognizing that the absolute benefits are modest and that ongoing trials may refine thresholds and dosing in the future [^111J9m4h] [^115gnERY].

---

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) confers **modest mortality benefit** [^111J9m4h] and **skeletal benefits** in older or deficient adults, but does not clearly reduce fractures in replete populations [^1165kh6X] [^111Wwyny]. It lowers cancer mortality [^113Gd1nz] and may reduce respiratory infections in children and high-risk adults [^111J9m4h] [^1128KZaN]. Evidence is limited or mixed for cardiovascular, autoimmune, and cognitive outcomes [^1143jjMs] [^112efLqS] [^116R6KAF]. Routine screening is not recommended [^111UJRQk]; **targeted supplementation is advised** for older adults, people with limited sun exposure, dark skin, obesity, malabsorption, chronic liver/kidney disease, pregnancy, lactation, infants, and those at risk of deficiency [^111J9m4h] [^116sT4h1].

## Skeletal health

- **Bone mineral density (BMD)**: Vitamin D3 enhances calcium absorption and bone mineralization, helping maintain or modestly improve BMD, especially in older adults or those with low baseline 25(OH)D [^114aveQL].

- **Fracture prevention**: Benefits are most consistent in institutionalized or vitamin D–deficient older adults; in community-dwelling, replete populations, vitamin D3 alone does not significantly reduce fractures [^1165kh6X] [^111Wwyny].

- **Fall risk**: May reduce falls in older adults, particularly when combined with calcium or when baseline 25(OH)D is low [^112oq1Vp].

---

## Mortality and chronic disease

- **All-cause mortality**: Meta-analyses suggest a modest reduction in all-cause mortality with vitamin D3, particularly in older adults [^113Gd1nz] [^115gnERY].

- **Cancer mortality**: Vitamin D3 reduces cancer mortality, though evidence for incidence is mixed [^113Gd1nz] [^116VfQDV].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: No consistent benefit on cardiovascular events or mortality in randomized trials [^1143jjMs] [^1159HZ5X].

- **Respiratory infections**: May reduce respiratory tract infections, especially in children and high-risk adults [^117Va2Uq] [^1128KZaN].

---

## Immune function and autoimmune diseases

Immune modulation involves **complex effects** of vitamin D3 on innate and adaptive immunity, with potential anti-inflammatory actions [^11313PxD]. Autoimmune diseases show **limited or mixed evidence**; no clear benefit for conditions such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis [^112efLqS] [^11639dQb].

---

## Cognitive function and neurological health

Cognitive function shows **limited evidence**; some observational studies suggest associations with better cognitive outcomes, but randomized trials are inconclusive [^116R6KAF].

---

## Population-specific benefits

| **Population** | **Evidence of benefit** |
|-|-|
| Older adults (≥ 75 years) | - Modest mortality reduction [^111J9m4h] <br/> - Potential fall risk reduction [^112oq1Vp] |
| Individuals with limited sun exposure | - Improved BMD [^114aveQL] <br/> - Reduced fracture risk [^114aveQL] |
| Individuals with dark skin | - Address higher prevalence of deficiency [^113mFGVQ] <br/> - Potential skeletal benefits [^116Q4h2v] |
| Individuals with obesity | - Higher vitamin D requirements [^1113qXWH] <br/> - Potential metabolic benefits [^1125G2hs] |
| Pregnant and lactating women | - Reduced risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight [^116sT4h1] [^117Va2Uq] |
| Infants and children | - Prevention of rickets [^112sVwNY] <br/> - Potential reduction in respiratory infections [^116sT4h1] |

---

## Safety and tolerability

Safety is favorable at typical doses; **routine supplementation up to 4000 IU/day is generally safe**, with low risk of hypercalcemia or kidney stones [^111XtMAu] [^111HyF5g]. High-dose bolus regimens may increase fall risk and are not recommended for older adults [^1153hWLu] [^115txpG3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Routine screening is not recommended for **asymptomatic adults**; **targeted testing** is advised for high-risk groups [^113VHJ8R] [^114gUrCM]. Supplementation is advised for older adults, individuals with limited sun exposure, dark skin, obesity, malabsorption, chronic liver or kidney disease, pregnancy, lactation, and infants [^1126dgNJ] [^116sT4h1].

---

Vitamin D3 provides **modest mortality and skeletal benefits** in older or deficient adults, lowers cancer mortality, and may reduce respiratory infections in children and high-risk adults. Evidence is limited for cardiovascular, autoimmune, and cognitive outcomes. Routine screening is not recommended; **targeted supplementation is advised** for high-risk populations.

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

### Evidence-based policy on dietary calcium and vitamin D [^1167np1J]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine's report on calcium and vitamin D makes a positive contribution by grounding its recommendations on the available evidence base. The committee does not substantially change recommended dietary intakes for calcium and modestly increases those for vitamin D based on the need for a median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40 nmol/L. They do not support the suggestion that all adults should have levels > 75 nmol/L. The committee concludes that current evidence does not support nonskeletal benefits for vitamin D or calcium, and notes that higher intakes of both could have adverse health consequences. The present authors are generally in agreement with these conclusions, with some caveats regarding the evidence base used. However, we believe that the central role of sunlight exposure in determining vitamin D status needs to be explicitly reflected in public policy in this area.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults states that for asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults, the USPSTF found that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency (I statement). It applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended and does not apply to persons who are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes. Implementation notes add that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for vitamin D deficiency, and the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF statement.

Conclusions

The putative pleiotropic benefits of vitamin D supplementation warrant further in-depth exploration with adequately powered multi-centre randomised trials.

This would require reliable assessment of baseline vitamin D status and metabolites with standardised assays. The most effective and safe method of supplementation with respect to preparation, dose, route and frequency of administration are all important considerations. In addition, an appropriate population should be identified who are most likely to benefit from supplementation and stratification of the population or a priori subgroups may need to be considered. Finally, relevant patient-centred primary and secondary endpoints will need to be selected.

Abstract

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — scope and evidence methods: The guideline addresses use of vitamin D to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing, assumes the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as a baseline standard, and focuses on adults ages 19 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older; populations examined include pregnant individuals and those with prediabetes, dark complexion, and obesity, and questions include daily versus intermittent dosing and whether to limit supplementation to those below a circulating 25(OH)D threshold. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized; large (≥ 1000 participants) longitudinal cohort studies with appropriate comparators were considered when RCTs were insufficient, while trials of vitamin D analogs or metabolites and Mendelian randomization studies were excluded. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, including stakeholder values, costs, acceptability, feasibility, and equity, were used to assess certainty and inform recommendations.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults [^116VfQDV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation is effective in decreasing cancers is contradictory.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science to February 2014. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults who were healthy or were recruited among the general population, or diagnosed with a specific disease. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D₂ (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). We considered risk of bias in order to assess the risk of systematic errors. We conducted trial sequential analyses to assess the risk of random errors.

Main Results

Eighteen randomised trials with 50,623 participants provided data for the analyses. All trials came from high-income countries. Most of the trials had a high risk of bias, mainly for-profit bias. Most trials included elderly community-dwelling women (aged 47 to 97 years). Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of six years. Fourteen trials tested vitamin D₃, one trial tested vitamin D₂, and three trials tested calcitriol supplementation. Cancer occurrence was observed in 1927/25,275 (7.6%) recipients of vitamin D versus 1943/25,348 (7.7%) recipients of control interventions (RR 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.06); P = 0.88; I² = 0%; 18 trials; 50,623 participants; moderate quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) of the 18 vitamin D trials shows that the futility area is reached after the 10th trial, allowing us to conclude that a possible intervention effect, if any, is lower than a 5% relative risk reduction. We did not observe substantial differences in the effect of vitamin D on cancer in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared to trials at high risk of bias; of trials with no risk of for-profit bias compared to trials with risk of for-profit bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared to trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL at entry compared to trials including participants with vitamin D levels of 20 ng/mL or more at entry; or of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared to trials without calcium. Vitamin D decreased all-cause mortality (1854/24,846 (7.5%) versus 2007/25,020 (8.0%); RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98); P = 0.009; I² = 0%; 15 trials; 49,866 participants; moderate quality evidence), but TSA indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. Cancer occurrence was observed in 1918/24,908 (7.7%) recipients of vitamin D₃ versus 1933/24,983 (7.7%) in recipients of control interventions (RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.06); P = 0.88; I² = 0%; 14 trials; 49,891 participants; moderate quality evidence). TSA of the vitamin D₃ trials shows that the futility area is reached after the 10th trial, allowing us to conclude that a possible intervention effect, if any, is lower than a 5% relative risk reduction. Vitamin D₃ decreased cancer mortality (558/22,286 (2.5%) versus 634/22,206 (2.8%); RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 4 trials; 44,492 participants; low quality evidence), but TSA indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. Vitamin D₃ combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 3 trials; 42,753 participants; moderate quality evidence). TSA, however, indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. We did not find any data on health-related quality of life or health economics in the randomised trials included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no firm evidence that vitamin D supplementation decreases or increases cancer occurrence in predominantly elderly community-dwelling women. Vitamin D₃ supplementation decreased cancer mortality and vitamin D supplementation decreased all-cause mortality, but these estimates are at risk of type I errors due to the fact that too few participants were examined, and to risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants. Combined vitamin D₃ and calcium supplements increased nephrolithiasis, whereas it remains unclear from the included trials whether vitamin D₃, calcium, or both were responsible for this effect. We need more trials on vitamin D supplementation, assessing the benefits and harms among younger participants, men, and people with low vitamin D status, and assessing longer duration of treatments as well as higher dosages of vitamin D. Follow-up of all participants is necessary to reduce attrition bias.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

### Impact of new vitamin D data on future studies and treatment [^114LLuT1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates recently published data on clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation, focusing on randomized, placebo-controlled trials and nontraditional actions on the cardiovascular and immune systems.

Recent Findings

Several randomized trials evaluating vitamin D therapy have recently emerged, in both the general population and in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the former, measurable effects on cardiovascular risk factors have not been detected, with the possible exception of a modest reduction in blood pressure. Studies aimed at boosting immunity have demonstrated efficacy only in specific, high-risk populations. In CKD, the benefits of nutritional vitamin D appear largely limited to earlier stages of disease. Benefits of active vitamin D agents, outside of their known effects on mineral metabolism, have also thus far eluded detection. One possible exception that has accumulated supportive evidence is the link between active vitamin D analogs and decreased proteinuria. Large-scale clinical trials, now underway, will be critical to understanding of the potential benefits and hazards of vitamin D treatment.

Summary

New trials evaluating the effects of vitamin D supplementation have failed to reveal any robust clinical benefits beyond its known actions on mineral and bone disease.

### Screening and treatment of vitamin D deficiency on hospital admission: is there a benefit for medical inpatients? [^113C5hj8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Whether screening and treatment of vitamin D deficiency improves clinical outcomes in medical inpatients remains unclear. We performed a systematic search and summarized the evidence from observational and randomized, controlled studies (RCTs) on the influence of vitamin D deficiency and its treatment on patient outcomes.

Methods

The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in January 2015 using the terms "vitamin D deficiency", "vitamin D", "mortality", "inpatient", "length of stay", "hospitalization", "accidental falls", "quality of life", "activities of daily living", and "intensive care units".

Results

Of 239 potential studies, 29 observational studies and 5 RCTs were included. Observational studies revealed an association between vitamin D deficiency and adverse patient outcomes, such as mortality, higher incidence and severity of infections, and increased duration of hospital stay, in the inpatient and geriatric patient population. The RCT data, however, are inconclusive regarding beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation for reduction of mortality and length of hospital stay, as well as fall prevention.

Conclusions

Despite evidence of associations in observational studies, high-quality evidence from interventional trials on the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in inpatients is currently lacking. On the basis of the available evidence, general vitamin D screening and supplementation for the medical inpatient population in an acute care setting cannot be recommended.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^113zycws]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The optimal level of vitamin D

In the last decade, there has been growing advocacy for achieving higher circulating levels of 25OHD than are necessary for maintenance of normocalcemia, in the hope that this has additional benefits for bone and non-bone health. In 2011, the governments of USA and Canada commissioned a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and concluded that:
the estimated average vitamin D requirement from all dietary sources should be 10 µg (400 IU) daily in those with minimal sunlight exposure;
a 25OHD level < 30 nmol/l indicated risk of deficiency and 25OHD > 50 nmol/l indicated sufficiency;
25OHD levels in excess of 125 nmol/l could be associated with harm.

The IOM considered that the recommended daily allowance for vitamin D should lead to serum 25OHD levels of at least 50 nmol/l and that individuals below that level should receive vitamin D supplementation. In contrast, the US Endocrine Society has recommended a higher treatment target (70 nmol/l) for health benefits and state that individuals < 50 nmol/l should be considered as vitamin D deficient. On the other hand, in fragile elderly subjects who are at an increased risk of falls and fracture, a minimal serum 25OHD level of 75 nmol/l is recommended by the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO).

### Vitamin D, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: the therapeutic benefit is in the D-tails [^116R6KAF]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

It is noticeable that most trials, showing no cognitive difference in the supplementation arms compared to the comparative arms, have actually included participants with relatively high serum 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline, possibly above the cerebral needs for vitamin D (if any). Moreover, the comparative arm of several trials continued to receive vitamin D supplements, either as part of the study or as part of routine care. So it will be important in the future to examine the cognitive effect of vitamin D supplementation in populations exhibiting vitamin D insufficiency at baseline. The definition of vitamin D insufficiency is consensually not based on what is called a "population-based reference value" (i.e. normality is the reference range involving 95% of the population) but rather on "health-based reference values" (i.e. normality is the 25(OH)D concentration range that prevents adverse health effects). Defining a "cognition-based reference value" is still the matter of debate.

The nature of the delivered molecule also needs to be considered. The difference in binding affinity of vitamin D2 metabolites to VDBP being weaker than that of vitamin D3, this would lead to a shorter half-life and an increased rate of clearance from circulation. The apparent inefficiency of 25(OH)D2 binding to VDBP may be advantageous in the setting of extra-renal metabolism of 25(OH)D where decreased binding to VDBP may increase the uptake of 25(OH)D2 by target cells. Future studies in animal models may aid in evaluating the relative efficacy of each metabolite in reference to cognitive outcomes. In parallel, human studies should incorporate separate measures for 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 in serum and CSF along with total versus free concentrations of each molecule after supplementation with either metabolite.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^11639dQb]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

### Revisiting vitamin D guidelines: a critical appraisal of the literature [^1154h9dU]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

The goal of this review is to compare the 2024 and 2011 Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guidelines on vitamin D 2 or vitamin D 3 (vitamin D). The 2024 Guideline made recommendations for the general healthy population for skeletal and extra skeletal health benefits of vitamin D. This contrasts with the 2011 Guidelines which provided clinicians with guidance on how to evaluate and treat patients with vitamin D deficiency and prevent recurrence.

Discussion

The 2024 Guideline focused on randomized controlled trials and ignored association studies and other studies that have supported the skeletal and extra skeletal health benefits of vitamin D. The 2024 Guideline recommended empiric vitamin D in children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to reduce risk of upper respiratory tract infections, pregnant women to improve pregnancy-related outcomes, prediabetic patients to reduce risk of diabetes, and to improve mortality in those over 75 years.

Conclusion

These guidelines do not apply to individuals with abnormalities in calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and bone metabolism which were provided in the 2011 Guidelines. For nonpregnant adults up to the age of 75, they recommend the Dietary Reference Intakes of 600 IUs (international units; 1 IU = 25 ng of vitamin D), and 800 IUs as recommended by The Institute of Medicine. Association studies have suggested that to obtain maximum extraskeletal benefits from vitamin D including reducing risk of upper respiratory tract infection for children and adults, autoimmune disorders, pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, neonatal dental caries, and deadly cancers circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be at least 30 ng/mL with a preferred range of 40–60 ng/mL as recommended by the 2011 Guidelines.

Figure 1 — Vitamin D for the prevention of disease lists population-specific empiric supplementation as follows: Ages 1–18 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" "To prevent nutritional rickets and because of the potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections", Ages 19–49 state "No empiric vitamin D supplementation" with "Follow the Institute of Medicine Recommended Daily Allowance", Ages 50–74 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation", Ages ≥ 75 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of mortality", Pregnancy indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age birth and neonatal mortality", and Prediabetes indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of progression to diabetes". Empiric vitamin D supplementation* is defined on-page as vitamin D (D3 or D2) intake that exceeds the DRI and is implemented without testing for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and doses in trials varied so optimal doses remain unclear.

### The vitamin D and calcium controversy: an update [^117WFvJC]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is widely recommended for prevention of falls and fracture, particularly in the elderly where calcium intakes and vitamin D levels are often inadequate. A number of meta-analyses have questioned the benefits of untargeted or 'holistic' supplementation for falls and fracture, and raised the possibility of adverse cardiovascular effects. This review provides an update on these controversies.

Recent Findings

Recent advances have largely centred around new trials of vitamin D and meta-analyses of published trials and observational studies. These articles have identified holistic vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium is unlikely to be an effective primary prevention strategy for falls or fracture. There has also been high-quality evidence that vitamin D, daily or as a bolus, does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Summary

The benefits of vitamin D and calcium supplements for holistic fall and fracture prevention remain uncertain. Recent evidence supports the concept that high-dose vitamin D has adverse musculoskeletal effects. Future studies should focus on moderate daily doses. Finally, there remain inconsistent findings for adverse cardiovascular effects of calcium supplements with or without vitamin D. This uncertainty should be taken into account when evaluating the risk/benefits of supplementation.

Vitamin D supplementation and 25(OH)D testing in adults aged 75 years and older — the panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation and issued a conditional recommendation, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in adults aged 75 years and older. The systematic review did not find evidence suggesting that the benefit is restricted to those with 25(OH)D below a threshold, and the panel judged that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity. In trials informing falls and fracture outcomes, the estimated weighted average intervention vitamin D dosage was approximately 990 IU/day (23 μg/day), participants were permitted to remain on vitamin D supplements up to 800 IU (20 μg)/day, and the median dosage of calcium used was 1000 mg per day (500–1500 mg/day).

### Should we screen for vitamin D deficiency? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113hNi1n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued guidelines on screening for vitamin D deficiency. The guidelines were based on randomized trials of vitamin D deficiency screening and treatment, as well as on case-control studies nested within the Women's Health Initiative. The USPSTF concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. Compared with placebo or no treatment, vitamin D was associated with decreased mortality; however, benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded. Vitamin D treatment was associated with a possible decreased risk for at least 1 fall and the total number of falls per person but not for fractures. None of the studies examined the effects of vitamin D screening versus not screening on clinical outcomes. In this Grand Rounds, 2 prominent endocrinologists debate the issue of screening for vitamin D deficiency in a 55-year-old, asymptomatic, postmenopausal woman. They review the data on which the USPSTF recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of screening for vitamin D deficiency in primary care practice.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D and calcium supplementation: The IOM recommends 600 IU for women aged between 50 and 70 years and 800 IU daily for those aged older than 70 years, stating these intakes were sufficient to achieve serum 25-OHD levels of at least 20 ng/mL in most postmenopausal women, but meta-analyses report inconsistent fracture outcomes with most showing no benefit; in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial bone health substudy, 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily for 24 months in healthy women (average age, 63 y; baseline serum 25-OHD 27.6 ng/mL) showed no effect overall or in those with baseline serum 25-OHD less than 30 ng/mL; salutary effects of vitamin D with calcium on fracture risk have been observed most often in institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient older adults; the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of daily vitamin D alone to prevent fractures and recommended against vitamin D supplements to prevent falls; women with osteoporosis do not require more calcium than those with normal bone mineral density (BMD), there is no convincing evidence that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements improves the effectiveness of osteoporosis drugs, and adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D are recommended when taking osteoporosis drugs to reduce the risk of treatment-induced hypocalcemia.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111J9m4h]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Summary of evidence — benefits and harms: The systematic review included 25 trials (49 879 participants) evaluating vitamin D for all-cause mortality across settings including community (n = 17), nursing homes (n = 6), and hospital clinics (n = 2); most used vitamin D3, commonly as a daily dose (13 trials), either alone or with calcium, with follow-up from 12 weeks to 7 years (median 2 years). The evidence suggests vitamin D lowers mortality versus placebo or no D: RR 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–1.00), absolute effect 6 fewer deaths per 1000 people (from 11 fewer to 0 more); community-based studies showed RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90–0.99], and among those with low vitamin D status (< 20 ng/mL [50 nmol/L]) results were consistent (RR of mortality 0.88 [95% CI, 0.46–1.67]). For fractures, trials reporting participants with fractures (43 585 participants) found RR 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94–1.08) with an estimated absolute effect of 1 fewer per 1000 people (from 5 fewer to 6 more).

Evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation could potentially be effective either in treatment or prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Indeed, several studies and trials have begun to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanisms of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of Covid-19. We consider whether deficiency of vitamin D may be one of the underlying biological factors that could explain the excess mortality seen among non-Caucasians. We also raise several important questions which need to be addressed to provide a clear picture of the extent to which vitamin D supplementation may benefit patients with Covid-19, particularly those with underlying risk factors.

### Vitamin D, calcium supplements, and Implications for cardiovascular health: JACC focus seminar [^1165jJm1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are commonly used, often together, to optimize bone health. Multiple observational studies have linked low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with increased cardiovascular risk. However, subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) failed to demonstrate cardiovascular benefit with vitamin D supplementation. Although vitamin D supplements do not appear to be harmful for cardiovascular health, the lack of benefit in RCTs should discourage their use for this purpose, favoring optimizing vitamin D status through healthy lifestyles such as specific foods and modest sunlight exposure. Furthermore, some (but not all) observational and RCT studies of calcium supplementation have suggested potential for cardiovascular harm. Therefore, calcium supplementation should be used cautiously, striving for recommended intake of calcium predominantly from food sources. In this review, the authors examine the currently available evidence investigating whether vitamin D and calcium supplements are helpful, harmful, or neutral for cardiovascular health.

Guidelines and practices

For the general population, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a daily allowance for adults of 600 to 800 IU, while the Endocrine Society Guideline recommends 1,500–2,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day for the at-risk population. Upper daily limits for adults are 4,000 (IOM)–10,000 (Endocrine Society) IU per day. Guidelines for parenteral nutrition recommend 200 IU per day and typical enteral nutrition formulas contain 200–300 IU of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol per 1000 ml. Available over the counter multivitamin preparations commonly contain 200 IU of vitamin D2 or D3. Currently, there is no intravenous vitamin D-monopreparation available, although high-dose intramuscular preparations may be an option in selected patients.

Rationale of the study and hypothesis

In summary, vitamin D plays a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis and is, based on current knowledge, associated with disease severity and mortality in critically ill patients. Moreover, vitamin D exhibits a number of pleiotropic effects that are of special interest to the ICU patient However, so far it is unclear whether a low vitamin D status is causally linked to adverse outcomes or merely an epiphenomenon reflecting poor health status. In contrast to previous clinical trials that failed to show a benefit for correcting hormonal insufficiencies in critical illness (e.g. administration of growth hormone or steroids), one has to bear in mind that vitamin D not only acts on endocrine, but also autocrine level which allows for tissue-specific control of 1,25(OH)2D regulation and action that may be completely independent of circulating calcitriol levels. As far as we know now vitamin D also has an excellent safety profile with a broad therapeutic window.

The hypothesis of this first large RCT is that supplementation with a sufficiently large dose of vitamin D leads to a fast correction of low vitamin D status and possibly to clinical benefits, particularly relating to immune, cardiac and muscle function. Because these potential benefits likely occur at various functional hierarchies, we chose "length of hospital stay" as a primary surrogate marker for a change in morbidity in this patient group.

### Early high-dose vitamin dfor critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^113Raj3k]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) was published by National Heart and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness and Vitamin D deficiency. In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of early high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients? In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the population was: 1078 patients (467 female, 611 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. The key exclusion criteria were an inability to take an enteral drug, a history of kidney stones, the presence of hypercalcemia at baseline, and informed consent not being obtained in a timely manner. In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the interventions were: n = 538 vitamin D (a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D3 in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization) n = 540 placebo (matched placebo in liquid form, administered within 2 hours after randomization). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 90 days (23.5% vs. 20.6%; AD 2.9%, 95% CI -2.1 to 7.9). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in in-hospital mortality at 90 days (17.1% vs. 13.4%; AD 3.7%, 95% CI -0.5 to 8) Borderline significant decrease in hospital length of stay at 90 days (9.1 days vs. 10.4 days; AD -1.4 days, 95% CI -2.7 to 0) No significant difference in ventilator-free days at 28 days (21.3 days vs. 22.1 days; AD -0.8 days, 95% CI -2.1 to 0.5). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious and nonserious adverse events, hypercalcemia, kidney stones, fall-related fractures. significant difference in total calcium level at 14 days (8.9 mg/dl vs. 8.8 mg/dl). In the VIOLET (high-dose vitamin D) study, the conclusion was: in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to a all-cause mortality at 90 days.

### Making sense of the latest advice on vitamin D therapy [^1146EXyq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine recently published recommendations for the daily intake and optimal serum levels of vitamin D based on an extensive review of the existing literature. Here we examine the issue and put levels of vitamin D in context for the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. Large randomized controlled trials are necessary to ensure that current recommendations are appropriate.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions.

Objective

To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of the 14 questions, 10 clinical questions assessed the effect of vitamin D vs no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes; 1 question assessed dosing; and 3 questions addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

Electronic searches yielded 37 007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years with variable certainty of evidence. There was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefit on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls, compared to lower-dose daily dosing. We did not identify trials on the benefits and harms of screening with serum 25(OH)D.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of vitamin D for the prevention of disease. The guideline panel considered additional information about individuals' and providers' values and preferences and other important decisional and contextual factors to develop clinical recommendations.

### Vitamin D supplementation and fractures in adults: a systematic umbrella review of meta-analyses of controlled trials [^113i9HJR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D plays a critical role in musculoskeletal health through its effects on mineral homeostasis and bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency is common among older individuals because of reduced cholecalciferol synthesis in the skin, reduced intestinal calcium (Ca) absorption, and changes in lifestyle favoring lower exposure to ultraviolet radiation. This deficiency may contribute to the observed steep rise in the risk of fractures with older age, particularly at the hip. This is of particular importance given that the estimated 1-year mortality following hip fracture is around 30%.

The benefit of vitamin D supplementation on fracture prevention has been extensively assessed, with an exponential rise in the number of systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) reporting discordant conclusions. A recent review in 2017 identified more than 40 international vitamin D guidelines with highly variable recommendations. There is still conflicting evidence with regards to the extent of vitamin D's benefit in fracture prevention, the target population likely to benefit the most, the desirable serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, the optimal vitamin D dose, and the need for coadministration of Ca.

We therefore conducted an umbrella review of SRs/MAs of vitamin D supplementation randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating fracture risk reduction in adults, to assess the quality of each SR/MA, explore similarities and differences between them, investigate the reasons for any discrepancy, and formulate a reliable conclusion on the topic. Such an approach would bring clarity to much confusion, paving the path for the formulation of informed population-tailored conclusions regarding the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in preventing fractures.

It will also be important to determine whether vitamin D insufficiency triggers AD (i.e. results in a pathological dysfunction of the brain leading to AD) or whether it removes protection of the CNS against AD. Just enough supplements to correct vitamin D insufficiency should be sufficient if vitamin D is a neuroprotectant, although high to very high dose of supplements should be used if vitamin D controls the CNS, with the aim of boosting mental faculties. Also, if vitamin D insufficiency explains partially the pathological process of AD, it may also enhance the efficacy of standard anti-dementia treatments or account for the resistance to these treatments. In line with this, a 6-month controlled trial showed that the combination of memantine+vitamin D was superior to memantine alone and vitamin D alone in preventing cognitive decline among AD patients. Even preliminary, this result certainly engages clinicians to replenish vitamin D before starting anti-dementia treatments or at least to use vitamin D as an adjunct to these treatments.

### Influence of vitamin D supplementation by simulated sunlight or oral D3 on respiratory infection during military training [^1128KZaN]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no consensus for the optimal vitamin D threshold or dose for immune health. Participants beginning supplementation with serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol·L −1 reported shorter URTI duration when receiving vitamin D compared with placebo supplementation. Further evidence that participants with serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol·L −1 benefitted more from vitamin D supplementation than the entire sample is clear when examining the effect sizes between vitamin D and placebo for URTI outcomes: small–medium effect sizes for the entire sample, compared with medium and large effect sizes for participants with serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol·L −1 (Fig. 5). Compared with the IOM- and the EFSA-recommended vitamin D sufficiency, no additional protection from URTI of higher vitamin D status, including a previously proposed optimal threshold (serum 25(OH)D > 75 nmol·L −1), was revealed. These findings alongside other findings from this research program that show benefits of vitamin D sufficiency on in vivo immunity support 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol·L −1 for immune health. Further, the current studies highlight that exercise performance may indirectly benefit from maintaining vitamin D sufficiency by reducing lost training days to URTI.

No additional benefit of SSR compared with oral vitamin D 3 supplementation was shown on URTI, immune function (this study and), or exercise performance. Consequently, active people are advised to take the 400-IU·d −1 oral vitamin D 3 dose, from the maintenance phase of study 2, to maintain vitamin D sufficiency when exposure to ambient UVB is inadequate: between early autumn and late winter, and for those that live and/or exercise indoors for the majority of sunlight hours or cover-up from the sun. When accounting for typical dietary vitamin D intake, this oral vitamin D 3 supplementation approach corresponds with current IOM and EFSA recommendations (600 IU·d −1) for bone and general health, and unlike simulated sunlight, there is no time burden for an individual, no requirement for bulky irradiation cabinets, and oral vitamin D 3 supplementation is effective regardless of sun-reactive skin type. Nevertheless, low-level sunlight may provide benefits to human health, additional to vitamin D synthesis, and this remains an area of active research.

### Is supplementation of vitamin D beneficial for fracture healing? A short review of the literature [^112GNaJJ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a surge of interest regarding the benefits of vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures. But can it also make them heal more quickly once they have occurred-that is, is supplementation of vitamin D beneficial for fracture healing? We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria, 11 of these were performed in animals. Two animal studies showed negative, 2 neutral, and 7 positive results. One clinical case series in humans was inconclusive in our opinion, and one randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed that supplementation of vitamin D3 and calcium in elderly women with reduced bone mass and a proximal humerus fracture had a positive influence on bone healing. The major weakness of the latter study is low number of participants. A clear statement on the benefits of vitamin D for fracture healing awaits further trials, but all types of fractures in elderly individuals indicate the need for secondary prevention and the implementation of appropriate guidelines concerning falls, vitamin D, and osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11535HZz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — screening and thresholds state that the Society no longer endorses the target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and no longer endorses specific 25(OH)D levels to define vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency; the panel did not find clinical trial evidence supporting distinct 25(OH)D thresholds tied to outcome-specific benefits. The guideline also suggests against routine 25(OH)D screening (in the absence of well-established indications), including in adults and children with obesity, in adults and children with dark complexions, and during pregnancy.

### Vitamin D and respiratory health [^11313PxD]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is now known to be of physiological importance outside of bone health and calcium homeostasis, and there is mounting evidence that it plays a beneficial role in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of diseases. In this brief review the known effects of vitamin D on immune function are described in relation to respiratory health. Vitamin D appears capable of inhibiting pulmonary inflammatory responses while enhancing innate defence mechanisms against respiratory pathogens. Population-based studies showing an association between circulating vitamin D levels and lung function provide strong justification for randomized controlled clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with respiratory diseases to assess both efficacy and optimal dosage.

### Vitamin D and cancer-NCI… [^1167SsYH]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

What is vitamin D. Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble hormones and prohormones that help the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth. These nutrients also perform many other important functions in the body, including reducing inflammation and controlling cell growth, as well as influencing neuromuscular and immune function and glucose metabolism. In experimental studies of cancer cells and of tumors in rodents, vitamin D has been found to have several biological activities that might slow or prevent the development of cancer, including promoting cellular differentiation, decreasing cancer cell growth, stimulating cell death, reducing tumor blood vessel formation, and decreasing tumor progression and metastasis.

Vitamin D was also found to suppress a type of immune cell that normally prevents the immune system from responding strongly to cancer. Evidence from observational studies Cancer risk. Observational studies have examined a number of individual cancer sites for possible associations of risk with vitamin D level. Higher vitamin D levels have been consistently associated with reduced risks of colorectal cancer and, to a lesser extent, bladder cancer. Studies have consistently shown no association between vitamin D levels and risk of breast, lung, and several other, less common cancers. By contrast, opposite associations of risk with higher blood vitamin D levels have been suggested for prostate cancer and possibly pancreatic cancer. For example, a meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies found a 14% higher cancer mortality among people with the lowest 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than among those with the highest levels.

Similarly, an analysis of approximately 4, 000 cancer cases within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial found a 17% lower cancer mortality among men and women in the highest category of vitamin D than in the lowest category. However, a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials through 2018 found that vitamin D supplementation was associated with a slight reduction in cancer mortality over 3–10 years of follow-up. A meta-analysis of 21 randomized trials found no evidence that vitamin D supplementation was associated with reduced mortality from all causes combined or from cardiovascular disease.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UcKko]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Considerations for empiric vitamin D — formulation, availability, cost, and equity note that most multivitamins contain 800 to 1000 IU (20 to 25 μg) of vitamin D, vitamin D is inexpensive and available without a prescription at costs varying from the equivalent of US $10 to $50 per year, and a daily empiric supplement was judged acceptable and feasible. Most vitamin D3 is from animal sources with vegan vitamin D3 from lichen also available; vitamin D2 is plant-based, widely available, and costs are similar. When benefits were identified, the panel judged empiric vitamin D will not likely have a negative impact on health equity and may have a favorable impact on improving health equity, and disadvantaged persons tend to be at higher baseline risk for many assessed outcomes so greater absolute benefit would be expected when benefit is present.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116GMwd2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — evidence and harms for adult screening explains that total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status, yet levels are difficult to measure accurately and results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods. There is no direct evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency, and adequate evidence shows that treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency has no benefit on mortality, risk for fractures in persons selected solely on the basis of low vitamin D levels or incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, while evidence on other outcomes remains inadequate. Regarding harms, there is no direct evidence on the harms of screening, and adequate evidence indicates that the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none. Overall, the evidence on the benefits of screening is lacking; therefore, the balance of benefits and harms in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

### Vitamin D and its potential benefit for the COVID-19 pandemic [^114pWQSm]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is known not only for its importance for bone health but also for its biologic activities on many other organ systems. This is due to the presence of the vitamin D receptor in various types of cells and tissues, including the skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, endocrine pancreas, immune cells, and blood vessels. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D exerts several actions that are thought to be protective against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infectivity and severity. These include the immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, the regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system in the kidneys and the lungs, and the protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in protecting against risk of acquiring acute respiratory viral infection and may improve outcomes in sepsis and critically ill patients. There are a growing number of data connecting COVID-19 infectivity and severity with vitamin D status, suggesting a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention or as an adjunctive treatment of COVID-19. Although the results from most ongoing randomized clinical trials aiming to prove the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for these purposes are still pending, there is no downside to increasing vitamin D intake and having sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at a level of least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and preferably 40 to 60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QqUNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115SXLZA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

New U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF commissioned 2 systematic evidence reviews and a meta-analysis on vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium to assess the effects of supplementation on bone health outcomes in community-dwelling adults, the association of vitamin D and calcium levels with bone health outcomes, and the adverse effects of supplementation.

Population

These recommendations apply to noninstitutionalized or community-dwelling asymptomatic adults without a history of fractures. This recommendation does not apply to the treatment of persons with osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in premenopausal women or in men. (I statement)The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with greater than 400 IU of vitamin D3 and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized postmenopausal women. (I statement)The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D3 and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized postmenopausal women.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in adults [^113Gd1nz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Available evidence on the effects of vitamin D on mortality has been inconclusive. In a recent systematic review, we found evidence that vitamin D3 may decrease mortality in mostly elderly women. The present systematic review updates and reassesses the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation used in primary and secondary prophylaxis of mortality.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of mortality in healthy adults and adults in a stable phase of disease.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index-Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (all up to February 2012). We checked references of included trials and pharmaceutical companies for unidentified relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials that compared any type of vitamin D in any dose with any duration and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adult participants. Participants could have been recruited from the general population or from patients diagnosed with a disease in a stable phase. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)) or as an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Six review authors extracted data independently. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). To account for trials with zero events, we performed meta-analyses of dichotomous data using risk differences (RDs) and empirical continuity corrections. We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. To minimise the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. Trial sequential analyses controlled the risk of random errors possibly caused by cumulative meta-analyses.

Main Results

We identified 159 randomised clinical trials. Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials reported mortality but did not report in which intervention group the mortality occurred. Accordingly, 56 randomised trials with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women was 77%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants. Of these, four trials included healthy volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35 trials included older people living on their own or in institutional care. The remaining eight trials randomly assigned 795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory or rheumatoid diseases. Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of 4.4 years. More than half of the trials had a low risk of bias. All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Forty-five trials (80%) reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Participants in 19 trials had vitamin D adequacy (at or above 20 ng/mL). Participants in the remaining 26 trials had vitamin D insufficiency (less than 20 ng/mL). Vitamin D decreased mortality in all 56 trials analysed together (5,920/47,472 (12.5%) vs 6,077/47,814 (12.7%); RR 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.99); P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%). More than 8% of participants dropped out. 'Worst-best case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that vitamin D could be associated with a dramatic increase or decrease in mortality. When different forms of vitamin D were assessed in separate analyses, only vitamin D3 decreased mortality (4,153/37,817 (11.0%) vs 4,340/38,110 (11.4%); RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98); P = 0.002; I(2) = 0%; 75,927 participants; 38 trials). Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol did not significantly affect mortality. A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D2 may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to random errors. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D3, with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent one additional death. We did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin D on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo compared with trials using no intervention in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin D levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/mL at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared with trials without calcium; of trials using a dose below 800 IU per day compared with trials using doses above 800 IU per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men. Vitamin D3 statistically significantly decreased cancer mortality (RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%; 44,492 participants; 4 trials). Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I(2) = 0%; 42,876 participants; 4 trials). Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia (RR 3.18 (95% CI 1.17 to 8.68); P = 0.02; I(2) = 17%; 710 participants; 3 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Vitamin D3 seemed to decrease mortality in elderly people living independently or in institutional care. Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant beneficial effects on mortality. Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis. Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased hypercalcaemia. Because of risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants and of outcome reporting bias due to a number of trials not reporting on mortality, as well as a number of other weaknesses in our evidence, further placebo-controlled randomised trials seem warranted.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Hfpqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Comparison of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 supplementation in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114bMinG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, there is a lack of clarity in the literature as to whether there is a definitive difference between the effects of vitamins D2 and D3 in the raising of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D].

Objective

The objective of this article was to report a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have directly compared the effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on serum 25(OH)D concentrations in humans.

Design

The ISI Web of Knowledge (January 1966 to July 2011) database was searched electronically for all relevant studies in adults that directly compared vitamin D3 with vitamin D2. The Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry, International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number register, and clinicaltrials.gov were also searched for any unpublished trials.

Results

A meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that supplementation with vitamin D3 had a significant and positive effect in the raising of serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared with the effect of vitamin D2 (P = 0.001). When the frequency of dosage administration was compared, there was a significant response for vitamin D3 when given as a bolus dose (P = 0.0002) compared with administration of vitamin D2, but the effect was lost with daily supplementation.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis indicates that vitamin D3 is more efficacious at raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations than is vitamin D2, and thus vitamin D3) could potentially become the preferred choice for supplementation. However, additional research is required to examine the metabolic pathways involved in oral and intramuscular administration of vitamin D and the effects across age, sex, and ethnicity, which this review was unable to verify.

Vitamin D regulates bone homeostasis, 1 and epidemiologic studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels may be associated with increased risk of RTIs, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and metabolic disorders. 2, 3 Increased awareness of possible health benefits associated with higher 25D levels has resulted in widespread vitamin D testing and supplementation in the general US population. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on a threshold value below which people should be offered vitamin D supplementation. 3, 4 In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force reported that there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening of asymptomatic adults for vitamin D deficiency.

### Optimal vitamin D status: a critical analysis on the basis of evidence-based medicine [^114aveQL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Public health authorities around the world recommend widely variable supplementation strategies for adults, whereas several professional organizations, including The Endocrine Society, recommend higher supplementation.

Methods

We analyzed published randomized controlled clinical trials to define the optimal intake or vitamin D status for bone and extraskeletal health.

Conclusions

The extraskeletal effects of vitamin D are plausible as based on preclinical data and observational studies. However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The greatest risk for cancer, infections, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels below 20 ng/mL. There is ample evidence from RCTs that calcium and bone homeostasis, estimated from serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH, calcium absorption, or bone mass, can be normalized by 25OHD levels above 20 ng/mL. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation (800 IU/d) in combination with calcium can reduce fracture incidence by about 20%. Such a dose will bring serum levels of 25OHD above 20 ng/mL in nearly all postmenopausal women. Based on calculations of the metabolic clearance of 25OHD, a daily intake of 500–700 IU of vitamin D3 is sufficient to maintain serum 25OHD levels of 20 ng/mL. Therefore, the recommendations for a daily intake of 1500–2000 IU/d or serum 25OHD levels of 30 ng or higher for all adults or elderly subjects, as suggested by The Endocrine Society Task Force, are premature. Fortunately, ongoing RCTs will help to guide us to solve this important public health question.

### An update on the screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with cystic fibrosis: evidence-based recommendations from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^116UdBjk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Use of vitamin D compounds and treatment strategy in cystic fibrosis — The CF Foundation recommends that all individuals with CF be treated with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) to achieve and maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter), with evaluation noted as Certainty: moderate Benefit: moderate Grade: B. The CF Foundation is not able to make a recommendation for or against the use of an oil vs. a powder-based formulation of vitamin D3 in all individuals with CF. The CF Foundation recommends that all individuals with CF who are prescribed vitamin D3 (in addition to their CF-specific vitamins) take once-daily vitamin D3 therapy or its weekly equivalent to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/ liter).

Intermittent high-dose vitamin D — justification for recommendation: The available evidence (which is specifically pertinent to persons age > 50 years) suggests that, compared to daily lower-dose vitamin D or placebo, intermittent high-dose vitamin D offers no desirable effects, and may be associated with undesirable anticipated effects (falls). Moderate certainty of evidence suggests an estimated 0.5% absolute increase in fracture risk.

New USPSTF recommendation on screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^1125G2hs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

When evaluating the potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation, we should also not discount the benefit of the reversal of prediabetes to euglycemia. If vitamin D supplementation promotes regression to euglycemia, then more people will spend more time in the low-risk state away from prediabetes/diabetes. Therefore, the higher likelihood of reversal to euglycemia with vitamin D supplementation (~48% more likely, as stated by Zhang et al) may, by delaying time-to-onset of diabetes, represent an additional benefit to the 12% lower risk to progression to diabetes reported by the 2 meta-analyses of clinical trials.

Although the summary results reported by Zhang et al and Barbarawi et al are concordant, meta-analyses that combine aggregate data from trials that vary in study design and quality should be interpreted cautiously. Individual participant data meta-analyses that combine data from high-quality clinical trials specifically designed and conducted to test the hypothesis are necessary to (1) estimate with precision the benefit of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes progression and regression to euglycemia, (2) assess heterogeneity of the treatment effect in order to define prediabetes subpopulations most likely to benefit most likely to benefit from vitamin D supplementation, and (3) evaluate safety using time-to-event analyses.

### Vitamin D insufficiency and epistemic humility: an endocrine society guideline communication [^1113S3oR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

A long-held precept is that vitamin D supplementation primarily, if not exclusively, benefits individuals with low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at baseline. However, the most appropriate 25(OH)D threshold to distinguish unacceptably low vs reliably adequate concentrations remains controversial. Such threshold proposals have largely been based on observational studies, which provide less robust evidence compared to randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Since the Endocrine Society's first vitamin D-related guideline was published in 2011, several large vitamin D-related RCTs have been published, and a newly commissioned guideline development panel (GDP) prioritized 4 clinical questions related to the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation in generally healthy individuals with 25(OH)D levels below a threshold. The GDP determined that available clinical trial evidence does not permit the establishment of 25(OH)D thresholds that specifically predict meaningful benefit with vitamin D supplementation. The panel noted important limitations in the available evidence, and the panel's overall certainty in the available evidence was very low. Nonetheless, based on the GDP's analyses and judgments, the Endocrine Society no longer endorses its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "sufficiency" (ie, at least 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]) or its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "insufficiency" (ie, greater than 20ng/mL [50nmol/L] but lower than 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]). The Endocrine Society's rationale for such is the subject of this Guideline Communication.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Vitamin D and cardiovascular disease prevention [^1143jjMs]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is a precursor of the steroid hormone calcitriol that is crucial for bone and mineral metabolism. Both the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the general population and the identification of the vitamin D receptor in the heart and blood vessels raised interest in the potential cardiovascular effects of vitamin D. Experimental studies have demonstrated various cardiovascular protective actions of vitamin D, but vitamin D intoxication in animals is known to induce vascular calcification. In meta-analyses of epidemiological studies, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Findings from Mendelian randomization studies and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) do not indicate significant effects of a general vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes. Previous RCTs, however, were not adequately designed to address extraskeletal events, and did not focus on vitamin D-deficient individuals. Therefore, currently available evidence does not support cardiovascular benefits or harms of vitamin D supplementation with the commonly used doses, and whether vitamin D has cardiovascular effects in individuals with overt vitamin D deficiency remains to be evaluated. Here, we provide an update on clinical studies on vitamin D and cardiovascular risk, discuss ongoing vitamin D research, and consider the management of vitamin D deficiency from a cardiovascular health perspective.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### Recommendations abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society consensus statement on vitamin D for prevention of falls and their consequences [^112oq1Vp]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Consensus statement on vitamin D — falls prevention in older adults summarizes evidence and target serum 25(OH)D levels as follows: The Institute of Medicine reported that there was "no benefit to 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in older adults", but the workgroup's review found that trials with higher starting levels had lower fall rates, with "four trials with starting serum levels of 24 ng/mL (60 nmol/L), or greater" showing benefit and "three trials with serum levels below 25 ng/mL (60 nmol/L)" showing higher fall risk. In studies with fewer falls/fractures, "average concentrations of 25(OH)D achieved were consistently greater than 26 ng/mL (65 nmol/L)", and the workgroup concluded that "serum levels of 25(OH)D of 25 ng/mL (60 nmol/L) or greater provide protection". The target level recommended is " ≥ 30 ng/mL, 75 nmol/L", and with recommended supplementation "the highest level reached will not exceed 60 ng/mL (150 nmol/L)", which remains "well below toxicity levels, even in the 5% of older adults with the highest baseline vitamin D levels".

### Pilot trial of vitamin D3 and calcifediol in healthy vitamin D deficient adults: does It change the fecal microbiome? [^113BDfRc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Experimental studies suggest that vitamin D receptor signaling may benefit the gut microbiome. In humans, whether vitamin D supplementation directly alters the gut microbiome is not well studied.

Objective

To determine whether correcting vitamin D deficiency with cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, D3) or calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 25(OH)D3) changes gut microbiome composition.

Methods

18 adults with vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 20 ng/mL) received 60 µg/day of D3 or 20 µg/day of 25(OH)D3 for 8 weeks. Changes in serum 25(OH)D, 1,25-diydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)2D) were assessed. We characterized composition of the fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and examined changes in α-diversity (Chao 1, Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity, Shannon Index), β-diversity (DEICODE), and genus-level abundances (DESeq2).

Results

Vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 groups were similar. After 8 weeks of vitamin D3, mean 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)2D increased significantly, but 1,25(OH)2D did not (25(OH)D: 17.8–30.1 ng/mL, P = 0.002; 24,25(OH)2D: 1.1 to 2.7 ng/mL, P = 0.003; 1,25(OH)2D: 49.5–53.0 pg/mL, P = 0.9). After 8 weeks of 25(OH)D3, mean 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, and 1,25(OH)2D increased significantly (25(OH)D: 16.7–50.6 ng/mL, P < .0001; 24,25(OH)2D: 1.3–6.2 ng/mL, P = 0.0001; 1,25(OH)2D: 56.5–74.2 pg/mL, P = 0.05). Fecal microbial α-diversity and β-diversity did not change with D3 or 25D3 supplementation. Mean relative abundance of Firmicutes increased and mean relative abundance of Bacterioidetes decreased from baseline to 4 weeks, but returned to baseline by study completion. DESeq2 analysis did not confirm any statistically significant taxonomic changes.

Conclusion

In a small sample of healthy adults with vitamin D deficiency, restoration of vitamin D sufficiency with vitamin D3 or 25(OH)D3 did not lead to lasting changes in the fecal microbiota.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^111HyF5g]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis [^112efLqS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review, "Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis" (published in the Cochrane Library; 2010, Issue 12). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by inflammation, demyelination, axonal or neuronal loss, and astrocytic gliosis in the central nervous system (CNS), which can result in varying levels of disability. Some studies have provided evidence showing an association of MS with low levels of vitamin D and benefit derived from its supplementation.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit and safety of vitamin D supplementation for reducing disease activity in people with MS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS Specialized Register up to 2 October 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist with search terms relevant to this review. We included references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and from handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books from conferences.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared vitamin D versus placebo, routine care, or low doses of vitamin D in patients with MS. Vitamin D was administered as monotherapy or in combination with calcium. Concomitant interventions were allowed if they were used equally in all trial intervention groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of studies, while another review author sorted any disagreements. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes (Expanded Disability Status Scale and number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions), as standardised MDs for health-related quality of life, as rate differences for annualised relapse rates, and as risk differences (RDs) for serious adverse events and minor adverse events, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We identified 12 RCTs enrolling 933 participants with MS; 464 were randomised to the vitamin D group, and 469 to the comparator group. Eleven trials tested vitamin D₃, and one trial tested vitamin D₂. Vitamin D₃ had no effect on the annualised relapse rate at 52 weeks' follow-up (rate difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.07; I² = 38%; five trials; 417 participants; very low-quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument); on the Expanded Disability Status Scale at 52 weeks' follow-up (MD -0.25, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.10; I² = 35%; five trials; 221 participants; very low-quality evidence according to GRADE); and on MRI gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions at 52 weeks' follow-up (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.48; I² = 12%; two trials; 256 participants; very low-quality evidence according to GRADE). Vitamin D₃ did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects within a range of 26 to 52 weeks' follow-up (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04; I² = 35%; eight trials; 621 participants; low-quality evidence according to GRADE) or minor adverse effects within a range of 26 to 96 weeks' follow-up (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06; I² = 20%; eight trials; 701 participants; low-quality evidence according to GRADE). Three studies reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using different HRQOL scales. One study reported that vitamin D improved ratings on the psychological and social components of the HRQOL scale but had no effects on the physical components. The other two studies found no effect of vitamin D on HRQOL. Two studies reported fatigue using different scales. One study (158 participants) reported that vitamin D₃ reduced fatigue compared with placebo at 26 weeks' follow-up. The other study (71 participants) found no effect on fatigue at 96 weeks' follow-up. Seven studies reported on cytokine levels, four on T-lymphocyte proliferation, and one on matrix metalloproteinase levels, with no consistent pattern of change in these immunological outcomes. The randomised trials included in this review provided no data on time to first treated relapse, number of participants requiring hospitalisation owing to progression of the disease, proportion of participants who remained relapse-free, cognitive function, or psychological symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

To date, very low-quality evidence suggests no benefit of vitamin D for patient-important outcomes among people with MS. Vitamin D appears to have no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and MRI lesions. Effects on health-related quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Vitamin D₃ at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited. Seven ongoing studies will likely provide further evidence that can be included in a future update of this review.

### Abstract… [^112KYK1w]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children has been linked to adverse effects, such as growth failure and rickets. Although vitamin D is available in several foods and drinks, recent estimates suggest the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among infants, children, and adolescents is between 12 and 24 percent. 1, 2 Infants who are breastfed appear to be at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency. Family physicians should understand current recommendations for vitamin D supplementation, and be prepared to educate parents about breastfeeding, sun precautions, and nutrition throughout childhood and adolescence. Vitamin D in Health and Disease Vitamin D plays several important roles in the metabolism and absorption of other minerals in the body. Vitamin D is essential for facilitating calcium metabolism and bone mineralization; is beneficial for phosphate and magnesium metabolism; and stimulates protein expression in the intestinal wall to promote calcium absorption.

Low levels of vitamin D lead to the release of parathyroid hormone, which causes calcium mobilization from the bone. Over time, excessive bone resorption can lead to rickets. Adequate levels of vitamin D may also help reduce the risk of autoimmune conditions, 3, 4 infection, 5 and type 2 diabetes. 6 Evidence from observational studies supports the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk of type 1 diabetes in infants and children. 7 Although observational studies suggest that vitamin D may be protective against some cancers, 8 a randomized controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in 36, 282 women did not find a protective effect against breast cancer.

These concerns are supported by studies showing that vitamin D deficiency can occur early in life 12; that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations tend to be lower in breastfed infants 13; and that 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation in these infants maintains higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

14 In addition, studies have shown that adolescents consume insufficient levels of dietary vitamin D 15, 16 and that supplementation increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and bone mineral density.
17. Despite these recommendations, there are no studies showing that universal supplementation improves patient-oriented outcomes, such as the reversal of lethargy, irritability, and growth failure, attributed to vitamin D deficiency. Only indirect evidence supports the contention that 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily prevents and treats rickets. 14 Prospective studies focusing on patient-oriented outcomes, rather than biomarkers, are needed before the actual clinical impact of supplemental vitamin D will be understood.

What to know Vitamin D supports healthy bone development. It helps prevent rickets, a condition that causes weak or deformed bones. Learn more about vitamin D considerations for breastfed infants. Do infants get enough vitamin D from breast milk. No. Breast milk alone does not provide infants with enough vitamin D. Shortly after birth, most breastfed infants will need an additional source of vitamin D through a supplement. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that breastfed and partially breastfed infants receive 400 International Units of vitamin D daily beginning in the first few days of life. Families who do not wish to provide a supplement directly to their infant should discuss the risks and benefits of maternal high-dose supplements with a health care provider. Why are breastfed infants at risk for vitamin D deficiency.

The risk for vitamin D deficiency increases when there is limited exposure to sunlight or when an infant is not consuming an adequate amount of vitamin D. Other factors that decrease the amount of vitamin D a person can make from sunlight include:

- Living at high latitudes, particularly during winter.
- High levels of air pollution.
- Dense cloud covering.
- The degree to which clothing covers the skin.
- Use of sunscreen.
- Darker skin types. Because adequate sunshine exposure varies and sunshine exposure may increase the risk of skin cancer, vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111FnWfU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years: Subgroup analyses did not provide evidence for benefit with vitamin D in subgroups with 25(OH)D below 20 to 24 ng/mL (50–60 nmol/L), and based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D, in addition to the anticipated undesirable effects, are likely to be trivial. The panel judged that vitamin D supplementation appears to have little or no beneficial impact on the outcomes analyzed in healthy populations aged 50 to 74 years, and concluded there was therefore no compelling rationale to recommend empiric vitamin D in this age group. Noting monetary costs and that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity, the panel suggested against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years.

### Association between vitamin D supplementation and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gnERY]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin D 3 is the most widely used type of vitamin D supplementation and has a clinically relevant effect of reducing all cause mortality by 5%, with the P value and 95% confidence interval close to the level of formal statistical significance. The current study is not a positive study, but it is also not an unambiguously negative study. In addition, subgroup analyses are observational by nature and are not based on randomised comparisons. Therefore, the effect of vitamin D 3 on all cause mortality requires additional evidence, preferably gathered by future large randomised controlled trials.

A further important finding from meta-regression was that all cause mortality was statistically significantly lower in trials with longer follow-up. Sensitivity analysis found a potential effect of vitamin D supplementation on all cause mortality after trials with a follow-up of less than one year were excluded (risk ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.00). However, subgroup analysis did not find a statistically significant difference in the effect of vitamin D supplementation on mortality in trials with a follow-up of less than three years and more than three years (P = 0.26). Additionally, the previous meta-analysis did not find a subgroup difference according to the length of follow-up.

The VITAL trial reported increasing benefit over time. Although no significant differences relate to cancer mortality (risk ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.02) or all cause mortality (0.99, 0.87 to 1.12), after excluding the first one and two years of follow-up, the risk ratio was significantly reduced to 0.75 for cancer mortality (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.96) and was slightly reduced to 0.96 for all cause mortality (0.84 to 1.11). Therefore, the length of follow-up could modify the effect of vitamin D supplementation on all cause mortality.

### Risk assessment for vitamin D [^111XtMAu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to apply the risk assessment methodology used by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) to derive a revised safe Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamin D. New data continue to emerge regarding the health benefits of vitamin D beyond its role in bone. The intakes associated with those benefits suggest a need for levels of supplementation, food fortification, or both that are higher than current levels. A prevailing concern exists, however, regarding the potential for toxicity related to excessive vitamin D intakes. The UL established by the FNB for vitamin D (50 microg, or 2000 IU) is not based on current evidence and is viewed by many as being too restrictive, thus curtailing research, commercial development, and optimization of nutritional policy. Human clinical trial data published subsequent to the establishment of the FNB vitamin D UL published in 1997 support a significantly higher UL. We present a risk assessment based on relevant, well-designed human clinical trials of vitamin D. Collectively, the absence of toxicity in trials conducted in healthy adults that used vitamin D dose ≥ 250 microg/d (10,000 IU vitamin D3) supports the confident selection of this value as the UL.

### The role of vitamin D in reducing cancer risk and progression [^111W9PYo]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2014). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is not really a vitamin but the precursor to the potent steroid hormone calcitriol, which has widespread actions throughout the body. Calcitriol regulates numerous cellular pathways that could have a role in determining cancer risk and prognosis. Although epidemiological and early clinical trials are inconsistent, and randomized control trials in humans do not yet exist to conclusively support a beneficial role for vitamin D, accumulating results from preclinical and some clinical studies strongly suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing cancer and that avoiding deficiency and adding vitamin D supplements might be an economical and safe way to reduce cancer incidence and improve cancer prognosis and outcome.

### Calcium and vitamin D controversies [^112GMqvg]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Controversies regarding appropriate use of vitamin D and calcium are predominately related to the extraskeletal effects. Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health. The concerns regarding calcium and cardiovascular complications are inconclusive at best, and do not warrant a change in our approach to supplementation at this time. A growing body of literature exists suggesting that additional vitamin D may have numerous benefits, although more study needs to be done. Further prospective trials would provide insight into the potential advantages that increased vitamin D supplementation could provide.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116uJcoA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 50–70 and > 70 years, respectively. Insufficient evidence whether 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D are enough to provide all of the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^115648Jz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Do subgroup findings elicit positive signals?

Response to vitamin D depends on vitamin D status at baseline. Thus, people with higher baseline levels of blood 25(OH)D would benefit less from vitamin D supplementation than people with lower baseline levels. The high proportion of participants with adequate blood 25(OH)D levels at baseline may have prevented the detection of statistically significant differences between the vitamin D and placebo groups in the full trial cohorts. In all 3 trials, among participants with baseline blood 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL, the risk of diabetes with vitamin D supplementation was reported to be lower compared with participants with levels ≥ 20 ng/mL, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the D2d study, the risk of diabetes was significantly lower in a small subgroup of participants with a baseline 25(OH)D level < 12 ng/mL (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18–0.80; p for interaction = 0.023). Results from subgroup analyses need to be interpreted cautiously partly because of the potential of a type I error (false positive) due to multiple analyses. However, given strong preexisting biologic plausibility, vitamin D supplementation may be more important in reducing diabetes risk among persons with prediabetes and low vitamin D status.

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in critical illness-the known knowns and known unknowns [^115w2Hgj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The known unknowns

The optimum range for vitamin D and what level to aim for?

In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report based on examination of data by a group of experts. They estimated that a vitamin D level of 50 nmol/L or higher was adequate for good bone health, and a level < 50 was considered a vitamin D deficiency.

In 2011, the Endocrine Society issued a report urging a much higher minimum blood level of vitamin D. The society's clinical practice guideline was developed by experts in the field assigned to a Vitamin D Task Force, and based on all the evidence they recommended a minimum vitamin D level of 75 nmol/L and, because of the vagaries of some of the assays, levels between 100 and 150 nmol/L to guarantee sufficiency for both children and adults. These reference ranges are determined by levels of vitamin D that achieve maximal parathyroid hormone suppression. However, this method for identifying the optimal level of vitamin D remains controversial; the relationship between serum 25 hydroxy-D and parathyroid hormone is inconsistent, and no clear threshold defining "sufficiency" has been established.

These recommendations from the Endocrine Society pertain to patients at risk of complications related to vitamin D deficiency, while those from the IOM on the other hand relate to healthy individuals.

Interestingly, although low levels of vitamin D have been associated with higher mortality and poor health outcomes, high levels may not be beneficial and could even be harmful. The first reports of a U-shaped or reverse J-shaped relationship were for prostate cancer. Subsequently, this has been shown in other groups including with all-cause mortality.

Importantly, based on level of risk there is unlikely to be one single optimum level. For patients at high risk of poor bone health or colorectal cancer, accepting the potential risks of higher 25 hydroxy-D levels may be warranted to gain maximum possible benefits. In addition to variation in the optimum level between individuals, the optimum level for different cellular functions and target actions within the same individual may be different; for example the bone health target may differ from that required for immune function.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113BvQRy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with adverse health outcomes.

Purpose

To systematically review benefits and harms of vitamin D screening in asymptomatic adults.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (through the third week of August 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency and case-control studies nested within the Women's Health Initiative.

Data Extraction

One investigator abstracted data, a second reviewed data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria.

Data Synthesis

No study examined the effects of vitamin D screening versus no screening on clinical outcomes. Vitamin D treatment was associated with decreased mortality versus placebo or no treatment (11 studies; risk ratio [RR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99]), although benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded (8 studies; RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.73 to 1.18]). Vitamin D treatment was associated with possible decreased risk for having at least 1 fall (5 studies; RR, 0.84 [CI, 0.69 to 1.02]) and falls per person (5 studies; incidence rate ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.50 to 0.88]) but not fractures (5 studies; RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.82 to 1.16]). Vitamin D treatment was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk for serious adverse events (RR, 1.17 [CI, 0.74 to 1.84]).

Limitation

Variability across studies in 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays and baseline levels, treatment doses, use of calcium, and duration of follow-up.

Conclusion

Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic persons might reduce mortality risk in institutionalized elderly persons and risk for falls but not fractures.

### Health effects of vitamin D [^111TQfc9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Increasing data suggest that many or most adults in the United States and Europe would benefit from vitamin D supplements. This review summarizes the benefits of vitamin D with the strongest evidence today from randomized controlled trials for fall and fracture prevention. Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms. Prospective epidemiological studies supported by strong mechanistic evidence suggest a reduction of cardiovascular disease (incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality) and colorectal cancer, extending to weaker evidence on immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits of vitamin D.

### Vitamin D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^1159HZ5X]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

A large body of experimental and observational data has implicated vitamin D deficiency in the development of cardiovascular disease. However, evidence to support routine vitamin D supplementation to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease is lacking.

Design and Results

A comprehensive literature review was performed using PubMed and other literature search engines. Mounting epidemiological evidence and data from Mendelian randomization studies support a link between vitamin D deficiency and adverse cardiovascular health outcomes, but randomized trial evidence to support vitamin D supplementation is sparse. Current public health guidelines restrict vitamin D intake recommendations to the maintenance of bone health and prevention of fractures. Two recently published large trials (VITAL and ViDA) that assessed the role of moderate- to high-dose vitamin D supplementation as primary prevention for cardiovascular outcomes in the general population had null results, and previous randomized trials have also been generally negative. These findings from general population cohorts that are largely replete in vitamin D may not be applicable to chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations, in which the use of active (1α-hydroxylated) vitamin D compounds is prevalent, or to other high-risk populations. Additionally, recent trials in the CKD population, as well as trials using vitamin D analogs, have been limited.

Conclusions

Current randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation do not support benefits for cardiovascular health, but the evidence remains inconclusive. Additional randomized trials assessing larger numbers of participants with low baseline vitamin D levels, having longer follow-up periods, and testing higher vitamin D dosages are needed to guide clinical practice.
