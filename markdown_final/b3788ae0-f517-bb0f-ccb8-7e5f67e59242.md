## Question

45 yo F with history of longstanding psoriasis (on methotrexate) and severe osteoarthritis presents with new right hip pain after a fall. She is afebrile, WBC normal, but ESR and CRP are mildly elevated. Hip X-ray shows no fracture. ED recommends outpatient MRI with gadolinium contrast to rule out occult fracture or avascular necrosis. GFR is 37 mL/min/1.73 m² — proceed with gadolinium-enhanced MRI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a gadolinium-enhanced MRI should be performed for a 45-year-old woman with suspected occult hip fracture or avascular necrosis after a fall, given her eGFR of 37 mL/min/1.73 m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indication and whether contrast is necessary. Then, I should verify the renal risk category and how that maps to current guideline recommendations. Next, I will examine the NSF risk by agent class and dose, and weigh that against the diagnostic benefit. After that, I should consider alternatives like non-contrast MRI or CT, and whether they would suffice. Finally, I will outline a practical, risk-mitigated plan if contrast is used, including agent selection, dosing, documentation, and follow-up, and then synthesize a recommendation with clear caveats and shared decision-making points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and whether gadolinium is actually needed. Suspected occult hip fracture or avascular necrosis after a fall with negative radiographs is a classic scenario where MRI is indicated, and non-contrast MRI is usually sufficient for both entities, so I should not assume contrast adds value here without a specific soft-tissue or marrow enhancement question in mind [^62e4e925] [^1046cace] [^4d411868].

> Wait, let me verify the renal risk category. With eGFR 37 mL/min/1.73 m², she has CKD stage 3b, which is not the highest-risk group for NSF; the highest risk is eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or acute kidney injury, so she is in a moderate-risk category rather than severe, which changes the balance of risk and benefit for gadolinium exposure [^bf5f27b7] [^62856e28].

> I need to check the NSF risk by agent class and contemporary practice. Historically, NSF was linked to linear agents, especially gadodiamide, and current guidelines and regulatory labeling emphasize using macrocyclic agents in CKD and avoiding high-risk linear agents; with modern macrocyclic agents, NSF risk appears extremely low, with large series showing zero NSF cases even in renally insufficient patients, though vigilance remains prudent [^bf5f27b7] [^ac9a922f] [^45f34a7d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about contrast benefit. For occult fracture, non-contrast MRI sequences are highly sensitive and specific, and for avascular necrosis, non-contrast MRI can detect early marrow changes and collapse, so routine gadolinium rarely changes management in this setting; I should confirm whether there is a specific enhancement question, such as synovitis or infection, that would justify contrast, otherwise non-contrast MRI is preferred [^1046cace] [^4d411868].

> Let me consider alternatives if MRI without contrast is not available or is contraindicated. CT can detect nondisplaced fractures and cortical breaks when MRI is unavailable, though MRI remains more sensitive for occult trabecular injury and early AVN; if MRI is deferred, close clinical follow-up with weight-bearing restrictions is reasonable while arranging imaging [^62e4e925] [^1046cace].

> If, after shared decision-making, gadolinium is deemed essential for a compelling question, I should confirm the mitigation steps. Use the lowest effective dose of a macrocyclic agent such as gadoterate or gadobutrol, document the agent name and dose, avoid repeat dosing within about a week, and ensure the indication is recorded; in patients with eGFR less than 30 or on dialysis, some guidelines suggest timing hemodialysis after contrast, but that does not apply to eGFR 37, so routine dialysis is not indicated here [^bf5f27b7] [^dfb36c1e] [^3710c827].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the VA/DoD guideline endorsed routine dialysis after any gadolinium in CKD, but I should double-check that. On review, the VA/DoD guidance specifically recommends timing group 2 GBCA administration to immediately precede a scheduled dialysis session for patients already on dialysis, and explicitly states not to alter or initiate dialysis solely for contrast removal; so my earlier impulse to consider dialysis here was incorrect and I should correct that now [^3710c827].

> I should confirm the bottom line and communicate it clearly. Given eGFR 37, the NSF risk with a macrocyclic gadolinium agent is very low, but the diagnostic yield of gadolinium for suspected occult fracture or AVN is also low, so the default should be a non-contrast MRI; if a compelling enhancement question arises and the benefit clearly outweighs risk, proceed with a macrocyclic agent at the lowest effective dose, with documentation and counseling about rare hypersensitivity and theoretical gadolinium retention, and arrange appropriate follow-up [^bf5f27b7] [^69771086] [^62e4e925].

Do not use **gadolinium contrast** for this patient. With eGFR 37 mL/min/1.73 m², the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is low but not negligible, and gadolinium does not improve detection of occult hip fracture or avascular necrosis [^bf5f27b7] [^4d411868]. Non-contrast MRI is the **preferred test** for suspected occult fracture or AVN, with equal or superior diagnostic performance and no NSF risk [^1046cace] [^4d411868]. If contrast is absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose of a macrocyclic agent (e.g. gadoterate) with informed consent and close follow-up, but this is not recommended here [^bf5f27b7] [^6746df41].

## Risks associated with gadolinium contrast in CKD

### Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)

- **Definition**: NSF is a rare, potentially fatal fibrosing disorder linked to gadolinium exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^62856e28].
- **Risk factors**: Severity of renal impairment, linear GBCAs, high doses, and pro-inflammatory states increase risk [^ce4b214d].
- **Incidence**: NSF incidence has dropped markedly since restrictions on high-risk agents; with macrocyclic agents, NSF risk is extremely low but not zero [^8805b249] [^a2a1ee42].

---

### Gadolinium deposition

Gadolinium can persist in brain, bone, and skin, even with normal renal function; **clinical significance remains uncertain**, though rare reports describe symptoms such as pain and skin changes [^69771086] [^8544b873].

---

## Diagnostic utility of gadolinium contrast for suspected occult hip fracture or avascular necrosis

Non-contrast MRI is highly sensitive and specific for occult hip fractures and AVN, and **gadolinium does not meaningfully improve detection** of these entities [^1046cace] [^4d411868]. Thus, contrast offers no diagnostic advantage in this scenario.

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation for gfr < 30 ml/min/1.73 m²** | **Recommendation for gfr 30–44 ml/min/1.73 m²** |
|-|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | Prefer ACR Group II/III agents if GBCA is essential; avoid Group I agents | Use caution; prefer macrocyclic agents if GBCA is used |
| ACR Appropriateness Criteria | GBCA generally contraindicated unless absolutely necessary | Use caution; consider non-contrast alternatives |
| VA/DoD CKD Guideline | Group 2 GBCA may be used if essential, with SDM and lowest dose | Use caution; no routine dialysis after Group 2 agents |

---

For eGFR 37 mL/min/1.73 m², **avoid gadolinium unless absolutely necessary**; if essential, use the lowest effective dose of a macrocyclic agent with informed consent and close follow-up [^bf5f27b7] [^6746df41].

---

## Alternative imaging strategies

Non-contrast MRI is the **preferred modality** for suspected occult hip fracture or AVN, with equal or superior diagnostic performance and no NSF risk [^1046cace] [^4d411868]. CT can be considered if MRI is contraindicated, but it is less sensitive for occult fractures and early AVN [^notfound].

---

## Clinical decision-making and patient counseling

- **Risk-benefit assessment**: The diagnostic benefit of gadolinium is minimal here, while the NSF risk, though low, is real; therefore, non-contrast MRI is preferred [^1046cace] [^4d411868].
- **Informed consent**: If gadolinium is considered essential, discuss NSF risk, agent selection, dosing, and monitoring with the patient [^bf5f27b7] [^6746df41].
- **Documentation**: Record the rationale, agent, dose, and counseling if gadolinium is used [^6746df41].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not use **gadolinium contrast** for this patient. Non-contrast MRI is the **preferred test** for suspected occult hip fracture or AVN, with equal or superior diagnostic performance and no NSF risk [^1046cace] [^4d411868]. Reserve gadolinium for rare cases where contrast is absolutely essential, using a macrocyclic agent at the lowest effective dose with informed consent and close follow-up [^bf5f27b7] [^6746df41].

### Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: a sufficient reason to avoid gadolinium-based contrast in all patients with renal impairment? [^35620c9b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) was recently linked to gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) exposure in patients with renal failure. As result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the UK Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and the European Pharmacovigilance Working Party Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that GBC should be avoided in patients with advanced renal failure (GFR < 30 ml/minute/1.73 m2). Ones initial reaction is to advise avoidance of GBC exposure in patients with any level of kidney disease to prevent this awful complication. However, this approach is not based on data nor is it practical for patients who would benefit from this diagnostic modality. Thus, while complete avoidance cannot currently be advocated, GBC-enhanced MRI in renal impairment should be reserved for neurological and vascular cases where the quality of information gained is sufficient to justify the risk of potential devastating adverse effects of NSF.

PC-AKI

Serum creatinine levels within 3 days pre- and post-MRI were available and percentage changes thus calculated for 2,105 contrast and 970 non-contrast scans. After controlling for the dependence of creatinine changes on eGFR category, there was no statistical difference in percentage changes of creatinine between contrast or non-contrast scans (-0.40% vs. 0.61%, p = 0.273). When this analysis was limited to only those scans performed on patients with renal function categorised as stage 4 or 5, those undergoing a non-contrast scan experienced an average serum creatinine increase of 7.31%, while the serum creatinine of those undergoing contrast scans decreased by an average of -4.40% (p = 0.023). There was no statistical difference in cases of a greater than 25% increase in serum creatinine post-MRI observed (Fig. 1) regardless of renal function or whether contrast was administered or not (p = 0.566).

GDD

A total of ten (0.026%) cases of new and regular chronic pain medication prescriptions were noted following either contrast or non-contrast MRI. Seven of these were contrast-enhanced MRI. All patients had normal renal function at the time of scan. The rate was not statistically higher regardless of renal function or whether contrast was administered (p = 0.777).

### Contrast media controversies in 2015: imaging patients with renal impairment or risk of contrast reaction [^ab379c92]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The incidence and significance of complications related to intravascular contrast material administration have become increasingly controversial. This review will highlight current thinking regarding the imaging of patients with renal impairment and those at risk for an allergiclike contrast reaction.

Conclusion

The risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury remains uncertain for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), but if there is a risk, it is greatest in those with estimated GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In this population, low-risk gadolinium-based contrast agents appear to have a large safety margin. Corticosteroid prophylaxis remains the standard of care in the United States for patients identified to be at high risk of a contrast reaction, but it has an incomplete mitigating effect on contrast reaction rates and the number needed to treat is large.

Abstract

Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) have been linked to the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renal impaired patients. The exact interaction between the various different available formulations and occurrence of NSF is not completely understood, but has been postulated. This association has triggered public health advisory bodies to issue guidelines and best practice recommendations on its use. As a result, the reported incidence of NSF, as well as the published use of GBCA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in renal impairment, has seen a decline. Understanding of the events that led to these recommendations can increase clinical awareness and the implications of their usage. We present a review of published literature and a brief overview of practice recommendations, guidelines and manuals on contrast safety to aide everyday imaging practice.

Teaching Points

- Low risk gadolinium based contrast agents should be the choice in renal insufficiency.

- Higher doses have been linked to NSF development. Doses should be as low as possible.

- Clear documentation of date, dose and type of formulation used should be noted.

- Post-scan dialysis should be arranged as soon as possible and feasible.

- Pre- existing inflammatory state is a risk factor; liver insufficiency is not a contraindication.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^2cc9f725]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines

From 2006 onwards, international agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Society for Urological Radiology (ESUR), the US Federal Drugs Agency (FDA), American College of Radiology (ACR) and the UK Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) have published alerts, precautions and recommendations on the use of GBCAs. Multiple publications, have since been gathered to form the body of evidence for NSF; however, the vast majority have been linked to the earlier types of contrast agents. The incidence of NSF has been reported to be on the decline after these recommendations were implemented.

While various different formulations are available on the market, not all have been associated with NSF. Linear GBCAs are considered the least stable, and have been linked to most cases of the development of NSF. These have often been linked to the background of an inflammatory process. Macrocyclic GBCAs for MRI have also been developed.

A recent systematic review of MRI studies in the renal impaired noted that the majority of included studies were published prior to the FDA alert. Half of the studies reported use of contrast types now mentioned by the EMA as having high incidence of NSF (Table 3).

Table 3
European Medicines Agency: categorisation of GBCAs according to NSF risk, based on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties

*Gadopentetic acid generics

In December 2007, the EMA recognized that the risk of developing NSF depends on the type of gadolinium-containing contrast agent used, and advised that these agents should be categorized into three groups. Following this categorization, if a GBCA is to be used in a high-risk patient, then the low risk category agents should be used. Risk and benefit analysis assessment and informed consent should be obtained. Always record the name and dose of the contrast agent used in the patient records. The use of high risk GBCAs in patients with acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease or stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease is not recommended. Caution is advised in patients with stage 3 disease (eGFR between 30 and 59 ml/min/1.73 m 2). A minimal 7-day interval should be observed between administrations.

VA/DoD chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline — gadolinium-based contrast media (GBCM) use in CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI) notes that "a precise risk of NSF after exposure to Group 2 or Group 3 GBCM cannot be given but is likely extremely low", and during shared decision-making (SDM) "Group 2 GBCM can be utilized in individuals with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² if other imaging techniques will not be adequate". It specifies that "The dose of GBCM used should be the minimum required to obtain satisfactory imaging" and that "No prophylactic interventions are of benefit in minimizing the risk of NSF; for patients on hemodialysis, the procedure should be timed to immediately precede a dialysis session", while "dialysis should otherwise not be altered or initiated based on the use of group 2 GBCM". It also acknowledges in those "at risk for developing CKD or those with AKI" that "rare cases of NSF cannot be excluded in patients with significant kidney disease".

### Fluctuations in eGFR in relation to unenhanced and enhanced MRI and CT outpatients [^a77d19af]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To study fluctuations in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in relation to contrast medium (CM) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) compared to control groups in outpatients.

Materials and Methods

eGFR was determined right before the imaging procedure and three days later at the department or at the patient's home. The iodine-based and gadolinium-based contrast media were the same as used for all other examinations at the department.

Results

A total of 716 patients completed the study. There was a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant rise in eGFR after three days in all four groups. The average eGFR variation was 4.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2). There were large variations in eGFR between the two measurements in 45.8% of the patients as they had a change greater than ± 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Only three patients fulfilled the contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) requirement when the definition s-creatinine ≥ 44 μmol/l (0.5mg/dl) was used.

Conclusions

eGFR in outpatients undergoing MRI or CT did vary independently of whether the patient received contrast or not. The findings probably reflect the natural variations in s-creatinine levels. This should be taken into consideration when CIN is studied.

### Diagnostic and screening magnetic resonance imaging of the breast [^0db96921]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Breast MRI performance — Diagnostic breast MRI is not recommended until after clinical breast examination and conventional breast imaging are performed and interpreted unless being performed as part of a standard screening program. Breast MRI requires a high field system (minimum 1.5 Tesla magnet), a dedicated breast surface coil (breast images taken in a body scanner are inadequate) and intravenous gadolinium (or other approved Breast MRI) contrast, and "Open" MRI equipment, designed for claustrophobic patients, is not recommended. Breast MRI should be performed by a dedicated imaging team, and policies for pre-MRI identification of "claustrophobic" and "gadolinium risk" patients should be established. Breast MRI with gadolinium contrast should not be ordered in patients receiving renal dialysis for kidney failure and should be used only with caution and with adequate informed consent in patients with a GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and administration of gadolinium contrast is discouraged during pregnancy. If contrast cannot be used, then breast MRI is not recommended in the screening or diagnostic setting, and percutaneous MRI-guided biopsy capability is essential for centers performing breast MRI even though some MRI lesions confirmed on second look US are amenable to US-guided core.

Paediatrics

A total of 1,265 scans performed on a cohort of 698 paediatric patients were identified for analysis. 572 scans were contrast-enhanced, of which 9% were performed while the patient was deemed renally insufficient.

Within both the normal and RI categories, the average age at scan was statistically higher in those undergoing contrast scans compared with non-contrast scans (p < 0.0005 and p = 0.015, respectively). There was no significant difference in gender proportions (p = 0.180) regardless of renal function or contrast group.

Zero paediatric patients were admitted to A&E with hyper-sensitivity reactions within a day of contrast enhanced MRI. After monitoring for an average time of 6.2 ± 2.4 years (range, 1–10 years), there have been zero cases of NSF diagnosed following 52 contrast-enhanced MRIs performed on 32 paediatric patients with RI. Percentage changes in serum creatinine did not differ significantly between the contrast and non-contrast group (0.32% vs. -6.05%, p = 0.113) and there was no significantly higher rate of increases over 25% observed (p = 0.841) regardless of renal function or contrast administration. One scan out of 1,265 (0.08%) was followed by an onset of a new, regular chronic pain medication prescription. At the time of the contrast-enhanced scan, the patient had normal renal function. The incidence of prescriptions for chronic pain medicine did not differ significantly across renal function or contrast group (p = 0.578).

### Update on nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [^bf6af672]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents were for many years considered safe, but this is no longer the case. The least stable agents may trigger the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a generalized fibrotic disorder, in renal failure patients. The use of gadodiamide and gadopentetate dimeglumine is now contraindicated in Europe and Japan in patients who have a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), including those on dialysis. The fear of NSF, however, should not lead to an enhanced MR imaging examination being denied when there is a good clinical indication to give a gadolinium-based contrast agent.

Regarding preventative measures for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, more specifically with respect to avoidance of gadolinium-containing contrast agents, EADV 2017 guidelines recommend to use a low-risk gadolinium medium and reduce the dose of the gadolinium-based contrast agents to the minimum effective dosage for imaging if MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents is indispensable.

### Urinary gadolinium levels after contrast-enhanced MRI in individuals with normal renal function: a pilot study [^19fc9245]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) have been used to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since 1985. Recently, the media and online groups have voiced concerns about gadolinium deposition in patients with normal renal function based on "elevated" urinary gadolinium levels. The determination of increased urinary gadolinium levels is based on reference ranges developed in individuals with normal renal function who were never exposed to GBCA. Studies suggest an elevated gadolinium urinary elimination greater than 72 h post GBCA scan. We evaluated urine gadolinium concentrations over a 30-day period in patients administered GBCA.

Methods

In this prospective, observational pilot study, we enrolled subjects between 18 and 65 years of age with normal renal function who received GBCA for the first time. Urinary gadolinium was measured at days zero (prior to GBCA exposure), 3, 10, and 30 after GBCA exposure. We compared urinary gadolinium levels after GBCA exposure to the current reference range and calculated an estimated duration of "elevated" gadolinium urine levels in the average patient.

Results

All 13 subjects had 24-h urinary gadolinium levels higher than 0.7 μg/24 h with means of 1944 (± 1432) μg/24 h on day 3, 301 (± 218) μg/24 h on day 10, and 34 (± 33) μg/24 h on day 30. Based on calculated urinary gadolinium elimination kinetics, we estimate urinary gadolinium levels will often remain above the current reference range for > 50 days.

Conclusion

The current reference range of 0.7 μg/24 h for 24 h urinary gadolinium is not applicable to patients for at least 30 days following GBCA exposure.

### Screening patients to assess renal function before administering gadolinium chelates: assessment of the choyke questionnaire [^603ad8fc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to determine the efficacy of using the Choyke questionnaire to stratify the potential risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) before a gadolinium-enhanced MRI examination and to compare the economic impact of such an approach with universal blood sampling before gadolinium-enhanced MRI.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1,086 consecutive outpatients referred for gadolinium-enhanced MRI. For inclusion, patients were required to have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) result within 30 days before gadolinium-enhanced MRI and a completed Choyke questionnaire, first when the order was placed and again at the point of service. Questionnaire results were dichotomized into "No" (all no responses in both questionnaires) or "Yes" (one or more yes responses in either questionnaire) response groups for comparison with the corresponding eGFR. An economic impact assessment for using the questionnaire to identify "at risk" patients was performed using a decision-analytic model.

Results

Entry criteria were met in 665 of 1,086 (61.2%) patients. Zero patients in the No (n = 287) and seven in the Yes (1.9%) group (n = 378) had an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Using the 100% sensitivity achieved in identifying higher risk patients (seven patients; 95% CI, 59–100%), the questionnaire could save $4.52 per patient. At the lower boundary of the 95% CI for sensitivity, the savings incurred would come at the expense of administering gadolinium to 0.4% of patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

Conclusion

The Choyke questionnaire effectively stratifies patients for NSF risk before gadolinium-enhanced MRI, offering potential cost savings and streamlined care.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Gadolinium-based contrast media in low GFR and pediatric populations — In people with GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², the use of newer linear and macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast media such as gadobenate dimeglumine, gadobutrol, gadoteridol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoxetate disodium should be preferred. Pediatric considerations note that considerations specific to young children and neonates must also be contemplated in addition to the general admonishments against their use in situations of GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m²; in particular, the FDA currently does not license any gadolinium-based contrast media product for use in children < 2 years of age and the European Medicines Agency cautions against use in a child < 1 year of age. In neonates, all nephrologists and radiologists must exercise caution and all other imaging modalities should be considered before choosing one requiring gadolinium exposure, and some have suggested the avoidance of high-risk gadolinium agents in very young children (e.g., neonates younger than 4 weeks of age). Although data are limited, the number of reported cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in the pediatric population is lower than in the adult population, there is no convincing evidence that pediatric populations have an increased risk compared with adults, and the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in pediatric patients appears to be low, but data are limited.

Contrast media use in renal impairment — consensus guidance specifies prophylaxis and safer options by glomerular filtration rate (GFR): patients with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease and GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² who are not on renal replacement therapy should receive intravenous normal saline prophylaxis before iodinated contrast; patients with GFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² may be considered for intravenous fluid prophylaxis at physician discretion; second-generation gadolinium-based MRI agents can be given when GFR is above 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with a reported nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk less than 0.07%, and patients need not be screened for renal function prior to receiving group II gadolinium-based agents. Based on the most recent consensus statement from the ACR and National Kidney Foundation, patients with acute kidney injury or CKD and GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² who are not undergoing renal replacement therapy should receive intravenous normal saline prophylaxis prior to receiving iodinated contrast media. Patients with GFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² may be considered for intravenous fluid prophylaxis per individual physician discretion based on the patient's risk factor for renal injury. The most recent consensus statement from the ACR and the National Kidney Foundation suggests that such agents can be given to patients with a GFR above 30 mL/min/1.73 m². A recent systematic review of the risks of NSF in patients with CKD 4 and 5 noted that the risks of NSF using group II gadolinium-based agents was less than 0.07%. Current ACR guidelines on the use of contrast media state that patients need not be screened for renal function prior to receiving group II gadolinium-based agents.

Patient data

In total, the electronic records for 40,411 MRI scans and corresponding biochemistry, dermatology and prescription data were gathered and divided into contrast and non-contrast MRI. 1,333 scans pertaining to 947 patients were excluded due to documented use of GdCAs other than gadoteric acid. Within the local area between 2004 and 2016, 22,325 contrast-enhanced MRI were performed on 15,377 adult patients (average age, 55.6 ± 16.1 years; range, 18–97 years; 53.3% female) and 572 contrast-enhanced scans were performed on 370 paediatric patients (average age, 11.4 ± 5.3 years; range, 0–17 years; 51.4% female). Further demographic data are outlined in Table 1.

b Indicates significant difference between the contrast and non-contrast cohort

 Data are given as mean ± standard deviation and (range)

For contrast scans performed on adults, eGFR values were calculated from serum creatinine at the time point closest prior to MRI and used to stratify scans accordingly; stages 1/2 (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, n = 19,168), stage 3 (30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, n = 2,570), stage 4 (15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, n = 464) and stage 5 (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2, n = 123). Scan data for paediatric patients was stratified into two renal function categories: normal (n = 520) and impaired (n = 52) dependent upon interdepartmental age and gender-modified serum creatinine reference values.

Similar stratification by age and renal function categories was performed for the control data of non-contrast examinations.

Hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions were identified by any records of admission to A&E within a day of contrast-enhanced MRI with presenting symptoms that matched known reactions to gadoteric acid as given in the prescribing information and/or any general hypersensitivity reaction (Table 2).

### Absence of potential gadolinium toxicity symptoms following 22, 897 gadoteric acid (dotarem ®) examinations, including 3, 209 performed on renally insufficient individuals [^8544b873]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

More recently, gadolinium has been found to accumulate in the body regardless of renal function. The highest concentrations of gadolinium have been seen following exposure to the least thermodynamically stable GdCAs and total concentrations within the CNS display an inverse correlation with renal function. Following an extensive review, the EMA has 'confirmed recommendations to restrict the use of some linear gadolinium agents used in MRI body scans and suspend the authorisation of others'. Clinical consequences of a theorised gadolinium deposition disease (GDD) have not yet been confirmed but case reports and published support group surveys suggest symptoms could be reminiscent of NSF. The development of symptoms such as headaches, bone/joint pain and skin changes appear to occur earlier, with typical onset times reported between hours and days post-contrast-enhanced MRI.

As the renal pathway is the predominant excretion mechanism of most GdCAs, patients with RI are considered at high risk of the above signs and symptoms of gadolinium toxicity and therefore a population of great interest. However, due to changes in guidelines and clinical practice, the use of GdCAs in populations with RI has declined dramatically, and instigating contrast-enhanced MRI clinical trials would be challenging. In cases where the diagnostic information is unavailable via non-contrast images and the clinical benefit-to-risk ratio is favourable, low risk macrocyclic GdCAs have continued to be administered.

Locally, patient-specific electronic health records have been collated over many years, and as such, the aim of this study was to use this data in a unique way to follow adult and paediatric patients, particularly focussing on those with RI, who have been exposed to gadoteric acid (Dotarem®, Guerbet) in order to identify any hypersensitivity reactions or symptoms that may be associated with gadolinium toxicity such as NSF, PC-AKI and/or chronic pain.

Conversely, other GdCAs have been associated with some form of gadolinium toxicity. Although the vast majority of NSF cases have been seen following the administration of linear agents, there have been unconfounded cases reported with other macrocyclic agents. In cases of suspected GDD, chronic pain is a frequent symptom for which chronic pain medication has been administered in order to ease symptoms. Available data on GdCA-induced PC-AKI varies widely, and with small sample sizes it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions, but PC-AKI has been observed following administrations of both gadodiamide and gadopentetate dimeglumine.

Demonstrating that GdCAs can be used safely in this population may improve outcomes for patients with RI. By being able to examine patients using the full capabilities of MRI, co-morbidities and complications may be better diagnosed and treated. Although an MRI-based clinical trial is likely to be deemed unethical at this time, health data linkage has allowed MRI-based research to continue in this cohort and further help to identify any potential clinical consequences of gadolinium toxicity. It was noted in the EMA's report that, regardless of renal function at the time of GdCA administration, it remains unknown whether later declines in patient health may trigger gadolinium toxicity symptoms. Thus, it is imperative to employ a surveillance technique that can accurately monitor patient populations over long periods of time. Ramahlo et al also suggests that reactions to gadolinium may depend somewhat on genetics. As such, there is a potential for further studies to use health data linkage, incorporating genetic data, where available, to help develop understanding of how this disease may progress, if at all.

The text also notes there is additional risk with repeated doses.

Discussion

'Gadolinium toxicity' is a generic term that had been ascribed to a myriad of signs and symptoms resulting from exposure to GdCAs, some of which have been confirmed – hypersensitivity reactions and NSF, whilst others are more debatable – PC-AKI and chronic pain. After having been deemed at an increased risk of gadolinium toxicity, the administration of GdCAs to patients with renal insufficiency has declined. Contrast-enhanced MRI scans may still be performed in this population if the benefit of information to be gained outweighs the potential risk, thus investigations may still continue retrospectively.

Through health data linkage, the anonymised patient data from 39,078 MRI scans, performed locally between 2004 and 2016, was linked with patient-specific electronic health records. Gadoteric acid was administered during 22,897 of these scans, 3,209 of which were performed on RI individuals. A low number of hypersensitivity reactions were observed within our adult cohort (0.01%) and none within our paediatric patients post-contrast exposure. After following these patients via their health records for an average of 6 years, zero cases of NSF were identified. Serum creatinine levels for the study cohort were largely unaffected (Fig. 1), with no statistically higher rate of PC-AKI following exposure to gadoteric acid when compared to non-contrast examinations, regardless of baseline renal function. Across all patients, there has been no significantly higher rate of chronic pain onset, a symptom that has been associated with GDD, when compared with patients who had undergone non-contrast scans.

### Screening breast MRI and gadolinium deposition: cause for concern? [^bc995c2f]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been used worldwide for over 30 years and have enabled lifesaving diagnoses. Contrast-enhanced breast MRI is frequently used as supplemental screening for women with an elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer. Data have emerged that indicate a fractional amount of administered gadolinium is retained in the bone, skin, solid organs, and brain tissues of patients with normal renal function, although there are currently no reliable data regarding the clinical or biological significance of this retention. Linear GBCAs are associated with a higher risk of gadolinium retention than macrocyclic agents. Over the course of their lives, screened women may receive high cumulative doses of GBCA. Therefore, as breast MRI screening utilization increases, thoughtful use of GBCA is indicated in this patient population.

### Non-contrast MRI protocol for TAVI guidance: quiescent-interval single-shot angiography in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT [^6a0badd8]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

For a successful TAVI procedure, it is crucial to accurately size the valve prosthesis dictated by aortic annulus dimensions as well as to evaluate access capability of aortoiliofemoral vessels, usually driven by a contrast-enhanced CTA. However, in patients undergoing TAVI, the reported prevalence of acute kidney injury ranges between 8.3 and 41% with an associated increase in 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, and length of hospital stay. In line with published observations, patients with CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) constituted 69% of the overall population of the present study. Moreover, patients with chronic and acute kidney injury, especially at Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) stages 4 and 5, are at higher risk to suffer NSF after administration of gadolinium-based MR contrast agents. However, the rapidly growing interest in more sophisticated, non-contrast MR imaging is also driven by reports of intra- and extracranial gadolinium depositions with currently unclear clinical significance.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^a3a80f71]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) have been linked to the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renal impaired patients. The majority of studies that report on their use in the renal impaired population were published prior to the publications that prompted the alert on NSF. This association has triggered public health advisory bodies to issue guidelines and best practice recommendations on its use in renal insufficiency. Since then, this has all but halted the rapid progression and uptake of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this population that was seen in the early to mid 2000s. Understanding of the events that led to these recommendations can increase clinical awareness and the implications of the use of GBCAs in daily imaging practice. We conducted an electronic database search [PubMed/Medline, EMBASE] to collate the evidence in published literature on the occurance of NSF in the renal impaired. We also carried out a forward citation and bibliographic search of identified studies. Published studies were reviewed for reported pathophysiological and clinical manifestations, proposed diagnostic pathway, treatments options and reported incidence. We also reviewed practice recommendations, guidelines and published manuals on contrast safety.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients receiving OMNISCAN should be instructed to inform their physician if they:

are pregnant or breast feeding, or
have a history of renal and/or liver disease, convulsions, asthma or allergic respiratory disorders, or recent administration of gadolinium-based contrast.

GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. To counsel patients at risk for NSF:

Describe the clinical manifestations of NSF
Describe procedures to screen for the detection of renal impairment

Instruct the patients to contact their physician if they develop signs or symptoms of NSF following OMNISCAN administration such as burning, itching, swelling, scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; stiffness in joints with trouble moving, bending or straightening the arms, hands, legs or feet; pain deep in the hip bones or ribs; or muscle weakness.

Gadolinium Retention

Advise patients that gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs in patients with normal renal function. The clinical consequences of retention are unknown. Retention depends on multiple factors and is greater following administration of linear GBCAs than following administration of macrocyclic GBCAs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Change in use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance studies in kidney disease patients after US food and drug administration warnings: a cross-sectional study of veterans affairs health care system data from 2005–2008 [^5c73881c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Exposure to gadolinium in patients with kidney disease has been linked to risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings against the use of gadolinium in this population. We studied the impact of these warnings on the use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (GE-MR) studies in patients with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the practice of measuring serum creatinine before gadolinium exposure.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study of patients who had undergone MR studies from October 2002 to September 2008.

Setting & Participants

Patients receiving medical care in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System.

Predictor

Date of MR imaging, serum creatinine level, and eGFR using the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation.

Outcomes & Measurements

The rate of MR studies performed with and without gadolinium from July 2005 to September 2008 in patients with different stages of kidney disease, defined using eGFR. The proportion of GE-MR studies with a screening serum creatinine level.

Results

There was a 71% decrease in the rate of GE-MR use in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 2 years after the release of the first public health advisory, although studies continued to be performed in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease. The proportion of GE-MR studies with serum creatinine measured within 1 month before the study increased by 99%.

Limitations

Data available up to September 30, 2008. Indications for the GE-MR studies were not assessed. The accuracy of Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision coding was not assessed.

Conclusion

There was a large decrease in the use of GE-MR studies in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and a large but not universal increase in the practice of measuring serum creatinine before GE-MR after the release of the FDA warnings.

Gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have revolutionized of MR imaging, enabling physicians to obtain life-saving medical information that often cannot be obtained with unenhanced MR imaging or other imaging modalities. Since regulatory approval in 1988, more than 450 million intravenous GBCA doses have been administered worldwide, with an extremely favorable pharmacologic safety profile. Recent evidence has demonstrated, however, that a small fraction of Gd is retained in human tissues. No direct correlation between Gd retention and clinical effects has been confirmed; however, a subset of patients have attributed various symptoms to GBCA exposure. This review details current knowledge regarding GBCA safety.

### Absence of potential gadolinium toxicity symptoms following 22, 897 gadoteric acid (dotarem ®) examinations, including 3, 209 performed on renally insufficient individuals [^ac9a922f]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Recent safety concerns regarding gadolinium-based contrast agents (GdCAs) concluded with the suspension of some agents from the European market, yet a clinical consequence remains unknown. We used electronic health records to investigate the incidence of potential toxicity to gadoteric acid (Dotarem®) within our local population, including those with renal insufficiency (RI).

Methods

Data for patients who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI were identified, stratified by renal function at time of scan and retrospectively followed using routinely collected health data. Searches performed were: records of hypersensitivity reactions; diagnoses of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF); onset of chronic pain, a symptom that has been associated with NSF and the theorised gadolinium deposition disease (GDD); and post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI). Comparisons were made between patients and controls (those who underwent non-contrast scans) via chi-square and ANOVA statistical tests.

Results

Of the 22,897 contrast-enhanced MRI scans performed locally from 2004–2016 (adult, n = 22,325 and paediatric, n = 572), 14% were performed on patients with RI (30 ≤ eGFR < 60, n = 2,622; 15 ≤ eGFR < 30, n = 464; eGFR < 15, n = 123). Two adult patients (0.01%) suffered hypersensitivity reactions. Zero cases of NSF were reported, with an average follow-up time of 6.0 ± 2.5 years (range, 8 months–15 years). Analysis failed to highlight statistically higher rates of chronic pain onset post-MRI (adult: p = 0.777, paediatric: p = 0.578), or PC-AKI (adult: p = 0.566, paediatric: p = 0.841), in the patient groups compared to controls.

Conclusions

These data indicate that administration of gadoteric acid to RI patients does not result in a higher rate of signs or symptoms that may be associated with gadolinium toxicity when compared to controls.

Key Points

- Following 22,897 administrations of gadoteric acid to a local population, there was no association with symptoms that may be associated with gadolinium toxicity.

- Zero cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis were reported following 3,209 gadoteric acid administrations to a cohort of renally insufficient patients.

- A low number of hypersensitivity reactions were observed (0.01%) and no higher rate of chronic pain or post-contrast acute kidney injury were noted when compared with a control cohort of non-contrast-enhanced examinations.

Patients

Patients (male or female, aged ≥ 18 years) with known stable stage 3 or 4 CKD according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition (i.e. eGFR > 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) scheduled to undergo MRI were included.

Patients were ineligible when surgery or chemotherapy was planned within 72 h post-procedure; if they had undergone an imaging procedure (MRI or computed tomography with or without contrast medium) during the 7 days before inclusion, or within 72 h post-procedure; if they had participated in any investigational drug study during the 30 days prior to inclusion or were scheduled to participate in another study within 72 h post-procedure; or had a known allergy to GBCAs.

Patients with a contraindication to MRI, a diagnosis of haemodynamic instability or acute myocardial infarction during the 2 weeks prior to inclusion, requiring haemodialysis, with newly diagnosed unstable diabetes, or pregnant women were ineligible. All patients who had received any medication known to be nephrotoxic or cause elevation of serum creatinine levels during the 2 weeks before the baseline blood sample and throughout the study duration were not included in the study (a list of nephrotoxic medications was established at the beginning of the trial and given to each site). Moreover, at the end of the study, all patient medications were reviewed by an independent expert (nephrologist) blinded to the imaging procedure performed. Any included patient having received nephrotoxic treatment was identified and considered as a protocol deviation.

A patient was considered to be screened but not yet included until the first blood sample had been drawn within 1 day before MRI (baseline). A patient was definitively included in the absence of any exclusion criteria and when (1) the relative difference between baseline serum creatinine and a previous serum creatinine value, obtained at least 1 week and less than 6 months before the baseline blood test, did not exceed 15% and (2) the eGFR value according to the abridged MDRD study prediction equation was > 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

### Gadolinium contrast agents-are they really safe? [^3529dd95]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2017). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) are used worldwide for enhanced MRI examinations, including heart and vessels. Gadolinium is a highly toxic heavy metal. If used in GBCA it must be tightly bound to ligands. The configuration of ligands influences the stability of the GBCA and two types of chelates have been used. Macrocyclic chelates offer better protection and binding of gadolinium ion than linear chelates with a flexible open chain - gadolinium could be more easily released from the latter ones. GBCAs are excreted from the body mostly by the kidneys, which is of importance in chronic kidney disease. Two states are related to gadolinium: nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and gadolinium body storage. NSF is a severe and debilitating disease, directly connected to gadolinium toxicity, proven after the use of linear chelates. Due to strict recommendations of radiology societies, NSF was practically eradicated. Gadolinium deposition was observed especially in bones and in some brain areas: in dentate nucleus and in globus pallidus, even years after the GBCA administration. The form of the storage (chelated or free), as well as their clinical impact, are not clear, but first observations of "gadolinium deposition disease" have been reported.

### Gadolinium use in patients with kidney disease: a cause for concern [^a30e49d0]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Gadolinium is widely used as a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent and is considered to have a good overall safety profile. Recently, both renal and extra-renal toxicities have been reported following exposure to gadolinium in patients with underlying kidney disease. Gadolinium-related contrast-induced nephropathy appears to be a risk in patients with advanced kidney disease and especially those with diabetic nephropathy. Even more concerning is the strong association of gadolinium with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a devastating fibrosing disorder of the skin and other systemic organs. Although cause and effect have not been proven for the NSF-gadolinium link, the impaired renal elimination of gadolinium in patients with kidney disease and the instability of gadolinium-chelate binding may expose tissues to toxic free Gd(3+) and promote this fibrosing disorder. Caution should be exercised when utilizing gadolinium as a contrast agent in patients with advanced CKD or ESRD.

5.1 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following Gadoterate Meglumine Injection administration to eVenus Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc. (1-609-395-8625) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age more than 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.

The factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Gadoterate Meglumine Injection dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of EOVIST among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following EOVIST administration to Bayer HealthCare (1-888-842-2937) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity.

Results

Study cohort – adults

A total of 37,813 contrast and non-contrast scans performed on a cohort of 21,770 adult patients were identified for analysis. 22,325 scans were contrast-enhanced, of which 14% were performed while the patient was deemed renally insufficient.

The average age at scan of all patients was significantly different between renal function categories. Age tended to increase with increasing RI (stages 1/2, 53.3 ± 15.4 years; stage 3, 69.6 ± 11.6 years; stage 4, 73.1 ± 12.7 years), but the average age decreased in the stage 5 category (60.5 ± 15.3 years). The average age of patients in stages 1/2 and 3 undergoing contrast-enhanced scans was higher when compared to those undergoing non-contrast scans (p < 0.0005), but this trend did not continue into stage 4 or 5 (p = 0.805 and p = 0.060, respectively). There were no statistically significant gender biases across renal function categories observed within the contrast group. For the non-contrast cohort, there was only a higher proportion of females than males in the stage 3 category (p < 0.0005). When comparisons were made between those having received contrast and those not, a significantly greater proportion of females underwent non-contrast scans in stages 1/2 and 3 than males (p < 0.0005).

Hypersensitivity reactions

Two adult patients (0.01%) were admitted to A&E with hypersensitivity reactions within a day of contrast-enhanced MRI. The first patient presented with a headache that occurred following their first contrast-enhanced MRI. The patient underwent no further scans. The second patient presented in an anxiety state following their first contrast-enhanced MRI but did go on to undergo two further contrast-enhanced scans with no reactions.

NSF

With an average follow-up time of 6.0 ± 2.5 years (range, 8 months–15 years), zero cases of NSF were diagnosed following the 3,157 gadoteric acid-enhanced MRI performed on patients with RI.

### Gadolinium-associated nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [^5c98768b]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a progressive, potentially fatal multiorgan system fibrosing disease related to exposure of patients with renal failure to the gadolinium-based contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging. Because of this relationship between nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and gadolinium-based contrast agents, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently warns against using gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, or any acute renal insufficiency related to the hepatorenal syndrome or perioperative liver transplantation. There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis developing in patients not exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents, but most patients have the triad of gadolinium exposure through contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, renal failure, and a proinflammatory state, such as recent surgery, endovascular injury, or sepsis. Development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis among patients with severe renal insufficiency following exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents is approximately 4 percent, and mortality can approach 31 percent. The mechanism for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is unclear, and current treatments are disappointing. Prevention with hemodialysis immediately following gadolinium-based contrast agents has been recommended, but no studies have shown this to be effective. Because of the large number of patients with clinically silent renal impairment and the serious consequences of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis related to gadolinium exposure, physicians should use alternative imaging modalities for patients who are at risk.

### How to avoid nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: current guidelines in Europe and the United States [^9d1773f3]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Views vary about how to avoid nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). In Europe, it is contraindicated to use gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, and gadovertisamide in patients who have a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 mL/min, and these agents may only be used with caution in patients who have a GFR between 30 and 60 mL/min. Similar restrictions have not been introduced for the other six gadolinium-based contrast agents available in the European market. In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration introduced a class ban and warned about the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients who have reduced renal function. However, European and American guidelines about how to avoid NSF are generally not very different.

### Lesion visualization of an oral manganese contrast agent compared to unenhanced MRI and gadobenate dimeglumine in patients undergoing liver magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of colorectal cancer metastases: centralized assessment of a randomized, crossover, phase II study [^e56e39b0]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Early detection of liver metastases, particularly before the development of extrahepatic disease, can significantly impact patient outcomes and potentially lead to curative treatment. If these are detected early and deemed eligible for surgical resection, the survival rate can be improved, and sometimes, full recovery is possible. In patients who underwent resection for colorectal liver metastases, the 5-year overall survival rate was reported to be 46%, whereas it was only 6% for patients who were not subjected to surgical treatment for liver metastases.

Imaging plays a pivotal role in managing patients with focal liver lesions (primary tumors or metastases). Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly used in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), providing enhanced image contrast and improved visualization of tissues and pathological conditions through intravenous (IV) administration. However, their use has raised important safety concerns, particularly in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2), according to FDA black box warning, who have a reduced ability to clear GBCA from their circulation. This is especially problematic with linear GBCAs, which are less stable and more likely to release free gadolinium, leading to an increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a rare but potentially fatal condition, due to prolonged exposure time and complex dissociation. In these patients, literatureand international guidelines recommend using only macrocyclic GBCAs with lowest risk of NSF, and to separate at least 7 days between 2 injections, and administration in high-risk patients should only occur when the diagnostic information is essential and cannot be obtained through other means. Additionally, there are 2 separate concerns: the presence of gadolinium deposits in brain tissue, which has been observed regardless of renal function but with no known clinical consequences to date, and symptoms reported after gadolinium exposure (sometimes referred to as Symptoms Associated with Gadolinium Exposure or SAGE), although a clear causal relationship has not been established. While gadoxetate disodium (Eovist/Primovist) has recently been reclassified in clinical guidelines reflecting its favorable safety profile due to its lower dose (0.025 mmol/kg vs 0.1 mmol/kg for multipurpose GBCAs) and lack of reported NSF cases, there remain other considerations beyond patient safety, including environmental concerns regarding gadolinium accumulation in water systems, that support the development of alternative contrast agents. For these reasons, a significant unmet medical need exists for a safe and effective liver MRI contrast agent for patients with severe renal impairment, particularly considering that renal insufficiency is common in cancer patients.

### Diagnostic imaging: appropriate and safe use [^9b970b55]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of diagnostic radiography has doubled in the past two decades. Image Gently (children) and Image Wisely (adults) are multidisciplinary initiatives that seek to reduce radiation exposure by eliminating unnecessary procedures and offering best practices. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 may have increased risk of nephropathy when exposed to iodinated contrast media and increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis when exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents. American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria can help guide specific diagnostic imaging choices. Noncontrast head computed tomography is the first-line modality when a stroke is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging stroke protocols and computed tomography perfusion scans can augment evaluation and potentially expand pharmacologic and endovascular therapy timeframes. Imaging should be avoided in patients with uncomplicated headache syndromes unless the history or physical examination reveals red flag features. Cardiac computed tomography angiography, stress echocardiography, and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (nuclear stress test) are appropriate for patients with chest pain and low to intermediate cardiovascular risk and have comparable sensitivity and specificity. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography is the preferred test for high-risk patients or those with a positive d-dimer test result, and ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy is reserved for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 or a known contrast allergy. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is preferred for evaluating adults with suspected appendicitis; however, ultrasonography should precede computed tomography in children, and definitive treatment should be initiated if positive. Ultrasonography is the first-line modality for assessing right upper quadrant pain suggestive of biliary disease. Mass size and patient age dictate surveillance recommendations for adnexal masses. Imaging should not be performed for acute (less than six weeks) low back pain unless red flag features are found on patient history. Ultrasonography should be used for the evaluation of suspicious thyroid nodules identified incidentally on computed tomography.

### Serum and urine gadolinium reference intervals in patients with normal renal function following gadobutrol administration [^8ea135bd]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the sensitivity and clinical utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations and are used extensively worldwide. While concerns remain regarding the potential toxicity of retained gadolinium (Gd) based on "elevated" serum or urinary Gd concentrations, current Gd reference intervals were established in GBCA-naive patients with normal renal function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the serum and urine Gd clearance in patients with normal renal function after being administered intravenous gadobutrol for a contrast-enhanced MRI examination.

Methods

Patients with normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min) with no prior GBCA exposure in the past 6 months were enrolled and had blood and urine collected before and ~1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after their gadobutrol-enhanced MRI examination to measure Gd at each time point. Serum and urine Gd were quantified using a clinically validated inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry-based assay with a limit of quantitation of 0.1 ng/mL (μg/L).

Results

Thirty-one patients who underwent a gadobutrol-enhanced MRI were enrolled, and 24 completed all collection time points. The pharmacokinetic data suggested a multicompartment (5 phase) model of elimination where 95% of patient's serum Gd fell below the unexposed reference interval (< 0.5 ng/mL) at ~56 days and 95% of urine Gd would fall below the unexposed reference interval (< 0.8 μg/g creatinine) at ~132 days. Based on review of the electronic medical record, none of the patients self-reported any Gd-related toxicity.

Conclusions

Current reference intervals for serum and urinary gadolinium clearance are not applicable for patients in the 5 months following intravenous gadobutrol exposure.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^eb029811]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

Recent theory suggests that administration of large amounts of GBCAs, (solely excreted via kidneys for earlier used formulations and again mainly excreted by kidneys in the remainder) persist in the body and may dissociate from their carrier ligands/chelates. These may then bind with readily available phosphates, carbonates or citrates, and form insoluble molecules. Several authors mention histological findings of increased dermal collagen bundles, CD34+ fibroblast like cells, macrophages, mucin and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) in this cohort of patients. Pre-existing renal disease has been the most prevalent patient characteristic.

Although the disassociated gadolinium theory has been the widely acknowledged trigger of NSF, questions of chelated gadolinium in combination with pre-existing cofactors have been raised. Cofactors such as high dose erythropoietin treatment, pro-inflammatory state, high serum phosphate and calcium, and absence of ace inhibitor treatment, have also been linked to the appearance of NSF. Chelated gadolinium such as gadodiamide and gadopentetate have been shown to directly stimulate macrophages and monocytes in vitro to release profibrotic cytokines and growth factors capable of initiating and supporting the characteristic tissue fibrosis.

Hepatic insufficiency

As evidence in published literature increased following the initial June 2006 alert, manufacturers of GBCAs were ordered by the FDA to add a "black box warning" the following year. This elaborated on the alert to extend caution of GBCA use in any acute or chronic renal insufficiency patient (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), or acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to the hepato-renal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. A 2009 systematic review of NSF in liver disease patients found no compelling evidence to suggest liver disease in itself as being a risk factor for developing NSF. The authors concluded that NSF developed only in the setting of pre-existing severe renal insufficiency, irrespective of liver disease status.

### Risks and options with gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with CKD: a review [^8805b249]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) improve the diagnostic capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging. Although initially believed to be without major adverse effects, GBCA use in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) was demonstrated to cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Restrictive policies of GBCA use in CKD and selective use of GBCAs that bind free gadolinium more strongly have resulted in the virtual elimination of NSF cases. Contemporary studies of the use of GBCAs with high binding affinity for free gadolinium in severe CKD demonstrate an absence of NSF. Despite these observations and the limitations of contemporary studies, physicians remain concerned about GBCA use in severe CKD. Concerns of GBCA use in severe CKD are magnified by recent observations demonstrating gadolinium deposition in brain and a possible systemic syndrome attributed to GBCAs. Radiologic advances have resulted in several new imaging modalities that can be used in the severe CKD population and that do not require GBCA administration. In this article, we critically review GBCA use in patients with severe CKD and provide recommendations regarding GBCA use in this population.

### Magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers for chronic kidney disease: a position paper from the European cooperation in science and technology action PARENCHIMA [^fb45cf47]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendation 8: Studies should be performed that assess MRI biomarkers against hard clinical endpoints of CKD progression

Hard clinical endpoints such as the development of ESKD (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 or initiation of RRT) or substantial reductions in GFR of 30, 40 or > 50% (doubling of serum creatinine) are the only measures of CKD progression currently accepted by the FDA. MRI biomarkers should be evaluated in terms of their ability to identify patients at higher risk of progressing to these endpoints. Alternative definitions of CKD progression (e.g. percentage reductions in eGFR, eGFR trajectory) should be recorded as secondary endpoints. This approach has the obvious drawback of requiring larger numbers of participants and longer study duration, which will be more challenging in terms of feasibility and cost. Evaluation of MRI biomarkers in populations defined as high risk of progression based on clinical features may permit more feasible sample sizes and shorter study length. Alternatively, efficient methods of tracking long-term outcomes may be utilized, for example, through the use of registry data for long-term tracking of RRT initiation data.

However, in 2006, it was demonstrated that some Gd-CA may trig the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a generalized fibrotic disorder, in renal failure patients. This sub-section of European Journal of Radiology covers the current knowledge about NSF from many aspects. The prevention of NSF must be given high priority, but it should not lead to a denial of a well-justified, enhanced MRI examination with a stable agent.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^4087563b]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Low risk gadolinium contrast agents as identified by the EMA should be the choice if CE MRI is to be carried out, but only after careful risk and benefit assessment. Informed consent should be obtained regarding GBCA administration. As appearance of NSF can occur from months to years after administration, clear documentation of date, dose and type of formulation used should be included in case notes.
Dosage should be kept to a minimum, as higher doses have been linked to the development of NSF. A minimal 7-day interval should be observed between administrations. Post scan, a full 4-hour dialysis session should be arranged for dialysis-dependent patients. Dialysis solely for contrast filtration is not recommended due to high risk of morbidity and mortality.
A pre-existing pro inflammatory state in the renal impaired is a high risk factor.
Liver insufficiency in itself is not a contraindication; however, patients may also have coexisting renal insufficiency and thus carry a risk of NSF.
There is insufficient reported data regarding GBCA use in the pregnant and neonate population.
Studies exploring efficacy of stronger magnetic fields, non-contrast or low dosage, and diagnostic test accuracy studies would aide in clinical decision making. Continuing follow-up and research will be needed on low-risk formulations in the long term.

### Safety of meglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA)-enhanced MRI compared to unenhanced MRI in patients with chronic kidney disease (RESCUE study) [^81021b38]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), part of a broader spectrum of acute kidney injuries, was first reported after administration of iodinated contrast media (CM). The European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines define CIN as acute kidney injury within days following CM administration when alternative causes of renal damage have been excluded. The development of CIN after administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) remains controversial, especially in high-risk groups such as patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in whom CIN has been inconsistently reported after injection of various GBCAs. These discrepancies could be due to multiple factors: different doses and routes of administration of GBCAs, heterogeneous study designs and CIN definitions with the use of different formulas to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), non-systematic use of prophylactic measures, and possible differences between GBCAs in terms of their intrinsic nephrotoxic potential. CIN has never been described after administration of meglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA) alone, a molecule in which gadolinium is chelated ("caged") by a macrocyclic ligand. The absence of CIN after Gd-DOTA administration was initially demonstrated in a small, randomised study conducted in CKD patients. The absence of impact of Gd-DOTA on renal function was further documented in a large Japanese post-marketing study, and its good overall safety was confirmed in a surveillance study of 84,621 patients, including 764 patients with renal failure. In a retrospective study conducted by Ergün et al in 91 patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD [mean eGFR by the modified MDRD formula (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease): 33 ml/min/1.73 m 2] assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an intravenous dose of 0.2 mmol/kg of Gd-DOTA, gadopentetate dimeglumine, or gadodiamide, 11 patients (12.1%) developed CIN. However, the respective CIN rate for each GBCA was not specified, and differences in renal toxicity between these GBCAs therefore cannot be excluded. The primary objective of this prospective study was to assess the CIN rate in a similar population of patients with stable stage 3 and 4 CKD undergoing Gd-DOTA-enhanced MRI compared with a control group undergoing unenhanced MRI.

Introduction

Macrocyclic and linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (GdCAs) are routinely used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to speed imaging and aid diagnosis. The stability of these agents varies, with the macrocyclic, ionic agents considered the most thermodynamically and kinetically stable, while linear, non-ionic agents, are considered less so. In general, GdCAs have excellent safety profiles with immediate hypersensitivity reactions reported as between 0.01% and 2.4%, yet the longer term safety of these agents has recently come under intense scrutiny. The deposition of gadolinium within the body following exposure to these agents has been proven, and appears to be dependent on factors such as agent stability and patient renal function. Whilst no clinical consequence has been confirmed, the term gadolinium toxicity has been ascribed to a broad range of likely pathologies.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) was definitively linked to the administration of some GdCAs in patients with renal insufficiency (RI) in 2006. This incurable skin-fibrosing condition, often accompanied with chronic pain, typically arises within 2–10 weeks of contrast administration, and is seen with greater frequency in patients with more severe RI at the time of exposure. NSF was found to be directly related to the stability of GdCAs and, as such, in 2010 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established guidelines and classified the agents based on their risk of inducing NSF. Post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) is a sudden deterioration in renal function post-contrast media administration in the absence of other nephrotoxic events and, although the development of PC-AKI following exposure to GdCAs remains highly disputed due to inconsistent study protocols, there is evidence to suggest that GdCAs can induce PC-AKI.

5.1 Risk Associated with Intrathecal Use

Intrathecal administration of GBCAs can cause serious adverse reactions including death, coma, encephalopathy, and seizures. The safety and effectiveness of OMNISCAN have not been established with intrathecal use. OMNISCAN is not approved for intrathecal use [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of OMNISCAN among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. Do not administer OMNISCAN to these patients. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following OMNISCAN administration to GE HealthCare (1-800-654-0118) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.

Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. When administering a GBCA, do not exceed the recommended dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the agent prior to any readministration [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

MRI contrast agents (gadolinium-based contrast agents [GBCA]) — With very few exceptions, MRI of the CNS for neuro-oncology purposes should always be performed with and without IV injection of a GBCA, and the main relative contraindications to GBCAs include pregnancy and prior allergic reactions; patients can develop allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions, for which premedication and switching to another GBCA product are general considerations, and facility protocols should be followed accordingly in those with prior reactions; GBCAs have a very low rate of acute adverse reactions (0.07–2.4%), and the American College of Radiology Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media considers that "the risk of NSF among patients exposed to standard or lower than standard doses of group II GBCAs is sufficiently low or possibly nonexistent such that assessment of renal function with a questionnaire or laboratory testing is optional prior to intravenous administration", and given their crucial importance, end-stage renal disease should not be a contraindication to GBCAs in most patients receiving group II agents.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® renal failure [^e5cbd0a5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal failure can be divided into acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Both are common and result in increased patient morbidity and mortality. The etiology is multifactorial and differentiation of acute kidney injury from chronic kidney disease includes clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging. The main role of imaging is to detect treatable causes of renal failure such as ureteral obstruction or renovascular disease and to evaluate renal size and morphology. Ultrasound is the modality of choice for initial imaging, with duplex Doppler reserved for suspected renal artery stenosis or thrombosis. CT and MRI may be appropriate, particularly for urinary tract obstruction. However, the use of iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast should be evaluated critically depending on specific patient factors and cost-benefit ratio. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Safety in magnetic resonance units: an update [^24a45e50]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis

There has been recent attention to reports that patients with renal failure are at risk of developing a rare, potentially life-threatening condition with Gd-CAs called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis or nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NSF/NFD). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be estimated in all patients with kidney disease to identify those at risk of developing NSF/NSD. If the GFR is estimated at less than 30 ml.min −1 per 1.73 m −2, the risk of Gd-CAs should be balanced against benefit, and a minimal dose of Gd-CAs only administered if an unenhanced scan proves insufficient. The Gd-CA should not be administered again for at least 7 days. Current evidence suggests that contrast agents may be classified as high-risk, e.g. gadopentelic acid, medium-risk, e.g. gadobenic acid, and low-risk e.g. gadoteridol. The use of high-risk agents is contra-indicated in neonates and during the peri-operative period in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The Gd-Cas are not recommended in pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.

### State of practice: ASNR statement on gadolinium-based contrast agent use in patients with chronic kidney disease [^a2a1ee42]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Beginning in 2006, neuroradiologists became increasingly aware of the risk of nephrogenic system fibrosis (NSF) when patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) received gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in conjunction with MRI scans. Radiology practices began withholding GBCAs from MRI patients with substantial CKD and instated a variety of safety measures to ensure that these individuals did not inadvertently receive GBCAs. As a result, the worldwide incidence of NSF was dramatically reduced. Since that time, a wealth of research on NSF and its etiology has found few unconfounded cases associated with those GBCAs categorized as group II agents by the American College of Radiology.

Methods

In 2023 and 2024, members of the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) Standards and Guidelines Committee reviewed new research evidence on GBCA safety and its relevance to current MRI contrast administration guidelines for patients with CKD. This focused on systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted during the past 5 years. Upon consideration of this literature, recommendations for the administration of GBCAs to patients with CKD were formulated.

Key Message

For neuroimaging applications, the ASNR recommends that group II GBCAs no longer be withheld in patients with CKD when these agents are medically indicated for diagnosis. Moreover, if group II GBCAs are exclusively used in an MRI practice, other safety measures, such as checking renal function or querying patients about CKD, can be discontinued.

### Symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure: different patterns and rates between linear and macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents [^042cc396]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gadolinium is a rare earth metal belonging to lanthanide group of elements. It has exceptional properties for enhancing magnetic resonance imaging signals at low concentrations. This is achieved by reducing the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of tissues resulting in increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Gadolinium is toxic in its free form; therefore, gadolinium chelates, referred to as gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), are synthesized in which gadolinium ion is bound to a chelator molecule to favor elimination and reduce toxicity. Based on the configuration of the chelate, GBCAs can be classified as either macrocyclic or linear molecules (Fig. 1). The macrocyclic GBCAs are known to exhibit very high kinetic stability, which enables their chelates to withhold gadolinium ion for significantly longer period as compared with the linear GBCAs (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1
Structure and kinetic stabilities of routinely used extracellular GBCAs approved for intravenous use in the United States. â Dissociation half-life (T 1/2) in acidic conditions (HCl, pH 1.0) at 25ÂºC.

Currently, almost 50 tons of gadolinium is administered annually worldwide for diagnosis and follow-up of several diseases. – GBCAs are considered safe when used at doses approved for clinical use (0.1–0.3 mmol/kg). The rate of immediate adverse events is very low (< 1 per 1000 injections), and these events are usually mild, with severe adverse events occurring in about 1 per 40,000 injections. However, GBCAs are not without risks. Alongside hypersensitivity reactions and acute nephrotoxicity, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), presenting with skin thickening and reddening, has been identified as a potentially debilitating condition associated with GBCA exposure, in patients with impaired renal function. –

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^4d411868]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Anterior Hip Pain Intra-articular hip pain predominately presents anteriorly. 4, 5 In young adults, anterior hip or groin pain that is aggravated by hip flexion or rotation warrants evaluation for intra-articular pathologies. Hip flexor strains, tears, and avulsion fractures can cause anterior hip pain, with the patient history often including a sports-related or traumatic incident consistent with a flexor injury. Radiography is used to help diagnose femoroacetabular impingement, although the preferred radiographic views may vary. Standing anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis may be most helpful for diagnosing of the pincer deformity, 26 whereas Meyer lateral and 90-degree Dunn views may be best to visualize the cam deformity.
27. 24 Previously, magnetic resonance arthrography with gadolinium injection of the hip was the diagnostic standard for labral tears.

However, with recent advances to 3-tesla MRI and specialized hip protocols, noncontrast 3-tesla MRI is as sensitive and specific as magnetic resonance arthrography and does not require a procedure for contrast injection. 22, 23 Physicians should consult with a local radiologist to determine the most appropriate test in their area. FEMORAL NECK STRESS FRACTURES Stress fractures of the femoral neck are typically associated with overuse and may also be associated with energy imbalance in athletes. Femoral neck stress fractures are more common in women than men but should not be excluded in men with a history of overuse. 10 Early in the disease process, stress fractures are typically not visible on radiographs and therefore MRI is required for definitive diagnosis. Early diagnosis of a femoral neck stress fracture is important because conversion to a complete fracture can be a devastating injury. 5, 28.

AVASCULAR NECROSIS Avascular necrosis of the femoral head most commonly presents in middle-aged to older adults. Risk factors include alcohol use, smoking, systemic corticosteroid use, hemoglobinopathies, chemotherapy, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Early detection of avascular necrosis can be joint sparing, but no physical examination finding is specific for this diagnosis. 11 Late-stage disease may be visible on a radiograph, but earlier diagnosis often requires MRI or computed tomography. 12, 21. OSTEOARTHRITIS In older adults, osteoarthritis of the femoroacetabular joint is the most common cause of anterior hip pain. 3 It can lead to significant morbidity and decrease in physical activity. Osteoarthritis of the hip typically has a gradual onset, but some patients recall a specific injury or fall. Patients with this condition may have pain with sitting and ambulating for long periods and may have an antalgic gait.

Physical examination maneuvers such as flexion and internal and external rotation may reproduce pain, and range of motion may be decreased. 4, 6. Standing anteroposterior radiography of the pelvis is the radiologic test of choice and will show joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. However, presence of these findings does not always correlate with symptom severity. 7, 13, 29 Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injection of the hip joint may help differentiate an intra-articular cause of pain from other causes, and corticosteroid injection may be therapeutic for intra-articular pain.
30. HIP FRACTURES Hip fractures are more common in older adults and often present after a fall or other trauma or may be associated with osteoporosis. Physical examination usually reveals an inability to walk on the affected limb and a shortened, externally rotated, abducted leg while in the supine position.

### Gadobutrol in renally impaired patients: results of the GRIP study [^4a04fb85]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design

GRIP was a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label phase IV study performed in 55 centers in 9 countries (Germany [18 centers], Italy [10], Spain [3], Austria [6], Switzerland [1], Canada [5], Australia [2], South Korea [8], and Thailand [2]). The study period lasted from December 2008 to January 2015. The primary objective was to assess the magnitude of potential risk of developing NSF after gadobutrol administration in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.

Study Population

The study population consisted of patients with moderate to severe renal impairment scheduled for gadobutrol-enhanced MRI within the approved indications and dose. The study was conducted in accordance with all international and local guidelines and laws stated by the involved institutional review boards. Oral and written informed consent was obtained before each examination.

The classification of cohorts based on the degree of renal impairment was already described by Lauenstein et alin a study on gadoxetate disodium. The identical classification was used in the present study. The definitions in brief are as follows: "severe" renal impairment was defined by an eGFR of < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or dialysis. "Moderate" renal impairment was defined as an eGFR between ≥ 30 and ≤ 59 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. However, renal status was tested twice — first during screening within 6 weeks before the gadobutrol injection at the local laboratory and second at baseline (ie, 48 hours before gadobutrol administration) at a central laboratory. As a result, 2 additional cohorts were defined post hoc: (1) an "extended moderate" renal impairment cohort (presenting an eGFR ≤ 59 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at screening, but > 59 and ≤ 65 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at baseline) and (2) a "mild" renal impairment cohort (presenting an eGFR ≤ 59 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at screening, but an eGFR > 65 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at baseline) (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Classification of Study Cohorts

Treatment

All patients received a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg (0.1 mL/kg) bw gadobutrol followed by a 20 mL saline flush in the framework of the clinical routine diagnostic workup. Gadobutrol is marketed in all participating countries and was provided by the local hospital pharmacies.

5.5	Acute Renal Failure

In patients with renal insufficiency, acute renal failure requiring dialysis or worsening renal function have occurred, mostly within 48 hours of OMNISCAN Injection. The risk of renal failure may increase with increasing dose of gadolinium contrast. Use the lowest necessary dose of contrast and evaluate renal function in patients with renal insufficiency. Acute renal failure was observed in < 1% of patients in OMNISCAN clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

OMNISCAN is cleared by glomerular filtration. Hemodialysis also enhances OMNISCAN clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

5.6	Impaired Visualization of Lesions Detectable with Non-contrast MRI

Paramagnetic contrast agents such as OMNISCAN might impair the visualization of lesions which are seen on the non-contrast MRI. This may be due to effects of the paramagnetic contrast agent, or imaging parameters. Exercise caution when OMNISCAN MRI scans are interpreted in the absence of a companion non-contrast MRI.

5.7	Laboratory Test Findings

Asymptomatic, transitory changes in serum iron have been observed. The clinical significance is unknown.

OMNISCAN interferes with serum calcium measurements with some colorimetric (complexometric) methods commonly used in hospitals, resulting in serum calcium concentrations lower than the true values. In patients with normal renal function, this effect lasts for 12 to 24 hours. In patients with decreased renal function, the interference with calcium measurements is expected to last during the prolonged elimination of OMNISCAN. After patients receive OMNISCAN, careful attention should be used in selecting the type of method used to measure calcium.

5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of Clariscan among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following Clariscan administration to GE HealthCare at (1-800-654-0118) or FDA at (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days), and usually reversible, decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.

The factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA, and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Clariscan dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

### Safety of meglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA)-enhanced MRI compared to unenhanced MRI in patients with chronic kidney disease (RESCUE study) [^29cd378f]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Safety assessment

Serum creatinine and other laboratory parameters (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, uric acid, haematocrit, and haemoglobin) were assayed in the same laboratory for each patient for both pre- and post-MRI blood samples.

The primary endpoint was nephrotoxicity, defined as the percentage of patients with serum creatinine level elevation, determined 72 ± 24 h after MRI, of at least 25% or 44.2 μmol/l (0.5 mg/dl) above the baseline value.

Secondary endpoints were: variation in (1) serum creatinine and (2) eGFR values between baseline and 72 ± 24 h after MRI as well as the percentage of patients with a decrease in eGFR of at least 25% from baseline values, the percentage of patients who met the criteria of the primary endpoint and for whom serum creatinine returned to the baseline value 14 days after MRI, and the potential influence on renal function of the measures to prevent CIN (medication/hydration). There was no specific hydration protocol defined in this study and the sites followed their routine practice. Nonetheless, whenever possible, the patient was encouraged to drink liberally before and after the injection. Special attention was paid to acute and delayed allergy-like reactions. The number of dialysis sessions after MRI was also recorded.

Patients were monitored for adverse events from the time informed consent was signed until 72 ± 24 h after MRI. In case of CIN, renal function was to be checked via a third blood sample 14 days after the imaging procedure in the same laboratory as the two others. The patient was then followed up until complete resolution of the CIN.

Adverse events reported by the local investigators were classified as serious or non-serious and assessed according to their clinical severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and their relationship (possible, doubtful, or not related) to the study contrast agent or the unenhanced-MRI procedure. Outcomes of adverse events were classified into the following categories: resolved with or without sequelae, ongoing, worsened at the time of the report, or death.

Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse) were monitored just before each MRI procedure, then 15 min and 1 h after the procedure.

Each patient was contacted 3 months after the MRI exam to detect any symptoms or signs suggestive of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). This 3-month follow-up was chosen according to the average time of NSF onset as suggested by several publications.

5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of ELUCIREM among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m2). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following ELUCIREM administration to Guerbet LLC (1-877-729-6679) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.

Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended ELUCIREM dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in CLTI — capabilities, risks, and performance indicates that MRA has the potential to produce images comparable in quality to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) without exposure to ionizing radiation or iodinated contrast material, making contrast-induced nephropathy extremely rare; time-resolved MRA is particularly useful in imaging of IP disease; equipment costs and limited access to MRA and subspecialists constrain use; gadolinium contrast enhancement has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis primarily in individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2; in highly specialized centers, compared with DSA, foot CE-MRA yielded a sensitivity of 92% for detecting significant disease in IP and pedal vessels; limitations include venous overlay in slow-flow states and limited availability; overall, MRA is described as an evolving technology with access to modern techniques highly variable worldwide.
