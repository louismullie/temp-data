## Question

Bleeding after CABG

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), integrating preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antithrombotic decisions with risk stratification, monitoring, and treatment strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance and definitions of bleeding after CABG. Then, I should verify preoperative antiplatelet interruption intervals and the role of aspirin continuation. Next, I will examine intraoperative and immediate postoperative hemostatic strategies and transfusion thresholds. After that, I need to review postoperative antiplatelet resumption and the balance of ischemic versus bleeding risks. Finally, I will consider special populations, risk scores, and quality metrics to close the loop on prevention and management, making sure each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance and definitions, because I need to ensure we are speaking the same language before proposing interventions. Major bleeding after CABG is common and prognostically important, with contemporary cohorts showing roughly 6–7% in-hospital bleeding and reoperation for bleeding around 2–3%, and both bleeding and transfusion independently associate with higher mortality, longer length of stay, and more ICU days, so I should treat bleeding as a primary safety endpoint rather than a mere side effect [^117CJqqL] [^1171ppVS] [^1161UGfU]. Hold on, I should verify the mortality signal tied to transfusion specifically; in ACUITY, mortality rose stepwise with increasing RBC units, with a notable inflection at ≥ 4 units, and in a large Swedish cohort, postdischarge major bleeding carried a mortality risk comparable to postdischarge MI, underscoring the need to prevent, detect, and treat bleeding aggressively [^113qoo5f] [^112HMY27] [^1146E7Nc]. I need to check standardized definitions too; BARC type 4 CABG-related bleeding, TIMI, GUSTO, and universal perioperative bleeding scores are the anchors I should use to classify severity and guide response [^113unF7o] [^112Nf2R1].

> Next, I should review preoperative antiplatelet interruption, and I need to be precise about agent-specific washout. For elective CABG, guidelines converge on ticagrelor 3–5 days, clopidogrel 5 days, and prasugrel 7 days before surgery, with ACCP advising interruption of P2Y12 inhibitors and AHA guidance aligning with these intervals; shorter washout increases bleeding and transfusion, and I should double-check that this applies across on- and off-pump contexts [^1137GfY3] [^117QSmwz] [^112dbRMS] [^116U72JH]. Wait, let me verify the data quantifying harm; in STS/SCA/AmSECT, clopidogrel within 5 days increased transfusion and early high chest tube output, and ticagrelor within 72 hours increased major bleeding and mortality, while a meta-analysis confirms fewer reoperations and less major bleeding when clopidogrel is held > 5 days, reinforcing the need to respect these intervals whenever feasible [^1163kPZQ] [^115sJf32]. I should also confirm that platelet function testing can refine timing in select cases, especially with clopidogrel variability, though evidence is mixed and should not override clinical judgment [^114PxEKA].

> Now, aspirin preoperatively is a separate question, and I need to ensure I do not conflate it with P2Y12 inhibitors. High-quality evidence and guidelines support continuing aspirin through the perioperative period; ATACAS showed no increase in reoperation and a signal toward fewer ischemic events when aspirin was given 1–2 hours pre-CABG and resumed within 24 hours, and ACCP recommends considering continuation or resumption within 24 hours, which I should prioritize unless there is an overriding bleeding risk [^113PebXq] [^115ERiLi] [^114sJhqV]. But wait, what if the patient is at very high bleeding risk or refuses transfusion? In that narrow scenario, holding aspirin 3 days pre-op may be reasonable after individualized assessment, but I should document the ischemic trade-off explicitly [^111BmDn8].

> I will now examine intraoperative and immediate postoperative strategies, and I need to check that I am not missing surgical hemostasis fundamentals. Meticulous surgical technique and a structured prechest-closure checklist reduce technical bleeding sources, which account for the majority of reexploration cases; antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid reduce bleeding and are standard in many programs; and viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) can guide targeted factor replacement rather than empiric plasma, reducing unnecessary transfusions and improving hemostasis efficiency [^112zs3Z7] [^116tdVe4] [^114bUVU6]. Hold on, I should verify transfusion thresholds; restrictive RBC strategies around hemoglobin 7–8 g/dL are reasonable in stable patients, and I should avoid prophylactic plasma unless there is documented coagulopathy, given lack of benefit and potential harm [^112eFxfW]. Let me reconsider adjuncts; continuous postoperative pericardial flushing reduced early blood loss and tamponade in a randomized trial, suggesting a role where available, though broader validation is needed [^115aEH3P].

> Next, I should review postoperative antiplatelet resumption, and I need to balance early graft thrombosis risk against bleeding. Aspirin should be resumed as soon as bleeding risk is acceptable, ideally within 6–24 hours, given its benefit on early graft patency and ischemic outcomes; if oral absorption is uncertain, IV or rectal aspirin can bridge until enteral intake is reliable [^111onK7Y] [^115ERiLi]. For P2Y12 inhibitors, I should confirm that adding them in the immediate postoperative window before secure hemostasis increases bleeding and reexploration; therefore, I should wait until chest tube output is low and hemodynamics are stable, typically 24–72 hours, before initiating DAPT, tailoring to ischemic and bleeding risk profiles [^112uN8pn] [^1137GfY3]. Let me verify the ischemic rationale; platelet-driven early graft failure clusters in the first month, so timely but safe antiplatelet intensification can mitigate that risk once hemostasis is secured [^113W9ajM].

> I should now weigh the net clinical benefit of DAPT after CABG, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Meta-analyses show DAPT reduces all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and MACCE compared with aspirin alone, but increases major and minor bleeding; ticagrelor-based DAPT may further reduce mortality versus clopidogrel-based DAPT, though bleeding risk rises, and contemporary consensus favors an individualized approach based on ischemic and bleeding risk rather than a blanket policy [^114193ST] [^114K9Uve] [^115KfG3Q]. Wait, let me verify guideline nuance; ESC 2024 suggests considering DAPT after CABG in selected patients at higher graft occlusion risk and lower bleeding risk, and ongoing trials like ODIN and TOP-CABG are testing shorter DAPT courses to preserve efficacy while limiting bleeding, which I should factor into shared decision-making [^116sbgfP] [^113W9ajM]. I need to ensure I also account for the COMPASS CABG data, where low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin did not reduce SVG failure but did reduce MACE, reinforcing that antithrombotic intensity must be matched to the clinical endpoint we are targeting [^115nuNkn].

> Special populations require tailored decisions, and I should double-check each modifier. In older adults, bleeding risk is higher and guideline-directed washout intervals become even more critical; frailty, low body weight, and renal dysfunction further amplify risk, so I should favor aspirin monotherapy when feasible and use DAPT cautiously with shorter intended durations if indicated [^112dbRMS] [^113Z1mWz]. In ACS patients facing urgent CABG, I must balance stent thrombosis against bleeding; if surgery cannot be delayed to achieve full washout, off-pump or minimally invasive strategies and meticulous hemostasis can mitigate bleeding while platelet function testing may help time surgery sooner when P2Y12 effect has waned, though evidence is limited and decisions should be multidisciplinary [^115FXKXq] [^114PxEKA]. For patients with mechanical valves or atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation, I should confirm there are no robust data to dictate the optimal antiplatelet–anticoagulant combination after CABG, so I must individualize based on thrombotic and bleeding risks, with a low threshold to favor simpler regimens when bleeding risk predominates [^114MSfJn].

> Risk stratification tools can sharpen preoperative planning, but I need to ensure I cite those validated in cardiac surgery. The Will-Bleed score incorporates anemia, renal function, recent potent antiplatelet exposure, ACS, and heparin use to predict severe bleeding, and nomograms for off-pump CABG incorporate age, BMI, hemoglobin, sodium, BUN, and operative time; these can guide preemptive blood conservation and transfusion planning, though prospective validation is ongoing [^1144UHad] [^114Y7qHQ]. Hold on, I should verify that these tools complement, not replace, clinical judgment; they identify high-risk patients who merit enhanced PBM protocols, antifibrinolytic optimization, and stricter transfusion triggers, while also identifying low-risk patients in whom transfusion may be avoidable [^112eFxfW].

> Monitoring and response protocols should be standardized, and I need to check that I include both quantitative and qualitative triggers. Chest tube output exceeding 200 mL/hour for 2–4 hours, sudden hemodynamic instability with falling hemoglobin, or signs of tamponade warrant urgent evaluation and often surgical exploration; reexploration for bleeding carries a several-fold increase in 30-day mortality and is among the strongest modifiable risk factors for poor outcomes, so I should not delay when indications are present [^1161UGfU] [^1171ppVS]. I should confirm that viscoelastic testing can expedite targeted therapy for coagulopathy, and that massive transfusion protocols with balanced ratios are activated when bleeding is severe, while simultaneously correcting reversible contributors such as hypothermia, acidosis, and hyperfibrinolysis [^116tdVe4].

> Prevention is the final pillar, and I need to ensure the plan addresses modifiable risks across the continuum. Preoperative anemia should be identified and treated to reduce transfusion exposure, antiplatelet interruption should follow agent-specific intervals whenever possible, and intraoperative antifibrinolytics and meticulous hemostasis should be routine; postoperatively, early aspirin, judicious DAPT selection and duration, and structured PBM programs reduce bleeding and its sequelae, and emerging strategies like continuous pericardial flushing may further decrease early blood loss and tamponade in selected centers [^112eFxfW] [^115aEH3P]. Let me reconsider the overarching principle; bleeding after CABG is not merely a complication to manage but a prognostic inflection point that rivals ischemic events in its impact on survival, so every decision about antithrombotic therapy should explicitly weigh bleeding and ischemic risks in shared decision-making and be reassessed dynamically as the patient's status evolves [^112HMY27] [^115KfG3Q].

---

Bleeding after CABG is common and clinically significant, with major bleeding in 3–5% and reoperation in 2–3% of cases [^1171ppVS]. The main drivers are **antiplatelet therapy** — especially recent P2Y12 inhibitor exposure [^111myUQu] — and **surgical factors** such as complex or redo procedures [^112fCyBF]. Bleeding increases transfusion, reoperation, ICU stay, and mortality [^113qoo5f] [^1161UGfU], and each RBC unit transfused further raises risk [^113qoo5f]. Management centers on **preoperative interruption of P2Y12 inhibitors** (clopidogrel 5 days, ticagrelor 3–5 days, prasugrel 7 days) [^1137GfY3] [^116U72JH], continuation of aspirin unless bleeding risk is very high [^113PebXq] [^111BmDn8], and early postoperative resumption of antiplatelets when safe [^115ERiLi] [^112epVvC]. Intraoperative antifibrinolytics, meticulous hemostasis, and viscoelastic-guided transfusion reduce bleeding [^116tdVe4] [^114bUVU6]; if bleeding persists, surgical reexploration is indicated [^112zs3Z7]. Risk stratification and multidisciplinary planning are essential to balance ischemic and bleeding risks [^115KfG3Q].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance

- **Incidence**: Major bleeding occurs in 3–5% of CABG cases, and reoperation for bleeding in 2–3% [^1171ppVS].

- **Clinical impact**: Bleeding increases transfusion, reoperation, ICU stay, infection, renal dysfunction, and mortality [^117CJqqL] [^1161UGfU].

- **Transfusion risk**: Each RBC unit increases mortality and morbidity; ≥ 5 units markedly elevate long-term mortality [^1124gTrw].

---

## Risk factors for bleeding after CABG

### Patient-related factors

Patient-related factors include **age** (> 65 years) [^114tMU4v], female sex, low body weight, and preoperative anemia [^112fCyBF]. Comorbidities such as renal insufficiency, liver disease, and prior bleeding history also increase risk [^112fCyBF]. Genetic variability in clopidogrel metabolism (CYP2C19 polymorphisms) further elevates bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

### Procedure-related factors

Procedure-related factors include **complex or redo surgery**, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, and emergency operations [^112fCyBF]. Off-pump CABG may reduce bleeding compared with on-pump procedures [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological factors

Pharmacological contributors include **recent P2Y12 inhibitor use** — clopidogrel within 5 days, ticagrelor within 3–5 days, or prasugrel within 7 days — which significantly increases bleeding risk [^1137GfY3] [^115sJf32]. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) also increases bleeding compared with aspirin alone [^114193ST].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with bleeding

- **Mortality**: Bleeding and transfusions increase short- and long-term mortality [^112HMY27] [^115JmVsF] [^112fCyBF].

- **Morbidity**: Higher rates of infection, renal dysfunction, respiratory complications, and neurological events [^notfound].

- **Resource utilization**: Longer ICU and hospital stay, higher costs [^117CJqqL] [^114tMU4v].

---

## Management strategies

### Preoperative management

Preoperative management emphasizes **antiplatelet interruption** — stop clopidogrel 5 days, ticagrelor 3–5 days, and prasugrel 7 days before surgery when feasible [^1137GfY3] [^116U72JH] — and continuation of aspirin unless the bleeding risk is very high [^111BmDn8] [^114sJhqV]. Risk stratification should identify high-risk patients and guide individualized planning [^114nQyGc].

---

### Intraoperative management

Intraoperative management includes **antifibrinolytics** (tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid) to reduce bleeding [^112zs3Z7], meticulous surgical technique with thorough hemostasis, and viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) to guide targeted transfusion and hemostatic therapy [^113GhxpP].

---

### Postoperative management

Postoperative management includes **close monitoring of chest tube output and hemodynamics**, early resumption of antiplatelet therapy once hemostasis is secure [^115ERiLi] [^112epVvC], and transfusion protocols using restrictive triggers with viscoelastic guidance [^112zs3Z7]. If bleeding persists despite correction of coagulopathy, surgical reexploration is indicated [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures

- **Patient blood management**: Preoperative anemia correction, antifibrinolytics, and restrictive transfusion [^112zs3Z7].

- **Minimally invasive techniques**: Off-pump CABG and smaller incisions reduce bleeding [^115FXKXq].

- **Standardized protocols**: Multidisciplinary pathways and quality metrics improve outcomes [^112zs3Z7].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Antiplatelet interruption | Clopidogrel: 5 days; Ticagrelor: 3–5 days; Prasugrel: 7 days [^1137GfY3] [^116U72JH] |
| Aspirin management | Continue unless very high bleeding risk [^111BmDn8] [^114sJhqV] |
| Antifibrinolytics | Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid recommended [^112zs3Z7] [^114bUVU6] |
| Transfusion | Restrictive triggers with viscoelastic guidance [^112zs3Z7] |
| Reexploration | Indicated for persistent bleeding after correction of coagulopathy [^notfound] |

---

Bleeding after CABG is a major complication with significant morbidity and mortality. Effective management requires **preoperative planning**, **intraoperative technique**, and **postoperative monitoring**, with antiplatelet interruption, antifibrinolytics, and selective transfusion as key measures.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related bleeding complications and perioperative coronary events are strongly influenced by the management of antithrombotic therapy before and after CABG. Bleeding but also blood products transfusion increase the risk of death and compromise the long-term benefits of CABG. The use of new P2Y 12 inhibitors, increasing pre-CABG percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug eluting stents (DES) requiring specific antiplatelet regimens, and advances in surgical technique has prompted the ESC Working Group on Cardiovascular Surgery and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis to review the evidence of peri-CABG recommendations on antithrombotic management. Due to the paucity of randomized trials, most of the evidence is still derived from observational studies and expert consensus, further reinforcing the importance of a multidisciplinary consultation for optimal decision making.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) is a major revascularization approach for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is widely used across the world. According to the current guidelines, CABG is recommended for stable CAD with proximal left anterior descending stenosis, left main stenosis and three-vessel disease, especially when the patient has a high SYNTAX score or diabetes mellitus. CABG is performed to relieve the symptoms of myocardial ischemia and improve the prognosis. Perioperative management is critical to reduce the main adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and complications after surgery.

Antithrombotic treatment plays an important role in reducing adverse cardiovascular events and is mandatory in CAD patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended early after operation for patients with low bleeding risk due to its prevention of early graft failure as well as its reduction of adverse events and death after CABG in some studies. Early use of dual antiplatelet drugs is also reasonable for patients with a high risk of ischemia and thrombosis, but the risk of bleeding should be taken into consideration. In addition, heparin for anticoagulation is administered in some centers at an early stage after CABG for the prevention of ischemic events. However, the current guidelines make no recommendation on the early use of heparin after CABG. Whether it is safe and effective to prevent early adverse events is still unknown.

### Postdischarge major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and mortality risk after coronary artery bypass grafting [^111NPuCk]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The findings of the present study indicate that major bleeding should be included with ischaemic events in composite endpoints when investigating antithrombotic strategies after CABG. The findings also suggest that strategies to reduce postdischarge bleeding, for example, by initiating proton pump inhibitors among selected patients, screening for Helicobacter pylori infection or systematically using bleeding risk prediction tools when deciding on antiplatelet intensity and duration, could potentially further improve long-term survival after CABG.

Study limitations

We did not have sufficient data to analyse the specific cause of death and could therefore not determine whether patients dying outside of hospitals did so because of bleeding, MI or other causes. We could not use bleeding definitions commonly used in clinical trials, since we did not have data on transfusions and haemoglobin levels. Even though not directly comparable to other definitions, we argue that our definition of major bleeding (hospitalisation with a primary diagnosis of bleeding) is relevant from a clinical and epidemiological perspective. Patient characteristics and comorbidities adjusted for in the statistical models were not updated during follow-up and do not take into account changes in patient status over time. This is a relevant limitation considering that the median time to major bleeding and MI was 3.5 and 3.3 years, respectively. The increase in mortality risk after an event may reflect both a direct association from the event as well as associations mediated via other comorbidities debuting after the event, since comorbidities were not updated and therefore not adjusted for. Despite extensive adjustment for baseline variables and time-updated use of secondary prevention medications throughout follow-up, there is always the risk of unmeasured confounders not included in the statistical analysis.

Considering these limitations, the study also had strengths. The large study population with nationwide real-world data from validated registries indicates high external validity.

### Strategies to reduce bleeding among patients with ischemic heart disease treated with antiplatelet therapies [^115tQXbL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone of management in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and percutaneous coronary intervention. Combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel reduces the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in ACS but increases the risk of major bleeding, which studies indicate is 1%-4% higher when clopidogrel is added to aspirin. Given the association between bleeding and adverse outcomes, minimizing bleeding risk is a clinical priority. This review outlines strategies to reduce both acute and chronic bleeding risk with aspirin and clopidogrel and focuses on dosing of concomitant therapies, vascular access techniques, and mitigating the bleeding risk associated with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

### Postdischarge major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and mortality risk after coronary artery bypass grafting [^112HMY27]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In a large, nationwide, contemporary cohort of CABG patients, postdischarge major bleeding events were associated with significantly higher short-term and long-term mortality risks, comparable with that in patients suffering from a postdischarge MI. The incidence of postdischarge major bleeding and MI was also similar. Therefore, trials investigating antithrombotic treatment regimens after CABG should include major bleeding events when determining the net clinical effect of the regimen and clinicians are urged to make the same effort to reduce bleeding events as for minimising the risk for new MIs after CABG.

Risks and benefits of preoperative exposure to antiplatelet therapy

Benefits of preoperative aspirin

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) is recommended as secondary prevention therapy for all patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) and without contraindications. Its indication is even stronger for post-CABG patients (recommendation IA). The general consensus is that ASA treatment withdrawal has ominous prognostic implications in patients with CAD, especially in those with intracoronary stents, and should be advocated only when the bleeding risk clearly outweighs that of atherothrombotic events.

The benefits of continuing ASA until the day of CABG ('preoperative ASA') are less clear and may explain the wide variability in the management of ASA therapy in the perioperative period and differences between guidelines endorsed by different professional and scientific societies. This was based on the demonstration that ASA started the day before surgery was no more effective than ASA started 6 h after surgery at improving early (7- to 10-day) graft patency, but was associated with increased bleeding complications. More recent evidence suggests, however, that ASA use within 5–7 days prior to CABG halves mortality without significant increase in haemorrhage, blood product requirements, or related morbiditiesand reduces late infarction and repeat revascularization. Retrospective data show consistent benefit of preoperative aspirin within 5 days of surgery, including a reduction in cerebrovascular events and 30-day mortality.

Risks of preoperative aspirin

Evidence that preoperative ASA increases the risk of transfusion, re-exploration rate, and chest tube drainage was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the late 80s when blood conservation and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) techniques were very different, such as little off-pump CABG surgery and higher aspirin ASA dosage. More recent analysis still suggests an increase in blood loss and more frequent use of blood products in patients exposed to ASA within 7 days of surgery. However, the underpowered nature of subanalyses precludes any strong recommendation on the time delay from ASA discontinuation to CABG in those at high risk of bleeding. Aspirin interruption 3 days prior to CABG may be considered in patients at very high risk for bleeding after individualized assessment or in patients who refuse blood transfusions(Table 1).

Definitions and outcomes

The primary endpoint was postoperative bleeding events during hospitalization according to the PLATO, TIMI and GUSTO criteria. In the PLATO criteria, major life-threatening bleeding was defined as fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, intrapericardial bleeding with cardiac tamponade, hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension due to bleeding requiring pressors or surgery, a fall in hemoglobin of 50 g/L (3.1 mmol/L) or greater, or the need for transfusion of at least 4 units of red blood cells. Other major bleeding was defined as significantly disabling bleeding (such as intraocular bleeding with permanent vision loss), a drop in hemoglobin of at least 30 g/L (1.9 mmol/L) but < 50 g/L (3.1 mmol/L) or requiring transfusion of 2 to 3 units of red blood cells. The TIMI criterion for major bleeding was either intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration of more than 50 g/L. Severe bleeding in the GUSTO guideline was defined as fatal intracranial intrapericardial bleeding with cardiac tamponade, or the development of hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension due to bleeding requiring pressor support or surgery. Secondary endpoints included postoperative mortality, postoperative myocardial infarction (MI), and postoperative stroke during hospitalization, and the composite of mortality, MI and stroke. Postoperative MI was defined in accordance with the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction. Other secondary endpoints included PRBC (packed red blood cell), FFP (fresh frozen plasma) or platelet transfusion, and MCTD (mediastinal chest tube drainage) > 1 L within 12 h postoperatively. According to the criteria proposed by The Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) which classified bleeding events based on bleeding cause, site, severity, and outcomes into 5 types, CABG-related bleeding falls on Type 4 and is divided into the following categories: (1) perioperative intracranial bleeding within 48 h, (2) reoperation after closure of sternotomy for the purpose of controlling bleeding, (3) transfusion of ≥ 5 units of whole blood or packed red blood cells within a 48-hour period, (4) chest tube output ≥ 2 L within a 24-hour period.

### Should clopidogrel be discontinued before coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with acute coronary syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111myUQu]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are treated with dual antiplatelet agents, including aspirin and clopidogrel, to prevent mortality and recurrent ischemia. However, those who require coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) could have increased postoperative bleeding and bleeding-related adverse outcomes. The current guidelines on clinical management differ significantly. The present meta-analysis examined the evidence for clopidogrel in the treatment of patients presenting with ACS requiring CABG, with a focus on the timing of medication cessation before surgery.

Methods

A systematic review of 9 electronic databases was performed to identify all relevant studies with comparable outcomes for patients with ACS treated with clopidogrel before CABG. The endpoints included reoperation, major bleeding, mortality, and a composite endpoint of mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction.

Results

Five relevant studies were identified according to the predefined selection criteria. Patients who had received clopidogrel had a significantly lower incidence of composite endpoints than those who had not. However, patients who underwent CABG < 5 days after the last dose of clopidogrel had a significantly greater incidence of reoperation, major bleeding, and combined adverse outcomes than those who had had a washout period > 5 days.

Conclusions

The results from the present meta-analysis suggest that patients who present with ACS should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, including clopidogrel. However, for patients subsequently referred for CABG, a minimum washout period of 5 days should be observed to minimize perioperative bleeding and bleeding-related complications, unless emergency indications exist. These results differ from those of previous studies and guidelines.

### Optimal antiplatelet strategy following coronary artery bypass grafting: a meta-analysis [^114193ST]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is an established revascularisation strategy for multivessel and left main coronary artery disease. Although aspirin is routinely recommended for patients with CABG, the optimal antiplatelet regimen after CABG remains unclear. We evaluated the efficacies and risks of different antiplatelet regimens (dual (DAPT) versus single (SAPT), and dual with clopidogrel (DAPT-C) versus dual with ticagrelor or prasugrel (DAPT-T/P)) after CABG.

Methods

We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data were extracted and pooled using random-effects models and Review Manager (V.5.4).

Results

Among the 2970 article abstracts screened, 215 full-text articles were reviewed and 38 studies totaling 77 447 CABG patients were included for analyses. DAPT compared with SAPT was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.65 with 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86; p = 0.002), cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84; p = 0.008), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; p = 0.01), but higher rates of major (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.56; p = 0.007) and minor bleeding (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.74; p = 0.001) after CABG. DAPT-T/P compared with DAPT-C was associated with significantly lower all-cause (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.65; p ≤ 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80; p = 0.008), and no differences on other cardiovascular or bleeding outcomes after CABG.

Conclusion

In patients with CABG, DAPT compared with SAPT and DAPT-T/P compared with DAPT-C were associated with reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, DAPT was associated with reduction in MACCE, but higher rates of major and minor bleeding. An individualised approach to choosing antiplatelet regimen is necessary for patients with CABG based on ischaemic and bleeding risks.

### A narrative review of clinical decision support systems for perioperative bleeding management in cardiac surgery [^114fCFj6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Bleeding complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are common. The clinician must assimilate multiple sources of monitoring information, make rational decisions on the etiology of the bleeding, and then formulate a treatment strategy. Clinical decision support systems that acquire this information and present the data in an easily usable format may be useful tools to guide the physician in optimizing treatment strategies through adherence to evidence-based best practice guidelines. The authors present a narrative review of the literature and discuss how clinical decision support systems may be useful to the clinician.

### Different antithrombotic strategies after coronary artery bypass grafting to prevent adverse events: a retrospective analysis [^1144UHad]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antiplatelet therapy is a major strategy to prevent post-CABG failure and adverse events. While aspirin therapy after CABG has been proven to be a safe approach to improve vein graft patency and reduce adverse events, there have been no dedicated large-scale studies in the CABG population to support postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy. Continuation of DAPT before the surgery increases the risk of excessive perioperative bleeding, transfusions, and re-exploration for bleeding, which suggests the likelihood of a high risk of bleeding in postoperative DAPT patients. In a meta-analysis of 20,315 patients, DAPT (as compared to single antiplatelet therapy) was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in observational studies, but not in randomized trials or in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Additionally, DAPT was correlated with an increased risk for major bleeding in that study. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline Focused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease issued recommendations to utilize DAPT over SAPT in patients following CABG in 2016. Another meta-analysis showed increased vein graft patency with DAPT, but increased postoperative bleeding was also noted. Current guidelines recommend postoperative DAPT based upon the stability of coronary artery disease prior to CABG. In 2017, F. Biancari et al. proposed a Will-Bleed score to evaluate the risk of severe bleeding after CABG. Seven parameters with different weights were included in this model: preoperative anemia, female gender, eGFR, potent antiplatelet drugs discontinued less than five days, critical preoperative state, ACS, and use of LMWH/fondaparinux/unfractionated heparin. This risk score simplified the evaluating process and showed optimistic ability for prediction.

European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy is essential after coronary artery bypass graft surgery to reduce ischaemic events and prevent graft occlusion. Although aspirin remains the most commonly used agent, in higher-risk patients, dual antiplatelet therapy or combining antiplatelet therapy with oral anticoagulation may be beneficial, but this increases bleeding risk. The choice of antithrombotic therapy should be tailored to each patient, based on their ischaemic and bleeding risks, and regularly reassessed. Here, the scientific evidence underlying the key aspects of the choice of antithrombotic therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting is reviewed. Consensus statements for best clinical practice are provided and areas requiring further research are highlighted.

European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In an individual patient data meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (1316 patients) that used rigorous re-adjudication of outcomes, aspirin + ticagrelor was associated with a significantly lower incidence of SVG failure compared with aspirin (11.2% vs. 20%; OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35–0.74; P < .001). This finding was consistent for patients undergoing on- or off-pump CABG (P int = .15) and for SVG and arterial grafts (including ITA and RA grafts, P int = .93). However, patients receiving aspirin + ticagrelor had a significantly increased risk of clinically important bleeding events [Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) types 2, 3, or 5 bleeding: 22.1% vs. 8.7%, OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.99–4.47; P < .001]. Of note, the median treatment duration with aspirin + ticagrelor was 1 year. The specific impact of DAPT on arterial graft patency, particularly in relation to different arterial graft types, has not yet been studied in detail.

These findings highlight the importance of a DAPT strategy after CABG that reduces bleeding risk while retaining its efficacy in reducing SVG failure. Platelet-driven thrombosis is the predominant mechanism of early SVG failure and typically occurs during the first month after surgery, providing a biological rationale for intensified antiplatelet therapy in the first month after CABG. The 1-month DAPT with ticagrelor in coronary artery bypass graft patients (ODIN) trial (NCT05997693) is an investigator-initiated prospective, randomized, international, multicentre trial that is designed to compare the effect of treatment with ticagrelor in addition to low-dose aspirin for 1 month vs. aspirin alone on the 1-year incidence of ischaemic events and graft failure among patients with chronic coronary syndromes undergoing CABG.ODIN will also inform whether short-term DAPT provides a net clinical benefit in this patient population. The Ticagrelor-based De-escalation of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy after Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (TOP-CABG) trial (NCT05380063) will investigate whether de-escalation of DAPT (ticagrelor + aspirin) to aspirin monotherapy after 3 months is non-inferior to DAPT for 12 months in reducing SVG occlusion and superior in reducing bleeding events.

Risk stratification, bridging therapies, and platelet function monitoring

The need for urgent CABG on DAPT arises in ACS patients or after recent stent PCI. In the absence of robust evidence from RCTs, the key issues areindividual risk stratification of bleeding vs. ischaemia according to patient clinical characteristics andtime interval from treatment interruption to CABG with or without bridging therapy.

Risk stratification

In urgent CABG indications, exposure to the full effect of DAPT may lead to increased major bleeding, a complication that is associated with poor outcome due to haemodynamic instability, need for reoperation, or red blood cell transfusion-related inflammation and ischaemia. Red blood cell transfusion during CABG is associated with a two-fold increase in 5-year mortality rates and with significantly more frequent sternal wound infection, severe sepsis, and renal dysfunction.

Risk factors for increased perioperative bleeding and transfusion during CABG have been identified:upstream antithrombotic therapy, patient nongenetic factors (age, female gender, small body size, preoperative anaemia, and comorbidities including COPD, liver disease, cardiac failure, and renal insufficiency), patient genetic factors (variability in clopidogrel response, hereditary deficiencies in coagulation factors/platelet function), andsurgical factors (complex/redo procedures, urgent/emergent procedures). However, there is no easy-to-use scoring system available and the surgeon performance is not taken into account, although it has been shown to be of importance. In addition, although severity of CAD, clinical presentation, and patient co-morbidities may assist in risk stratification for ischaemic events, no available scoring systems for ACS presenters undergoing PCI or medical management have ever been tested in CABG-eligible patients. It appears reasonable to recommend the use of scores which encapsulate the common comorbidities of the CABG-eligible population to better risk stratify (Table 1). The combination of the GRACE and the CRUSADE risk scores appears relevant in such context.

Premature interruption of DAPT is the most important risk factor for early stent thrombosis. – In addition to comorbidities (diabetes, renal failure), the initial clinical presentation, stent length, stent undersizing, complex and/or bifurcation lesions, coronary dissection, genetic factors influencing clopidogrel metabolism, and high platelet reactivity have all been associated with stent thrombosis.

Dual antiplatet therapy after Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery

Observational studies have demonstrated the safety of early postoperative clopidogrel use following CABG but a meta-analysis of studies reporting on safety/efficacy of clopidogrel use with or without aspirin did not show a clear clinical benefit of clopidogrel when given in addition to aspirin after CABG. Several randomized trials have compared the effect of DAPT vs. aspirin on graft patency with diverging results. – Two meta-analyses of observational studies and RCTs showed that the use of DAPT reduced early vein graft occlusion. The meta-analysis by Deo et al. also showed, in the ASA-clopidogrel group, a decrease in hospital or 30-day mortality (0.8 vs. 1.9%, P < 0.0001) compared with ASA alone and this effect was more pronounced in off-pump patients.

The effects of prasugrel have not yet been studied following CABG surgery but the mortality data from TRITON is supportive of resuming prasugrel following CABG surgery (adj OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08–0.85; P = 0.025). In the PLATO study, it was intended that study medication with ticagrelor or clopidogrel should be started as soon as possible after CABG surgery and prior to hospital discharge. Thirty-six percent of CABG patients in the study restarted study medication within 7 days of surgery, 37% did not restart study medication and the rest restarted study medication 7 or more days later. Postoperative mortality was lower in the ticagrelor group compared with the clopidogrel group (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.32–0.77). It is uncertain how much of the benefit of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel related to preoperative compared with postoperative treatment and further studies will provide more evidence in this area.

Conclusions

Antiplatelet therapy plays a major role in the treatment of CAD and is therefore implicated throughout the CABG pathway. Management of single and DAPT in patients undergoing CABG for ACS, previous PCI, or stable angina impacts on early and late outcomes. Risk stratification for bleeding and recurrent ischaemic events, heart team decision making for temporary interruption of antiplatelet therapy and bridging strategies, the use of platelet function monitoring, and blood sparing management strategies are the key steps to further improve clinical outcome in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Gaps in knowledge remain, especially with respect to identification of the optimal bleeding-thrombotic risk balance before and after surgery. Specific studies for patients undergoing CABG are mandatory.

### Impact of major bleeding and blood transfusions after cardiac surgery: analysis from the acute catheterization and urgent intervention triage strategY (ACUITY) trial [^113qoo5f]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prior retrospective studies have identified a relationship between bleeding after cardiac surgery and subsequent mortality. Whether this is attributable to bleeding, anemia, or transfusions is undetermined.

Methods

ACUITY was an international prospective trial of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) before hospital discharge was performed in 1,491 patients. Major bleeding was adjudicated as CABG- or non-CABG related. The relationship between CABG-related bleeding and 1-year mortality was determined using a time-updated covariate-adjusted Cox model.

Results

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related major bleeding after surgery occurred in 789 patients (52.9%); allogeneic blood product transfusions were administered in 612 patients (41.0%), including red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in 570 (38.2%, range 1–53 U), platelet transfusions in 180 (12.1%), and fresh-frozen plasma in 195 (13.1%). One-year mortality occurred in 95 patients (6.4%). Red blood cell transfusion (but not transfusion of platelets or fresh-frozen plasma, CABG-related major bleeding per se, or nadir hemoglobin) was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality, but only after transfusion of ≥ 4 U (adjusted hazard ratio for death after transfusion of 1–3, 4–6, and ≥ 7 RBC units = 0.74, 2.01, and 5.22, respectively). Of the 95 deaths after CABG, 23 (24.2%) were attributable to CABG-related RBC transfusions.

Conclusions

In patients with acute coronary syndromes, RBC transfusion of ≥ 4 U after CABG is strongly associated with subsequent mortality. Future strategies should focus on reducing major hemorrhagic complications and RBC transfusions after CABG.

### Predictors of secondary revascularization after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and role of dual antiplatelet therapy [^113fM9oU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study's retrospective design and single-center setting may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the observational nature precludes establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship between DAPT and revascularization. While we found an increased drop in hemoglobin in the DAPT group, transfusion requirements and major bleeding events (e.g. intracranial bleeding) were similar between groups. These results have been presented in different other articles by authors.

Future research should focus on large-scale, randomized controlled trials to elucidate the causal relationship between DAPT and revascularization post-CABG. Investigating the underlying mechanisms and patient-specific factors that influence these outcomes will be crucial for developing tailored therapeutic strategies.

### Platelet-directed therapies and coronary artery bypass grafting [^111uxaeM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in certain high-risk groups. Despite improvement in surgical technique, hemorrhagic complications are a major concern and are likely to affect perioperative morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and hospital expenditures. The use of platelet-directed therapies in this setting is effective in decreasing ischemic complications, yet these agents simultaneously increase the risk of bleeding. Concern about potential hemorrhagic risk from antiplatelet agents in proximity to CABG may influence physicians to discontinue these agents. The benefit of low-dose aspirin given preoperatively is likely to outweigh any hemorrhagic risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (or aspirin and prasugrel) is associated with a significant increased risk of bleeding and its complications. Additional research is needed to properly evaluate the ischemic benefit versus bleeding risk of aspirin and clopidogrel. Whether reversible P2Y(12) receptor antagonists will mitigate the bleeding risk is unclear at the present time and will require large prospective studies.

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related risk on ticagrelor

Ticagrelor is a direct-acting and reversible inhibitor of the P2Y 12 receptor and is additionally an inhibitor of adenosine reuptake. Like prasugrel, ticagrelor has a more rapid and consistent onset of action compared with clopidogrel leading to a better outcome in ACS patients, irrespective of revascularization strategies, including a mortality benefit. Ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily) is recommended for all patients at moderate-to-high risk of ischaemic events, regardless of initial treatment strategy and including those pretreated with clopidogrel. In addition, it has a more rapid and consistent offset of action related to its reversible receptor binding and plasma half-life of 6–12 h. In patients with stable CAD, recovery of platelet aggregation is almost complete at 5 days after cessation of ticagrelor, with substantially more recovery than seen with good responders to clopidogrel. For patients in the PLATO study who underwent CABG surgery within 7 days of the last dose of study medication, there was evidence of early mortality reduction in the ticagrelor group and this was accounted for by fewer deaths associated with bleeding and infection as well as ischaemic events (4.6 vs. 9.2%; P = 0.0018).

The strategies to reduce bleeding during CABG surgery have been added as.

### Coronary bypass surgery for multivessel disease after percutaneous coronary intervention in acute coronary syndromes: why, for whom, how early? [^115FXKXq]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Multivessel coronary artery disease is present in ∼50% of patients with acute coronary syndrome and, compared with single-vessel disease, entails a higher risk of new ischaemic events and a worse prognosis. Randomized controlled trials have shown the superiority of 'complete revascularization' over culprit lesion-only treatment. Trials, however, only included patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and evidence regarding complete revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery after culprit lesion-only PCI ('hybrid revascularization') is lacking. The CABG after PCI is an open, non-negligible therapeutic option, for patients with non-culprit left main and/or left anterior descending coronary artery disease where evidence in chronic coronary syndrome patients points in several cases to a preference of CABG over PCI. This valuable but poorly studied 'PCI first-CABG later' option presents, however, relevant challenges, mostly in the need of interrupting post-stenting dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for surgery to prevent excess bleeding. Depending on patients' clinical characteristics and coronary anatomical features, either deferring surgery after a safe interruption of DAPT or bridging DAPT interruption with intravenous short-acting antithrombotic agents appears to be a suitable option. Off-pump minimally invasive surgical revascularization, associated with less operative bleeding than open-chest surgery, may be an adjunctive strategy when revascularization cannot be safely deferred and DAPT is not interrupted. Here, the rationale, patient selection, optimal timing, and adjunctive strategies are reviewed for an ideal approach to hybrid revascularization in post-acute coronary syndrome patients to support physicians' choices in a case-by-case patient-tailored approach.

Platelet function monitoring

The interindividual variability in pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel leads to variability in the time taken to recover normal platelet reactivity following cessation of clopidogrel. This is important because several studies have shown that the level of platelet reactivity at the time of surgery can predict the risk of CABG-related bleeding. – Although bedside platelet function testing has not, so far, been successful in guiding antiplatelet therapy during PCI to prevent ischaemic events, treatment monitoring using bedside testing has been suggested as an option to guide treatment interruption rather than arbitrary use of a specified period of delay. Platelet inhibitory response to clopidogrel determines CABG-related bleeding and a strategy based on preoperative platelet function testing to determine the timing of CABG in clopidogrel-treated patients led to ≈50% shorter waiting time than recommended in the current guidelines. For these reasons, the 2012 Update of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Guideline suggested that a delay of even a day or 2 is reasonable to decrease bleeding and thrombotic risk in ACS patients. Point-of-care monitoring of platelet aggregation or whole-blood clot properties is associated with reduced perioperative bleeding and ischaemic complications especially during off-pump CABG surgery. Bedside platelet function testing has been evaluated during clopidogrel exposure but might also be useful in prasugrel- or ticagrelor-treated patients, as recently shown for prasugrel. A proposed strategy for preoperative management of P2Y 12 inhibitors and bridging is shown in Table 3. When the bleeding risk is low, short timing of cessation of P2Y 12 inhibitors prior to CABG surgery is encouraged in addition to bridging therapies that should be used when the thrombotic risk appears high. Platelet function testing may be used when the bleeding risk is low and the thrombotic risk is low. Evidence for PFT is derived from a single randomized study that was performed without point-of-care assayand the interpretation of high platelet reactivity in patients at risk for bleeding remains unclear.

### Major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention and risk of subsequent mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116bAnX1]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Advances in antithrombotic therapy have improved the outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) through the reduction of ischaemic events at the expense of increased procedure-related bleeding complications. Major bleeding events in contemporary PCI are significant, with 30-day bleeding event rates reported between 0.7% and 1.1% in elective,0.6% and 4.7%in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 0.9% and 8.9% in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)depending on the definition used.

There are currently around 10 different definitions of major bleeding used in trials and registries of patients undergoing PCIand these definitions include various clinical events, such as blood transfusion or retroperitoneal haemorrhage, laboratory parameters, such as differing values of haemoglobin decreases, and clinical outcomes such as mortalityresulting in significant differences in bleeding event recording across clinical trials thereby making comparisons between therapeutic strategies difficult. Furthermore, the incidence of major bleeding varies depending on definition used. In one study, the RIVAL non-coronary artery bypass graft (non-CABG) related major bleeding occurred in 0.87% in the STEMI cohort and 0.57% in the NSTEMI group, while if an ACUITY major bleeding definition was used, major bleeding occurred in 3.1% in the STEMI group and 2.26% in the NSTEMI group, respectively.

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related risk on Clopidogrel

Clopidogrel is a second-generation thienopyridine characterized by a large interindividual variability in pharmacodynamic response that has a significanct impact on clinical outcomes. This is because clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires biotransformation into its active metabolite. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, especially CYP2C19, are key players and clopidogrel-treated PCI patients who carry genetic variants associated with CYP2C19 loss-of-function have a three- to six-fold higher risk of stent thrombosis. However, polymorphic variation in CYP2C19 explains < 20% of the response variability with clopidogrel, leaving variation in bioactivation of clopidogrel largely unexplained. So far, there is no convincing evidence that genetic testing or functional platelet assays that measure platelet reactivity may improve clinical outcomes in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing PCI.

Observational studies

Observational studies have demonstated that the increase in postoperative chest tube drainage, transfusion, reoperation rates, hospitalization stay, and mortality observed when DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel) is maintained during CABG – is blunted when DAPT is stopped 5 days or more prior to CABG. Shorter windows of clopidogrel interruption have been suggested but time delay alone does not solely account for the difference in the observed magnitude of clopidogrel effect on bleeding. Differences in patient response to P2Y 12 inhibitors, outcome definitions, transfusion triggers, use of antifibrinolytics, and surgeon-related factors may have been sources of bias. Few studies have reported on ischaemic event rates in ACS patients waiting for CABG. In the CURE trial, patients exposed to clopidogrel had a non-significantly lower MACE rate than the placebo group (2.9 vs. 4.7, 1.8% ARR, RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.29–1.08). Overall, current evidence suggests that clopidogrel should be stopped 5 or more days prior to CABG to avoid bleeding complications that may increase perioperative mortality except if there is uncontrolled ischaemia (Table 1).

Meta-analysis data

Higher blood loss, transfusion, and reoperation rates associated with pre-CABG clopidogrel exposure < 5 days have been confirmed by five meta-analyses. Mortality is increased in observational studies except in patients with ACS, although patient status (stable vs. ACS), type of surgery (urgent vs. elective), and the absence of appropriate study matching may confound the effect of recent clopidogrel exposure (Table 2). Importantly, discontinuation of clopidogrel for 5–7 days before operation does not seem to confer increased cardiac risk.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting in the setting of acute coronary syndrome [^115vUfJb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

After acute coronary syndrome (ACS), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the standard of care for both invasive management with percutaneous intervention and noninvasive (medical) management. Conversely, studies using dual antiplatelet in the population of patients presenting with ACS who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are conflicting. The appropriate antiplatelet regimen after CABG remains an area of controversy. Plaque stability, prevention of graft closure, and secondary thrombosis form the basis for using a second antiplatelet drug, whereas the additional risk of bleeding and lack of conclusive evidence should also be considered. After an extensive literature search, 12 clinical trials with efficacy outcomes were identified. Most of the studies are retrospective, nonrandomized single-center trials. A few large patient populations have been examined using database information. To date, there is only 1 prospective, multicenter, randomized trial published. Recommendations from national guidelines differ, proposing single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or DAPT with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. The purpose of this report is to review the available clinical trial data and provide guidance to practitioners when caring for this patient population. In conclusion, there is no clear consensus regarding the use of DAPT in patients after CABG. If not contraindicated, it is reasonable to use DAPT, starting in the postoperative period, in patients presenting with ACS. Large, multicenter, randomized clinical trials are needed to definitively investigate the role of DAPT in patients with ACS after CABG.

### Innovative strategies in coagulation management for cardiothoracic surgery: a narrative review of pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches [^11326GU1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology

This review addresses the following question: "What are the effective pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies for managing coagulation in cardiothoracic surgery?" We searched PubMed for articles up to August 17, 2024, without applying filters, focusing on studies about coagulation management strategies in patients undergoing cardiothoracic procedures. We conducted two screening steps: first, we reviewed titles and abstracts, followed by full-text analysis. All the authors participated in screening and tabulation via Rayyan. We did not conduct a formal quality evaluation due to topic heterogeneity.

Inclusion criteria

We included studies that were published in English and included case studies, case series, cross-sectional research, case‒control studies, cohort studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. These studies were selected on the basis of their relevance to the field of cardiothoracic surgery and their contribution to understanding coagulation management strategies. We prioritized research that presented novel or significant insights into the pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to coagulation in cardiothoracic surgery.

Exclusion criteria

We excluded publications that did not meet the criteria for rigorous scientific contribution, including preprints, non-English publications, gray literature, letters to the editor, and meeting reports. Additionally, narrative reviews were excluded because they did not provide original data or findings. We also excluded cadaver and animal studies, as well as studies that focused on unrelated surgical procedures, as these were not directly relevant to the scope of our review on coagulation management in cardiothoracic surgery.

### Biological and pharmacological aspects of perioperative hemorrhagic complications associated with oral platelet-directed antithrombotic agents. focus on isolated coronary artery bypass grafting and oral irreversible P2Y (12) receptor antagonists [^117L2U6G]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Coronary arterial bypass grafting (CABG)-the most common heart surgery performed worldwide-is an effective procedure for treating patients with advanced, obstructive atherothrombotic coronary artery disease, prolonging survival in selected high-risk patients. However, CABG is also associated with hemorrhagic complications, which can impact outcome measures such as perioperative morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and health care expenditures. Recent observations have expanded our understanding of the complex process of hemostasis, fostering a more informed view of CABG-associated bleeding complications. Additional research is warranted to determine whether new antithrombotic drug treatment options, such as reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonists among patients with acute coronary syndromes, will favorably impact these clinically relevant complications.

### Postdischarge major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and mortality risk after coronary artery bypass grafting [^1124X4PW]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelet inhibition with acetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to reduce the risk of ischaemic events. More intense platelet inhibition, using dual antiplatelet therapy, is recommended for CABG patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. Dual antiplatelet therapy may also be considered after elective CABG to improve vein graft patency. Furthermore, a significant proportion of CABG patients are treated with oral anticoagulants because of concomitant conditions, such as atrial fibrillation or valvular disease.

However, antithrombotic therapy comes at the cost of increased bleeding risk. Previous studies have demonstrated a comparable increase in mortality risk following a postdischarge bleeding event and myocardial infarction (MI), respectively, in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in general acute coronary syndrome populations. The incidence of postdischarge major bleeding after CABG and its association with mortality risk is not known.

Knowledge of the incidence and severity in terms of subsequent mortality risk after postdischarge major bleeding events in relation to postdischarge MI is important for physicians when deciding on the intensity and duration of antithrombotic therapy after CABG. The objectives of this study were, therefore, (1) to investigate the incidence of postdischarge major bleeding after CABG and its association with subsequent mortality risk, and (2) to relate this to the incidence and mortality risk associated with postdischarge MI.

WARNING: BLEEDING RISK

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

PRASUGREL tablets can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding (5.1, 5.2, 6.1).
Do not use PRASUGREL tablets in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke (4.1, 4.2).
In patients ≥ 75 years of age, prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended, except in high-risk patients (diabetes or prior MI), where its use may be considered (8.5).
Do not start Prasugrel tablets in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Prasugrel tablets at least 7 days prior to any surgery (5.2).
Additional risk factors for bleeding include: body weight < 60 kg; propensity to bleed; concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (5.1).
Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone invasive or surgical procedures (5.1).
If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Prasugrel tablets. Stopping Prasugrel tablets increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (5.3)

Discussion

In this nationwide cohort of CABG patients, two main findings emerged: (1) postdischarge major bleeding events were associated with a markedly increased mortality risk which was most pronounced during the first 30 days after the event; and (2) the incidence and increase in mortality risk associated with a postdischarge major bleeding event were similar to those associated with a MI (figure 6).

The massive increase in mortality risk in the first 30 days after major bleeding events, with an approximately 20-fold increase in mortality risk overall, and an 80-fold increase for patients with intracranial bleeding, indicates a strong direct effect of major bleeding on mortality. However, the remaining increase in mortality risk, both at 30–365 and > 365 days, suggests that also indirect effects of bleeding on mortality are at play. It has been suggested that interruption of antiplatelet treatment following a bleeding event, and thereby an increase in the risk for ischaemic events, is one mechanism behind the increase in mortality after major bleeding in patients with coronary artery disease. However, in the present study, we adjusted for use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications both before and after the event through time-updated covariates, which indicates that other mechanisms were involved. The possibility of major bleeding only being a risk marker for mortality cannot be ruled out, but we made extensive adjustments for covariates and the increase in long-term mortality risk after bleeding has been reported in studies in post-PCI patients and patients with medically managed acute coronary syndrome as well.

Given the indications for CABG, including left main disease and three-vessel disease, diabetes and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, CABG patients as a group have extensive coronary artery disease and a high burden of comorbidities. As such, it could be hypothesised that new MI would be detrimental for these patients. At the same time, CABG patients are protected by the 'surgical collateralization' compared with PCI patients. However, the results of the current study of post-CABG patients are in line with previous studies of post-PCI patientsand patients with medically treated acute coronary syndrome, all indicating a prognostically similar impact of postdischarge major bleeding and MI. This suggests that direct comparisons of bleeding risk and ischaemic risk, preferably by using validated risk scores, can be made for patients with coronary artery disease regardless of revascularisation method.

### Prasugrel [^113QNxW7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: BLEEDING RISK

Prasugrel tablets can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Do not use prasugrel tablets in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].
In patients ≥ 75 years of age, prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended, because of the increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding and uncertain benefit, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or a history of prior myocardial infarction [MI]) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Do not start prasugrel tablets in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue prasugrel tablets at least 7 days prior to any surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Additional risk factors for bleeding include: body weight < 60 kg; propensity to bleed; concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., warfarin, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures in the setting of Prasugrel tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing prasugrel tablets. Discontinuing prasugrel tablets, particularly in the first few weeks after acute coronary syndrome, increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular (CV) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112dbRMS]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) perioperative antithrombotic and glycemic management in older adults — Guidelines provide a Class 1 recommendation for use of an intraoperative insulin infusion to maintain a serum glucose level < 180 mg/dL to reduce sternal wound infection risk and a Class 1 recommendation to continue aspirin until the time of surgery in patients already taking aspirin preoperatively; because older people are at higher risk of CABG-associated bleeding complications, relevant guidance includes a Class 2a recommendation to discontinue ticagrelor for 3 days, clopidogrel for 5 days, and prasugrel for 7 days before elective CABG to reduce major bleeding, and a Class 3 recommendation is made for initiating aspirin in the immediate preoperative period in patients previously not on aspirin undergoing elective CABG. A recent systematic review reported age as being an independent risk factor for delirium after CABG, and consideration should be given to anesthesia strategies and postoperative pain regimens that can reduce delirium risk.

### Nomogram for predicting major bleeding after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [^114Y7qHQ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Major bleeding is a major concern during off-pump CABG and can result in adverse outcomes and extended hospital stays. It is essential for risk stratification, appropriate patient counseling, and optimizing perioperative care to accurately predict the risk of severe bleeding. In this study, we devised a nomogram that combines preoperative and intraoperative variables to predict the likelihood of major bleeding following off-pump CABG. The nomogram demonstrated excellent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility, providing clinicians with a valuable instrument for making informed decisions about bleeding risk and implementing preventative measures.

The nomogram was derived from a retrospective analysis of 541 patients who underwent off-pump isolated primary CABG from January 2012 to December 2022. Age, BMI, hemoglobin, sodium, BUN, and operation time were identified as independent predictors of major bleeding. These predictors have been previously associated with hemorrhage complications in cardiac surgery and are consistent with previous research. Consistently, older age has been identified as a risk factor for hemorrhage due to factors including decreased vascular integrity and impaired hemostatic function. Careful preoperative assessment, closer monitoring, and tailored interventions for older patients may help mitigate the risk. Low BMI has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding, possibly owing to lower coagulation factor levels. Nutritional optimization and targeted interventions to address potential bleeding risks in patients with lower BMI may be beneficial. Hemoglobin and sodium levels reflect the overall health status of the patient and can affect hemostasis. Preoperative correction of anemia and maintaining electrolyte balance during and after surgery can be crucial in preventing major bleeding. Renal dysfunction, which can compromise platelet function and coagulation, may be indicated by elevated BUN levels. Therefore, preoperative assessment and management of renal function, along with adequate hydration, may be essential in reducing bleeding risk. Extended operation Time is a recognized risk factor for bleeding because it subjects the patient to protracted anticoagulation and surgical trauma. Strategies to optimize surgical efficiency, meticulous hemostasis, and consideration of minimally invasive techniques may help reduce operation time and subsequently lower the risk of major bleeding.

### Recent advances in the management of coronary artery disease: highlights from the literature [^1156H4gw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

The recent advances in the multidisciplinary management of coronary artery disease (CAD) have been significant. The assessment of patients before percutaneous coronary intervention is likely to change significantly. National compliance with clinical guidelines in the preprocedural assessment of myocardial ischemia should be encouraged. Multislice computed tomographic coronary angiography continues to improve and is already an excellent screening test for CAD. Coronary stenting has an increasing role in multivessel and left main CAD, although further outcome trials are indicated, especially in the elderly. Although off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery reduces postoperative atrial fibrillation, further major outcome advantages have not been shown in comprehensive meta-analyses when compared with on-pump CABG surgery. Although an intra-aortic balloon pump reduces mortality in high-risk CABG surgery, it may be replaced gradually by the percutaneous left ventricular-assist device, which has shown clinical benefit in this challenging setting. Statin therapy significantly improves clinical outcome after CABG surgery, even when begun postoperatively. There is strong evidence that, unless contraindicated, all CABG patients should receive statin therapy. Clopidogrel therapy just before CABG surgery is still associated with prolonged hospital stay because of significant bleeding complications. This risk will be exacerbated with the advent of the more potent platelet inhibitor, prasugrel. There is a clinical necessity for readily reversible platelet blockade to minimize the bleeding risks in CABG surgery.

Practical implications

This multicenter, prospective registry has been planned to investigate a number of controversial issues regarding the prognostic impact of baseline risk factors as well as treatment methods for surgical myocardial revascularization. This registry will provide also data on the role of pre- and postoperative pharmacological treatments on the outcome of patients undergoing CABG. These informations are expected to provide further knowledge on the mechanisms leading to adverse events after CABG and prevent them.

### Bleeding avoidance strategies. consensus and controversy [^1149XyFv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Bleeding complications after coronary intervention are associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital costs, patient dissatisfaction, morbidity, and 1-year mortality. Bleeding avoidance strategies is a term incorporating multiple modalities that aim to reduce bleeding and vascular complications after cardiovascular catheterization. Recent improvements in the rates of bleeding complications after invasive cardiovascular procedures suggest that the clinical community has successfully embraced specific strategies and improved patient care in this area. There remains controversy regarding the efficacy, safety, and/or practicality of 3 key bleeding avoidance strategies for cardiac catheterization and coronary intervention: procedural (radial artery approach, safezone arteriotomy), pharmacological (multiple agents), and technological (vascular closure devices) approaches to improved access. In this paper, we address areas of consensus with respect to selected modalities in order to define the role of each strategy in current practice. Furthermore, we focus on areas of controversy for selected modalities in order to define key areas warranting cautious clinical approaches and the need for future randomized clinical trials in this area.

### Clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients with and without prior coronary artery bypass grafting [^111QBFpr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background There are limited data on the management strategies, temporal trends and clinical outcomes of patients who present with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and have a prior history of CABG. Methods and Results We identified 287 658 patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction between 2010 and 2017 in the United Kingdom Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project database. Clinical and outcome data were analyzed by dividing into 2 groups by prior history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): group 1, no prior CABG (n = 262 362); and group 2, prior CABG (n = 25 296). Patients in group 2 were older, had higher GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk scores and burden of comorbid illnesses. More patients underwent coronary angiography (69% versus 63%) and revascularization (53% versus 40%) in group 1 compared with group 2. Adjusted odds of receiving inpatient coronary angiogram (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.95; P < 0.001) and revascularization (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70–0.76; P < 0.001) were lower in group 2 compared with group 1. Following multivariable logistic regression analyses, the OR of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of inpatient death and reinfarction; OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90–1.04; P = 0.44), all-cause mortality (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88–1.04; P = 0.31), reinfarction (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.17; P = 0.78), and major bleeding (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90–1.11; P = 0.98) were similar across groups. Lower adjusted risk of inpatient mortality (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46–0.98; P = 0.04) but similar risk of bleeding (OR,1.07; CI, 0.79–1.44; P = 0.68) and reinfarction (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.81–1.57; P = 0.47) were observed in group 2 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention compared with those managed medically. Conclusions In this national cohort, patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction with prior CABG had a higher risk profile, but similar risk-adjusted in-hospital adverse outcomes compared with patients without prior CABG. Patients with prior CABG who received percutaneous coronary intervention had lower in-hospital mortality compared with those who received medical management.

### Clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients with and without prior coronary artery bypass grafting [^111jQ6AY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data on the management strategies, temporal trends and clinical outcomes of patients who present with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction and have a prior history of CABG.

Methods and Results

We identified 287 658 patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction between 2010 and 2017 in the United Kingdom Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project database. Clinical and outcome data were analyzed by dividing into 2 groups by prior history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): group 1, no prior CABG (n = 262 362); and group 2, prior CABG (n = 25 296). Patients in group 2 were older, had higher GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk scores and burden of comorbid illnesses. More patients underwent coronary angiography (69% versus 63%) and revascularization (53% versus 40%) in group 1 compared with group 2. Adjusted odds of receiving inpatient coronary angiogram (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.95; P < 0.001) and revascularization (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70–0.76; P < 0.001) were lower in group 2 compared with group 1. Following multivariable logistic regression analyses, the OR of in‐hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of inpatient death and reinfarction; OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90–1.04; P = 0.44), all‐cause mortality (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88–1.04; P = 0.31), reinfarction (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.17; P = 0.78), and major bleeding (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90–1.11; P = 0.98) were similar across groups. Lower adjusted risk of inpatient mortality (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46–0.98; P = 0.04) but similar risk of bleeding (OR,1.07; CI, 0.79–1.44; P = 0.68) and reinfarction (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.81–1.57; P = 0.47) were observed in group 2 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention compared with those managed medically.

Conclusions

In this national cohort, patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction with prior CABG had a higher risk profile, but similar risk‐adjusted in‐hospital adverse outcomes compared with patients without prior CABG. Patients with prior CABG who received percutaneous coronary intervention had lower in‐hospital mortality compared with those who received medical management.

### How detrimental is reexploration for bleeding after cardiac surgery? [^1161UGfU]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the risk factors and impact of reexploration for bleeding in a large modern cardiac surgical cohort.

Methods

At a tertiary referral center, baseline, index procedural, reexploration, outcome, and readmission characteristics of 16,793 consecutive adult cardiac surgery patients were prospectively entered into dedicated clinical databases. Correlates of reexploration for bleeding, as well as its association with outcomes and readmission, were examined with multivariable regression models.

Results

The mean patient age was 65.9 ± 12.1 years, and 11,991 patients (71.4%) patients were male. Perioperative mortality was 2.8% (458 of 16,132) in those who did not undergo reexploration for bleeding and 12.0% (81 of 661) in those who underwent reexploration for bleeding, corresponding to an odds ratio of 3.4 ± 0.5 (P < .001) over other predictors of mortality, including Euroscore II. Mortality was highest in patients who underwent reexploration after the day of index surgery (odds ratio, 6.4 ± 1.1). Hospital stay was longer in patients who underwent reexploration for bleeding (median, 12 days, vs 7 days in patients who did not undergo reexploration; P < .001), to an extent beyond any other correlate. Reexploration for bleeding also was independently associated with new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency, intensive care unit readmission, and wound infection. Risk factors for reexploration for bleeding were tricuspid valve repair, on-pump versus off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, emergency status, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration, low body surface area, and lowest CPB hematocrit of < 24%.

Conclusions

Reexploration for bleeding is a lethal and morbid complication of cardiac surgery, with a detrimental effect that surpasses that of any other known potentially modifiable risk factor. All efforts should be made to minimize the incidence and burden of reexploration for bleeding, including further research on transfusion management during CPB.

### Innovative strategies in coagulation management for cardiothoracic surgery: a narrative review of pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches [^114bUVU6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact of coagulation management on postoperative outcomes

Heavy bleeding after cardiac surgery leads to increased morbidity and mortality, which is related to critical injuries to the organ system due to transfusion and hyperperfusion. Preexisting inherited (deficiency in coagulation pathways or platelets) or preoperatively acquired (DIC or hepatic or renal failure) potential defects affect the hemostatic system and can influence bleeding postcardiac surgery. Activated extrinsic and intrinsic pathways can lead to increased fibrinolytic activity and thrombin generation. Hyperresponders to pharmacological agents (NSAIDs and aspirin) can cause heavy bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma (FPP), cryoprecipitate, or factor concentrates are used in the replenishment of coagulation factors to prevent excessive bleeding. Coagulopathy due to massive transfusion and uncontrolled bleeding results in defects in clot firmness and decreased clot stability. For the treatment of coagulation factor-mediated bleeding in cardiac surgery, the use of prothrombin complex concentrators (PCCs) has increased steadily. The number of postoperative transfusions of RBCs has decreased with the use of PCC. Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery can result from microembolization, neurohormonal activation, oxidative stress, exogenous and endogenous toxins, inflammatory factors, and ischemia‒reperfusion injury. A postoperative strategy to prevent AKI after cardiac surgery is to maintain a hemoglobin level > 8 g/dl. Preprocedure management for coagulopathies includes short-term discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. For high-risk surgeries such as cardiothoracic surgery, direct oral anticoagulants are used. Intraprocedure management includes heparin management and protamine reversal, tranexamic acid usage, and standard laboratory testing. Point-of-care (POC) testing is becoming important in the management of coagulopathies. To reduce the incidence of postoperative complications and long-term mortality in cardiac surgery, avoiding blood transfusion may prove beneficial. Postoperative cell salvage has decreased the length of hospital stay, risk of infection, and mortality rate. Postoperative interventions to manage coagulopathies include thromboelastography (TEG®) and recombinant factor VII A administration. Aprotinin has proven to be safe in decreasing postoperative blood drainage and transfusion requirements during CABG. Nonpharmacological blood-saving strategies such as intraoperative hemodilution, autologous blood transfusions, and ECC blood retransfusions have been increasingly used in recent years.

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114K9Uve]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The primary safety outcome was the incidence of major bleeding. Secondary outcomes were all cause mortality and myocardial infarction. These outcomes were binary and defined according to the definitions of the study authors (table 1 and supplementary table 1). We collected data on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, heart failure, minor bleeding, red blood cell transfusion, and admission to hospital owing to a cardiovascular cause; however, because these data were sparse, we did not report them in our study.

Risk of bias and certainty assessment

We assessed the risk of bias in included studies by using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for randomised trials 2.0for each outcome. We graded the certainty of direct and network evidence by using the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) for network meta-analysis.

Statistical analyses

We performed a frequentist network meta-analysis of aggregate data to obtain network estimates for the aforementioned outcomes of interest. The model framework used random effects to allow for apparent heterogeneity among studies in treatment comparison effects. We conducted a pairwise meta-analysis to generate direct estimates for outcomes by using a random effects model. Transitivity assumption, the distribution of patient and study characteristics that modify treatment effects (effect modifiers) across treatment comparisons, was explored to assess whether these characteristics were sufficiently similar between comparisons. Additionally, we evaluated incoherence assumption (the statistical disagreement between direct and indirect evidence in a closed loop) locally using a loop specific approach, and globally using a design by treatment interaction model. We used surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA)to rank the intervention's hierarchy in the network meta-analysis and then we estimated mean ranks. We used the comparison adjusted funnel plot to explore the potential for publication bias.

We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the model for the primary outcomes. We visually compared the results of the base case analysis with those of the per graft and in-trial data (to exclude the legacy effect of drug interventions) analyses, and excluding trials with off pump coronary artery bypass graft only. We performed an "all missing failure" analysis to explore the impact of missing data; this analysis assumed that all missing patients had a negative event. All outcomes of interest were binary and the relative treatment effects were reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. All analyses were done in Stata version 14 using the network command.

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related risk on prasugrel

Prasugrel is the third generation oral thienopyridine with faster onset and a more consistent irreversible platelet P2Y 12 blockade than the second-generation oral thienopyridine clopidogrel. This pharmacodynamic advantage over clopidogrel translated into a 19% relative risk reduction in ischaemic events in ACS patients undergoing PCI at the expense of increased major and fatal bleeding. Prasugrel (60-mg loading dose, 10-mg daily dose) in addition to aspirin is recommended over clopidogrel in P2Y 12 inhibitor-naïve ACS patients undergoing PCI with no history of prior stroke/TIA and in whom coronary anatomy is known. A lower maintenance dose of 5 mg is recommended in patients < 60 kg or > 75 years. In the TRITON-TIMI 38 study, a total of 368 (2.7%) ACS patients received at least one dose of study medication and subsequently underwent CABG surgery out of a total of 13 608 patients. Despite an increase in observed TIMI major bleeding (OR: 4.73, CI: 1.9–11.8), platelet transfusion and surgical re-exploration for bleeding, prasugrel was associated with a lower rate of death after CABG compared with clopidogrel (2.3 vs. 8.7%; OR ad 0.26; P = 0.025). More than 60% of patients received the last dose of study medication 5 or more days prior to CABG surgery, with the imbalance in the number of deaths attributable to patients who received last dose of study medication 4 or more days prior to surgery. It is recommended to discontinue prasugrel 7 days prior to CABG surgery, but it is also recognized that the level of platelet inhibition during prasugrel maintenance therapy tends to be less and more variable than in the days following a loading dose, raising the question as to whether platelet function testing may be useful under some circumstances to guide timing of cessation prior to surgery.

### Continuous postoperative pericardial flushing reduces postoperative bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting: a randomized trial [^115aEH3P]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged or excessive bleeding after cardiac surgery can lead to a broad spectrum of secondary complications. One of the underlying causes is incomplete wound drainage, with subsequent accumulation of blood and clots in the pericardium. We developed the continuous postoperative pericardial flushing (CPPF) therapy to improve wound drainage and reduce postoperative blood loss and bleeding-related complications after cardiac surgery. This study compared CPPF to standard care in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

This is a single center, open label, randomized trial that enrolled patients at the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The study was registered at the 'Netherlands Trial Register', study identifier NTR5200 [1]. Adults undergoing CABG were randomly assigned to receive CPPF therapy or standard care, participants and investigators were not masked to group assignment. The primary end point was postoperative blood loss in the first 12-hours after surgery.

Findings

Between the January 15, 2014 and the March 13, 2017, 169 patients were enrolled and assigned to CPPF therapy (study group; n = 83) or standard care (control group; n = 86). CPPF reduced postoperative blood loss when compared to standard care (median differences -385 ml, reduction 76% p = ≤ 0.001), with the remark that these results are overestimated due to a measurement error in part of the study group. None of patients in the study group required reoperation for non-surgical bleeding versus 3 (4%, 95% CI -0.4% to 7.0%) in the control group. None of the patients in the study group suffered from cardiac tamponade, versus 3 (4%, 95% CI -0,4% to 7.0%) in the control group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €116.513 (95% bootstrap CI €-882.068 to €+897.278).

Interpretation

The use of CPPF therapy after CABG seems to reduce bleeding and bleeding related complications. With comparable costs and no improvement in Qualty of Life (QoL), cost consideration for the implementation of CPPF is not relevant. None of the patients in the study group required re-interventions for non-surgical bleeding or acute cardiac tamponade, which underlines the proof of concept of this novel therapy.

Funding

This study was funded by ZonMw, the Netherlands organization for health research and development (project 837001405).

### Antithrombotic treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115nuNkn]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The clinical benefits of adding a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin originate from the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial. Participants with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes who were allocated to receive aspirin plus clopidogrel experienced a major reduction in the composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke, and a range of related ischaemic events. However, there was a tradeoff of increased risk of bleeding, and most of the major bleeding events were gastrointestinal and arterial access site bleeds. In our analysis, although the occurrence of major bleeding with aspirin plus ticagrelor was not statistically significant compared with aspirin alone, the network estimates showed an odds ratio of 1.93, and wide 95% confidence intervals (0.30 to 12.4) compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel (0.85, 0.30 to 2.37). The lack of different doses of clopidogrel precludes further analysis. Notably, the combination of aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily or rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily alone did not reduce saphenous vein graft failure compared with aspirin alone in the COMPASS (Cardiovascular OutcoMes for People Using Anticoagulation StrategieS) coronary artery bypass graft trial. However, the combination of aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily was associated with similar reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, and this was consistent with the findings of the main COMPASS trial. Therefore, because major bleeding has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, the risk of bleeding should be carefully balanced against the benefits when planning long term (> 12 months) dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

### Prasugrel hydrochloride (effient) [^116cVWo2]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNING: BLEEDING RISK

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Effient can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding (5.1, 5.2, 6.1).
Do not use Effient in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke (4.1, 4.2).
In patients ≥ 75 years of age, Effient is generally not recommended, except in high-risk patients (diabetes or prior myocardial infarction [MI]), where its use may be considered (8.5).
Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Effient at least 7 days prior to any surgery (5.2).
Additional risk factors for bleeding include: body weight < 60 kg, propensity to bleed, concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (5.1).
Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone invasive or surgical procedures (5.1).
If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Effient. Stopping Effient increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (5.3).

Etiology for increased morbidity in patients (2% to 8%) undergoing reoperation for bleeding after cardiac surgery is unclear. Recent work suggests that it may be related to red-cell transfusion, but what role does reoperation itself play? We sought to determine prevalence of and risk factors for reoperation for bleeding, separate the effect of reoperation from that of transfusion on hospital mortality and major morbidity, and identify the source of bleeding.

Methods

From January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2010, 18,891 primary and repeat coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, or combined operations were performed. Risk factors for reoperation were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Hospital mortality and major morbidity were compared in propensity-matched patients requiring reoperation and not. Medical records from 2005 to 2010 were reviewed to determine bleeding source.

Results

A total of 566 patients (3.0%) underwent reoperation for bleeding, with considerable variability over time. Risk factors included older age, higher acuity, greater comorbidity, aortic valve surgery, longer myocardial ischemic and cardiopulmonary bypass durations, and surgeon. Mortality was higher for propensity-matched patients requiring reoperation; 8.5% (68% confidence interval [CI] 7.3% to 9.9%) versus 1.8% (CI 1.2% to 2.5%). Both greater transfusion and reoperation were independently associated with increased risk of mortality and major morbidity. At reoperation, technical factors (74%), coagulopathy (13%), both (10%), or other (3.3%) causes were responsible for bleeding.

Conclusions

Transfusion and reoperation for bleeding both contribute to postoperative mortality and morbidity. Technical reasons are at the root of most bleeding, emphasizing a major focus for process improvement to minimize need for reoperation and blood use.

### Cardiac surgical bleeding, transfusion, and quality metrics: joint consensus statement by the enhanced recovery after surgery cardiac society and society for the advancement of patient blood management [^112zs3Z7]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive perioperative bleeding is associated with major complications in cardiac surgery, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and cost.

Methods

An international expert panel was convened to develop consensus statements on the control of bleeding and management of transfusion and to suggest key quality metrics for cardiac surgical bleeding. The panel reviewed relevant literature from the previous 10 years and used a modified RAND Delphi methodology to achieve consensus.

Results

The panel developed 30 consensus statements in 8 categories, including prioritizing control of bleeding, prechest closure checklists, and the need for additional quality indicators beyond reexploration rate, such as time to reexploration. Consensus was also reached on the need for a universal definition of excessive bleeding, the use of antifibrinolytics, optimal cessation of antithrombotic agents, and preoperative risk scoring based on patient and procedural factors to identify those at greatest risk of excessive bleeding. Furthermore, an objective bleeding scale is needed based on the volume and rapidity of blood loss accompanied by viscoelastic management algorithms and standardized, patient-centered blood management strategies reflecting an interdisciplinary approach to quality improvement.

Conclusions

Prioritizing the timely control and management of bleeding is essential to improving patient outcomes in cardiac surgery. To this end, a cardiac surgical bleeding quality metric that is more comprehensive than reexploration rate alone is needed. Similarly, interdisciplinary quality initiatives that seek to implement enhanced quality indicators will likely lead to improved patient care and outcomes.

### Adverse events in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) trials: a systematic review and analysis [^111WkPvY]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To quantify the incidence of major adverse events (AEs) occurring in hospital or within 30 days after surgery in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and to identify risk factors for these AEs.

Methods

Systematic review and analysis of studies published in English since 1990. Studies of isolated standard CABG reporting postoperative incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, or death in hospital or within 30 days were eligible for inclusion. Incidence of these events was calculated overall and for selected patient groups defined by all elective CABG versus mixed (some non-elective); mean ejection fraction ≤ 50% versus > 50%; mean age ≤ 60 versus > 60 years; primary CABG versus some reoperations; randomised controlled trials versus cohort studies; and single centre versus multicentre studies. Odds ratios of selected AEs were computed according to group risk factors.

Results

176 studies (205 717 patients) met all inclusion criteria. The average incidence of major AEs occurring in-hospital was death (1.7%); non-fatal MI (2.4%); non-fatal stroke (1.3%); gastrointestinal bleeding (1.5%); and renal failure (0.8%). Thirty day mortality was 2.1%. Meta-analyses show that age > 70, female sex, low ejection fraction, history of stroke, MI, or heart surgery, and presence of diabetes or hypertension are all associated with increased 30 day mortality after CABG.

Conclusion

The incidence of major AEs in patients after CABG varies widely across studies and patient populations, and this heterogeneity must be controlled when using the literature to benchmark safety.

Bleeding after cardiac surgery is a common and serious complication leading to transfusion of multiple blood products and resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Despite the publication of numerous guidelines and consensus statements for patient blood management in cardiac surgery, research has revealed that adherence to these guidelines is poor, and as a result, a significant variability in patient transfusion practices among practitioners still remains. In addition, although utilization of point of care coagulation monitors and the use of novel therapeutic strategies for perioperative hemostasis, such as the use of coagulation factor concentrates, has increased significantly over the last decade, they are still not widely available in every institution. Therefore, despite continuous efforts, blood transfusion in cardiac surgery has declined only modestly over the last decade, remaining at 50% or greater in high-risk patients. Given these limitations and in response to new regulatory and legislature requirements, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists has formed the Blood Conservation in Cardiac Surgery Working Group in order to organize, summarize, and disseminate the available best-practice knowledge in patient blood management in cardiac surgery. The current publication includes the summary statements and algorithms designed by the working group, after collection and review of the existing guidelines, consensus statements, and recommendations for patient blood management practices in cardiac surgery patients. The overall goal is creating a dynamic resource of easily accessible educational material that will help to increase and improve compliance with the existing evidence-based best practices of patient blood management by cardiac surgery care teams.

### Clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients with and without prior coronary artery bypass grafting [^117KddZm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that ≈1 in 11 patients who present with NSTEMI ACS have a history of prior CABG. The odds of receiving an invasive coronary angiogram and revascularization remained low in the patients with prior CABG even after adjustment of baseline differences. Once differences in baseline characteristics were adjusted for, we report no significant differences in in‐hospital MACE, reinfarction, mortality, and major bleeding between patients with prior CABG and patients without prior CABG who presented with NSTEMI ACS. Our analysis suggests lower odds of in‐hospital mortality in patients with prior CABG who were managed with PCI compared with those managed medically, without increased odds of major bleeding. This may suggest that an invasive approach may be associated with better outcomes in patients with prior CABG, although adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^1163kPZQ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) — shorter preoperative discontinuation intervals of clopidogrel or ticagrelor are associated with higher bleeding. In a cohort of 626 DAPT patients undergoing isolated on-pump CABG, clopidogrel withdrawn less than 5 days increased transfusion needs (71.2% vs 41.3%), multiple transfusions (14.4% vs 3.7%), and mediastinal chest tube drainage of 1000 mL or more in the first 12 hours (26.4% vs 12.6%), with a nonsignificant trend to more reexploration (10.4% vs 5.4%; p = 0.051) compared with aspirin only; discontinuation greater than 5 days had lower major bleeding (unadjusted OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.04–2.79; p = 0.033). For ticagrelor, PLATO subgroup analyses suggested discontinuation 2 to 3 days preoperatively, and subsequent studies showed that at least 3 days of washout minimizes bleeding risk without apparently increasing thrombotic events. Ticagrelor withdrawn less than 72 hours preoperatively was associated with higher transfusion needs (72.1% vs 41.3%), multiple allogeneic transfusions (14.8% vs 3.7%), and higher in-hospital mortality (4.9% vs 1.0%) versus aspirin only; those withdrawn greater than 72 hours showed no differences versus aspirin only. In 2244 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) DAPT patients undergoing CABG, discontinuing ticagrelor less than 3 days versus 3 to 5 days increased major bleeding (unadjusted OR, 5.17; 95% CI, 2.89–9.27; P < .0001), and mortality was higher with major bleeding (9.9% vs 0.7%; unadjusted OR, 14.78; 95% CI, 7.82–27.93; P < .0001), while postoperative thrombotic events before discharge were similar between ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups (2.9% vs 2.8%). A 2019 study reported that ticagrelor exposure within 72 hours before surgery was associated with increased major bleeding, defined as intraoperative transfusion of more than 1000 mL of red blood cells (RBCs), postoperative bleeding volume of more than 1000 mL, or surgical reexploration due to bleeding.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^1137GfY3]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — preoperative antiplatelet management states that in order to reduce bleeding in patients requiring elective cardiac surgery, ticagrelor should be withdrawn preoperatively for a minimum of 3 days, clopidogrel for 5 days, and prasugrel for 7 days (Class I, Level B-NR). It is reasonable to discontinue low-intensity antiplatelet drugs (eg, aspirin) only in purely elective patients without acute coronary syndromes before operation with the expectation that blood transfusion will be reduced. Laboratory and/or point-of-care measurement of antiplatelet drug effect in patients having received recent dual-antiplatelet therapy can be useful to assess bleeding risk or to guide timing of surgery. The addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin therapy, if indicated, in the immediate postoperative care of coronary artery bypass grafting patients prior to ensuring surgical hemostasis may increase bleeding and the need for surgical re-exploration for bleeding (Class III: No Benefit, Level C-LD).

### Association of acute venous thromboembolism with in-hospital outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^114vGxBX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a feared complication in patients undergoing surgical procedures and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs. 1, 2, 3 As a result, pharmacological prophylaxis against VTE is strongly recommended in the perioperative period for most surgical patients, and is a benchmark used to evaluate quality of care. 4, 5

However, for patients undergoing cardiac surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), VTE prophylaxis is controversial. The incidence of perioperative VTE in CABG patients reported in the literature is low (≈1%). 6, 7, 8 Unfortunately, a majority of the current evidence regarding the incidence and outcomes of VTE, and optimal strategies for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing CABG, is from studies with limited sample sizes, and is of moderate‐to‐low quality as acknowledged by guidelines. 9, 10 Moreover, current evidence regarding benefit of prophylaxis versus bleeding complications is inconclusive. 11

Given the volume of patients undergoing CABG, and the significant adverse outcomes associated with perioperative VTE, we believe this issue needs further attention, and that a more robust understanding of the impact of VTE in the perioperative CABG period may help guide clinical management. In this study, we used a large national inpatient database to investigate the incidence and outcomes of perioperative VTE in patients undergoing CABG.

Temporal Changes

In a temporal analysis to assess PCI during the study period, we observed an increase in PCI over time in group 1 (no prior CABG) (P for trend < 0.001) and Group 2 (prior CABG) cohorts (P for trend < 0.001) (Figure 3).

Clinical Outcomes in Patients Without Prior CABG Versus Patients With Prior CABG

The prevalence of in‐hospital all‐cause mortality (5.4% versus 5.1; P = 0.08), major bleeding (1.58% versus 1.7%; P = 0.17), MACE (6% in each group; P = 0.95) were similar in both cohorts, but reinfarction was higher in patients with prior CABG (1.1% versus 0.9%; P < 0.001). After adjustment for differences in baseline clinical and treatment characteristics, odds of all‐cause mortality (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88–1.04; P = 0.31), reinfarction (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.17; P = 0.78), major bleeding (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90–1.11; P = 0.98), and inpatient MACE (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90–1.04; P = 0.44) were similar between the 2 groups (Table 3).

### Practical issues in clinical scenarios involving CKD patients requiring antithrombotic therapy in light of the 2017 ESC guideline recommendations [^1176nL4F]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Critical analysis of new recommendations for the management of bleeding

Guidance on the management of patients who develop bleeding complications while on DAPT is supplied by the ESC Update, but it is not based on data from RCTs and refers to a prior Expert Consensus. The key decision to be taken is whether to withhold or continue DAPT. Additionally, the type, dose, and duration of DAPT should be reassessed. These decisions should be individualized based on the relative risks of thrombosis and continuous or recurrent bleeding. A flow chart according to the severity of bleeding is provided. Guidance for the management of bleeding is especially relevant for CKD patients, mainly for those with more severe CKD. As an example, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in hemodialysis patients was estimated at 6–33 episodes per 100 person-years, with an overall 30-day mortality of 12%.

Several standardized bleeding definitions from clinical trials rank the severity of bleeding in three categories (TIMI, GUSTO) or five types (BARC), one of the five being lethal bleeding (Table 4). The ESC Update proposes five categories, encompassing trivial, mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening bleeding (Table 4). Mild bleeding requires medical attention, while in moderate and severe bleeding the patient is hemodynamically stable and not rapidly evolving but hemoglobin levels have fallen to > 3 g/dL or > 5 g/dL, respectively. Life-threatening bleeding is severe, active, and puts the patient's life immediately at risk. Each category is associated with recommendations regarding DAPT, OAT, and general measures.

### Prasugrel hydrochloride (effient) [^116kWoez]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNING: BLEEDING RISK

Effient can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Do not use Effient in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].
In patients ≥ 75 years of age, Effient is generally not recommended, because of the increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding and uncertain benefit, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or a history of prior myocardial infarction [MI]) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Effient at least 7 days prior to any surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Additional risk factors for bleeding include: body weight < 60 kg, propensity to bleed, concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., warfarin, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures in the setting of Effient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Effient. Discontinuing Effient, particularly in the first few weeks after acute coronary syndrome, increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular (CV) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Balancing the benefit and risk of oral antiplatelet agents in coronary artery bypass surgery [^111j428c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Concern about possible hemorrhagic complications arising from use of oral antiplatelet agents in immediate proximity to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery leads many clinicians to avoid or discontinue these agents preoperatively. Recent evidence suggests that aspirin and clopidogrel can be used with relative safety in the preoperative period; dual antiplatelet therapy in the 5 days immediately preceding CABG surgery results in a moderate and variable increase in the risk of procedural bleeding. This modest hemorrhagic risk may be acceptable, given the clinical benefits of sustained antiplatelet therapy in preventing graft occlusion and ischemic complications pre- and post-CABG. Because the bleeding risk with aspirin is dose dependent, use of a low dose is preferred post-CABG.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^112uN8pn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Management

Patients were managed in accordance with local practice guidelines, and all procedures were performed using standard bypass techniques (Data S1). The choice between on‐pump and off‐pump CABG was at the discretion of the principal surgeon. Whenever possible, the internal thoracic artery was preferentially used for revascularization of the left anterior descending artery. The perioperative antiplatelet therapy was also left to the individual surgeon's evaluation and decision, though clopidogrel should have been discontinued at least 5 days before surgery if clinically feasible. Local guidelines and regulatory authorities do not specify rules or restrictions for the selection of patients who receive post‐CABG DAPT administration. Routinely, aspirin was started within 24 hours (ideally within 6 hours) after CABG in a daily dose of 100 mg and recommended to continue indefinitely. For patients who received DAPT, 75 mg of clopidogrel was added to 100 mg of aspirin daily without a loading dose, preferably within 48 hours after CABG, but when clinical stability was ensured and chest tube output was < 30 mL/hour for at least 2 hours. The duration of DAPT was determined by the treating physician, with the treatment typically maintained for a minimum of 1 month. Additional secondary prevention therapies (eg, statins, β‐blockers, or renin‐angiotensin system blockade) were recommended for all patients, if indicated, following clinical guidelines.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the first occurrence of MACCE, defined as a composite of all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization within 6 months after CABG. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary outcome and major bleeding, which was defined as a composite of in‐hospital reoperation because of bleeding and hospitalization for bleeding after discharge. All outcome measures were prespecified, rigorously verified, and adjudicated by independent clinicians. Detailed definitions of the outcomes are provided in Data S1.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^111cJtWn]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Overview of the net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the combination of ASA with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, namely clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor (Table 1), has become the cornerstone of antiplatelet treatment before, during and after PCI, with significant reductions of stent thrombosis and ischaemic events compared with either aspirin alone or aspirin and anticoagulant drugs. – This combination increases the risk of major bleeding to an extent that appears to be associated with the degree of P2Y 12 inhibition achieved and all Phase 3 studies of P2Y 12 inhibitors vs. placebo or vs. clopidogrel, have excluded patients at high risk of bleeding. In the absence of contraindications, DAPT is currently recommended for 9–12 months following ACS based on evidence of enduring benefit over this time course in studies of clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. – There is no clear evidence for defining the optimal duration of DAPT after elective stenting. Indeed, none of the randomized trials were powered for ischaemic endpoints; all were open label and the time from stenting to randomization varied. – Therefore, weighing the quality of available evidence is difficult and these inferences need to be confirmed by ongoing mega trials. Usually, it is recommended to continue DAPT for 1 month after BMS implantation in stable angina,6–12 months after DES implantation in all patients, and up to one 1 year in all patients after ACS, irrespective of revascularisation strategy.

Older adults undergoing coronary revascularization — population definition, risk, and decision-making include that most clinical trials have defined older patients as those ≥ 75 years of age; older patients form a vulnerable subset with more complex presentations, higher prevalence of comorbidities, and increased risk of bleeding complications and stroke after PCI; older patients constitute a growing, high-risk population with increased rates of adverse events; although older patients benefit from revascularization to the same, if not greater, extent as younger patients, the optimal strategy should be chosen according to patient-centered goals of care; subgroup analyses indicate relative outcomes after PCI and CABG are comparable in older patients, with CABG better at achieving complete revascularization and PCI preferred for frail patients at higher risk of periprocedural events; careful consideration of risks and benefits using a Heart Team, in accordance with patient preferences while accounting for frailty and cognitive status, is vital to decisions about the revascularization plan.

### Long-term outcome of reexploration for bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting [^1124gTrw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine the influence of reexploration for bleeding and blood product requirement after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on long-term mortality.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A single-center institution.

Participants

All patients who underwent CABG between January 1998 and December 2019 were included.

Interventions

The parameters were analyzed to assess the association between reexploration for bleeding and long-term mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality up to the end of follow-up (June 1, 2021). The secondary endpoints were 30-day mortality, duration of admission, blood product transfusion, postoperative use of an intra-aortic balloon pump, deep sternal wound infection, myocardial infarction, and neurologic complications. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between reexploration and blood product use and all-cause mortality. Median follow-up was 9.7 years (IQR 5.1–14.6). In total, 576 out of 21,346 (2.7%) patients were reexplored for bleeding. Thirty-day mortality was 6.2% v 1.6% for the reexplored versus not reexplored patients. Reexploration for bleeding was not significantly correlated with long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.029; p = 0.068). On the other hand, blood product transfusion (HR = 1.135; p < 0.001), and in particular, packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion (HR = 1.139; p < 0.001), was significantly associated with higher long-term mortality. After multivariate Cox regression using ≥ 5 pRBC transfused as a cut-off point, reexploration for bleeding was not significantly associated with long-term mortality (HR 0.982; p = 0.813). Receiving ≥ 5 pRBCs was significantly associated with higher long-term mortality (HR 1.249; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Reexploration for bleeding was significantly associated with higher 30-day mortality but not with long-term mortality. Poorer long-term mortality was attributed to patient characteristics and higher use of postoperative blood products.

### Prediction and management of bleeding in cardiac surgery [^113GhxpP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Excessive bleeding after cardiac surgery can result in increased morbidity and mortality related to transfusion- and hypoperfusion-related injuries to critical organ systems. Our objective was to review mechanisms that result in bleeding after cardiac surgery as well as current and emerging interventions to reduce bleeding and transfusion. We discovered that of point-of-care (POC) tests of hemostatic function can facilitate the optimal management of excessive bleeding and reduce transfusion by facilitating administration of specific pharmacologic or transfusion-based therapy and by allowing physicians to better differentiate between microvascular bleeding and surgical bleeding. Emerging interventions like recombinant FVIIa have the potential to reduce bleeding and transfusion-related sequelae and may be life-saving; however, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm safety before they can be used as either first-line therapies for bleeding or bleeding prophylaxis. In conclusion, careful investigation of the role of new interventions is essential as the ability to reduce use of blood products, to decrease operative time and/or re-exploration rates has important implications for overall patient safety and health care costs.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding complications in patients treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel: a nationwide study [^113Ph3Nw]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Definitions

Major bleeding was defined according to four published definitions: Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 4, CABG-related bleeding (bleeding resulting in death, or reoperation due to bleeding, or intracranial haemorrhage, or transfusion of 5 or more units of RBCs over 48 h, or chest tube drainage in excess of 2000 mL over 24 h), Blood Conservation Using Antifibrinolytics in a Randomized Trial (BART; postoperative blood loss > 1500 mL/12 h, or re-exploration due to bleeding, or RBC transfusion of 10 units or more, or death because of bleeding), PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) life-threatening bleeding (fatal bleeding, or pericardial bleeding requiring repeat surgery, or drop in haemoglobin of ≥ 50 g/L, or transfusion of 4 or more units of RBCs), and PLATO major bleeding (pericardial bleeding requiring repeat surgery, or drop in haemoglobin of ≥ 30 g/L, or transfusion of 2 or more units of RBCs).

Major bleeding is reported for all four bleeding definitions while adjusted data are reported only for the BARC-CABG definition. Bleeding volume was defined as mediastinal drainage volume. A thrombotic event was defined as ischaemic stroke with duration exceeding 24 h and verified by CT or MRI, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis evidenced during the index hospitalization. Acute surgery was defined as procedure starting within 24 h of acceptance. Urgent surgery was defined as within hospitalization for ACS.

Clinical management

Patients were treated in accordance with standard practice at the participating centres. All patients received 75 mg aspirin daily. Ticagrelor or clopidogrel was administered with a loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily for clopidogrel or 90 mg twice daily for ticagrelor. According to the current European guidelines, the platelet inhibitor should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery if clinically feasible. Fondaparinux and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were discontinued at least 12 h before non-acute surgery. Aspirin was not discontinued before surgery.

### Clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients with and without prior coronary artery bypass grafting [^113bTPNu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Settings

This analysis is based on the data derived from MINAP, a comprehensive, national clinical registry of patients hospitalized with type 1 MI in England and Wales. The MINAP data set consists of 130 variables and records information about patients with acute MI including baseline clinical characteristics, comorbid conditions, management strategies including invasive and conservative, pharmacotherapy, place of care, in‐hospital clinical outcomes, and diagnosis on discharge. Data are submitted by hospital clinical and clerical staff, and pseudorandomized records are uploaded to the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research central database. Two hundred six hospitals enter over 92 000 new cases to MINAP annually, and approximately 1.5 million patient records are currently present in this database. Institutional research and ethical board approval were not required for this study, as all data were anonymized and routinely collected as part of the national audit. Because of the sensitive nature of the data collected for this study, requests to access the data set from qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols may be sent to the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research at.

Study Design

This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients admitted with a diagnosis of NSTEMI in England and Wales between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017. The discharge diagnosis of NSTEMI was decided by treating clinicians according to presenting complaints, clinical examination, and the results of in‐hospital investigations in keeping with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Patients with missing data for prior history of CABG, mortality, and any individual patient with second or later admissions were excluded from analysis (Figure 1). This constituted a final cohort of 287 658 patients with NSTEMI, which were then categorized into 2 groups according to history of CABG: group 1, patients with no prior history of CABG; and group 2, patients with prior CABG. Clinical outcomes of interest were in‐hospital all‐cause mortality, reinfarction, major bleeding, and MACEs. MACE was defined as a composite end point of inpatient death or reinfarction. Major bleeding was defined as a composite of gastrointestinal, retroperitoneal, and intracranial hemorrhage. Patient risk assessment was performed using the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) scoring systems.

### Clopidogrel use and bleeding after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^114gGbAY]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Short-term use of clopidogrel plus aspirin among patients with acute coronary syndrome reduces ischemic events, but concerns about coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery-related bleeding limit its early use.

Methods

Using data from 4,794 consecutive CABG procedures in the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease (January 1999 to December 2003), we developed multivariable models for associations with CABG-related bleeding defined as reoperation for bleeding, red cell transfusion, and a composite of reoperation/transfusion/hematocrit drop ≥ 15%. We examined clopidogrel use ≤ 5 days versus no clopidogrel ≤ 5 days before CABG in each model. Models were adjusted for propensity for clopidogrel use ≤ 5 days.

Results

Of 4,794 CABG patients, 332 (6.9%) received clopidogrel ≤ 5 days before CABG, 127 (2.6%) had reoperation for bleeding, 3,277 (68.4%) received red cell transfusion, and 4,387 (91.5%) had the composite outcome. After adjustment, clopidogrel use ≤ 5 days was not significantly associated with reoperation (odds ratio [OR] 1.24, 95% CI 0.63–2.41) or the composite end point (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.72–2.10). Clopidogrel ≤ 5 days was modestly associated with red cell transfusion (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04–1.89) but more weakly than other factors, including which surgeon performed the procedure.

Conclusion

Clopidogrel administration ≤ 5 days before CABG was not significantly associated with reoperation for bleeding or a bleeding composite, and only weakly with red cell transfusion after surgery. The impact of withholding clopidogrel acutely in those for whom clopidogrel has proven benefits and the impact of delaying CABG to prevent bleeding among patients treated with clopidogrel should be viewed in the context of other stronger determinants of bleeding.

### Bleeding in acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions: position paper by the working group on thrombosis of the European Society of Cardiology [^116D4bwa]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Bleeding has recently emerged as an important outcome in the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), which is relatively frequent compared with ischaemic outcomes and has important implications in terms of prognosis, outcomes, and costs. In particular, there is evidence that patients experiencing major bleeding in the acute phase are at higher risk for death in the following months, although the causal nature of this relation is still debated. This position paper aims to summarize current knowledge regarding the epidemiology of bleeding in ACS and percutaneous coronary intervention, including measurement and definitions of bleeding, with emphasis on the recent consensus Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definitions. It also provides an European perspective on management strategies to minimize the rate, extent, and consequences of bleeding. Finally, the research implications of bleeding (measuring and reporting bleeding in trials, the importance of bleeding as an outcome measure, and bleeding as a subject for future research) are also discussed.

CABG surgery — ASA (aspirin) perioperative use evidence (ATACAS and cohort): In a > 8,000-patient cohort study, ASA use within 5 days prior to CABG was associated with a reduction in overall mortality without a concomitant increased risk for re-operation for pericardial bleeding or need for blood transfusion. In the randomized, placebo-controlled ATACAS trial, patients received ASA 100 mg starting 1 to 2 hours pre-CABG with resumption within 24 hours post-CABG, and after 30 days there was no significant effect on myocardial infarction (13.8% vs 15.8%; RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.71–1.07) or re-operation related to bleeding (1.8% vs 2.1%; RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.47–1.6).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) perioperative management of oral P2Y12 inhibitors specifies interruption intervals and postoperative resumption. For clopidogrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For prasugrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 7 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 7 d may be reasonable. For ticagrelor, elective CABG: interrupt for 3–5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For all patients, oral P2Y12 inhibitor should be resumed after surgery when bleeding risk not excessive (typically 24–72 hours).

### Hemorrhage after coronary artery bypass graft procedures [^114tMU4v]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify risk factors for excessive bleeding after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures and to quantify the outcomes related to this complication.

Design

We conducted a case-control study to identify risk factors for hemorrhage following CABG surgery and a historical cohort study to quantify outcomes of hemorrhage.

Setting

The cardiothoracic surgery service of a university hospital.

Results

Factors associated with excessive blood loss were recent catheterization (odds ratio [OR] = 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 0.21 to 0.91); age older than 65 years (OR = 1.94; CI95, 0.96 to 3.93); bypass time of 150 minutes or more (OR = 2.91; CI95, 1.09 to 7.81); and postoperative platelet count of 160,000/mm3 or less (OR = 2.36; CI95, 1.06 to 5.22). The attributable cost of a postoperative hemorrhage was $3,866 (P = 0.0002) overall, $9,912 (P = 0.0001) for patients who required reoperation, and $3,316 (P = 0.03) for those treated medically. The median attributable postoperative length of stay was 1 day longer for cases than for controls (P = 0.011). Postoperatively, patients who hemorrhaged received significantly larger volumes of packed red blood cells (P < .0001), fresh frozen plasma (P < .0001), platelets (P < .0001), plasminate (P = 0.007), protamine sulfate (P < .0001), desmopressin acetate (P < .0001), and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (P < .0001) than did controls.

Conclusions

Age, duration of bypass, and postoperative platelet count were associated with excessive bleeding. Hemorrhage after CABG surgery significantly increased the length of stay and cost of care.

### Perioperative considerations in management of the severely bleeding coagulopathic patient [^112Nf2R1]. Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of Severe Bleeding

The most severe complication of perioperative hemorrhage is hypovolemic shock. Classification of acute hypovolemia as defined by the American College of Surgeons (Chicago, Illinois) includes four levels corresponding to less than 15% (class I), 15 to 30% (class II), 31 to 40% (class III), and greater than 40% (class IV) blood volume loss. Shock occurs when the blood loss creates oxygen debt, end-organ dysfunction, and ultimately death if not effectively treated in a timely fashion.

Multiple tools to standardize bleeding assessment have been reported. As examples, the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) defines major bleeding as the need for four or more erythrocyte units within 24 h in the first postoperative week, whereas the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Carrboro, North Carolina) defines major bleeding as more than two erythrocyte units in the same timeframe. The universal definition of perioperative bleeding, which monitors nine independent events related to perioperative bleeding within a five-level classification system, has been well-validated for the prediction of bleeding complications after adult cardiac surgery (table 1). The same applies for the European Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Bleeding Severity Grade. The universal definition of perioperative bleeding score revealed a high predictive value for 28-day mortality of patients of the large randomized Transfusion Avoidance in Cardiac Surgery (TACS) trial.

Table 1.
Bleeding Categories According to Consensus-based Bleeding Scores in Cardiac Surgery

Although there are many definitions of severe or life-threatening bleeding, each differs in the timeframe and volume of blood products administered and whether the response activates a massive transfusion protocol. The need for consensus-based definitions is evident from the variable quantification of bleeding and inconsistent timing of when scoring occurs. This challenge was the topic of a recent consensus conference that recommended primary outcomes for clinical trials evaluating hemostatic blood products and agents in patients with bleeding. Summary recommendations addressed multiple scenarios including trauma, cardiac surgery/mechanical circulatory support, and inherited bleeding disorders.

### Bleeding avoidance strategies in percutaneous coronary intervention [^113ptAWA]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

For many years, bleeding has been perceived as an unavoidable consequence of strategies aimed at reducing thrombotic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the paradigm has now shifted towards bleeding being recognized as a prognostically unfavourable event to the same extent as having a new or recurrent ischaemic or thrombotic complication. As such, in parallel with progress in device and drug development for PCI, there is clinical interest in developing strategies that maximize not only the efficacy but also the safety (for example, by minimizing bleeding) of any antithrombotic treatment or procedural aspect before, during or after PCI. In this Review, we discuss contemporary data and aspects of bleeding avoidance strategies in PCI, including risk stratification, timing of revascularization, pretreatment with antiplatelet agents, selection of vascular access, choice of coronary stents and antithrombotic treatment regimens.

### Bleeding risk stratification in coronary artery surgery: the should-not-bleed score [^114nQyGc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

When it comes to the haemostatic management, the focus of many researchers, including our research team was to identify the patients at high risk of bleeding who might benefit from more aggressive and more targeted haemostatic management. In patients considered to be at high risk of bleeding, the aim of haemostatic management is to provide targeted and efficient haemostatic treatment (mostly procoagulant blood components). The idea is to avoid transfusions whenever possible and to reduce transfusion requirements with targeted, efficient transfusions.

However, high prevalence (up to 92.8%) of transfusions in patients undergoing isolated CABG, considered as lowest risk cardio-surgical procedure, raises the question to which extent those transfusions were unnecessary. Goodnough et al. investigated costs of blood support given to patients undergoing CABG along with costs of blood components whose transfusions were identified to be unnecessary. The number of blood components transfused unnecessarily represented up to 43% of all blood units transfused. The percentage of total blood costs that was incurred by inappropriate transfusions among institutions was found to be as high as 44%. Identification of patients at high risk of bleeding and shifting their haemostatic management towards more efficient and targeted transfusion treatment presents, however, only one way to reduce unnecessary transfusions.

The other way to reduce the clinical and economic burden of unnecessary transfusions is to completely avoid transfusions in patients undergoing low risk procedures such as CABG, particularly, if the patients are considered to be at low risk of bleeding at the same time. Recently, we changed our paradigm of haemostatic management and shifted our focus towards identification of low bleeding risk patients undergoing low risk procedures (i.e. CABG). Herein we present our institutional bleeding risk score, based on our own data and own, recently published, peer reviewed results. The score was embedded into a Windows platform application with user friendly interface and was named "SHOULD-NOT-BLEED" score. The main goal of this score is to identify a group of patients with estimated low risk of bleeding undergoing low risk cardio-surgical procedure such as CABG, for whom transfusion treatment might be considered unnecessary.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have the application/software developed for the bleeding risk scoring.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^111onK7Y]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Postoperative management of antiplatelet therapy

Single antiplatelet therapy

Early thrombosis is the major cause of vein graft attrition during the first month after CABG, with occlusion rates of between 5 and 26% at 1 year, and ASA has been shown to improve 1-year vein graft patency. – The role of ASA in graft patency becomes substantial when initiated prior to CABG and then restarted ∼6 h after surgery. The beneficial effect of ASA on vein graft patency appears attenuated after the first year due to lack of effect on intimal hyperplasia and vein graft atherosclerosis. Although there is no evidence for an effect of ASA on long-term internal mammary artery graft patency, it should be continued indefinitely after CABG given its benefit in preventing subsequent clinical events (Table 4). Medium doses of ASA (300–325 mg daily) have not been shown to be more effective than low doses (75–160 mg daily) in preventing graft occlusion and adverse clinical events, although an indirect meta-analysis provided weak evidence that medium doses might be more effective. Inhibition of platelet function by ASA may be impaired after CABG, with or without CPB, in one-third of patients, due to reduced absorption, drug interactions, systemic inflammation, and increased platelet turnover, and these factors may increase the risk of graft occlusion early after CABG. This phenomenon is transient and may be addressed by early intravenous or rectal administration followed by oral twice-daily administration early postoperatively. In case of ASA intolerance, clopidogrel is indicated for prevention of ischaemic events.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing cardiac surgery (management of antiplatelets), ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to recognize that withdrawal of aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) before surgery might increase the risk of coronary thrombosis, whereas continuation of aspirin or clopidogrel increases the risk of bleeding.

### Impact of bleeding complications on length of stay and critical care utilization in cardiac surgery patients in england [^117CJqqL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bleeding is a significant complication in cardiac surgery and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the impact of bleeding on length of stay (LOS) and critical care utilization in a nationwide sample of cardiac surgery patients treated at English hospitals.

Methods

Retrospective, observational cohort study using linked English Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) records for a nationwide sample of patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve repair/replacement, or aortic operations from January 2010 through February 2016. The primary independent variables were in-hospital bleeding complications and reoperation for bleeding before discharge. Generalized linear models were used to quantify the adjusted mean incremental difference [MID] in post-procedure LOS and critical care days associated with bleeding complications, independent of measured baseline characteristics.

Results

The study included 7774 cardiac surgery patients (3963 CABG; 2363 valve replacement/repair; 160 aortic procedures; 1288 multiple procedures, primarily CABG+valve). Mean LOS was 10.7d, including a mean of 4.2d in critical care. Incidences of in-hospital bleeding complications and reoperation for bleeding were 6.7 and 0.3%, respectively. Patients with bleeding had longer LOS (MID: 3.1d; p < 0.0001) and spent more days in critical care (MID: 2.4d; p < 0.0001). Reoperation for bleeding was associated with larger increases in LOS (MID = 4.0d; p = 0.002) and days in critical care (MID = 3.2d; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Among English cardiac surgery patients, in-hospital bleeding complications were associated with substantial increases in healthcare utilization. Increased use of evidence-based strategies to prevent and manage bleeding may reduce the clinical and economic burden associated with bleeding complications in cardiac surgery.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^112eFxfW]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — updated recommendations from previous guidelines state that preoperative identification of high-risk patients should be performed, and all available preoperative and perioperative measures of blood conservation should be undertaken in this group as they account for the majority of blood products transfused. It is reasonable to discontinue low-intensity antiplatelet drugs (eg, aspirin) only in purely elective patients without acute coronary syndromes before operation with the expectation that blood transfusion will be reduced. Minimization of phlebotomy through a reduction in blood sampling volumes and frequencies is a reasonable means of blood conservation. The addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin therapy, if indicated, in the immediate postoperative care of coronary artery bypass grafting patients prior to ensuring surgical hemostasis may increase bleeding and the need for surgical reexploration, and is not recommended until the risk of bleeding has abated. Prophylactic use of plasma in cardiac operations in the absence of coagulopathy is not indicated, does not reduce blood loss, and exposes patients to unnecessary risks and complications of allogeneic blood component transfusion. Direct reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood from postoperative chest tube drainage is not recommended as a means of blood conservation and may cause harm. A comprehensive multidisciplinary blood conservation program led by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers should be part of any patient blood management program to limit utilization of blood resources and decrease the risk of bleeding.

### Reoperation for bleeding in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery: incidence, risk factors, time trends, and outcomes [^1171ppVS]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Reoperation for bleeding represents an important complication in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Yet, few studies have characterized risk factors and patient outcomes of this event.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 528 686 CABG patients at > 800 hospitals in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Database (2004 to 2007). Clinical features and in-hospital outcomes were evaluated in patients with and without reoperation for bleeding after CABG. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of risk of this event and to estimate weights for an additive risk score. A total of 12 652 CABG patients (2.4%) required reoperation for bleeding. These rates remained fairly stable over time (2.2%, 2.3%, 2.5%, and 2.4% from 2004 to 2007, respectively). Although overall operative mortality was 4.5-fold higher in patients requiring reoperation for bleeding versus those who did not (2.0% versus 9.1%), this mortality risk declined significantly over time (11.3%, 9.5%, 8.8%, and 8.2% from 2004 to 2007, respectively, P for trend = 0.0006). Factors associated with higher risk for reoperation were identified by multivariable analysis (c statistic = 0.60) and summarized into a simple bedside risk score. The risk-score performed well when tested in the validation set (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.16).

Conclusions

Reoperation for bleeding remains an important morbid event after CABG. Nonetheless, death in patients with this complication has decreased over time. Our risk tool should allow estimation of patients risk for reoperation for bleeding and promote preventive measures when feasible in this at-risk group.

### Nomogram for predicting major bleeding after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [^115EKNwB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

We developed a nomogram to predict major bleeding after off-pump CABG. Incorporating preoperative and intraoperative variables, the nomogram demonstrated excellent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. The nomogram can serve as a valuable clinical decision-making instrument, assisting clinicians in identifying patients at increased risk of major bleeding and directing the implementation of preventive measures. Interventions can be tailored to reduce bleeding complications and enhance patient outcomes in off-pump CABG procedures by proactively identifying high-risk patients. Further prospective validation and implementation studies are required to determine the nomogram's broad applicability and impact on patient care.

### Coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with acute coronary syndromes is difficult to predict [^116mT5Rp]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although the use of clopidogrel in patients "unlikely" to require coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is recommended in current guidelines of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management, an important minority of patients require CABG. We assessed the ability to predict need for CABG from demographics known at the time of ACS presentation, using data from SYNERGY.

Methods

Patients undergoing CABG at any time after the index angiogram were included. Early CABG was defined as surgery < 72 hours after angiography. The relationship between cessation of enoxaparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition, CABG timing, and 30-day death or MI and bleeding events was assessed. Demographic and clinical factors and geographic location were assessed as predictors of early CABG or CABG at any time. The discriminatory utility is reported with the c-index.

Results

Of the 9053 patients undergoing angiography, 1793 (18.1%) received CABG. Early CABG (n = 972) was associated with more bleeding events (39.2% vs 29.4%, P < .001) but not death or MI. The risk of bleeding events diminished when surgery was delayed > 18 hours after cessation of enoxaparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. Clinical factors associated with early CABG included diabetes and lack of prior CABG or clopidogrel. However, overall the logistic regression model had poor discriminatory ability to predict patients likely to require CABG in the setting of an ACS presentation (c-index 0.671).

Conclusions

It is difficult to predict those high-risk patients with ACS who will undergo surgical revascularization based on baseline clinical characteristics.

### Postdischarge major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and mortality risk after coronary artery bypass grafting [^115C5UBu]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population and study design

The Swedish Cardiac Surgery Registry was used to identify the study population in this cohort study. All patients ≥ 18 years of age in Sweden undergoing first-time isolated CABG between 2006 and 2017 were considered for inclusion. Patients who died during hospital admission or within 14 days of hospital discharge and patients discharged after 16 December 2017 were excluded. A flow chart of patient inclusion and exclusion is presented in figure 1. The exposures of interest were postdischarge major bleeding and MI, and the investigated outcome was death from any cause. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, socioeconomic factors and time-updated use of cardiovascular drugs were registered and adjusted for in the statistical analysis. Comorbidities were recorded at start of follow-up and thus included both chronic conditions and comorbidities debuting during the index admission; data on left ventricular ejection fraction and renal function were recorded preoperatively. Start of follow-up was 15 days after hospital discharge and is referred to as 'baseline'. The choice to start follow-up 15 days after discharge was to exclude patients dying early after discharge which often is directly related to complications to the surgery. It also allows time to obtain baseline data on dispensed prescriptions after discharge, similar to a previous study from our group. Patients were followed until death, emigration or 31 December 2017.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding complications in patients treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel: a nationwide study [^114FbJun]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y 12 -receptor antagonist reduces the risk of thrombotic complications compared with treatment with only acetylsalicylic acid in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The risk of thrombotic complications is further reduced if one of the new more potent platelet inhibitors, ticagrelor or prasugrel, is used instead of clopidogrel, but the risk of both spontaneous and surgical bleeding complications may increase with the new inhibitors.

Major bleeding complications impair outcome after cardiac surgery. Acute coronary syndrome patients on DAPT who need acute or urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are at high risk of major bleeding. Current revascularization guidelines therefore recommend that clopidogrel and ticagrelor are discontinued 5 days before surgery and prasugrel 7 days before elective surgery, but the patient's condition may render this impossible. Most ACS patients are hospitalized while waiting for CABG. If a shorter discontinuation time of the platelet inhibitor would be safe from a bleeding perspective, it would reduce the risk of thrombotic complications during the waiting time, and save hospital resources. The risk of bleeding complications in relation to discontinuation time has not previously been investigated in real life in sufficiently large patient cohorts.

The newer and more potent platelet inhibitors may increase the risk of major CABG-related bleeding complications, but it is unclear whether the incidence differs between ticagrelor and clopidogrel in real life after adjustment for time since discontinuation and other factors that influence bleeding risk.

The aims of the present real-life study were to investigate whether a shorter discontinuation time before surgery increases the risk of major bleeding with ticagrelor or clopidogrel and to compare the unadjusted and adjusted incidence of CABG-related bleeding complications between clopidogrel and ticagrelor.

### Impact of bleeding severity on clinical outcomes among patients with acute coronary syndromes [^114sid4g]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Bleeding is a complication of current therapies for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). No studies have examined the effect of bleeding events on clinical outcomes. We analyzed pooled data from 4 multicenter, randomized clinical trials of patients who had ACS (n = 26,452) to determine an association between bleeding severity as measured by the GUSTO scale and 30-day and 6-month mortality rates using Cox proportional hazards modeling that incorporated bleeding as a time-dependent covariate. The analysis was repeated to examine procedure- and non-procedure-related bleeding and after censoring at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting. Of all the patients included, 27.6% had ≥ 1 bleeding episode. Patients who bled were older and sicker at presentation than were those who did not bleed. Unadjusted rates of 30-day and 6-month mortality increased as bleeding severity increased. There were stepwise increases in the adjusted hazards of 30-day mortality (mild bleeding, hazard ratio [HR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 1.9; moderate bleeding, HR 2.7, 95% CI l 2.3 to 3.4; severe bleeding, HR 10.6, 95% CI 8.3 to 13.6) and 6-month mortality (mild bleeding, HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.6; moderate bleeding, HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.4; severe bleeding, HR 7.5, 95% CI 6.1 to 9.3) as bleeding severity increased. Results were consistent after censoring for coronary artery bypass grafting and for procedure- and non-procedure-related bleeds. In conclusion, the GUSTO bleeding classification identifies patients who are at risk for short- and long-term adverse events. Therapies that minimize bleeding risk and maintain an anticoagulant effect may improve outcomes among patients who have ACS.
