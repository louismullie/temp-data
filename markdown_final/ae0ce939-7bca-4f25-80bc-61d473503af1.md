## Question

High blood pressure treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about high blood pressure treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify blood pressure and confirm the diagnosis. Then, I should assess absolute cardiovascular risk and how it modifies treatment thresholds. Next, I will review lifestyle interventions, followed by pharmacologic initiation thresholds and first-line drug choices. After that, I need to set individualized blood pressure targets, including special populations. Then, I will outline treatment monitoring, adherence strategies, and management of resistant hypertension. Finally, I should reconcile guideline differences and synthesize a practical, risk-based algorithm, making sure I verify each step against current high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the blood pressure classification and diagnostic approach, because misclassification leads to overtreatment or undertreatment. I should double-check that office measurements are accurate and repeated, and that out-of-office confirmation with home or ambulatory monitoring is used when feasible, especially for borderline values or suspected white-coat hypertension [^115GPRbD] [^115DxLHQ]. The 2025 ACC/AHA guideline retains the 2017 framework defining hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg and recommends confirming with HBPM/ABPM when possible, while the 2024 ESC introduces a three-tier schema with nonelevated < 120/70 mmHg, elevated 120–139/70–89 mmHg, and hypertension ≥ 140/90 mmHg, which still requires confirmation before labeling and treating [^115GPRbD] [^113a1pp9]. Wait, let me verify the implication: both systems emphasize confirmation and risk stratification rather than a single office reading, which I need to keep front-of-mind to avoid premature pharmacotherapy [^115GPRbD] [^113a1pp9].

> Next, I should review absolute cardiovascular risk because it increasingly drives whether and how aggressively to treat. Hold on, I should verify that contemporary evidence supports risk-based initiation even when blood pressure is "high-normal" if risk is high [^114afJ9F]. The 2025 ACC/AHA guideline operationalizes risk using the ASCVD calculator and recommends drug therapy at ≥ 130/80 mmHg for high-risk adults, whereas lower-risk adults generally start at ≥ 140/90 mmHg, aligning treatment with expected absolute benefit [^115GPRbD]. The 2024 ESC similarly ties treatment decisions in the 120–139/70–89 mmHg range to overall cardiovascular risk, reinforcing a risk-first mindset rather than a purely threshold-based approach [^113a1pp9]. I need to ensure I calculate risk accurately and communicate that the absolute risk reduction, not just relative risk, determines the value of treatment [^114afJ9F].

> I will now examine lifestyle therapy because it is foundational for all patients regardless of risk or blood pressure level. Let me think about which interventions have the most robust, durable effects and how to implement them [^114kPFtG]. Weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, adoption of the DASH-style eating pattern, increased physical activity, moderation of alcohol, and smoking cessation all lower blood pressure meaningfully, with combined strategies often yielding effects comparable to single-drug therapy, though adherence wanes over time without structured support [^114kPFtG]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines universally endorse lifestyle as first-line and concurrent with pharmacotherapy when indicated, which they do across ACC/AHA, ESC/ESH, and WHO documents, emphasizing feasibility and equity in implementation [^115GPRbD] [^111fKfwn] [^115eWtok].

> Now, I need to determine when to initiate pharmacologic therapy. Let me reconsider the thresholds to avoid overgeneralization across risk strata and geographies [^1121DrNF]. For ACC/AHA, initiate drug therapy at ≥ 130/80 mmHg if ASCVD risk ≥ 10% or with diabetes/CKD/CVD, and at ≥ 140/90 mmHg for lower-risk adults, typically after a 3–6 month lifestyle trial if BP remains elevated; for ESC 2024, prompt treatment is recommended at ≥ 140/90 mmHg, with consideration of treatment in the 120–139/70–89 mmHg range when risk is high or organ damage is present, and WHO advises initiating at ≥ 140/90 mmHg with attention to cost-effectiveness and access [^115GPRbD] [^113a1pp9]. But wait, what if the patient is very high risk with high-normal BP; both ESC and ACC/AHA allow earlier initiation in that scenario, so I should confirm risk and organ damage before deciding [^113a1pp9] [^115GPRbD].

> Choosing first-line agents comes next. I should confirm which classes have the strongest outcome evidence and where beta-blockers fit [^113wcFJf]. ACC/AHA 2025 and WHO endorse thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs as co-equal first-line options, with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications such as heart failure, CAD, or arrhythmias due to inferior stroke prevention and side-effect profile; ESC/ESH similarly prioritizes these four classes and supports single-pill combinations to improve adherence and control [^113wcFJf]. Hold on, I should verify that race-informed choices still matter: in Black patients, thiazides or CCBs are preferred initial agents, with ACEi/ARB added for kidney protection when indicated, which is consistent across JNC 8 and contemporary guidance [^115CjvEw].

> I should double-check the role of combination therapy and single-pill combinations. If BP is > 20/10 mmHg above goal, starting with two complementary agents is reasonable to accelerate control and improve adherence, and SPCs reduce pill burden and inertia, which is emphasized by ACC/AHA and WHO [^115GPRbD] [^115eWtok]. Let me verify that this strategy aligns with real-world effectiveness data showing better control with SPCs and structured titration, which it does in multiple implementation studies and guideline statements [^114mB11i] [^115eWtok].

> Next, I should review individualized blood pressure targets. I need to ensure I balance benefit, harm, and patient preferences rather than apply a single number to all [^1121DrNF]. ACC/AHA 2025 sets a universal target of < 130/80 mmHg for most adults, with consideration of < 120 mmHg in selected high-risk patients if tolerated, and allows relaxation to < 140/90 mmHg in the elderly with frailty, limited life expectancy, or institutionalized care; ESC 2024 defaults to 120–129 mmHg for most treated adults but relaxes to "as low as reasonably achievable" in those ≥ 85 years, with frailty, orthostasis, or limited life expectancy; ESH 2023 supports 130–139 mmHg in older adults with close monitoring [^1121DrNF] [^113a1pp9] [^114FFvZw]. Wait, I should verify the evidence base for intensive targets: large meta-analyses show proportional risk reduction with BP lowering across baseline levels, but in older or comorbid patients, the absolute benefit must outweigh hypotension, falls, and polypharmacy risks, so shared decision-making is essential [^114afJ9F] [^111aBUb7].

> I will now examine special populations. Let me think about diabetes, CKD, pregnancy, and stroke, and confirm any nuances that change thresholds or agents [^1121DrNF]. In diabetes or CKD, ACEi/ARB are preferred for kidney protection and the general < 130/80 mmHg target applies, with careful potassium and eGFR monitoring. In pregnancy, methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are preferred and ACEi/ARB are contraindicated. After ischemic stroke, initiate or intensify therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mmHg, and for secondary prevention, many guidelines support a target < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated. For intracerebral hemorrhage, acute intensive lowering to < 140 mmHg is guideline-supported but benefits may vary by etiology and timing, so I should individualize and monitor closely [^115CjvEw] [^111W1Dmc]. Hold on, I should verify that these agent choices align with labeling and safety, which they do for commonly used agents like amlodipine, telmisartan, and irbesartan, reinforcing class-based benefits and combination use when needed [^111UepAZ] [^1138cFtR] [^115z3T2v].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration. I need to ensure follow-up intervals and measurement protocols are explicit to avoid therapeutic inertia [^1121DrNF]. Reassess BP within 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change, intensify if not at goal, and consider HBPM/ABPM to guide titration and detect white-coat or masked hypertension. Most patients require at least two agents, and structured algorithms with SPCs improve time-to-control and reduce inertia, which is emphasized in ACC/AHA implementation guidance and WHO's risk-stratified follow-up cadence [^114mB11i] [^115eWtok]. Wait, let me verify that these intervals are consistent with European guidance as well. ESC/ESH supports close early follow-up and use of out-of-office measurements to refine control, which aligns with this approach [^115DxLHQ].

> I should confirm adherence strategies because poor adherence is a major driver of uncontrolled BP. Let me consider evidence-based levers to improve real-world control [^114o252b]. Simplification to once-daily regimens and SPCs, pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and counseling, team-based care, and digital health tools for reminders and home-BP uploads all improve adherence and control; I need to screen for barriers at each visit and tailor solutions to patient preferences and access [^114o252b] [^115eWtok]. Hold on, I should verify that these are not just theoretical; implementation studies and health-system advisories consistently show improved control with these strategies, supporting routine adoption [^114o252b] [^115eWtok].

> Now, I will evaluate resistant hypertension. I need to ensure I exclude pseudoresistance before labeling a patient as truly resistant [^117BqjS3]. Confirm adherence, rule out white-coat effect with HBPM/ABPM, and screen for secondary causes such as obstructive sleep apnea, primary aldosteronism, renal parenchymal disease, and renovascular disease; optimize to maximally tolerated doses of three complementary classes, typically ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide, then add spironolactone as fourth-line, and consider referral to a hypertension specialist or device-based therapies like renal denervation in carefully selected patients within experienced centers [^117BqjS3]. Wait, I should double-check that device therapies remain adjunctive and evidence-limited for broad use; current guidance positions them as options in refractory cases after exhaustive medical therapy, which is consistent with contemporary statements [^117BqjS3].

> I need to reconcile guideline differences explicitly so I don't overstate any one position. Let me reconsider the main axes of variation and where they converge [^113UamHE]. Thresholds for diagnosis and treatment vary, with ACC/AHA at ≥ 130/80 mmHg and ESC/WHO historically anchored at ≥ 140/90 mmHg, yet all now emphasize risk-based initiation and the primacy of lifestyle therapy; targets range from universal < 130/80 mmHg in ACC/AHA to ESC's default 120–129 mmHg with allowances for frailty, but both accept individualized goals when harms emerge; first-line classes largely overlap, and all endorse combination therapy and SPCs to close the control gap [^115GPRbD] [^113a1pp9]. Hold on, I should verify that harmonization efforts highlight this convergence; yes, comparative analyses underscore substantial concordance despite surface differences, supporting a unified, risk-based clinical approach [^115PhMLy].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-based algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence I've verified: confirm accurate BP with repeated office and out-of-office measurements. Calculate ASCVD risk and assess for organ damage. Implement lifestyle therapy for all. Initiate pharmacotherapy at ≥ 130/80 mmHg if high risk or at ≥ 140/90 mmHg if lower risk, favoring thiazide, CCB, ACEi, or ARB with race- and comorbidity-informed selection. Start two agents if > 20/10 mmHg above goal or if high risk. Titrate every 2–4 weeks to a personalized target of < 130/80 mmHg for most, 120–129 mmHg if tolerated and appropriate, or < 140/90 mmHg if frail or limited life expectancy. Embed adherence supports and structured follow-up. Evaluate for resistant hypertension if uncontrolled on three agents, excluding pseudoresistance and secondary causes. And throughout, use shared decision-making to align intensity with patient values and tolerance [^115GPRbD] [^113a1pp9] [^115eWtok]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to apply a strict < 120 mmHg target broadly, but I should correct that to "selected high-risk patients if tolerated", given mixed outcome data and increased adverse events at very low targets in some populations, reinforcing the need for individualized judgment [^1148paiZ].

High blood pressure treatment centers on **lifestyle first** (weight loss, sodium restriction, DASH, exercise, alcohol moderation) [^114Hunx7] and **pharmacotherapy when indicated** (thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers for compelling indications) [^113wcFJf] [^115CjvEw]. Most patients require **≥ 2 drugs** to reach targets, and therapy should be individualized to comorbidities, age, and tolerance [^111UepAZ] [^111fKfwn]. Current guidelines target **< 130/80 mmHg** for most adults, with < 120 mmHg for high-risk patients if tolerated, and relaxed goals for older or frail adults [^1121DrNF] [^113a1pp9]. Regular monitoring, adherence support, and addressing secondary causes are essential to sustained control and risk reduction [^114o252b] [^117BqjS3].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are **first-line** for all patients and can lower BP by 4–10 mmHg:

- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²; each 1 kg lost reduces SBP by ~1 mmHg.
- **Dietary sodium restriction**: < 2.3 g/day; ideal < 1.5 g/day.
- **DASH diet**: High in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and low in saturated fat.
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women), ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).

---

## Pharmacological therapy

### Indications for initiation

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for:

- **General population**: Persistent BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite lifestyle therapy.
- **High-risk patients**: BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg (e.g. diabetes, CKD, CVD) [^115GPRbD].
- **Older adults**: Individualize; consider ≥ 150 mmHg per ACP/AAFP [^112XqMSk].

---

### First-line antihypertensive agents

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | - Chlorthalidone <br/> - Hydrochlorothiazide | First-line; especially in Black patients [^113wcFJf] [^115CjvEw] |
| ACE inhibitors | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril | - Diabetes <br/> - CKD <br/> - Heart failure |
| ARBs | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan | - Diabetes <br/> - CKD <br/> - ACEI cough |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Amlodipine <br/> - Diltiazem | - Elderly <br/> - Isolated systolic HTN |
| Beta-blockers | - Metoprolol <br/> - Carvedilol | - Heart failure <br/> - CAD <br/> - Arrhythmias |

---

### Combination therapy

Most patients require **≥ 2 drugs** to reach targets; fixed-dose combinations improve adherence and control [^111bx9qM].

---

## Blood pressure targets

Current guideline targets include **< 130/80 mmHg** for most adults, with more intensive targets (< 120 mmHg) for high-risk patients if tolerated [^1121DrNF]. For older or frail adults, **130–139 mmHg** is reasonable, balancing benefits and harms [^113a1pp9].

---

## Special populations

- **Diabetes/CKD**: Target < 130/80 mmHg; use ACEi/ARB [^1121DrNF].
- **Elderly**: Individualize; consider < 150 mmHg per ACP/AAFP [^112XqMSk].
- **Pregnancy**: Methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine; avoid ACEi/ARB.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include reassessment **every 3–6 months** until control, then annually, with home BP monitoring encouraged. Follow-up should reinforce adherence, evaluate for adverse effects, and adjust therapy as needed [^114o252b].

---

## Barriers to control and solutions

Barriers include nonadherence, therapeutic inertia, and limited access; solutions include **team-based care**, pharmacists, telehealth, and simplified regimens [^112Q1nc5] [^114o252b].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **renal denervation**, SGLT2 inhibitors, and novel agents for resistant hypertension, though long-term data are pending [^117BqjS3].

---

Effective hypertension management requires **lifestyle first**, evidence-based pharmacotherapy, individualized targets, and persistent follow-up to reduce cardiovascular risk [^115DxLHQ].

### 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) / international society of hypertension (ISH) statement on management of hypertension [^114XfzxB]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypertension is estimated to cause 4.5% of current global disease burden and is as prevalent in many developing countries, as in the developed world. Blood pressure-induced cardiovascular risk rises continuously across the whole blood pressure range. Countries vary widely in capacity for management of hypertension, but worldwide the majority of diagnosed hypertensives are inadequately controlled. This statement addresses the ascertainment of overall cardiovascular risk to establish thresholds for initiation and goals of treatment, appropriate treatment strategies for non-drug and drug therapies, and cost-effectiveness of treatment.

Conclusions

Since publication of the WHO/ISH Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in 1999, more evidence has become available to support a systolic blood pressure threshold of 140 mmHg for even 'low-risk' patients. In high-risk patients there is evidence for lower thresholds. Lifestyle modification is recommended for all individuals. There is evidence that specific agents have benefits for patients with particular compelling indications, and that monotherapy is inadequate for the majority of patients. For patients without a compelling indication for a particular drug class, on the basis of comparative trial data, availability, and cost, a low dose of diuretic should be considered for initiation of therapy. In most places a thiazide diuretic is the cheapest option and thus most cost effective, but for compelling indications where other classes provide additional benefits, even if more expensive, they may be more cost effective. In high-risk patients who attain large benefits from treatment, expensive drugs may be cost effective, but in low-risk patients treatment may not be cost-effective unless the drugs are cheap.

### Acute hypertensive response in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage: a narrative review [^111W1Dmc]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the role of the acute hypertensive response in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, current treatment options, and areas for further research.

Methods

Review of the literature to assess 1) frequency of acute hypertensive response in intracerebral hemorrhage; 2) consequences of acute hypertensive response in clinical outcomes; 3) acute hypertensive response and secondary brain injury: hematoma expansion and perihematomal edema; 4) vascular autoregulation, safety data side effects of acute antihypertensive treatment; and 5) randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses.

Results

An acute hypertensive response is frequent in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, it is not clear whether high blood pressure is a cause of poor clinical outcome or solely represents a marker of severity. Although current guidelines recommend intensive blood pressure treatment (< 140 mm Hg) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, 2 randomized clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent clinical benefit from this approach, and new data suggest that intensive blood pressure treatment could be beneficial for some patients but detrimental for others.

Conclusions

Intracerebral hemorrhage is a heterogenous disease, thus, a one-fit-all approach for blood pressure treatment may be suboptimal. Further research should concentrate on finding subgroups of patients more likely to benefit from aggressive blood pressure lowering, considering intracerebral hemorrhage etiology, ultra-early randomization, and risk markers of hematoma expansion on brain imaging.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^112XqMSk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians hypertension guideline — Recommendation 1 states that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg and target a systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke, cardiac events, and possibly mortality; Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

---

### Arterial hypertension [^115DxLHQ]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Arterial hypertension is the most important contributor to the global burden of disease; however, disease control remains poor. Although the diagnosis of hypertension is still based on office blood pressure, confirmation with out-of-office blood pressure measurements (ie, ambulatory or home monitoring) is strongly recommended. The definition of hypertension differs throughout various guidelines, but the indications for antihypertensive therapy are relatively similar. Lifestyle adaptation is absolutely key in non-pharmacological treatment. Pharmacologically, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics are the first-line agents, with advice for the use of single-pill combination therapy by most guidelines. As a fourth-line agent, spironolactone should be considered. The rapidly evolving field of device-based therapy, especially renal denervation, will further broaden therapeutic options. Despite being a largely controllable condition, the actual rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension are disappointingly low. Further improvements throughout the process of patient screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up need to be urgently addressed.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^113UamHE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Box.
Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Does chocolate reduce blood pressure? A meta-analysis [^114ayFoG]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Flavanol-rich chocolate and cocoa products have attracted interest as nonpharmacological treatment options for high blood pressure, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Even small reductions in blood pressure substantially reduce cardiovascular risk. Current guidelines strongly recommend integration of lifestyle modification and complementary treatment with the use of conventional blood pressure medications.

Polyphenols, in particular flavanols in cocoa products, have been shown to increase the formation of endothelial nitric oxide, which promotes vasodilation and consequently may lower blood pressure. Meta-analyses by Taubert et al. (2007), including five small trials, and Desch et al. (2010), including 10 trials, concluded that cocoa-rich foods may reduce blood pressure. However, additional trials have been published since then, with conflicting results. Our study updates current research on the effect of cocoa-rich products taken daily for two or more weeks compared with placebo on blood pressure in adults. In addition, we explored the influence of baseline blood pressure, dosage, duration, type of control, study design, age, body mass index and trial quality on blood pressure outcome.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### European guidelines for hypertension in 2024: a comparison of key recommendations for clinical practice [^113vwMGX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality globally. Suboptimal control of elevated blood pressure places a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide. Several factors contribute to this suboptimal control, such as limited awareness of hypertension, lack of appropriate diagnosis and poor control of blood pressure among those with a diagnosis. These factors can be due to patient non-adherence to treatment, inertia among health-care professionals and low uptake and implementation of clinical guideline recommendations. From 2003 to 2018, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology jointly published four sets of guidelines on hypertension. However, the two societies released separate guidelines on hypertension in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These two sets of European guidelines agree on most recommendations, but some differences have been identified. In this Expert Recommendation, we highlight the key consensus recommendations from the two guidelines; compare differing approaches to the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; and aim to help health-care professionals in their decision-making to improve the management of hypertension and to reduce the burden of hypertension-associated outcomes and premature deaths.

### Targeting multivariable risks: an opportunity for population high blood pressure control [^115dym5p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Elevated blood pressure has been recognized since the early 20th century as an indicator of adverse cardiovascular risk and mortality, with increased rates of disease with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Results from early hypertension treatment studies from the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents determined that treating and lowering blood pressure levels among patients with high blood pressure was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and stroke risks. These successful blood pressure reductions and adverse risk outcomes were demonstrated in the population as a whole, leading to strategies for hypertension control. These strategies for population and clinical programs focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension are associated with the consistent lowering of systolic blood pressure distributions from 1960 to 2010 in the United States. Further, the shifting in blood pressure distributions to the left was associated with the significant reduction in stroke mortality and stroke risks in the population. Hypertension treatment and control was attributed as the greatest factor for population risk reduction and most effective in accelerated blood pressure reduction. While the lowering of blood pressure levels has been recognized as one of the major public health successes of the past 50 years, optimal treatment and control has yet to be obtained. Lloyd-Jones and colleagues, in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association, provide a valuable assessment of cardiovascular events and the level of blood pressure with implications for improved hypertension control and risk reduction. Specifically, the investigator team has advocated for a multiple risk factor assessment and profile for the treatment of elevated blood pressure to maximize cardiovascular disease risks.

This report is timely and contributes to the evidence gap essential in the development of strategies, clinical guidelines, and interventions for elevated blood pressure. In particular, the consideration and assessment of multiple risk factors has become a valuable clinical component in the management of high blood pressure. Specifically, the risk of cardiovascular disease increase with the number of risk factors and comorbid conditions. Likewise, treatment effects of from antihypertensive agents vary by the levels of risks and comorbid conditions. These differences in risks and benefits are associated with therapy regimens that are specific to multiple factors and comorbid conditions. Complicating the recommendations of high blood pressure treatment based on risks is the variation in level of risks by population demographics including race, sex, age, and geography. The significant differences in risk profiles for blood pressure levels by race has implications for target blood pressure levels, blood pressure treatment initiation levels, types of therapy, and treatment intensity.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^115eWtok]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effects of blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and death: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^111DXF7G]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

This detailed study of age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effect of antihypertensive medication provides compelling evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological blood pressure reduction into old age irrespective of baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure. These findings challenge the common approach of withholding antihypertensive treatment for older adults, in particular when their blood pressure is not highly abnormal. Treatment should, therefore, be considered an important option regardless of age with removal of age-related blood-pressure thresholds from international guidelines.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that increased blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events across different age categories and over a wide range of blood pressure. Although these studies have found some attenuation in relative risks with increasing age, older patients might still gain as much as, if not more than, younger individuals from blood-pressure-lowering treatment because the absolute cardiovascular event rates increase with age. However, other studies have reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in older patients with lower blood pressure compared with those with higher blood pressure. Some have even suggested a rapid decline in blood pressure in the years preceding death, raising doubts about the value of blood-pressure-lowering treatment in older people.

Thus far, robust evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has been lacking, in part because of the under-representation of older individuals in clinical trials. To date, the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) is the only large-scale trial that has exclusively recruited patients aged 80 years and older. Although this study found 30% reductions in risk of stroke and 23% reductions in risk of cardiovascular death, its 3845 participants were selected on the basis of having very high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg or higher) at baseline. Several other randomised trials and their meta-analyses have also investigated the effects of blood pressure reduction by age. Although these studies found no evidence of heterogeneity of effects by age, individual trials have had insufficient statistical power to investigate this question in depth. Previous meta-analyses were also mainly based on broad age categories (eg, < 65 years vs ≥ 65 years) and could not investigate effects based on narrower age groups and by other important characteristics such as baseline blood pressure. This uncertainty is evident in the conflicting clinical guideline recommendations for treatment according to age (appendix p 2).

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^113NfUqy]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

This study had also some limitations. We stratified analyses based on two variables, which is often insufficient for identifying distinct groups of individuals. Nonetheless, the phenotypes selected in this study were those with substantial clinical uncertainty and the absence of any meaningful heterogeneity should inform clinical practice as well as future research that seeks to assess the potential heterogeneity of treatment effects based on other important phenotypes, including novel approaches to multivariable and high-dimensional participant stratification. Relatedly, although we did not exclude any particular participant group other than those with diagnosis of heart failure, some types of groups are likely to have been under-represented or excluded. Thus, we caution against generalising our findings to suggest that treatment is equally effective across all possible patient groups. However, our sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the findings and do not support concerns that inclusion or exclusion of particular trials or alternative assumptions could have changed our conclusions. We did not investigate potential treatment harms. However, as described in the introduction, concerns raised about blood pressure reduction in low blood pressure ranges has been largely due to their disputed unfavourable effects on major cardiovascular outcomes, which our study provides reassurance about. Moreover, our definition of major cardiovascular events did not include other outcomes such as valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, or diabetes, which might also be partially preventable with blood pressure-lowering treatment. Several ongoing and planned BPLTTC studies are investigating such effects which might further help refine treatment recommendations.

This study provides evidence against the widely held view that an individual's blood pressure or previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease per se are key factors for selecting or deselecting participants for blood pressure-lowering treatment. These findings call for revision of clinical guideline recommendations globally and suggest that antihypertensive medications are better viewed as treatment options for prevention of cardiovascular disease regardless of an individual's blood pressure level and their previous history of cardiovascular disease. For people at risk of cardiovascular disease, pharmacological blood pressure-lowering treatment should become a cornerstone of risk prevention irrespective of cardiovascular disease status or blood pressure.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effects of blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and death: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^111aBUb7]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, we found no evidence to substantiate the common approach of withholding antihypertensive treatment for older adults, in particular when their blood pressure is not highly elevated. Although the findings for people aged 85 years or more at study entry were less compelling, the overall patterns were consistent and suggestive of worthwhile reductions in cardiovascular outcomes across all age groups. Although clinical decision making for initiation and continuation of pharmacological blood-pressure-lowering will continue to be based on harm-benefit trade-offs for any individual, our study does not support the common belief that such trade-offs justify the overemphasis of several clinical practice guidelines on an individual's age or starting blood pressure. Therefore, pharmacological blood pressure reduction should be considered as an important treatment option for the prevention of cardiovascular events even in those aged 80 years or older and guidelines should be simplified to remove any differing blood pressure thresholds by age.

### Editors' commentary on the 2023 ESH management of arterial hypertension guidelines [^111HNZQC]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

### Optimizing hypertension management in clinical practice [^111bx9qM]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

A clear relationship exists between elevated blood pressure (BP) and various manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Despite the availability of numerous treatment guidelines, hypertension remains inadequately controlled, with only a small proportion of patients achieving target BP levels. Many factors, both patient and physician related, contribute to this poor level of hypertension control. Major determinants include the implementation of inappropriate treatment regimens that do not enable patients to achieve goal and poor patient compliance. For example, it is widely acknowledged that most patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve BP goal; however, physicians may be reluctant to employ such treatment strategies. The aim of this review is to explore factors that contribute to poor hypertension control rates and how to overcome these, including the rationale for selecting combination therapy, with particular reference to angiotensin II receptor blocker combinations.

### Eligibility and subsequent burden of cardiovascular disease of four strategies for blood pressure-lowering treatment: a retrospective cohort study [^111evXMF]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our analyses and the evidence to date illustrate that the potential benefits of an absolute risk-based approach to assess eligibility for blood pressure-lowering treatment surpass those of approaches recommended by international guidelines. These findings show the need to re-assess blood pressure treatment guidelines that are based on blood pressure cutoffs.

However, strong evidence suggests that using a blood pressure threshold to make treatment decisions might not be the optimal strategy. Meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised studies, have shown that treating patients with blood pressures as low as 110/70 mm Hg (lower than the NICE and European Society of Cardiology guideline threshold of 140/90 mm Hg) can reduce cardiovascular risk. Additionally, the absolute treatment benefit of blood pressure-lowering drugs is determined by a patient's absolute cardiovascular risk, with more benefit achieved in patients with the highest risk, even when blood pressure is lower than treatment thresholds. Blood pressure is just one component of absolute cardiovascular risk, meaning that patients with blood pressure lower than guideline treatment thresholds could have very high risk, and patients with blood pressure higher than those thresholds could be at low risk. This suggests that many patients who might benefit from blood pressure-lowering treatment are missing out, whereas others might be overtreated.

Two key considerations in determining the optimal strategy for blood pressure-lowering treatment are the number of patients who would be eligible for treatment and the degree to which treatment is prioritised to those people most likely to have future cardiovascular disease. The 2011 NICE guidelinesand their proposed 2019 updateare positioned between two strategies: blood pressure-only treatment and risk-based treatment.

Before the 2011 NICE guidance, treatment recommendations were based solely on blood pressure thresholds, treating patients with hypertension. Some evidence exists that general practitioners continue to use a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg to guide treatment decisions. However, the aim of lowering blood pressure is to reduce cardiovascular risk. A rational strategy to determine who to treat would be to target patients at high cardiovascular risk rather than only those with hypertension. Such a strategy would involve the use of a validated cardiovascular risk score (such as QRISK2, SCORE, or the ACC/AHA pooled equations, calculated on the basis of blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors) to determine treatment eligibility. This approach has been adopted for lipid lowering in the UK: patients whose absolute QRISK2 10-year cardiovascular risk is 10% or higher are recommended for treatment.

### Developing hypertension guidelines: an evolving process [^114X8KMZ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension guidelines provide up-to-date information and recommendations for hypertension management to healthcare providers, and they facilitate translation of new knowledge into clinical practice. Guidelines represent consensus statements by expert panels, and the process of guideline development has inherent vulnerabilities. Between 1977 and 2003, under the direction of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) issued 7 reports. The evolution of the JNC recommendations reflects the acquisition of observational and clinical trial data and the availability of newer antihypertensive drugs. Despite 5 years in preparation, NIH did not release a JNC 8 report and recently made the decision to withdraw from issuing guidelines. The responsibility for issuing hypertension-related guidelines was transferred to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Without the endorsement of the NIH or the AHA, JNC 8 committee members recently published their guideline report. Notably, there have been discrepancies of JNC recommendations over time as well as discrepancies with recommendations of other professional organizations. The Institute of Medicine recently recommended criteria for "trustworthy" guidelines. Criticisms of the guideline process, and of the guidelines themselves, should not obscure their likely contribution to improved hypertension control and to decreases of mortality rates of stroke and cardiovascular disease over the past several decades. Nevertheless, translation of guidelines into clinical practice remains a challenge.

### What is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension? [^113a1pp9]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for the management of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The guideline introduced a new BP categorization: (1) nonelevated (office BP < 120/70 mmHg) for which drug treatment is not recommended, (2) elevated (120–139/70–89 mmHg) for which drug treatment is recommended based on cardiovascular disease risk and follow-up BP level, and (3) hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for which prompt confirmation and drug treatment are recommended in most individuals. The initial default systolic BP treatment target is 120 to 129 mmHg; however, relaxed targets (BP as low as reasonably achievable) are recommended in case of treatment intolerance, adults ≥ 85 years, symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or limited life expectancy. Here, we summarize what is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, relative to other major international hypertension guidelines in Europe and America. Our aim is to reconcile any uncertainty clinicians may have about implementing these various guidelines in patient care.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112j6vuh]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Office blood pressure treatment targets in hypertensive patients — It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all patients and that, if the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients < 65 years receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. In older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg, with close monitoring of adverse effects. These BP targets are recommended for patients at any level of CV risk and in patients with and without established CVD. A DBP target of < 80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^111gnkci]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

### Resistant hypertension: diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment. A scientific statement from the American Heart Association professional education committee of the council for high blood pressure research [^11476Noc]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem faced by both primary care clinicians and specialists. While the exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is unknown, clinical trials suggest that it is not rare, involving perhaps 20% to 30% of study participants. As older age and obesity are 2 of the strongest risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension, the incidence of resistant hypertension will likely increase as the population becomes more elderly and heavier. The prognosis of resistant hypertension is unknown, but cardiovascular risk is undoubtedly increased as patients often have a history of long-standing, severe hypertension complicated by multiple other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The diagnosis of resistant hypertension requires use of good blood pressure technique to confirm persistently elevated blood pressure levels. Pseudoresistance, including lack of blood pressure control secondary to poor medication adherence or white coat hypertension, must be excluded. Resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial in etiology. Successful treatment requires identification and reversal of lifestyle factors contributing to treatment resistance; diagnosis and appropriate treatment of secondary causes of hypertension; and use of effective multidrug regimens. As a subgroup, patients with resistant hypertension have not been widely studied. Observational assessments have allowed for identification of demographic and lifestyle characteristics associated with resistant hypertension, and the role of secondary causes of hypertension in promoting treatment resistance is well documented; however, identification of broader mechanisms of treatment resistance is lacking. In particular, attempts to elucidate potential genetic causes of resistant hypertension have been limited. Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of resistant hypertension remain largely empiric due to the lack of systematic assessments of 3 or 4 drug combinations. Studies of resistant hypertension are limited by the high cardiovascular risk of patients within this subgroup, which generally precludes safe withdrawal of medications; the presence of multiple disease processes (eg, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic disease) and their associated medical therapies, which confound interpretation of study results; and the difficulty in enrolling large numbers of study participants. Expanding our understanding of the causes of resistant hypertension and thereby potentially allowing for more effective prevention and/or treatment will be essential to improve the long-term clinical management of this disorder.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116xjPrG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### Hypertension guidelines: criteria that might make them more clinically useful [^113ZmA3w]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease prevention depends on reduction of risk factors, including hypertension. Guidelines designed to improve management of hypertension are widely available. Their purpose is to assemble the available data from basic biomedical science, epidemiology, and clinical science in an accessible form with which physicians and patients can make reasoned decisions for individual cases. However, guidelines have been neither widely accepted, nor effectively implemented. We recommend a strategy for guideline preparation designed to yield a product more user friendly, accessible, and effective. Guideline recommendations and the evidence used to make them should be based on an explicit grading system. Relevant clinical as well as nonclinical factors must be considered. Moreover, because the goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent cardiovascular events, and the likelihood of such events is determined by multifactor or absolute risk assessment, risk, rather than level of blood pressure (BP), should determine the need for therapy. Similarly, the benefit of therapy must be assessed by reduction in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^1135WgQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. Trial reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants. We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy are recommended first-line options from thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence "supports 4 classes of first-line agents", and a meta-analysis reported "50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals", while "all other antihypertensive agents are considered secondary" and "BBs were less effective than first-line antihypertensive classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications".

### Lifestyle modification as a means to prevent and treat high blood pressure [^114Hunx7]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

High BP is one of the most important and common risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and renal disease. The contemporary approach to the epidemic of elevated BP and its complications involves pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive individuals and "lifestyle modification", which is beneficial for both nonhypertensive and hypertensive persons. A substantial body of evidence strongly supports the concept that lifestyle modification can have powerful effects on BP. Increased physical activity, a reduced salt intake, weight loss, moderation of alcohol intake, increased potassium intake, and an overall healthy dietary pattern, termed the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, effectively lower BP. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and is reduced in fat and cholesterol. Other dietary factors, such as a greater intake of protein or monounsaturated fatty acids, may also reduce BP but available evidence is inconsistent. The current challenge to health care providers, researchers, government officials, and the general public is developing and implementing effective clinical and public health strategies that lead to sustained lifestyle modification.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^116x7BGU]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) management strategies have evolved substantially over recent decades, shifting from approaches based exclusively on BP thresholds to the adoption of multidimensional, risk-based decision making. Within this context, the 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Scientific Statement on the use of risk assessment in BP managementrepresents a further welcome advancement towards aligning clinical practice with contemporary evidence. The Statement offers a robust and evidence-informed framework for risk-based BP management. However, in our view, some key issues remain that are worth highlighting.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116GiKcy]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — evidence on detection, benefits, and harms: There is inadequate evidence about the accuracy of screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents. There is no direct evidence that screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents delays or reduces adverse health outcomes, although there is adequate evidence about the longitudinal association between high blood pressure in children and adolescents and high blood pressure and other intermediate outcomes in adults. There is inadequate evidence on the long-term effectiveness of interventions for treating high blood pressure in children and adolescents to reduce blood pressure or improve immediate outcomes, and inadequate evidence on whether such interventions reduce adverse health outcomes associated with high blood pressure in adults. There is inadequate evidence to assess the potential harms of screening and of pharmacologic, lifestyle, or combined interventions for treatment. Overall, the benefits and harms of screening for blood pressure in children and adolescents are uncertain, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

### Potential US population impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure guideline [^116ZsipS]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication, and BP target goals.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among US adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).

Methods

The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9 623). BP was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce US population estimates.

Results

According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among US adults was 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.6% to 47.6%) and 31.9% (95% CI: 30.1% to 33.7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36.2% (95% CI: 34.2% to 38.2%) and 34.3% (95% CI: 32.5% to 36.2%) of US adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.4% of US adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among US adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53.4% (95% CI: 49.9% to 56.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 36.4% to 41.6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of US adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^113aNg5B]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Future Outlook

Looking ahead, we propose a substantially expanded role for risk-based treatment, extending its use to all individuals with elevated BP, not only to inform who should be treated but also to guide how treatment should be tailored. This approach aligns naturally with the central aim of risk assessment: to direct pharmacological therapy — along with its attendant risks and costs — towards those at highest risk. Higher risk individuals are most likely to achieve greater absolute benefits, thereby maximizing efficiency in reducing cardiovascular disease risk (ie, lowering the number needed to treat). Among higher-risk individuals, however, the magnitude of risk remains important and should directly inform treatment decisions. Figure 2 illustrates that, for individuals with identical baseline BP, the benefits of achieving a mean on-treatment systolic BP of 120, 125, or 130 mm Hg are largely determined by their underlying cardiovascular risk. This matters because the rates of adverse effects and associated costs can vary so widely across treatment regimens; for example, monotherapy with an angiotensin II receptor blocker is inexpensive and is associated with fewer adverse effects than placebo. Whereas maximal therapy with 3 to 4 maximum-dose agents plus renal denervation entails a significantly higher adverse effect and cost profile. With a wave of novel therapies on the horizon, risk stratification among individuals at elevated risk will become increasingly important from a cost-effectiveness perspective as well.

Our study highlights the role of pharmacological agents in effectively reducing BP over several years across individuals with a wide range of characteristics, although the achieved between-group reductions, even with the intensive BP-lowering regimens, were relatively modest. Given that large-scale trials have shown the effects of pharmacological BP reduction on improving clinical outcomes, the modest BP reductions estimated in our study should still be clinically meaningful. Indeed, the estimates of long-term BP reduction in this study could inform treatment strategies and help in setting realistic treatment goals in the pharmacologic management of raised BP.

### Blood pressure: the lower, the better: the con side [^111Hq4vk]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Recent guideline recommendations to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all hypertensive patients, including the elderly, and to < 130/80 mmHg in diabetic and high-risk patients is not based on solid evidence. It is clear that lowering SBP to 140 mmHg is beneficial, but there is no evidence that lowering BP to < 140 mmHg in all patients adds benefit. The blood pressure target should be determined according to the patients' global risk and accompanied diseases. Lowering SBP to < 140 mmHg may be prudent in diabetic and high-risk patients. Lowering BP too much is associated with more side effects and may be dangerous. This scenario may be especially true in the elderly with isolated systolic hypertension.

High value care — benefit concentration by baseline SBP in lower-risk patients is described as follows: "In lower risk patients, other than the slight possibility of minor harms for lower BP targets, most benefit occurs with acceptable harms and costs in the pharmacologic treatment of patients who have an SBP of 150 mm Hg or greater".

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115RaCrb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of the review published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included more than 50 participants per group and provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Potential U.S. population impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure Guideline [^113nPZsi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication, and BP target goals.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among U.S. adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).

Methods

The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9,623). BP was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce U.S. population estimates.

Results

According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among U.S. adults was 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.6% to 47.6%) and 31.9% (95% CI: 30.1% to 33.7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36.2% (95% CI: 34.2% to 38.2%) and 34.3% (95% CI: 32.5% to 36.2%) of U.S. adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.4% of U.S. adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among U.S. adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53.4% (95% CI: 49.9% to 56.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 36.4% to 41.6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of U.S. adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114FFvZw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure targets: In patients (≥ 65 years), SBP should be targeted to between 130 and 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) to < 80 mmHg, and treated SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg. The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^114afJ9F]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Our study fills the aforementioned gaps in evidence and provides compelling evidence from randomised trials for the beneficial effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment across the spectrum of systolic blood pressure in people with or without a known diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Our findings do not substantiate concerns about a J-shaped association between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies, and dismiss the suggestions that blood pressure-lowering treatment is only effective when blood pressure is above a certain threshold.

These findings have important implications for clinical practice. Currently, the approach to prescribing antihypertensives depends on an individual's previous history of cardiovascular disease and blood pressure value. Although guidelines vary on the degree of their emphasis on these two risk factors, they invariably modify recommendations based on them. For instance, New Zealand has largely abandoned the approach of treating hypertension and recommends screening adults for overall cardiovascular risk as the first stage towards clinical decision making. Nonetheless, in the second stage, those ranked to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease are additionally required to have a high blood pressure to qualify for antihypertensive treatment. Most other guidelines have an even stronger reliance on blood pressure, often with explicit criteria for diagnosis of hypertension in the first stage and then consideration of treatment at the second stage in a subset of hypertensive participants. For instance, in England, blood pressure-lowering treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is not considered as relevant when baseline systolic blood pressure is less than 140 mm Hg. Most guidelines also define a floor level for reducing blood pressure, assuming that lowering blood pressure below a common threshold would be ineffective or to have an uncertain or even detrimental effect.

Our study calls for a revision of these guidelines. The finding that a fixed and modest degree of blood pressure reduction is expected to lead to similar relative reductions in risk of cardiovascular events, regardless of current blood pressure or presence of ischaemic heart disease and stroke, calls for consideration of blood pressure-lowering treatment for any individual who has a sufficiently high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. By considering antihypertensives as a tool for reducing cardiovascular risk, rather than simply reducing blood pressure, clinicians are no longer required to make decisions according to an arbitrary and confusing classification of hypertension. The need for and the burden of exact measurement of blood pressure is also reduced. This will not only simplify decision-making, management, and communication of treatment strategies with participants but, as shown in previous modelling studies, will also lead to more efficient care compared with alternative strategies that rely more heavily on absolute blood pressure values.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^116fp46P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians hypertension guideline — Recommendation 3 states that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying treatment in other adults aged 60 years or older, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events; Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

### Rationalizing the treatment of hypertension [^117CLCoV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Management of hypertension in this country is confounded by continual changes in recommended target blood pressure (BP) goals and a nonhomogeneous patient population who have a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics that influence treatment. This paper focuses on three major elements in managing hypertension: BP and the importance of reducing it to acceptably low levels; concomitant risk factors or cardiovascular and renal target involvement; and drug therapy that may confer prognostic advantages beyond those predicted by BP effects.

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^115jzTRA]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

### Non-pharmacological aspects of blood pressure management: what are the data? [^114kPFtG]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects 29% of US adults and is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data support contribution of several dietary and other lifestyle-related factors to the development of high blood pressure (BP). Several clinical trials investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications to reduce BP. Best evidence from randomized controlled trials supports BP-lowering effects of weight loss, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and dietary sodium (Na(+)) reduction in those with prehypertension, with more pronounced effects in those with hypertension. In hypertensive participants, the effects on BP of DASH combined with low Na(+) alone or with the addition of weight loss were greater than or equal to those of single-drug therapy. Trials where food was provided to participants were more successful in showing a BP-lowering effect. However, clinical studies with long-term follow-up revealed that lifestyle modifications were difficult to maintain. Findings from controlled trials of increased potassium, calcium, or magnesium intake, or reduction in alcohol intake revealed modest BP-lowering effects and are less conclusive. The reported effects of exercise independent of weight loss on BP are inconsistent.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111fKfwn]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — initiation of treatment according to office blood pressure anchors therapy to hypertension grade, risk, age, and thresholds. Prompt initiation of BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended in patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension at any level of cardiovascular (CV) risk, simultaneous with the initiation of lifestyle changes. In patients with grade 1 hypertension, lifestyle interventions are recommended to determine if this will normalize blood pressure (BP); in patients with grade 1 hypertension at low–moderate-risk and without evidence of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended if the patient remains hypertensive after a period of lifestyle intervention; and in patients with grade 1 hypertension and at high risk or with evidence of HMOD, prompt initiation of drug treatment is recommended simultaneously with lifestyle interventions. In fit older patients with hypertension (even if aged > 80 years), BP-lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention are recommended when systolic blood pressure (SBP) is ≥ 160 mmHg, while BP-lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention are recommended for fit older patients (> 65 years but not > 80 years) when SBP is in the grade 1 range (140–159 mmHg), provided that treatment is well tolerated. Antihypertensive treatment may also be considered in frail older patients if tolerated, and withdrawal of BP-lowering drug treatment on the basis of age, even when patients attain an age of > 80 years, is not recommended, provided that treatment is well tolerated. In patients with high–normal BP (130–139/85–89 mmHg), lifestyle changes are recommended and drug treatment may be considered when their CV risk is very high due to established cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary artery disease (CAD).

### Telmisartan [^1138cFtR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Telmisartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Telmisartan tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Is there a role for nurse-led blood pressure management in primary care? [^112sGKSh]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Adequate treatment of high blood pressure reduces the risk of strokes and other cardiovascular events, but current treatment in UK general practice is often inadequate. Nurse-led management of people with high blood pressure could lead to improvements due to strict adherence to protocols, agreed target blood pressure, better prescribing and compliance, and regular follow-up. However, a review of the literature shows a lack of robust evidence of the effectiveness of nurse-led hypertension management in primary care. There is a clear need for randomized controlled trials to see if nurse-led management is associated with better blood pressure control than routine care.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ACP and AAFP Recommendation 3 — some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk: recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and select treatment goals based on a periodic discussion of benefits and harms with the patient.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oZq7q]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the above guidelines, the WHO provides the most current and relevant evidence-based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment with pharmacological agents for hypertension in adults. The guidelines are expected to be valid for a period of 5 years. This period reflects the fact that new research findings are likely to become available in the meantime but also represents a feasible time frame, considering the costs, time and other resources that are needed to update such guidelines. If the evidence base or user needs change before the 5-year mark, consideration will be given to producing updates sooner. More large randomized controlled trials, powered for CVD and/or mortality outcomes, are needed to shed light on the research gaps mentioned in discussion above especially for subpopulations that have not been adequately represented in previous trials.

### Targeting multivariable risks: an opportunity for population high blood pressure control [^11189QTS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The incorporation of risk assessment in the hypertension treatment and control efforts has implications for the clinical treatment guidelines of high blood pressure. The evolution and modifications of the guidelines and recommendations for prevention, detection, treatment, and control of high blood pressure over the past 5 decades have been associated with lower blood pressure distributions and reduced cardiovascular disease risks. The updates and modifications of the clinical guidelines have been based on ongoing study results and findings providing evidence for inclusion in recommendations. Current hypertension guidelines have incorporated systematic reviews to produce evidence-based guidelines. The evidence-grading process has become the major component and activity for the development of clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension, as seen in the recent recommendations. However, there are significant evidence gaps in the risks associated with blood pressure levels with different populations, multiple risk factors, and comorbid conditions. Such variations have led to guidelines specific to the risk differential addressing specific characteristics, such as those associated with the treatment of hypertension in patients with ischemic heart disease. Current guidelines propose different blood pressure target levels, blood pressure values for initiating therapy, and different therapy regimens for the clinical management of hypertension based on the risks and comorbid conditions. However, the lack of clinical study evidence for the multiple stratifications of risks and corresponding treatment strategies have led to differences in recommendations. The lack of information leads to confusion and lack of consistency in the management of high blood pressure and subsequent risk benefit.

As high blood pressure prevention, management, and control continue to emerge and develop globally, the issues of hypertension risk management will be a major consideration for clinicians throughout the world. The World Hypertension League has identified the future needs and essential study evidence for the development of high blood pressure control strategies for the diverse populations with various risk levels. The current article contributes to the evidence gap in refining the risks for elevated blood pressure and proposing a mechanism to improve hypertension management by supplementing risk assessment with blood pressure measurements. These results provide a guide for future studies to provide evidence for the diverse hypertensive populations of the world.

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Amlodipine besylate (Norvasc) [^111UepAZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

NORVASC®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^114dERpR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosing and treating hypertension plays an important role in minimising the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Early and accurate diagnosis of hypertension, as well as regular monitoring, is essential to meet treatment targets. In this article, current recommendations for the screening and diagnosis of hypertension are reviewed. The evidence for treatment targets specified in contemporary guidelines is evaluated and recommendations from the USA, Canada, Europe and the UK are compared. Finally, consideration is given as to how diagnosis and management of hypertension might develop in the future.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115PhMLy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^11768XSv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ACP/AAFP guideline recommendations — blood pressure targets in adults aged 60 years or older: Recommendation 1: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke, cardiac events, and possibly mortality (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence); ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, andfor randomised controlled trials investigating blood pressure-lowering drug treatment, covering the period between Jan 1, 1966, and Sept 1, 2019, with no language restrictions. We searched MEDLINE using and expanding on the MeSH terms for "hypertension", "blood pressure", and "antihypertensive agents" including possible variations of the terms and relevant antihypertensive drug classes. We identified several individual trials and tabular meta-analyses with conflicting or little information on the effect of blood pressure-lowering treatment stratified by baseline blood pressure and previous cardiovascular disease status. In particular, information relating to heterogeneous treatment effects at normal or high-normal blood pressure categories was scant.

Added value of this study

In this collaborative project, we gathered individual participant-level data (IPD) from eligible large-scale trials of blood pressure-lowering treatment. With access to IPD from about 350 000 patients randomly assigned to treatment in 48 trials, this analysis is the largest and most detailed investigation of the stratified effects of pharmacological blood pressure-lowering. Participants were first divided into two groups: those with a previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and those without. Each group was then divided further into seven subgroups based on systolic blood pressure at study entry (< 120, 120–129, 130–139, 140–149, 150–159, 160–169, and ≥ 170 mm Hg). Over an average 4 years of follow-up, a 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure lowered the relative risk of major cardiovascular events by 10%. The risks for stroke, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, and death from cardiovascular disease were reduced by 13%, 13%, 8%, and 5%, respectively. Relative risk reductions were proportional to the intensity of blood pressure-lowering. Neither the presence of cardiovascular disease or the level of blood pressure at study entry modified the effect of treatment.

Implications of all the available evidence

This study calls for a change in clinical practice that predominantly confines antihypertensive treatment to people with higher than average blood pressure values. On the basis of this study, the decision to prescribe blood pressure medication should not be based simply on a previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or an individual's current blood pressure. Rather, blood pressure medication should be viewed as an effective tool for preventing cardiovascular disease when an individual's cardiovascular risk is elevated. Recommendations that specify a minimum blood pressure threshold for initiation or intensification of treatment, or a floor level for blood pressure reduction are not substantiated by this study.
