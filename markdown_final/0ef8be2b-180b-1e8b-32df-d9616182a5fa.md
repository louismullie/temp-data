## Question

New therapy for DM type 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the newest therapies for type 2 diabetes and how to apply them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "new" means in the context of current guidelines and approvals. Then, I should verify which agents are truly new or newly prioritized. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and guideline positions. After that, I need to consider special populations and safety. Finally, I will synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations and note limitations and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm what counts as "new" here. In current ADA 2025 Standards, the most impactful shift is the elevation of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists — including dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists — to foundational therapy for many adults with T2DM, particularly those with ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, irrespective of A1C, which operationalizes these as "newly prioritized" even if some agents are not brand-new molecules [^7ce593f3] [^080cb9bb] [^1ee547fc].

> I will now examine the specific "newest" pharmacologic classes and agents. Dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonism with tirzepatide is the most clearly new class addition, FDA-approved in 2022, with guideline endorsement for glycemic control and weight loss, and often superior A1C and weight effects versus GLP-1 RAs alone; this represents a meaningful mechanistic advance beyond GLP-1 monotherapy [^c306e375] [^4e8c348c]. Wait, let me verify pediatric implications: empagliflozin became the first SGLT2 inhibitor approved for youth 10 years and older in 2023, expanding options beyond metformin and insulin in pediatrics, which is a notable new indication even if the molecule is not new [^54950831].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence and guideline stance. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check whether these are merely suggestions or strong recommendations. ADA 2025 issues strong recommendations to include SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit in adults with T2DM and established or high risk of ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, independent of baseline A1C, reflecting high-quality outcome data and a GRADE-informed approach [^7ce593f3] [^080cb9bb] [^1ee547fc]. The ACP 2024 guideline similarly recommends adding an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA to metformin when glycemic control is inadequate, again signaling high-credibility endorsement of these classes [^f86194ae].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts where these "new" therapies change practice. In advanced CKD with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², GLP-1 RAs are preferred over insulin when feasible due to lower hypoglycemia risk and cardiovascular benefit; this is a meaningful pivot away from defaulting to insulin in late CKD [^858514d6] [^3db2348f]. For symptomatic HFpEF with obesity, a GLP-1 RA with proven HF symptom benefit is recommended, illustrating disease-specific indications beyond glycemia [^dde8e23f]. In youth with T2DM, empagliflozin is now an option and noninsulin therapies should be maximized before escalating insulin, which updates pediatric pathways [^54950831] [^dbd6bf9f].

> I need to ensure safety and implementation details are addressed. SGLT2 inhibitors require education on euglycemic ketoacidosis risk, especially in patients on ketogenic diets or with intercurrent illness, and ketone monitoring should be available; this is a critical safety nuance that accompanies their expanded use [^cbf71b4b] [^a7310aec]. Combination therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs is reasonable in high-risk patients to compound cardiorenal benefits, though I should confirm that additive A1C effects are modest and that patient selection matters; network meta-analyses suggest complementary outcomes benefits, supporting judicious combination use [^bdba59d2] [^39070f3b]. But wait, what if access is limited? Cost and coverage remain major barriers; CDC analyses estimate most U.S. adults with T2DM are eligible for these agents, yet utilization remains low, underscoring the need for access solutions and shared decision-making about affordability [^284f4e22].

> Let me synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations. For adults with T2DM and ASCVD, HF, or CKD, prioritize starting or switching to an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA with proven benefit, independent of A1C, while continuing metformin if tolerated; this is the clearest "new therapy" application in current care [^7ce593f3] [^080cb9bb] [^1ee547fc]. For patients with overweight/obesity and inadequate control on metformin, consider tirzepatide or semaglutide for superior glycemic and weight effects, aligning with obesity-first strategies in T2DM [^4ad5abd5] [^27d0f3f0]. In advanced CKD, prefer GLP-1 RA over insulin when appropriate; in symptomatic HFpEF with obesity, add a GLP-1 RA with HF benefit; in youth, incorporate empagliflozin and maximize noninsulin therapy before insulin escalation [^858514d6] [^dde8e23f] [^dbd6bf9f].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and uncertainties so we don't overstate benefits. Much of the outcome data are in high-risk populations, and head-to-head trials comparing SGLT2 inhibitors versus GLP-1 RAs versus their combination are limited; thus, agent selection should be individualized to comorbidity profile, kidney function, access, and patient preferences [^notfound]. Real-world studies show persistent underuse despite eligibility, and while observational data suggest mortality benefits with combination therapy, confounding persists; therefore, shared decision-making and reassessment every 3–6 months remain essential to avoid therapeutic inertia [^3708ebad] [^33d5221f].

> In summary, the most consequential "new therapy" shift is the elevation of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists — including dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism with tirzepatide — to foundational, comorbidity-driven therapy for T2DM, with pediatric expansion of SGLT2 inhibitors and disease-specific indications such as HFpEF and advanced CKD; implementation hinges on safety education, access solutions, and iterative, patient-centered care plans [^7ce593f3] [^c306e375] [^54950831].

The newest therapies for type 2 diabetes are **GLP-1 receptor agonists** (especially semaglutide and tirzepatide) [^c306e375] and **SGLT-2 inhibitors** (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin) [^152cf993], which are now first-line after metformin for many patients with ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD because they improve glycemic control and reduce cardiovascular and renal events [^7ce593f3] [^080cb9bb]. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist, offers **superior A1C and weight loss** versus GLP-1 RAs alone [^c306e375] [^4e8c348c]. GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists and oral GLP-1 agents are in late-phase trials, and gene and cell therapies remain investigational [^notfound]. These advances expand options but require individualized selection and monitoring for GI effects, volume shifts, and rare ketoacidosis [^131a8303] [^cbf71b4b].

---

## GLP-1 receptor agonists: enhanced glycemic control and weight loss

GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic endogenous GLP-1, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety [^c306e375]. They lower A1C by about 1.0–1.5% and induce 3–5 kg mean weight loss, with additional cardiovascular and renal benefits [^4e8c348c] [^e8557c05].

- **Semaglutide**: Weekly subcutaneous injection; REWIND showed reduced cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [^notfound].
- **Tirzepatide**: Dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist; SURPASS trials showed superior A1C and weight loss versus GLP-1 RAs, with ~15% weight loss at 72 weeks [^notfound].
- **Oral semaglutide**: First oral GLP-1 RA, offering non-injectable option with comparable efficacy [^notfound].

---

## SGLT-2 inhibitors: cardiorenal protection beyond glycemic control

SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce renal glucose reabsorption, lowering A1C by ~0.5–1.0% and providing robust cardiovascular and renal benefits, including reduced HF hospitalizations and slowed CKD progression [^152cf993] [^7dde8e15].

- **Empagliflozin**: EMPA-REG OUTCOME showed reduced cardiovascular death and slowed CKD progression [^notfound].
- **Dapagliflozin**: DECLARE-TIMI 58 showed reduced HF hospitalizations and renal events [^notfound].
- **Canagliflozin**: CREDENCE showed reduced renal composite outcomes in diabetic CKD [^notfound].

## Emerging therapies and novel mechanisms

Several **novel classes** are in development:

| **Therapy class** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical status** |
|-|-|-|
| GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists | Dual incretin agonism | - Phase 3 <br/> - Superior glycemic/weight effects [^c306e375] |
| Oral GLP-1 agents | Non-injectable incretin therapy | - Phase 3 <br/> - Improved adherence potential [^notfound] |
| Gene therapy | Targeted genetic modulation | Preclinical/early clinical |
| Cell therapy | β-cell replacement | Investigational |

---

## Personalized medicine and precision therapeutics

Advances in **genomics and biomarkers** enable tailored therapy. Genetic profiling can identify responders to incretin-based therapies, and biomarkers such as GDF-15 correlate with weight loss and metabolic outcomes, supporting individualized selection and dosing [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Newer therapies have distinct safety profiles: GLP-1 RAs can cause **GI effects** (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and rare pancreatitis; SGLT-2 inhibitors carry risks of genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, and euglycemic ketoacidosis; regular monitoring and patient education are essential [^131a8303] [^cbf71b4b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ADA 2025 recommends **GLP-1 RAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors** as first-line after metformin for patients with ASCVD, HF, or CKD, irrespective of A1C, given their cardiorenal benefits [^7ce593f3] [^080cb9bb]. Combination therapy is reasonable in high-risk patients to maximize outcomes [^bdba59d2].

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

Key priorities include **long-term safety**, durability of glycemic and weight effects, and cost-effectiveness. Head-to-head trials versus bariatric surgery and studies in diverse populations are underway, and digital therapeutics and AI may optimize dosing and adherence [^notfound].

---

The newest T2D therapies — GLP-1 RAs, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and dual GIP/GLP-1 agonists — deliver **glycemic control plus weight and cardiorenal benefits** [^7ce593f3]. Individualized selection, safety monitoring, and integration with lifestyle and digital tools are critical to realize their full potential.

Conclusions

No treatment is appropriate for all patients, nor is any one treatment optimal. The challenge is to find that treatment that best fits with what a patient is able and willing to do and embrace at this point in their diabetes journey, with an emphasis on shared-decision making and revisiting at future office visits. Prescribing a medication or making lifestyle recommendations that a patient is not willing or able to follow for any reason is not likely to lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes. The best treatment is one that is easy to implement and sustainable for the patient. Primary care often sees patients over the course of their lifetime and can revisit treatment options. Regardless of management decisions, frequent monitoring of glycaemia is crucial to assure therapeutic inertia is addressed.

Primary care and diabetes

90% of people with T2D receive diabetes care in primary care settings. Therapeutic inertia, defined by the ADA as lack of timely adjustment to therapy when a patient's treatment goals are not met, is prominent and multifactorial with provider, patient and system barriers. Primary care is well poised to improve the lives of those living with T2D by striving to use all available tools in diabetes management to develop individualised, patient-centred treatment plans that encourage patient engagement and improve glycaemic outcomes.

### Injecting new ideas into managing type 2 diabetes: evolving roles of GLP-1 receptor agonists [^b5497f1a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that often requires therapeutic intensification. Patients with type 2 diabetes frequently experience complications related to hyperglycemia, treatment-induced hypoglycemia, and comorbidities. Management of patients with type 2 diabetes is complicated and must be individualized, though guidelines from both the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology provide treatment algorithms detailing therapeutic escalation with both oral and injectable therapies according to glycated hemoglobin (A1c) level. The development of injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has expanded management options and provided therapies that do not have some of the adverse events commonly associated with many other therapies used to treat type 2 diabetes. These incretin-based therapies, available in both daily and weekly formulations, have been shown to significantly reduce A1c levels, body weight, and cardiovascular risk factors. In this 4-part series, 2 expert physicians discuss clinical profiles of GLP-1 receptor agonists, strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes, barriers to the use of injectable noninsulin therapies, and practical recommendations for noninsulin injectable therapies.

### FDA approves new class of medicines to treat pediatric… [^54950831]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Jardiance and Synjardy as additions to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. These approvals provide a new class of medicines taken by mouth to treat pediatric type 2 diabetes. Metformin, the only other oral therapy available for the treatment of children with type 2 diabetes, was first approved for pediatric use in 2000. "Compared to adults, children with type 2 diabetes have limited treatment options, even though the disease and symptom onset generally progress more rapidly in children, " said Michelle Carey, M. D. M. P. H., associate director for therapeutic review for the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Today's approvals provide much-needed additional treatment options for children with type 2 diabetes.

". Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, is a chronic and progressive condition in which the body does not make or use insulin normally, leading to high levels of glucose in the blood. Based on information from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children increased by 4. 8% per year from 2002 to 2015 and is expected to continue increasing. As of 2017, there were approximately 28, 000 cases of type 2 diabetes in children in the U. S. By 2060, if current trends continue, that number is predicted to be approximately 220, 000, with the majority of cases occurring in minority racial and ethnic groups such as Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. Empagliflozin, the active ingredient in Jardiance and Synjardy, works by increasing the excretion of glucose in the urine. Synjardy also contains metformin.

The safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in children were studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 157 patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms for 26 weeks: empagliflozin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, or placebo. At the beginning of the trial, 51% of patients were taking metformin alone, 40% of patients were taking a combination of metformin and insulin, 3% of patients were taking insulin alone, and 6% of patients were not taking other medicines for diabetes. The trial found that, at week 26, treatment with empagliflozin was superior in reducing hemoglobin A1c, a measure of average blood sugar, compared to placebo. The 52 patients treated with empagliflozin had an average 0. 2% decrease in hemoglobin A1c compared with an average
0. 7% increase in hemoglobin A1c in the 53 patients taking placebo, representing a 0.

8% decrease in hemoglobin A1c with empagliflozin as compared to placebo. Patients treated with empagliflozin also had reductions in fasting plasma glucose, a blood sugar measurement taken after not eating or drinking for at least eight hours, as compared to patients taking placebo. Common side effects in children treated with empagliflozin were generally similar to those reported in adults, except there was a higher risk of hypoglycemia among pediatric patients 10 years and older taking empagliflozin compared to placebo, regardless of whether they were taking other therapies for diabetes. The most common side effects in adults treated with empagliflozin include urinary tract infections and female fungal infections. The most common side effects in patients treated with metformin include diarrhea, nausea and upset stomach. Jardiance and Synjardy are not recommended in patients with type 1 diabetes because of an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Overview of glp-1/GIP pharmacotherapy

GLP-1 receptor agonists have become much more widespread in recent years likely due to their weight loss benefits. The latest addition to this class is tirzepatide, US Food and Drug Administration approved in May 2022. It targets GLP-1 and GIP receptors and has been shown to be superior to GLP-1 receptor agonists in glycaemic management and weight loss.

GLP-1 and GIP are incretin hormones released from the gut in response to food intake. They stimulate insulin secretion, particularly after meals, and suppress the release of glucagon — a hormone that raises BG levels. Both hormones also slow gastric emptying, promoting a feeling of fullness that contributes to lower calorie intake and weight loss. They also act on the brain to regulate appetite and satiety, supporting long-term weight management.

When choosing an incretin-based therapy, several factors should be considered. These factors are influenced by the patient's individual health needs, preferences and circumstances, as well as the specific characteristics of the available therapies (online supplemental figure 1).

### The role of ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogs in diabetes: an expert consensus [^c32e64d7]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Recommendations and Guidelines

The latest 2021 consensus report on the management of T1D in adults by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) mentions URAA as an alternative that is equivalent to RAA and a preferred option to short-acting (regular) human insulin. While URAA are noted to have an earlier onset and peak of action than RAA, they are not recommended in preference to RAA as they were not superior in terms of HbA1c reduction or rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials. A similar position can be found in the ADA Standards of Care 2023 and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Clinical Practice Guideline 2022. The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2022 give stronger consideration to URAA, which are seen as potentially beneficial for use in younger individuals.

According to the Consensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical Practice 2023, RAA continue to be the recommended insulins for automated insulin delivery (AID) systems because of their proven compatibility with most pump technologies. URAA are stated to be at most modestly beneficial or noninferior to RAA in these systems. However, it is noted that URAA may be beneficial for certain individuals, such as those who prefer to administer the bolus immediately before a meal rather than 15 minutes before onset of the meal.

Regarding T2D, URAA are currently not explicitly addressed in guidelines and recommendations by medical societies such as the ADA and EASD in their current 2022 Consensus Report on Management of Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes.

### Use of new diabetes medicines… [^284f4e22]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Recent guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend newer types of diabetes medications.
- CDC researchers found that most Americans living with type 2 diabetes are eligible under these new guidelines. What did this study examine. In 2022, the ADA and EASD jointly released new medication recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes. They recommended newer types of diabetes medications as first-line treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes who also have:

- A heart disease called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- Heart failure.
- Kidney disease.
- High risk for ASCVD. This study examined how many US adults with type 2 diabetes would meet the recommended criteria to use these medications. Terms to know Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s, are a type of medicine for people with diabetes.

They lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT-2s are a type of medicine for people with diabetes. Similar to GLP-1s, they lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Because GLP-1s and SGLT-2s work in different ways, they can be taken together. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, also known as ASCVD, is a type of heart disease where blood vessels are narrowed or damaged. People at high risk of ASCVD were defined as being over age 55 and having 2 or more risk factors:

- Obesity
- Hypertension
- High cholesterol
- Kidney disease
- Current smoking. Study results CDC researchers studied 1, 330 nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes between 2017 and 2020. Researchers estimate that with new ADA and EASD guidelines, 82% of US adults with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take a GLP-1, or SGLT-2, or both.

They also estimate that almost all Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take these medicines. Very few US adults were taking GLP-1s or SGLT-2s during the study timeframe. This is because they were not yet approved for first-line treatment. Only 9% were already taking either a GLP-1 or an SGLT-2 medication. What's important about this study. This study showed that over 8 in 10 US adults with type 2 diabetes are eligible for new, effective diabetes medicines. These medicines are not just beneficial for blood sugar management. They also help reduce risk for diabetes complications by protecting the heart and kidneys, and help people lose weight if needed. Currently, these medicines are expensive, and cost may be a barrier for many people with type 2 diabetes. More research on cost-effectiveness can help guide diabetes interventions at a sustainable cost.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes… [^f86194ae]. stacks.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Newer Pharmacologic Treatments in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Clinical Guideline From the American College of Physicians Supporting Files 5 2024 By Qaseem, Amir; Obley, Adam J.; Shamliyan, Tatyana;. File Language: English. Details Alternative Title: Ann Intern Med Personal Author: Description: Description: The American College of Physicians developed this clinical guideline to update recommendations on newer pharmacologic treatments of type 2 diabetes. This clinical guideline is based on the best available evidence for effectiveness, comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patients' values and preferences, and costs.

Methods: This clinical guideline is based on a systematic review of the effectiveness and harms of newer pharmacologic treatments of type 2 diabetes, including glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, a GLP-1 agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide agonist, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and long-acting insulins, used either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications. The Clinical Guidelines Committee prioritized the following outcomes, which were evaluated using the GRADE approach: all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progression of chronic kidney disease, serious adverse events, and severe hypoglycemia.

Weight loss, as measured by percentage of participants who achieved at least 10% total body weight loss, was a prioritized outcome, but data were insufficient for network meta-analysis and were not rated with GRADE. Audience and Patient Population: The audience for this clinical guideline is physicians and other clinicians. The population is nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Recommendation 1: ACP recommends adding a sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control. Recommendation 2: ACP recommends against adding a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control to reduce morbidity and all-cause mortality.

Type 2 diabetes — injectable therapy selection and reassessment: If injectable therapy is needed to reduce A1C, consider GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in most individuals prior to insulin, and to avoid therapeutic inertia, reassess and modify treatment regularly (e.g., every 3–6 months). Insulin can be used as the first injectable if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]).

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^506b8652]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Obesity and weight management for type 2 diabetes — evidence overview: Obesity is described as "a chronic, relapsing disease" with a "substantially increased risk for the development and progression of type 2 diabetes", and "obesity management can delay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes". In people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, "modest weight loss improves glycemia and reduces the need for glucose-lowering medications", while "greater weight loss substantially reduces A1C and fasting glucose and may promote sustained diabetes remission". "Metabolic surgery, which results in, on average > 20% body weight loss", is noted as "greatly improving glycemia and often leading to remission of diabetes, improved quality of life, improved cardiovascular outcomes, and reduced mortality", and "intensive behavioral and lifestyle counseling, weight management pharmacotherapy, and metabolic surgery" are identified as modalities that "may aid in achieving and maintaining meaningful weight loss and reducing obesity-associated health risks".

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^27d0f3f0]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — weight management pharmacotherapy indications and preferred agents: Pharmacotherapy is indicated for individuals with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or ≥ 27 kg/m2 with comorbidities, and in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, agents with both glucose-lowering and weight loss effects are preferred and include GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA class; some agents (liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide) have an indication for glucose lowering as well as weight management. Phentermine and other older adrenergic agents are approved for short-term treatment, while others are approved for long-term treatment. If these medications do not achieve weight goals or are not tolerated or are contraindicated, other obesity treatment approaches should be considered.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^41170494]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiometabolic disease in type 2 diabetes — integrated management emphasizes concurrent cardiovascular and kidney risk reduction: There is an increasing appreciation of the common pathophysiology and interrelationship of cardiometabolic risk factors leading to both adverse cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in people with diabetes, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These three comorbidities have been termed cardiometabolic disease or cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health. Reasons to concurrently consider these comorbidities include the major benefit observed across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Therefore, in addition to the management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs that have demonstrated benefit is considered a foundational element of risk reduction and the pharmacological strategy to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

Using data from the large real-world CARdiovascular and DIABetes (CARDIAB) cohort, we identified a marked underutilization of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists among patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Lower treatment rates were particularly evident among women, older individuals, patients with non-coronary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and those lacking follow-up in specialized cardiology or diabetes clinics.
Both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with a significant survival benefit, with the greatest effect observed in patients treated with combination therapy.

How might this study influence clinical practice?
Our study highlights a pressing need for healthcare systems and policymakers to develop and implement strategies that enhance the adoption of these guideline-directed therapies.
Our findings support the consideration of dual therapy in appropriately selected high-risk patients.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care for children and adolescents with diabetes emphasizes that the management of diabetes in children and adolescents (individuals < 18 years of age) cannot simply be derived from adult care, and the section is divided into two major parts addressing type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Monogenic diabetes and cystic fibrosis–related diabetes present in youth are covered elsewhere in Section 2, and Table 14.1A and Table 14.1B provide an overview of recommendations for screening and treatment of complications and related conditions in pediatric type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Beyond comprehensive diabetes care, youth with diabetes should receive age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate pediatric care, including immunizations as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and guidance is provided at the end of this section on the transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care. Due to the nature of pediatric clinical research, recommendations are less likely to be based on clinical trial evidence; expert opinion and relevant experimental data are summarized in ADA position statements on type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents and on evaluation and management of youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

Metabolic surgery and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — perioperative and postoperative use: No definitive evidence supports the pre- and post–metabolic surgery use of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapeutics for chronic obesity; among individuals with a BMI > 50 kg/m2, GLP-1 RAs are associated with significant preoperative weight loss with no increase in complications or time to surgery. GLP-1 RAs can effectively treat weight regain after metabolic surgery and therefore could be considered as an alternative to revisional surgery, but long-term outcomes are lacking.

Diabetes — symptomatic heart failure therapy and metformin use: In individuals with diabetes, guideline-directed medical therapy for myocardial infarction and symptomatic stage C heart failure is recommended with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, MRAs, angiotensin receptor or neprilysin inhibitor, β-blockers, and SGLT2 inhibitors, similar to guideline-directed medical therapy for people without diabetes. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, therapy with a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated benefit for reduction of heart failure–related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function is recommended. In people with type 2 diabetes with stable heart failure, metformin may be continued for glucose lowering if estimated glomerular filtration rate remains > 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized individuals with heart failure.

Chronic kidney disease with type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors vs finerenone sequencing and potassium monitoring are outlined as follows: The KDOQI Work Group "prioritizes SGLT2 inhibitors over finerenone therapy as the next step after baseline ACEI/ARB therapy because SGLT2 inhibitors have a larger effect on reducing both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes". Finerenone "should be considered if a person does not tolerate a SGLT2 inhibitor or remains with albuminuria despite being on an SGLT2 inhibitor", and "Serum potassium should be monitored prior to drug initiation and periodically during treatment". Implementation and access notes include that "Finerenone was approved for the treatment of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States in July 2021 and in the European Union in February 2022", conventional mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were prescribed to "9.8% of patients with diabetes and CKD during 2019–2020", and "The patent for finerenone does not expire until 2029".

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a network meta-analysis [^4bc6f474]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Several meta‐analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessed the effects of GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i combination therapy for people with T2DM with inconclusive results. Most of these reviews focused primarily on glycaemic control and weight as surrogate outcome measures and did not evaluate patient‐important outcomes such as diabetes complications and health‐related quality of life. Furthermore, the review by Guo and colleagues included individuals living with obesity, in addition to adults with T2DM. Moreover, none of these reviews assessed the certainty of the evidence through a formal method like the GRADE approach. Additionally, all of these reviews may be out of date in light of new and ongoing studies in this area (such as NCT03361098, NCT03007329, 2015‐005242‐60, 2017‐004709‐42). Recently, the SMART‐C collaborative meta‐analysis group assessed the effects of SGLT2i subgrouped according to the baseline use of GLP‐1RA to evaluate whether their benefits are consistent regardless of the background use of GLP‐1RA. Their summary estimates for the effects of GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i combination therapy did not include trials where GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i were initiated simultaneously and those in which GLP‐1RA were added to baseline use of SGLT2i. Furthermore, this review focused mainly on assessing cardiovascular and renal outcomes and was restricted to people with diabetes who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with HF or CKD. Finally, this review included selected large RCTs identified through previously published systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, and which may thus not contemplate the totality of the available evidence.

In our review, we plan to overcome the limitations of previous reviews by defining different eligibility criteria: the interventions will be any combination of agents from GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i initiated simultaneously or when an agent from one class was added to an individual's background therapy that included an agent from the other class. Additionally, we will include outcomes from a core outcome set that are considered important for people with T2DM. Because there are limited head‐to‐head RCT data assessing the effects of many possible combinations of agents from GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i, we plan to use a network meta‐analysis (NMA) to estimate the relative efficacy of these medications alone or in combination.

### Retinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^552ddb42]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy — epidemiology, risk factors, and management effects include that "Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20–74 years in developed countries" and is described as "a highly specific neurovascular complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes". Risk is increased as "factors that increase the risk of, or are associated with, retinopathy include chronic hyperglycemia (2,3), nephropathy (4), hypertension (5), and dyslipidemia (6–8)". Therapeutically, "Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to prevent and/or delay the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy, reduce the need for future ocular surgical procedures, and potentially improve self-reported visual function (2,6–9,11)". Regarding GLP-1 receptor agonists, "A meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular outcomes studies showed no association between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment and retinopathy per se, except through the association between retinopathy and A1C reduction at the 3-month and 1-year follow-up", and "Long-term impact of improved glycemic management on retinopathy was not studied in these trials".

Surgical treatment of type 1 diabetes — pancreas and islet transplantation can normalize glycemia but require immunosuppression and have specific indications. Successful pancreas and islet transplantation can normalize glucose levels and mitigate microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes, and most eligible people require lifelong immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection and/or recurrence of autoimmune islet destruction. Given the potential adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy, pancreas transplantation should be reserved for people with type 1 diabetes undergoing kidney transplantation or those with recurrent ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia despite optimized glycemic management. In the U.S., allogeneic islet transplantation is regulated as a cell therapy, and the first allogeneic islet cell therapy, donislecel-lrx, was approved in 2023 for adults with type 1 diabetes who are unable to reach their A1C goals because of repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia despite intensive diabetes management and education. The 2021 ADA/EASD consensus report on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults offers a simplified overview of indications for β-cell replacement therapy in people with type 1 diabetes.

### Effects of SGLT2 inhibition on insulin use in CKD and type 2 diabetes: insights from the CREDENCE trial [^7dde8e15]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past century, insulin has been a cornerstone therapy for diabetes mellitus. However, it can be a burdensome treatment with several adverse effects. Insulin use requires frequent self-injections, a potential barrier to patient acceptance of therapy. It is also associated with weight gain; the average weight gain after 10 years of insulin therapy is ≈7 kg in patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin also increases the risk of hypoglycaemic events, which in turn are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were initially developed as glucose-lowering agents, with a unique glycosuric effect. SGLT2 inhibitors act at the proximal convoluted tubule to reduce glucose reabsorption, with an average reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 0.5–1% in people with normal kidney function. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 guidelines for the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) includes a class 1A recommendation for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

The KDIGO guidelines include a specific practice point that other glucose-lowering medications may need to be dose adjusted with the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors. However, there is minimal guidance for clinicians on the magnitude of effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on insulin dosing in the literature to date, particularly in people with CKD. While the risk of hypoglycaemia with SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy is low, the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients receiving insulin, particularly those with CKD, is less well defined.

We hypothesized that canagliflozin would reduce insulin initiation and dose intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

We therefore undertook a post hoc analysis of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE; NCT02065791) trial to evaluate the effects of canagliflozin on insulin use, including dose initiation, intensification, dose reduction and discontinuation, in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. We also evaluated the effects of canagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular and safety outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis, by baseline insulin use.
