## Question

How IDA can be prevented and treated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia across populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining iron deficiency anemia and distinguishing it from iron deficiency without anemia. Then, I should verify population-specific prevention strategies for pregnancy, infants and children, and adults. Next, I will examine screening and diagnostic thresholds by population and context. After that, I need to review treatment algorithms, including oral versus intravenous iron, dosing, and monitoring. Finally, I should consider special scenarios such as IBD, CKD, perioperative care, and bariatric surgery, and close with a concise, practical summary that reconciles guideline differences and highlights evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by low hemoglobin with evidence of depleted iron stores, whereas iron deficiency without anemia reflects depleted stores with normal hemoglobin; both can impair function and should be addressed when identified, particularly in high-risk groups such as pregnancy, infants, and chronic disease states [^11189XPC] [^112kTtQT].

> Now, prevention in pregnancy. Wait, let me verify the conflicting guidance before I jump to conclusions. The USPSTF issues an I statement for both screening and routine supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons due to insufficient evidence on maternal and infant outcomes, so it neither recommends for nor against universal screening or routine supplementation in this exact context [^115Pf11c] [^111gy53h] [^116KCY7v]. In contrast, ACOG recommends initiating low-dose iron supplementation in the first trimester to reduce maternal anemia at delivery, reflecting obstetric practice norms and the high physiologic iron demand of pregnancy, even though this is not a USPSTF endorsement [^111k5sAa]. I should also note that while supplementation improves maternal hematologic indices, high-quality outcome data remain limited, which explains the USPSTF uncertainty and underscores the need for better trials that distinguish prevention from treatment and use adequate doses [^116Tqfvb] [^116j2MUD].

> For infants and children, I need to check age-specific prevention. In the first 6 months, exclusive breastfeeding is generally protective due to fetal iron stores and breast milk iron bioavailability, though delayed cord clamping can further improve iron status, especially in preterm or small-for-gestational-age infants; beyond 6 months, introduce iron-rich complementary foods and continue breastfeeding or use iron-fortified formula to prevent deficiency [^111tHkQG] [^114Wx4vx]. Hold on, I should verify screening recommendations. The USPSTF finds insufficient evidence for universal screening of asymptomatic children 6–24 months, whereas the AAP supports screening around 12 months; in practice, selective screening is reasonable for high-risk children such as preterm or low birth weight infants, those with limited iron intake, or socioeconomic risk factors [^114g15Gg] [^1112NvEY] [^112emJzc].

> For adults, let me consider diet and risk modification. Emphasizing iron-rich foods and enhancers of absorption, such as vitamin C, and minimizing inhibitors like excessive tea or coffee with meals can reduce risk; in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, address the gynecologic source of blood loss to prevent recurrent iron deficiency, and in older adults, maintain vigilance for occult gastrointestinal blood loss and malabsorption [^114GoKMn] [^114QnEQf] [^116yAa5W].

> Next, I should review screening and diagnosis thresholds. In pregnancy, anemia is commonly defined as hemoglobin less than 110 g/L in the first trimester and less than 105 g/L in the second and third trimesters, with ferritin less than 30 µg/L supporting iron deficiency in this context; however, the USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient for universal screening in asymptomatic pregnant persons, so practice varies and often relies on clinical judgment and local protocols [^112851YH] [^114evuu2] [^115Pf11c]. In children, microcytosis on CBC with low ferritin supports iron deficiency, but I should confirm that no single noninvasive test has high accuracy for universal screening in early childhood, reinforcing the USPSTF's I statement and supporting selective strategies [^1112NvEY] [^112emJzc]. In adults with suspected IDA, a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks of iron therapy is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency even if iron studies are equivocal, which I should remember when labs are confounded by inflammation [^114J4SK1].

> I will now examine treatment principles. First-line therapy is oral iron for most patients because it is effective, inexpensive, and safe; ferrous sulfate is commonly preferred for cost reasons, and no oral formulation has clear superiority over others, though tolerability varies and can be optimized with dosing strategies and co-administration of vitamin C [^111yT1Xa] [^113xmMC9]. Wait, I should double-check dosing nuances. Traditional teaching favored 150–200 mg elemental iron daily, but emerging data suggest once-daily or alternate-day dosing may improve absorption and tolerability for some patients, so I should individualize and reassess adherence and side effects if response is suboptimal [^11531s8p] [^113xmMC9].

> For pregnancy, I need to ensure I align with obstetric guidance. ACOG recommends adding iron supplementation beyond prenatal vitamins when IDA is diagnosed, with typical treatment doses of elemental iron around 100–200 mg daily in divided doses; if oral iron is not tolerated or not effective, or if severe deficiency presents late in gestation, parenteral iron should be considered to achieve timely repletion before delivery [^115Kkpeh] [^115ptE7u]. Hold on, I should verify expected response. Many guidelines anticipate a hemoglobin rise of about 10 g/L within 2–4 weeks if adherence and absorption are adequate, which helps me judge early whether the regimen is working or needs adjustment [^114J4SK1].

> For infants and children, I should confirm weight-based dosing. The recommended treatment dose is 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 1–3 divided doses for 3–6 months to replete stores and correct anemia, with close follow-up of hemoglobin and reticulocyte response to confirm efficacy and adherence [^112emJzc] [^114pF4M5].

> For adults with confirmed IDA, I need to ensure I do not delay iron while awaiting full gastrointestinal evaluation. BSG advises not to defer iron replacement while investigations are pending unless colonoscopy is imminent, and to use a structured care pathway with senior clinician oversight to coordinate diagnostics and therapy efficiently [^1114eHoJ] [^1118ixYD]. But wait, what if the patient is premenopausal and otherwise healthy? AGA suggests bidirectional endoscopy over iron alone in asymptomatic premenopausal women with IDA given the small but real malignancy risk, though this is a conditional recommendation and shared decision-making is important when alternative explanations are plausible [^115oqn8e].

> Now, indications for intravenous iron. I should confirm that IV iron is appropriate when oral iron is not tolerated, not absorbed, or when rapid repletion is needed. Preferred IV formulations are those that correct the deficit in 1–2 infusions, and true anaphylaxis is rare; most reactions are complement activation–related pseudo-allergies that can be managed supportively, which reassures me about safety in monitored settings [^113xmMC9]. Let me consider specific scenarios. In IBD, IV iron achieves higher odds of hemoglobin rise and better treatment continuity than oral iron, and ECCO recommends IV first-line when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL or disease is active; in CKD, IV iron is commonly used to overcome functional iron restriction and blood loss; after bariatric surgery, IV iron is preferred due to malabsorption; and in the perioperative setting, IV iron can expedite correction of IDA and reduce transfusions when time is limited [^116FymGj] [^115RRCTu] [^115RRCTu] [^1166Qywe] [^1115AV6R] [^114AY7tp].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I need to check hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks to confirm an early rise, assess ferritin at 4–8 weeks to document repletion, and continue therapy for about 3 months after normalization to rebuild stores; if the hemoglobin rise is inadequate, I should verify adherence, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, or an alternative diagnosis before escalating therapy [^114J4SK1] [^11531s8p]. Hold on, I should verify that in inflammatory states ferritin may be misleading and that transferrin saturation can help distinguish absolute from functional iron deficiency, guiding whether IV iron is more appropriate than oral in those contexts [^11189XPC].

> Special scenarios deserve explicit attention. In IBD, I should screen regularly for iron deficiency and treat even mild anemia because it meaningfully impairs quality of life; IV iron is often first-line when anemia is moderate to severe or disease is active, with close monitoring for recurrence and retreatment triggers such as ferritin less than 100 µg/L or hemoglobin less than 12–13 g/dL depending on sex [^115mg2GW] [^114k8Tww]. In CKD, I must balance the risks of iron overload with the benefits of correcting absolute and functional deficiency, using IV iron judiciously and aligning with nephrology protocols for ESA use when indicated [^115RRCTu]. In perioperative care, early detection and treatment of anemia, with preference for IV iron when time to surgery is short, can reduce transfusions and improve outcomes; allowing 1–2 weeks after parenteral iron and 3–8 weeks after oral iron before complex surgeries is prudent when feasible [^117Q2v51] [^1115AV6R] [^1128uafv]. After bariatric surgery, I should maintain a low threshold for IV iron and evaluate for ulcer-related bleeding if IDA persists despite therapy [^114DUyCn].

> I should also address the etiologic workup. In adult men and postmenopausal women with IDA, gastrointestinal evaluation for malignancy and other sources of blood loss is indicated; in premenopausal women, gynecologic sources should be prioritized, but bidirectional endoscopy remains reasonable depending on risk tolerance and clinical context [^116yAa5W] [^115oqn8e]. Let me reconsider the role of risk stratification. Using age, sex, hemoglobin, and MCV can refine gastrointestinal cancer risk and guide the urgency and extent of endoscopic evaluation in IDA [^1169QSJE].

> Finally, I need to ensure I reconcile guideline differences and evidence gaps. The USPSTF's I statements for pregnancy reflect limited high-quality outcome data and do not negate the physiologic rationale or the hematologic benefits of iron; conversely, ACOG and many international bodies continue to support screening and supplementation based on obstetric experience and the high prevalence of deficiency, emphasizing individualized care and shared decision-making until stronger evidence emerges [^115Pf11c] [^111k5sAa] [^114QHjnG]. For children, the absence of universal screening recommendations should not deter vigilant selective screening and prompt treatment of confirmed IDA, given potential neurodevelopmental risks and the safety of oral iron in appropriate doses [^112emJzc] [^114pF4M5].

> In summary, prevention centers on population-specific strategies such as first-trimester iron in pregnancy, iron-rich complementary feeding and delayed cord clamping in infants, and dietary counseling in adults; diagnosis relies on hemoglobin with ferritin and, when inflammation is present, transferrin saturation; treatment is oral iron first-line with careful adherence and absorption optimization, escalating to IV iron for intolerance, malabsorption, or when rapid repletion is needed; and throughout, I should monitor early and systematically, investigate the cause of IDA in adults, and tailor choices to patient context and evolving evidence [^111k5sAa] [^112emJzc] [^113xmMC9] [^11189XPC] [^116yAa5W].

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is best prevented by **dietary iron intake** (iron-rich foods, vitamin C to enhance absorption, limit cow's milk in toddlers) [^114pF4M5] and **targeted screening** in high-risk groups (pregnant women, infants, adolescents, heavy menstrual bleeding, chronic disease) [^115mg2GW] [^1112NvEY]. For treatment, **oral iron** (ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) is first-line; continue for 3 months after normalization to replete stores [^113xmMC9] [^111yT1Xa]. Use **IV iron** when oral therapy fails, is not tolerated, or rapid repletion is needed (e.g. severe anemia, CKD, IBD, bariatric surgery, late pregnancy) [^116FymGj] [^115VPcNR] [^1166Qywe] [^116HGRXx]. Address the underlying cause to prevent recurrence, and monitor hemoglobin and ferritin to guide therapy and confirm repletion [^11189XPC] [^114J4SK1].

---

## Prevention strategies

### Dietary measures

- **Iron-rich foods**: Red meat, poultry, fish, legumes, dark leafy greens, and iron-fortified cereals [^notfound].
- **Vitamin C**: Enhances absorption; pair iron-rich foods with citrus, tomatoes, or supplements [^113xmMC9].
- **Limit cow's milk**: Excess cow's milk (> 24 oz/day) in toddlers increases IDA risk [^116AsYHT].

---

### Supplementation

- **Pregnancy**: Low-dose daily iron (30 mg elemental) from the first trimester reduces maternal anemia at delivery [^notfound].
- **Infants**: Breastfeed exclusively to 6 months; introduce iron-fortified cereals at 6 months; formula should be iron-fortified [^111Nshzw].
- **Adolescents**: Periodic iron supplementation in menstruating adolescents reduces IDA risk [^notfound].

---

### Screening

Screening should be **population-specific**: universal screening in pregnancy [^112UfB8Z], targeted screening in infants, adolescents, and women with heavy menstrual bleeding [^1112NvEY], and screening in chronic diseases (CKD, IBD, heart failure) [^115mg2GW].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Oral iron therapy

- **First-line**: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day; alternate-day dosing improves absorption and tolerability [^113xmMC9].
- **Duration**: Continue for 3 months after hemoglobin normalization to replete stores [^notfound].
- **Adherence**: Address GI side effects; consider alternate-day dosing or switching formulations [^11531s8p].

---

### Intravenous iron therapy

Intravenous iron is **indicated** for intolerance or nonresponse to oral iron, malabsorption (e.g. IBD, bariatric surgery), severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL), or when rapid repletion is needed (e.g. CKD, late pregnancy) [^115VPcNR] [^1166Qywe] [^116HGRXx]. Common formulations include ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose, and ferric derisomaltose, with ferric carboxymaltose enabling repletion in 1–2 infusions [^notfound].

---

### Addressing underlying causes

Addressing underlying causes entails identifying and treating sources of **blood loss** (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia) [^116yAa5W] and managing chronic diseases such as CKD, IBD, and heart failure to reduce recurrent IDA [^115RRCTu] [^114k8Tww].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should track **hemoglobin** at 2–4 week intervals initially, then every 4–8 weeks until stable [^notfound]. Ferritin should be checked to confirm repletion and guide therapy, especially in chronic disease [^11189XPC]. Long-term surveillance should continue periodic monitoring in high-risk patients to detect recurrence early [^115mg2GW].

### Screening and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy: a review and appraisal of current international guidelines [^116fbpq9]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy is a common diagnosis that is associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. There remains uncertainty regarding how best to screen for, prevent, and treat established IDA in pregnancy. There is no consensus on the benefits of routine iron supplementation in pregnancy, with concerns regarding potential harmful effects of routine iron supplementation in women who are iron replete. Fourteen international guidelines were selected and appraised and compared by a multidisciplinary team. The AGREE II GRS tool was used. Each reviewer independently made their own assessment, and the scores from 1 to 7 were also collated and averaged for an overall score incorporating seven domains: process of development, clarity of presentation, completeness of reporting, clinical validity, and overall quality. The reviewers' scores were also individually compared according to discipline. The mean score across all the guidelines was 4.4 (range 3.5–6.5). Only half of the guidelines recommend routine iron in pregnancy. In terms of screening recommendations, five guidelines recommend screening with ferritin in addition to a full blood count in pregnancy, two recommend selective screening with ferritin for at risk groups only, and one guideline suggests using ferritin where feasible. Although many of the guidelines recommend similar doses of oral elemental iron of 100–200mg daily for the treatment of established IDA in pregnancy, two recommend twice or three times daily dosing. Only five guidelines give hemoglobin rises to expect within specific timeframes. There remains a need to clarify the optimal screening method, dosing regimen, timing, and route of iron supplementation in pregnancy. Robust randomized controlled data are needed to guide appropriate prevention and management.

### Iron deficiency anemia in women across the life span [^114QnEQf]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a global health issue with disproportionately high prevalence in women. In addition to being an independent risk factor for decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality, anemia in women has been linked to unfavorable outcomes of pregnancy and other issues for children born to anemic women. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in many populations. Guidelines recommend proactive screening for anemia, particularly in the preoperative setting. Once anemia is diagnosed, treatment should be based on etiology (most commonly, iron deficiency followed, in order of prevalence, by inflammation or chronic disease). Iron supplementation (oral and intravenous) offers safe and effective treatment for anemia associated with iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic disease may be more challenging to treat, and attention must be given to the underlying disease, along with use of hematinic agents. Given its enormous impact on the health and well-being of women and the availability of simple and effective treatment options, anemia should never be left unmanaged.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115mg2GW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are some of the most common systemic complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Symptoms such as fatigue, reduced ability to concentrate and reduced exercise tolerance can mimic common symptoms of IBD and can therefore easily be overseen. Furthermore, clinicians tend to see mild to moderate anemia as an inevitable accompaniment of IBD that is sufficiently explained by the underlying disease and does not require further workup. But in contrast to these clinical routines, current guidelines recommend that any degree of anemia in patients with IBD should be further evaluated and treated. Multiple studies have shown that anemia is a main factor for decreased quality of life (QoL) in patients with IBD. Correction of anemia, however, can significantly improve the QoL of patients with IBD. It is therefore recommended that every patient with IBD is regularly screened for iron deficiency and anemia. If detected, appropriate workup and treatment should be initiated. Over the last years, a number of new diagnostic tools and treatment options have been developed. Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety of newer formulations of intravenous iron in patients with IBD and have compared oral and intravenous iron in various situations. Treatment recommendations have changed and new evidence-based guidelines were developed. However, to date these guidelines are still not widely implemented in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the need for treatment for every level of anemia in patients with IBD and to provide some practical guidance for screening, diagnostics, treatment and follow up of IDA in patients with IBD following current international guidelines.

### Iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease: updates on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115RRCTu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a complication that affects a majority of individuals with advanced CKD. Although relative deficiency of erythropoietin production is the major driver of anemia in CKD, iron deficiency stands out among the mechanisms contributing to the impaired erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced kidney function. Iron deficiency plays a significant role in anemia in CKD. This may be due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation. The traditional biomarkers used for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with CKD have limitations, leading to persistent challenges in the detection and monitoring of IDA in these patients. Here, we review the pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD, we discuss the literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of IDA in CKD, and we summarize the available oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD. Two important issues are addressed, including the potential risks of a more liberal approach to iron supplementation as well as the potential risks and benefits of IV versus oral iron supplementation in patients with CKD.

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries? [^111whdvc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a major public health problem that affects over a third of the global population, causing 68 million disability-adjusted life years (nearly 9% of total). Anemia of any etiology increases the risk of child mortality and morbidity, and specifically iron deficiency (ID) anemia has been associated with harmful effects on cognitive and physical development and on the immune function of children. – Children less than 5 years of age, especially those living in low- and middle-income countries, have the highest frequency of anemia, and it is the only age group in which anemia prevalence increased from 1990 to 2010. In these countries, the etiology of anemia is often multifactorial, including a combination of nutritional deficiencies, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, although ID remains the main cause of anemia globally. Prevention and treatment of ID are based on the administration of iron supplements and/or food fortification. However, for decades, iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas has been controversial because of reports of increased risk of malaria episodes or severe morbidity in individuals receiving iron supplements. For this reason, previous World Health Organization (WHO) anemia prevention guidelines for children living in malaria-endemic areas recommended targeting only iron-deficient children; this implied screening children for ID, something logistically difficult in resource-limited settings. Moreover, available markers of ID have important limitations in the presence of infectious diseases and inflammation, both conditions highly prevalent in low-income settings.

### Clinicolaboratory findings and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in childhood [^114eGsSK]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

One of the major causes of anemia in childhood worldwide is iron deficiency. Its prevalence depends mainly on age, being higher in infancy and adolescence. Its etiology varies, but poor iron diet is considered the commonest causative factor. Better tactics may be needed, like the targeted screening of children who belong to high-risk groups, to eradicate childhood iron deficiency. The amount of the body iron regulates its absorption from the gut through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Early identification of iron deficiency is essential for the prevention not only of anemia but also the numerous and long-term consequences caused by the lack of iron. Many tests are available for the diagnosis of the disease. Some of them seem very promising for the early detection of iron deficiency, but further research is needed before they become widely acceptable in clinical practice. Treatment is based on oral iron salts, which do not have any serious side effects.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^116j2MUD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Third, oral iron is well-established as a safe and effective treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of the lack of studies of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in a screen-detected population, the USPSTF, focused primarily on supplementation doses, with most included studies using doses between 20 and 50 mg of elemental iron. Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy, and the increased iron requirements, these doses are likely insufficient for adequate treatment and resulted in the lack of benefit observed. Future studies should evaluate the outcomes of iron supplementation in 3 distinct groups: participants who are iron replete, participants who are iron deficient without anemia, and participants with iron deficiency anemia. We recommend that future guidelines focused on the management of iron deficiency in pregnancy should include literature that differentiates between supplementation for prevention and treatment for diagnosed iron deficiency. In addition, future reviews should distinguish between supplemental and treatment doses of oral and intravenous iron and their impacts on outcomes. Guidance on appropriate supplementation (including formulation, dosage, and timing) is also necessary due to the lack of consensus and the variability in dosing strategies found in the literature.

As the rates of iron deficiency during pregnancy increase, so too may pregnancy morbidity. Given these significant implications for public health, it is critical to conduct additional studies to examine the advantages and disadvantages of screening for and treating subclinical iron deficiency. To harmonize future study findings, it is important to standardize the diagnostic cutoff values for iron deficiency across different populations and settings and clearly differentiate between indications for supplementation vs treatment. This will also help improve the identification and treatment of at-risk individuals, address disparities in care, and ultimately mitigate adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes.

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries? [^116UNQwr]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a major public health problem that affects mainly children, predominantly in low-income countries and most often due to iron deficiency (ID). Administration of iron supplements to prevent and treat ID anemia in malaria endemic areas has been controversial for decades; however, recent World Health Organization guidelines recommend universal iron supplementation for children in highly prevalent anemia settings, including those where malaria is endemic. However, infants younger than 6 months of age have been exempted from this recommendation because ID is not considered prevalent at this age and because of assumptions-without evidence-that they are protected from ID through breast milk. To achieve full impact of anemia prevention targeting infants less than 6 months of age who are at highest risk of ID, operational studies that conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of delivering iron supplements to young infants in settings with a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, are needed.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^112exuV8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Iron deficiency, with or without anemia, affects almost half of pregnancies worldwide, adversely impacting maternal and fetal outcomes. In North America, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is reported to be greater than 50%, and nearly 12% of pregnancies are affected by iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with an increased risk of maternal complications, including preterm labor, cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and maternal death, as well as fetal complications, like low birth weight and small for gestational age. Iron deficiency anemia is influenced by social determinants of health, such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, nutritional status, and food insecurity. Thus, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) examined the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with or without anemia in asymptomatic pregnant individuals, to update its previously published recommendations from nearly a decade ago.

In the evidence review and updated recommendation statement, the USPSTF extended its review to include the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency without anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant individuals. Additionally, the evidence review and recommendation statement, examined studies on the relationship between change in maternal iron status and improvement in infant and maternal outcomes in pregnant individuals with iron deficiency with or without anemia. After reviewing the literature, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence that screening and supplementation for iron deficiency, with or without anemia, during pregnancy improved maternal and infant health outcomes (I statement). Additionally, they found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation in pregnant individuals to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes (I statement).

As cohort studies suggest an association between latent (or nonanemic) iron deficiency and maternal and neonatal morbidity, it is timely and relevant that the USPSTF included iron deficiency without anemia in this evidence review. This is a critical step to better understand these associations and the optimal ways to supplement or treat pregnant persons with iron deficiency. However, the USPSTF was unable to find adequate studies to address 4 of 5 key questions, highlighting a significant gap in knowledge. As a result, their ability to make recommendations was inherently limited. The absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of a negative association. Rather, this void emphasizes the value and need for additional studies addressing screening and supplementation.

Abstract.

Anemia is a major public health problem that affects mainly children, predominantly in low-income countries and most often due to iron deficiency (ID). Administration of iron supplements to prevent and treat ID anemia in malaria endemic areas has been controversial for decades; however, recent World Health Organization guidelines recommend universal iron supplementation for children in highly prevalent anemia settings, including those where malaria is endemic. However, infants younger than 6 months of age have been exempted from this recommendation because ID is not considered prevalent at this age and because of assumptions — without evidence — that they are protected from ID through breast milk. To achieve full impact of anemia prevention targeting infants less than 6 months of age who are at highest risk of ID, operational studies that conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of delivering iron supplements to young infants in settings with a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, are needed.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

It also states that further studies are needed to determine optimal formulations and routes for iron repletion and to identify patients who would benefit from earlier IV iron administration, and that additional studies to elucidate optimal gastrointestinal management of difficult-to-treat conditions such as PHG, GAVE, and small-bowel angioectasias also are needed.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^112kTtQT]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron plays an important role in many biological functions. Absolute iron deficiency results from a severe reduction or absence of iron stores. Functional iron deficiency occurs in the presence of adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability (thus, it is not a true deficiency of body stores). Although most research has focused on adverse outcomes among people with iron deficiency and anemia, iron deficiency affects nonerythropoietic tissue, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, in the absence of anemia. Iron deficiency has been associated with restless leg syndrome, decreased physical capacity, impaired neurocognitive function, heart failure, all-cause mortality, and other adverse outcomes independent of anemia.

Infants and children, people of childbearing potential, and people with certain conditions, such as anemia, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, have high rates of iron deficiency. The prevalence of iron deficiency outside these groups and the potential underlying causes remain unclear. Moreover, the prevalence of functional iron deficiency has not been determined. Iron deficiency can be prevented or treated through dietary interventions or nonprescription iron supplements, but the current use of nonprescription iron supplements and dietary iron intake and iron deficiency prevalence have not been studied. These estimates are needed to identify populations at risk of iron deficiency–related adverse outcomes, inform screening recommendations, and establish research priorities. We estimated the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency and iron supplement use in the US from 2017 to 2020 across age, sex, and comorbidity categories.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^113xmMC9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^1112NvEY]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence on the effectiveness of universal screening of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in children under five years of age for improving growth, cognitive function, and psychomotor development. We assessed the accuracy of the screening tests for detecting IDA, the efficacy of existing treatment for children with IDA, and the potential harms associated with screening and treatment. We conducted a literature search up to the 18th of August 2019 by using key terms and manual search in selected sources. We summarized the recommendations and the strength of the recommendation when and as reported by the authors. We summarized the main findings of systematic reviews with the certainty of the evidence as reported. There is no suitable test for IDA screening that is non-invasive with high accuracy for detecting IDA and there is uncertainty whether IDA in children causes cognitive and psychomotor delays. There is a lack of evidence on the effects of routine screening for IDA in asymptomatic children under five years of age on growth, cognitive and psychomotor development outcomes. Universal screening of IDA in children under five years of age is not recommended by most organisations such as the Spanish Association of Primary Care Paediatrics, the United Kingdom National Screening Committee, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force, but is recommended by the American Academy of Paediatrics. However, selective screening of IDA is recommended in infants and children with risk factors including prematurity, low birth weight, and dietary risk factors.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112s5t2z]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia during pregnancy. According to survey data from 1999 to 2006, overall estimated prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is near 18% and increases across the 3 trimesters of pregnancy (from 6.9% to 14.3% to 28.4%). An estimated 5% of pregnant persons have iron deficiency anemia.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with and without anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

Population

Asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined. The USPSTF also concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined.

Recommendation

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115UYDZG]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Implementation — screening and supplementation during pregnancy should reflect the evidence gap and clinical judgment, as there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening or supplementation during pregnancy for iron deficiency with or without anemia, and in the absence of evidence, clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and whether to provide routine iron supplementation during pregnancy. Screening often includes measurement of hematologic indices (eg, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values as proxies of iron deficiency anemia), and an abnormal screening test result may be followed by treatment with iron therapy; supplementation refers to routine provision of low-dose supplemental iron or intake of iron-fortified foods without specifically measuring hematologic indices. Other organizations' guidelines vary, and screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with or without anemia during pregnancy are common.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^115oqn8e]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in asymptomatic premenopausal women — the AGA suggests bidirectional endoscopy over iron replacement therapy alone. Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Pooled evidence from 10 studies showed detection of lower gastrointestinal malignancy in 0.9% (95% CI, 0.3%–1.9%) and upper gastrointestinal malignancy in 0.2% (95% CI, 0%–0.9%) of premenopausal women with IDA. As a comparison, a recent meta-analysis found a prevalence of colorectal cancer of 0.1% (95% CI, 0%–0.1%) in individuals younger than 50 years. Comment: Patients who place a high value on avoiding the small risk of endoscopy, particularly those who are young and might have other plausible reasons for iron deficiency anemia, and a low value on the very small risk of missing a gastrointestinal malignancy would reasonably select an initial course of iron replacement therapy and no initial bidirectional endoscopy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116yAa5W]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) present the official recommendations and highlight epidemiology, physiology, and evaluation considerations. U.S. epidemiology is detailed: In the United States in 1999–2000, 2% of men aged 16–69 years, 12% of women aged 12–49 years, and 9% of women aged 50–69 years were iron deficient, and 4% of women aged 20–49 years and 3% of women aged 50–69 years had IDA. The overall prevalence of IDA in North America in 2010 was estimated at 2.9%. Iron physiology notes that the normal total body iron content varies between 300 and 1,000 g and that about 1–2 mg of iron is lost daily through desquamation of skin and enteric cells or through minor blood loss. Gastrointestinal malignancy is the most serious potential cause, and in most adults without an obvious source of blood loss, evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract for a source of chronic blood loss or malabsorptive process is indicated. There is significant practice variability in the initial gastrointestinal evaluation of IDA. The next update for these guidelines is anticipated 3 years from publication (2023).

### Expert consensus on improving iron deficiency anemia management in obstetrics and gynecology in Asia [^115hdDfd]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major health burden among women in Asia. Key issues in IDA management in Asia are under-diagnosis and under-treatment. The lack of Asia-specific guidelines, and suboptimal utilization of treatment compounds the management of IDA. To address these gaps, a panel of 12 experts in obstetrics, gynecology, and hematology from six regions in Asia convened to review current practices and clinical evidence and provide practical guidance on IDA diagnosis and management in Asian women. The Delphi approach was used to obtain objective opinions and attain consensus on statements pertaining to awareness, diagnosis, and management of IDA. In total, 79 statements attained consensus and are summarized to provide guidance on raising awareness of IDA and approaches for improved diagnosis and treatment of IDA among women in various settings: pregnancy, postpartum, heavy menstrual bleeding, gynecologic cancers, and perioperative care. This clinician-led consensus integrates appropriate recommendations based on clinical evidence and best practices and is intended to guide decision making in the management of iron deficiency/IDA in women. The expert panel raises a call for timely diagnosis and utilization of appropriate treatment, including use of high-dose intravenous iron, stringent blood management, and interdisciplinary collaboration, for optimization of IDA management among women in Asia.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114pF4M5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment and prevention in young children — iron deficiency anemia is usually treated with oral iron; the usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses. According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day, and in children ages 1 to 3 years it is 7 mg per day; nonheme iron may be less well absorbed than heme iron such that the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet. Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods, and iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants; federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and more than 50% of the iron in the US food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.

### Identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^115mu9nU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common during pregnancy, and while most anemia is physiologic, the most common pathologic cause is iron deficiency. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends confirmation of iron deficiency anemia with iron studies when anemia is diagnosed during pregnancy but acknowledges that presumptive treatment for suspected iron deficiency anemia is common in practice. Currently ACOG does not recommend treating iron deficiency without anemia during pregnancy. Though the benefits of treating iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are clear, the optimal route of iron repletion remains uncertain. Results of ongoing large, randomized trials will help define the optimal route of iron treatment for pregnant patients diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia.

USPSTF research needs — screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are identified as priorities. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of screening (eg, with hemoglobin, hematocrit, or ferritin values) for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy on maternal (eg, quality of life or need for transfusion) and infant (eg, low birth weight or preterm birth) health outcomes. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of treatment (eg, oral or intravenous iron) in asymptomatic, screen-detected populations with iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes in settings relevant to US primary care clinical practice. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons without known iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes.

In addition, no new studies of oral iron treatment for iron deficiency anemia in this age group were found. The USPSTF previously concluded there was poor evidence of interventions improving health outcomes in asymptomatic children, and in the current review no studies applicable to the U.S. population demonstrated an association between change in iron status due to intervention and improvement in child health outcomes.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^1122PKte]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Although anemia is the most common systemic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), among the broad spectrum of extraintestinal disease complications encountered in IBD, including arthritis and osteopathy, it has generally received little consideration. However, not only in terms of frequency, but also with regard to its potential effect on hospitalization rates and on the quality of life and work, anemia is indeed a significant and costly complication of IBD. Anemia is multifactorial in nature, the most prevalent etiological forms being iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease. In a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, the determination of iron status using common biochemical parameters alone is inadequate. A more accurate assessment may be attained using new iron indices including reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells or zinc protoporphyrin. While oral iron supplementation has traditionally been a mainstay of IDA treatment, it has also been linked to extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. However, many physicians are still reluctant to administer iron intravenously, despite the wide availability of a variety of new IV preparations with improved safety profiles, and despite the recommendations of international expert guidelines. This article discusses improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on new clinical insights into the regulation of iron homeostasis.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^111tHkQG]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

WHO estimated the worldwide prevalence of anaemia at 42.6% in children between 6 and 59 months of age in 2011. Focusing on the European region, it was estimated that 22.9% of children between 6 and 59 months had anaemia, translating to 12.7 millions of children with anaemia. Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency in children and the major cause of anaemia. WHO estimated that between 44 and 65% of children with anaemia in the European region were amendable to iron supplementation. Prevalence of IDA in children under five years of age was recently estimated at between 1 and 4% in the UK, the US, and other developed countries.

Although IDA most commonly presents without symptoms, ID and IDA have been associated with cognitive impairment and neurodevelopmental delay at short and long term. However, this was based in observational studies with methodological flaws such as confounding with nutritional and socioeconomic factors, which make the cause-effect of the relationship difficult to establish.

The aim of screening IDA in children is the prompt identification and therefore early treatment of anaemia, which may improve health outcomes including growth, cognitive, psychomotor, and neurodevelopmental outcomes, mortality, and quality of life. Most infants with no risk factors such as prematurity or low birth weight are at low risk of iron deficiency during the first six months of life, due to iron stores from the perinatal period. This explains why screening programme usually focus on children from six months of age.

Criteria for a good screening programme that were adopted by the WHO are summarized in the core document.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^117UMLkX]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency

Iron deficiency, both isolated and associated with anemia, represents one of the five major causes of disability burden worldwide, especially in women. For discussions of the etiology, clinical presentation and treatment of iron deficiency with or without anemia readers are directed to specific reviews. – In absolute iron deficiency low total body and serum iron fully suppress hepcidin, a mechanism of adaptation to increase iron absorption. In functional iron deficiency (e.g. in inflammation) total body iron is not decreased, but iron is sequestered in stores by the high hepcidin levels. This distinction strongly influences the route of iron administration required to treat iron deficiency, as discussed below.

Anemia of inflammation

Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β, produced in chronic infections, autoimmunity, cancer, renal failure and other chronic disorders activate hepcidin expression leading to iron-restricted erythropoiesis and anemia of inflammation, once named anemia of chronic diseases. By withholding iron in macrophages, extracellular Gram-negative microorganisms are deprived of this essential nutrient. This is an innate defense mechanism known as 'nutritional immunity'. A recent interpretation is that hypoferremia prevents the generation of NTBI that potentiates the pathogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria. Anemia, usually moderate and normocytic, is multifactorial, because of concomitant insufficient erythropoietin production and impaired early erythroid commitment. Microcytosis occurs in longstanding severe inflammation such as in Castleman disease, a lymphoproliferative disorder in which high IL-6 production strongly enhances hepcidin synthesisor in patients with ectopic hepcidin expression by liver adenomas. Anemia reverts after anti-IL6 receptor treatment in Castleman disease or after surgical removal of the tumor in the case of adenoma.

Anemia of inflammation regresses with control of the disease. In selected cases intravenous iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are used. Since treatment is often unsatisfactory, manipulation of the hepcidin pathway (blocking either its production or function) is proposed as a novel therapeutic opportunity.

### The contribution of iron deficiency to the risk of peripartum transfusion: a retrospective case control study [^114evuu2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A drop in hemoglobin (Hb) level is a physiologic consequence of pregnancy due to an expanded plasma volume. The maternal serum hemoglobin typically reaches the physiological nadir at 24–32 weeks gestation. Iron requirements steadily rise in each trimester, reaching a peak of 7.5 mg/d in the 3rd trimester. Overall, pregnancy has a net iron loss of approximately 740 mg. In Canada, 23% of pregnant women are anemic (Hb < 110 g/L in 1st and 3rd trimesters, < 105 g/L in 2nd trimester) and an estimated 85% of these cases are attributable to iron deficiency. In its early stages, iron deficiency can occur without anemia. Ferritin is the best marker of iron deficiency in pregnancy and a serum ferritin less than 30 μg/L has a sensitivity of 92% for iron deficiency with a positive predictive value of 83%. Recent Canadian data showed that over 73% of pregnant women had ferritin levels < 30 μg/L at first obstetrical evaluation.

Maternal health is impacted by anemia during pregnancy. A recent analysis describes a 2.36 fold higher risk of maternal death in women with severe anemia (hemoglobin < 70 g/L). The risk of postpartum depression is also higher in women with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Given iron's critical role in DNA synthesis and cellular metabolism, it is not surprising that it also plays a crucial role in fetal development. In fact, maternal IDA increases the risk of prematurity, fetal intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay and perinatal mortality. The risks associated with anemia in pregnancy correlate best with hemoglobin levels tested in the first trimester, prior to significant plasma expansion.

In addition to these adverse outcomes, treating iron deficiency can also prevent red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for severe, symptomatic anemia. Avoiding RBC transfusions in pregnant women and women of childbearing age is key to preventing the development of red blood cell alloantibodies and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in subsequent pregnancies, as one in fifteen recipients of RBC transfusions will develop an alloantibody. Further, any transfusion carries the risk of identification errors, viral or bacterial infection, transfusion associated circulatory overload or other transfusion reactions.

Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women, our goal was to elucidate the relative contribution of untreated iron deficiency to peripartum RBC transfusions. We present a case control study aimed at identifying the prevalence of iron deficiency or anemia in pregnant women that were transfused in the peripartum period compared to controls.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^114dG39x]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of multifactorial anemia

After ascertaining potential causes, we first aim to treat with the most specific agent. For example, potential IDA will be treated first. Uncontrolled comorbid inflammatory illness should be appropriately managed. Anemia can best be ascribed to remaining causes, such as CKD after sequential exclusion or optimal management of other conditions. For residual anemia with CKD, we adhere to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines on hemoglobin threshold and targets for ESA. Importantly, we do not aim for normalization of hemoglobin levels when using ESAs and only initiate at hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL and avoid exceeding hemoglobin levels of > 11 g/dL to minimize cardiovascular complications.

Because the patient has a history of bariatric surgery, ACI, and anemia of CKD, we continued nutritional optimization with B12 injections, started IV iron to maintain ferritin between 300 and 500 ng/mL, and deferred ESA because of stable hemoglobin at 9.5 g/dL. Symptoms of fatigue and exercise tolerance substantially improved.

Case 3 educational points

Anemia in older adults is often multifactorial and should be evaluated and managed with a sequential approach. Nutritional deficiencies should also be corrected and maintained with special attention to maintaining adequate iron stores in patients treated with ESAs. ACI is managed by treating the underlying chronic inflammatory conditions whenever possible.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^11531s8p]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

Iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease — Celiac disease is present in 2% to 6% of asymptomatic patients with IDA; in most patients without another explanation for iron deficiency, anemia will improve after initiation of a strict gluten-free diet without iron supplementation, but up to 20% of patients will remain iron deficient even with strict gluten avoidance. Oral iron is less likely to be effective in patients with more severe degrees of villous atrophy, and IV iron may be indicated in these patients or in patients with more severe symptoms of iron deficiency; IV iron also may be indicated in patients whose iron stores do not recover sufficiently with oral iron and a strict gluten-free diet, and appropriate evaluation of other micronutrient deficiencies, sources of chronic blood loss, or anemia of chronic inflammation should be undertaken in patients whose iron stores are slow to recover.

### Prevention of iron deficiency in infants and toddlers [^116AsYHT]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of nutritional iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers has declined dramatically since 1960. However, satisfaction with this achievement must be tempered because iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers is associated with long-lasting diminished mental, motor, and behavioral functioning. Additionally, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in one- to three-year-old children seems to be increasing. The exact relationship between iron deficiency anemia and the developmental effects is not well understood, but these effects do not occur until iron deficiency becomes severe and chronic enough to produce anemia. At that point, treatment with iron can reverse the anemia and restore iron sufficiency, yet the poorer developmental functioning appears to persist. Therefore, intervention should focus on the primary prevention of iron deficiency. In the first year of life, measures to prevent iron deficiency include completely avoiding cow's milk, starting iron supplementation at four to six months of age in breastfed infants, and using iron-fortified formula when not breastfeeding. Low-iron formula should not be used. In the second year of life, iron deficiency can be prevented by use of a diversified diet that is rich in sources of iron and vitamin C, limiting cow's milk consumption to less than 24 oz per day, and providing a daily iron-fortified vitamin. All infants and toddlers who did not receive primary prevention should be screened for iron deficiency. Screening is performed at nine to 12 months, six months later, and at 24 months of age. The hemoglobin/hematocrit level alone detects only patients with enough iron deficiency to be anemic. Screening by erythrocyte protoporphyrin or red-cell distribution width identifies earlier stages of iron deficiency. A positive screening test is an indication for a therapeutic trial of iron, which remains the definitive method of establishing a diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Preventing childhood anemia in India: iron supplementation and beyond [^1179q4wV]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Childhood anemia has major adverse consequences for health and development. It's prevalence in India continues to range from 70 to 90%. Although anemia is multifactorial in etiology, preventative efforts have predominantly focused on increasing iron intake, primarily through supplementation in pregnant and lactating women. Policy thrust for childhood anemia is only recent. However, program implementation is dismal; only 3.8–4.7% of preschoolers receive iron-folate supplements. There is an urgent need for effective governance and implementation. Policy makers must distinguish anemia from iron deficiency, and introduce additional area-specific interventions as an integrated package. Increased iron intake may yield maximum benefit but will only address up to half the burden. In 6–59 months old children, instead of 100 days' continuous dosing with iron-folate syrup in a year, a directly supervised intermittent supplementation (biweekly; ~100 days per year) merits consideration. Multiple micronutrient powders for home fortification of foods in 6–23 months old infants do not appear viable. Additional interventions include delayed cord clamping, earlier supplementation in low birth weight infants, appropriate infant and young child feeding guidelines, and intermittent supervised supplementation in children and adolescents through school health programs. Use of double (iron-folate)-fortified salt in mid-day meal programs deserves piloting. Important area-specific, non-iron interventions include targeted deworming, and prevention and treatment of hemoglobinopathies, malaria and other common infections. Routine addition of multi-micronutrients to iron-folate supplementation appears unjustified currently. There is a pressing need to conduct relevant research, especially to inform etiology, additional interventions and implementation issues.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.
