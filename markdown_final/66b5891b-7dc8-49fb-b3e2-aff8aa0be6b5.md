## Question

What is the dose of the bolus of levothyroxine drip prior to infusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate bolus (loading) dose of levothyroxine sodium for injection prior to starting a continuous infusion, including how to determine the correct dose and ensure safe administration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indication for IV levothyroxine and whether a bolus is even appropriate. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dosing for IV loading and maintenance. Next, I will review guideline nuances and safety modifiers for high-risk patients. After that, I need to check whether a true continuous infusion is ever used or if daily IV dosing is the standard. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation and monitoring plan, including preparation details and adrenal considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Intravenous levothyroxine is indicated for myxedema coma, a life-threatening hypothyroid crisis in which oral absorption is unreliable and IV therapy is preferred; outside of this setting, routine IV levothyroxine is not standard, and oral therapy is first-line when feasible, so I need to ensure we are not extrapolating beyond the labeled indication [^113ESds9] [^113Yw7xG].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled dosing language. The FDA labeling specifies an initial IV loading dose of 300 to 500 micrograms, followed by once-daily IV maintenance doses of 50 to 100 micrograms until the patient can tolerate oral therapy. It does not describe a continuous infusion protocol, so a "bolus prior to infusion" framing may be misleading here, and I should correct that to "loading dose followed by daily IV dosing" rather than a true infusion [^117FyPDD] [^114ByqwG].

> Hold on, I should review guideline concordance. The ATA guidance for myxedema coma aligns with the FDA range, recommending an IV loading dose of 200–400 micrograms with subsequent daily IV replacement, with lower doses advised for smaller, older patients or those with coronary disease or arrhythmias. This supports using the lower end of the labeled range in higher-risk patients [^115H48AC].

> I need to check safety modifiers next. Excessive bolus dosing above 500 micrograms is associated with cardiac complications, particularly in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease; therefore, I should favor 300 micrograms rather than 500 micrograms in older adults, those with CAD, arrhythmias, or heart failure, and ensure close cardiac monitoring after the loading dose [^111PFGa1] [^112MSYcE].

> Let me consider the pharmacokinetics to ensure the dosing cadence makes sense. Levothyroxine has a long half-life of about 9–10 days in hypothyroid patients, which explains why daily (not continuous infusion) dosing is standard after the loading dose; this also means that clinical and biochemical responses evolve over days, so I should not expect immediate normalization after the bolus and must plan serial assessments [^117FyPDD] [^114ByqwG].

> Next, I should review preparation and administration details to avoid errors. The lyophilized vial should be reconstituted with 5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride only, yielding approximately 20 mcg/mL for the 100 mcg vial and 100 mcg/mL for the 500 mcg vial; the reconstituted solution is preservative-free and stable for 4 hours, and should not be added to other IV fluids, so I need to ensure it is administered promptly and as a dedicated dose [^114ByqwG] [^1113UCaa].

> I should confirm adrenal considerations before giving thyroid hormone. Empiric glucocorticoid coverage should precede levothyroxine in myxedema coma because thyroid hormone can precipitate adrenal crisis if unrecognized adrenal insufficiency is present; this is a critical step that I must not overlook prior to the loading dose [^116Guxqx] [^111PFGa1].

> But wait, what if someone is asking about converting an existing oral dose to IV in non-crisis settings? The ATA notes that when switching from oral to IV due to malabsorption or enteral intolerance, the IV dose is approximately 75% of the oral dose; however, that conversion applies to maintenance therapy, not to myxedema coma loading, so I should not conflate these scenarios [^113Yw7xG] [^114ogLS4].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation. For adults with myxedema coma, give an IV loading dose of 300–500 micrograms once, with a strong preference for 300 micrograms in elderly or cardiac patients, followed by 50–100 micrograms IV daily until the patient is clinically stable and able to take oral therapy. Continuous infusion is not standard, and doses should be individualized to age, cardiac status, and severity, with close hemodynamic and ECG monitoring after the loading dose [^117FyPDD] [^115H48AC] [^111PFGa1].

> I should double-check the monitoring plan. Thyroid hormone levels typically rise and TSH gradually improves over several days. Measuring free T4 and T3 every 1–2 days early on is reasonable to ensure trajectory, with dose adjustments based on clinical status and labs, and transition to oral therapy as soon as feasible given the long half-life and the risks of prolonged IV therapy [^1179LeJB] [^116E8CRK].

---

The recommended bolus dose of levothyroxine prior to infusion is **300–500 mcg IV once** [^117FyPDD] for myxedema coma, with lower doses (200–400 mcg) for elderly or cardiac patients [^115H48AC]. This is followed by **daily IV maintenance of 50–100 mcg** [^114ByqwG] until oral therapy is tolerated. For non-critically ill patients unable to take oral therapy, use **about 75% of the oral dose IV** [^113Yw7xG] [^114ogLS4]. Always give glucocorticoids before levothyroxine [^116Guxqx] to prevent adrenal crisis [^111PFGa1], and monitor closely for cardiac complications [^112MSYcE].

---

## Indications for intravenous levothyroxine administration

IV levothyroxine is indicated in **myxedema coma** [^113ESds9] — a life-threatening emergency characterized by severe hypothyroidism, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypoventilation, and altered mental status [^notfound]. It is also used when oral therapy is not feasible due to severe malabsorption, persistent vomiting, or inability to swallow [^113Yw7xG] [^116E8CRK].

---

## Recommended bolus dose of levothyroxine prior to infusion

The recommended bolus dose of levothyroxine prior to infusion is **300–500 mcg IV once** [^117FyPDD], administered as a bolus injection over 2–3 minutes. For elderly patients or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, a lower initial dose of 200–400 mcg IV may be considered [^115H48AC] to minimize the risk of cardiac complications [^111PFGa1].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

### Patient-specific factors

- **Age**: Elderly patients may require lower initial doses due to increased susceptibility to cardiac complications [^1113UCaa].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease should be monitored closely for arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or worsening heart failure [^112MSYcE].
- **Body weight**: Dosing may be adjusted based on patient weight and clinical severity of hypothyroidism [^113SVBJx].

---

### Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Cardiac complications**: Excessive bolus dosing (> 500 mcg) is associated with arrhythmias, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia, and worsening heart failure [^112MSYcE].
- **Adrenal crisis**: Thyroid hormone therapy can precipitate adrenal crisis in patients with unrecognized adrenal insufficiency. Empiric glucocorticoid administration is recommended prior to levothyroxine administration [^116Guxqx] [^111PFGa1].
- **Overdose**: Signs of overdose include hyperthyroidism symptoms such as tachycardia, anxiety, tremors, and heat intolerance [^116ruj4z].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients receiving IV levothyroxine should be monitored closely for **clinical improvement** and **adverse effects** [^1179LeJB]. Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) should be measured every 1–2 days initially, then adjusted based on clinical response [^1179LeJB].

---

## Transition to oral therapy

Once the patient is clinically stable and able to tolerate oral medication, transition from IV to oral levothyroxine is recommended. The **relative bioavailability** of IV levothyroxine compared to oral formulations is approximately 48–74% [^117FyPDD] [^114ogLS4]; therefore, the oral dose should be adjusted accordingly.

---

## Levothyroxine bolus dose prior to infusion

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended bolus dose** | **Maintenance dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Myxedema coma | 300–500 mcg IV once | 50–100 mcg IV daily |
| Elderly or cardiovascular disease | 200–400 mcg IV once | 50–100 mcg IV daily |
| Non-critically ill patients (oral to IV conversion) | Approximately 75% of oral dose | Adjusted based on clinical response |

---

The recommended bolus dose of levothyroxine prior to infusion is **300–500 mcg IV once**, with lower doses for elderly or cardiac patients [^115H48AC]. Close monitoring and empiric glucocorticoid administration are essential to minimize risks and ensure safe administration [^116Guxqx].

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^115VXdZg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement at the first postoperative follow-up might be harder than expected. Despite the various LT4 dose-choosing strategies tested, there is no consensus on the most effective approach to achieve early euthyroidism.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, including studies published between 2000 and 2024 that reported the proportion of patients achieving euthyroidism at first follow-up after total thyroidectomy. Data from 11 studies comprising 2577 patients were analyzed. LT4 dosing strategies included fixed-dose, weight-based (dose/kg), and individualized algorithm-based methods. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Results

The pooled euthyroidism rate at first follow-up was 33.9%, with high heterogeneity across studies (I 2 = 82.68%). No dosing strategy consistently outperformed others: dose/kg methods achieved 29% euthyroidism, while fixed or algorithm-based approaches achieved 40%, though without statistical significance. Meta-regression analysis did not identify any statistically significant predictor. No significant differences emerged between patients treated for benign or malignant thyroid diseases or between retrospective and prospective study designs.

Conclusion

Only about one-third of patients achieve euthyroidism at first follow-up after thyroidectomy, regardless of LT4 dosing strategy. The current guidelines recommendation of applying a pro/kg dose may not be adequate, and even personalized algorithms yield inconsistent results. Future prospective studies are needed to refine individualized dosing protocols and identify additional factors influencing LT4 requirements.

Combined Therapy of T4 and T3

Although the predominant treatment of thyroxine supplementation is LT4 monotherapy, 10% to 15% of patients have persistent or recurrent hypothyroid symptoms (weight gain, fatigue, memory loss, etc.) despite normal TH levels and medical adhesion. This phenomenon is assumed to be attributed to a low level of circulating T3, which plays a superior role to T4 in the feedback of the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis. A previous study showed a 10% to 20% reduction in serum T3 levels in ∼1.8 thousand LT4-treated hypothyroid patients compared with the healthy population. Similar phenomena were also observed in thyroidectomized rats, which reached euthyroidism only after normalization of serum T3 levels.

Based on the theory above, clinicians have returned to combined therapy of T4 plus T3 to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms, with strict indications. Clinicians supported that only hypothyroid patients treated with a stable dose of LT4 for at least 6 months, who had experienced persistent symptoms and had a normal serum TSH level, should receive T4 plus T3 combination therapy. However, those with associated comorbidities (eg, autoimmune diseases and psychological dysfunctions) or unrealistic expectations should not receive combination therapy. The dose ratio of T3 to T4 in combination therapy is a controversial area. Ratios ranging from 1:3 to 1:17 have been reported in several articles. Considering that the physiological ratio of T3:T4 secreted by the thyroid gland is approximately 1:14 and the residual thyroid has secretory function, a ratio between 1:8 and 1:13 may be more appropriate. Animal-derived DTE has also been introduced to treat refractory hypothyroidism due to combinations of T3 and T4 in a 1:4.22 ratio. Animal-derived DTE contains a supraphysiological amount of T3, and cardiac complications should be monitored with caution.

Hospitalized but not critically ill patients beginning levothyroxine — adrenal insufficiency: For patients who are about to be treated with levothyroxine, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered, and if there is sufficient clinical or biochemical evidence to consider this diagnosis, adrenal insufficiency should be ruled out or empiric treatment should be provided. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

Intensive care unit hypothyroidism considerations — dopamine and dobutamine may lower serum TSH, LT4 may need to be given intravenously due to malabsorption from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or specialized tube feedings, and if using intravenous LT4 the equivalent intravenous dose is approximately 75%; the possibility of adrenal insufficiency must also be considered since treatment of hypothyroidism might accelerate cortisol metabolism, and there are case reports of adrenal insufficiency unmasked by thyroid hormone.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–related adrenal insufficiency (AI) and pituitary–thyroid management — In milder cases, "a physiologic regimen of HC at 15 to 25 mg/d in divided doses is sufficient, and ICI therapy may be continued". If secondary AI is suspected in a patient with secondary hypothyroidism, "glucocorticoid replacement should be started prior to thyroid hormone replacement to avoid the precipitation of adrenal crisis". For severe cases with adrenal crisis or hemodynamic instability, "hospitalization will be required with 100 mg of intravenous HC and fluid resuscitation, followed by 200 mg per 24 hours of HC either via continuous infusion or divided into 6-hourly injections of 50 mg", then, when stable, taper "to physiologic doses of 15 to 25 mg/d in divided doses and the reintroduction of ICI therapy". In hypophysitis with severe headaches/visual symptoms, patients "may benefit from high doses of prednisone (20–60 mg/d or 1 mg/kg/d) with subsequent tapering to a physiologic glucocorticoid regimen", although "a recent retrospective study reported reduced survival of patients with melanoma and hypophysitis treated with high-dose glucocorticoid regimens compared with those on < 7.5 mg of prednisone equivalents per day". For secondary hypothyroidism, "The initial dose of levothyroxine can vary between 25 and 50 μg/d up to a full weight-based replacement of 1 to 1.6 μg/kg/d", and "free T4 should be used to monitor patients, and the dose of levothyroxine should be adjusted to target the upper half of the normal reference range of free T4". Recovery expectations include that it is "highly unlikely that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function will recover", whereas "approximately 50% of patients with secondary hypothyroidism may regain activity in their hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis".

10 OVERDOSAGE

In general, the signs and symptoms of overdosage with levothyroxine are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. In addition, confusion and disorientation may occur. Cerebral embolism, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Excessive doses of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection (greater than 500 mcg) are associated with cardiac complications in patients with underlying cardiac disease.

Treatment of Overdosage

Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection should be reduced in dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or symptoms of overdosage occur. To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is the certified Regional Poison Control Center. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in the patient.

In the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient's medical status.

### No effect of levothyroxine and levothyroxine-induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in healthy male subjects [^117K763o]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Background: Patients receiving the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib for locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine often receive concomitant levothyroxine for thyrotropin (TSH) suppression. In the Phase 3 DTC trial (DECISION), sorafenib exposure was approximately twofold higher than that observed in other cancers. This study assessed sorafenib pharmacokinetics without and with concomitant levothyroxine to examine whether a levothyroxine interaction or levothyroxine-induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis results in increased sorafenib exposure in patients with DTC.

Methods: This was an open-label, two-period sequential treatment study in healthy male subjects. In period 1, day 1, subjects received a single oral dose of sorafenib 400 mg, followed by a minimal 10-day washout. In period 2, day 1, levothyroxine 300 μg was administered orally once daily (q.d.) for 14 days. After 10 days, a single oral concomitant dose of sorafenib 400 mg was given. Blood samples for sorafenib pharmacokinetic analyses were obtained pre-dose and at time points up to 96 hours after sorafenib dosing. Samples for thyroid tests were collected before and after levothyroxine dosing.

Results: Twenty-five subjects completed the study and were evaluable for pharmacokinetic analysis. Levothyroxine 300 μg q.d. was well tolerated and induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis, producing full suppression of TSH (M ± SD = 0.032 ± 0.027 mIU/L) and increased free thyroxine (from 0.94 ± 0.09 to 1.77 ± 0.33 ng/dL) and free triiodothyronine (from 2.87 ± 0.28 to 4.24 ± 0.66 pg/mL) levels by day 11 of period 2. The geometric mean (%CV) sorafenib maximum concentration (C max) without and with levothyroxine was 2.09 (68.1) and 1.78 (63.9) mg/L, respectively, with a corresponding geometric mean area under the curve of 68.1 (68.2) and 64.3 (66.3) mg·h/L. Median (range) time to C max was 4.00 (2.98–16.0) and 4.02 (1.98–36.0) hours, respectively. Mean (%CV) half-life was 24.0 (25.3) and 25.7 (21.0) hours. All study drug-related adverse events were mild and included headache and fatigue for sorafenib, and headache, increased alanine aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase, fatigue, and nervousness for levothyroxine.

Conclusions: Levothyroxine 300 μg q.d. for 14 days was well tolerated, induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis, and did not affect sorafenib pharmacokinetics. The findings suggest that concomitant use of levothyroxine with sorafenib is not likely responsible for the previously reported increase in sorafenib exposure in patients with DTC. However, the possible effects of long-term levothyroxine dosing were not assessed.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate levothyroxine therapy in patients with CeH only after evidence of conserved cortisol secretion. Initiate thyroid replacement only after corticosteroid therapy in order to prevent the possible induction of an adrenal crisis if coexistent central adrenal insufficiency is not ruled out.

Statistical methods

Demographic parameters, TEAEs, and PK parameters were summarized descriptively for all dosed subjects. Statistics included arithmetic and geometric means, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and minimum, median, and maximum values.

AUC 0–48, AUC 0–72, and C max were compared between treatment groups using the general linear model ANOVA procedure in SAS ®, with an alpha error of 0.05. The model included sequence, period, treatment, and subject*sequence as fixed effects. Intrasubject CV was estimated from the ANOVA residual error. The ratios of geometric means (Treatment A/Treatment B) and their corresponding 90% confidence intervals [90% CIs] were calculated.

Lack of clinical difference between treatment groups was a priori set to be declared if the 90% CIs calculated for the area under the curves (AUCs) were contained within the predefined standard limits of 80–125%. Wilcoxon's test was performed on t max.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of EUTHYROX in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start EUTHYROX at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure:

Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: EUTHYROX dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of EUTHYROX by 12.5 mcg daily to 25 mcg daily and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable EUTHYROX dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce EUTHYROX dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure EUTHYROX dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH less than 10 mIU per liter) start EUTHYROX at 1 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust EUTHYROX dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

The dose of EUTHYROX should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require a EUTHYROX dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.

Cost versus benefit

The average follow-up period in the study was 127 ± 6.4 days, or ∼18 weeks, ranging from 47 to 468 days. The average number of postoperative blood draws in this period was 6.6 ± 0.15, and the average number of follow-up visits was 3.6 ± 0.14 (Table 3). For goiter and cancer groups, the application of the DAT reduced the number of blood draws needed [t = 2.47, p = 0.02 and t (50) = 3.14, p = 0.003 respectively] and the number of follow-up visits [t = 2.16, p = 0.04 and t (50) = 3.15, p = 0.003] as compared with their respective controls. As our RCT did not have a control arm with an ordinary standard of care, we made a comparison with retrospective data from a similar population operated three years before the DAT study (Supplementary Table S1). Lab records from these patients showed that the average number of blood draws before the TSH targets were reached was 8.6, which is higher than for patients in the current RCT (Supplemental Data).

Pharmacodynamic analysis

Thyroid tests confirmed that T4, T3, and TSH levels were within reference ranges for all 25 subjects at screening, through period 1, and before levothyroxine administration on day 1 of period 2 (Fig. 2).

FIG. 2.
Mean (SD) thyroid test values over time for (A) free T4 and total T4, (B) free T3 and total T3, and (C) TSH (mIU/L). M, minutes; P1, period 1, sorafenib; P2, period 2, sorafenib plus levothyroxine. The time point reference is the first dose of sorafenib in the period.

Following the daily administration of levothyroxine 300 μg, free T4 and T3 levels gradually increased, whereas total T4 and T3 had a tendency to increase but remained within the reference ranges, although distributed around the upper normal limits (Fig. 2A and B). Arithmetic mean (SD) values of free T3 and T4 were 4.24 (0.66) pg/mL and 1.77 (0.33) ng/dL, respectively, by day 11 of period 2 (i.e. after 10 days of levothyroxine 300 μg administration). Free T3 and T4 reached peak values by day 15 of period 2, with an arithmetic mean (SD) of 4.83 (1.04) pg/mL and 1.91 (0.30) ng/dL, respectively. Free T3 and T4 levels returned to normal levels for all 25 subjects when assessed at the follow-up visit (Fig. 2A and B).

Corresponding to the increase in free T4 and T3, oral doses of levothyroxine 300 μg q.d. for 14 days successfully induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis, resulting in a steady decrease in TSH (Fig. 2C). By day 11 of period 2, the day when sorafenib was co-administered with levothyroxine, the mean (SD) TSH level had attained full suppression of 0.032 (0.027) mIU/L (about 0.09-fold the lower limit of normal), with the lowest mean (SD) level observed on the last day of levothyroxine dosing (0.020 [0.013] mIU/L). After the last dose of levothyroxine was given, all TSH values returned to normal levels when assessed at the safety follow-up visit (Fig. 2C).

Safety

Table 4 summarizes the AEs of all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. A total of 11 TEAEs were reported (9 of 36 participants). In the Treatment A group, there were a total of three TEAEs (one case had increased blood pressure and two cases had headache) that were possibly related to the treatment. In the Treatment B group, there were a total of three TEAEs (one case had increased body temperature, one had vomiting, and one had intermittent headache) that were possibly related to the treatment. There were no serious AEs for either treatment.

Table 4.
Summary of Possibly Related Adverse Events by Treatment

Overall, these findings suggest that administration of LT4 in a single 600-mcg dose is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115gXwoJ]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^117P4p5a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

All studies were conducted in referral hospital centers. The normal TSH range was reported by all studies, with most using 0.4 to 4.5, while only 1 study applied a 0.4 to 2.5 range. For tumors, different risk categories were considered: low risk (0.5–2), intermediate risk (0.1–0.5), and high risk (< 0.1). Of the 11 studies included, 7 analyzed patients using a single LT4 dosing method: 2 studies used a dose/kg approach, 3 applied a fixed-dose regimen, and 2 employed an algorithm-based method. In the remaining 4 studies, multiple groups of patients received different dosing strategies: 3 compared 2 groups (1 using a dose/kg method and the other an algorithm-based approach) and 1 examined 4 groups using a dose/kg method but with a different TSH target according to their disease.

As a result, the 11 studies yielded 17 patient groups. Among them, 3 groups followed a fixed-dose regimen [2 receiving 100 mcg, 1 receiving 150 mcg], 9 groups used a dose/kg approach, and 5 groups applied an algorithm-based calculation.

A detailed description of the algorithm-based approaches is reported in Supplemental Material 3.

All studies reported the number of euthyroid patients at the first control, which was typically conducted at 6 to 8 weeks, with the widest timeframe being 4 to 15 weeks.

Quantitative Analysis (Meta-analysis)

The pooled proportion of patients achieving target thyroid hormone levels at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up was 33.9% (803/2577 patients), with a confidence interval from 29.3% to 38.5% (Fig. 2). The analysis included 17 different study populations, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 82.68%). A comparative analysis based on key study characteristics was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity (Table 2).

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1156ZVou]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient's standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

Discussion

As millions of people around the world take LT4 daily and a huge number of patients with goiter or cancer undergo thyroidectomy, achieving robust data about the optimal starting LT4 dose should be important for helping the clinical practice of thyroidologists. The main goal of the present meta-analysis was to assess whether different approaches for a LT4 dose-choosing strategy would translate into a higher number of euthyroid patients at the first follow-up visit after total thyroidectomy.

The results of the present analysis show a mean percentage of euthyroid patients receiving LT4 at the first follow-up after thyroidectomy of ∼34%. This indicates that, in most patients, independently from the LT4 dose-choosing method used, TSH level was either below or above the normal range. The high heterogeneity in terms of euthyroidism rates observed across studies (ranging from 19% to 68%) using different dose-choosing strategies highlights the complexity of choosing an adequate starting LT4 replacement dose in thyroidectomized patients. We aimed to identify the primary contributors to this variability, considering methodological differences in LT4 dosing and patient characteristics by assessing whether different methods for estimating LT4 dose would lead to different results in terms of rates of euthyroidism achieved.

The studies included in our analysis employed different dosing approaches, including fixed-dose regimens, weight-based dosing (dose/kg), and individualized algorithms incorporating factors such as BMI, lean body mass (LBM), or age. We conducted mainly 2 comparative analyses: (1) dose/kg studies vs all other approaches and (2) weight-based, BMI-based, LBM-based dosing vs fixed-dose and other particular algorithm-based methods. In both analyses, the second group exhibited higher rates of euthyroidism; however, this was accompanied by greater heterogeneity and wider confidence intervals, primarily due to 1 study belonging to the second group reporting a 68% achievement rate among 31 patients. When considering how these factors were incorporated into dose-choosing algorithms, we found that only 1 study included LBM in its algorithm, yet it achieved a euthyroidism rate of just 26%, indicating no clear advantage over other methods. No study accounted for sex in the dose-choosing algorithm. Two studies included age as a variable, reporting euthyroidism rates of 67% and 58%. Three studies incorporated BMI into their algorithms. Two studies considered age and BMI, while 1 used a BMI-based approach, achieving a euthyroidism rate of 38%.

### Evidence-based use of levothyroxine / liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism: a consensus document [^112DtQc5]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Fourteen clinical trials have not shown a consistent benefit of combination therapy with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3). Despite the publication of these trials, combination therapy is widely used and patients reporting benefit continue to generate patient and physician interest in this area. Recent scientific developments may provide insight into this inconsistency and guide future studies. Methods: The American Thyroid Association (ATA), British Thyroid Association (BTA), and European Thyroid Association (ETA) held a joint conference on November 3, 2019 (live-streamed between Chicago and London) to review new basic science and clinical evidence regarding combination therapy with presentations and input from 12 content experts. After the presentations, the material was synthesized and used to develop Summary Statements of the current state of knowledge. After review and revision of the material and Summary Statements, there was agreement that there was equipoise for a new clinical trial of combination therapy. Consensus Statements encapsulating the implications of the material discussed with respect to the design of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy were generated. Authors voted upon the Consensus Statements. Iterative changes were made in several rounds of voting and after comments from ATA/BTA/ETA members. Results: Of 34 Consensus Statements available for voting, 28 received at least 75% agreement, with 13 receiving 100% agreement. Those with 100% agreement included studies being powered to study the effect of deiodinase and thyroid hormone transporter polymorphisms on study outcomes, inclusion of patients dissatisfied with their current therapy and requiring at least 1.2μg/kg of LT4 daily, use of twice daily LT3 or preferably a slow-release preparation if available, use of patient-reported outcomes as a primary outcome (measured by a tool with both relevant content validity and responsiveness) and patient preference as a secondary outcome, and utilization of a randomized placebo-controlled adequately powered double-blinded parallel design. The remaining statements are presented as potential additional considerations. Discussion: This article summarizes the areas discussed and presents Consensus Statements to guide development of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy. The results of such redesigned trials are expected to be of benefit to patients and of value to inform future thyroid hormone replacement clinical practice guidelines treatment recommendations.

### Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of different levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of human thyroid disease [^114cuoXF]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

At the present time, optimal therapy for hypothyroidism requires replacement of the deficiency in thyroid hormone with synthetic levothyroxine. Precise titration of this narrow therapeutic index drug is necessary to return the patient to a chemically and clinically euthyroid state. Seven levothyroxine formulations are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and four are available to the physician. Proper dosage is established based on thyrotropin (TSH) testing and clinical evaluation. Each levothyroxine preparation must comply with FDA standards for bioavailability but may vary with respect to its dissolution and absorption properties and are not interchangeable. This equivalence testing is done on normal volunteers and requires a suprapharmacologic dose of levothyroxine in order to make the determination of bioavailability. In this review we discuss the various methods to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of thyroid disease. These are relevant to the physician and patient because small differences in the efficacy can produce unwanted effects of either underreplacement or overreplacement.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^117LFNGB]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring — recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

R5.2d: In case of TSH deficiency, treatment with levothyroxine should be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on the severity of the deficiency, clinical tolerance and/or the clinical and biochemical evolution seen after thyroid tests carried out at 1 month.

R5.2e: In case of gonadotropin deficiency, replacement should be considered depending on the evolution of the gonadotropin deficiency in the first 3 months of monitoring and in the absence of oncological contraindication.

R5.2f: Confirmed cases of diabetes insipidus should be systematically treated.

R5.2g: Given the oncological context, no replacement therapy should be considered in the case of growth hormone deficiency.

In cases of hypophysitis, ICPI can be continued, after the management of acute hormonal deficiencies. Withdrawal of ICPI has been reported to have no effect on the natural history of hypophysitis. There is currently no published data on the risk of hypophysitis in patients with a history of pituitary pathology prior to ICPI. In these patients, close examination of hormone equilibrium obtained prior to ICPI is needed and can lead to a readjustment of dose for replacement therapies.

R5.2h: Hypophysitis is not a contraindication for ICPI, which can be delayed in the acute phase of hypophysitis. The presence of hypophysitis secondary to a first ICPI (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1) does not contraindicate the use of another ICPI. A history of pituitary pathology does not contraindicate treatment by ICPI. Adjustment of replacement therapy may be necessary.

5.1 Risk of Cardiac Complications in Elderly and in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease

Excessive bolus dosing of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection (greater than 500 mcg) are associated with cardiac complications, particularly in the elderly and in patients with an underlying cardiac condition. Adverse events that can potentially be related to the administration of large doses of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection include arrhythmias, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia and infarction, or worsening of congestive heart failure and death. Cautious use, including doses in the lower end of the recommended range, may be warranted in these populations. Close observation of the patient following the administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is advised.

5.2 Need for Concomitant Glucocorticoids and Monitoring for Other Diseases in Patients with Endocrine Disorders

Occasionally, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, which can lead to myxedema coma, may occur in association with other autoimmune disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and insulin‑dependent diabetes mellitus. Patients should be treated with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of treatment with Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, until adrenal function has been adequately assessed. Failure to do so may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis when thyroid hormone therapy is initiated, due to increased metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids by thyroid hormone. With initiation of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, patients with myxedema coma should also be monitored for previously undiagnosed diabetes insipidus.

5.3 Not Indicated for Treatment of Obesity

Thyroid hormones, including Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)].

### Optimal levothyroxine dosing strategy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypothyroidism: a retrospective study [^1163XWD9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related hypothyroidism is mostly irreversible and prompt thyroid hormone replacement therapy is crucial, especially for patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy.

Objective

This study aimed to propose a novel titration strategy for ICI-related hypothyroidism, evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) dose differences between hypothyroidism patterns, and develop a predictive equation for the optimal LT4 dose.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Tertiary academic hospital.

Patients

109 patients with ICI-related hypothyroidism.

Interventions

Rapid versus conventional titration strategy.

Main Outcome Measures

The time to achieve normal free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

Results

Patients with transient thyrotoxicosis followed by overt hypothyroidism (Toxic-OHypo) required higher LT4 doses to achieve a euthyroid state compared to isolated overt hypothyroidism, with a mean difference of 0.23 μg/kg/day (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08–0.38). In patients with ICI-related overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, who had elevated TSH levels within 4 weeks of the last documented low or normal TSH, a rapid titration strategy was implemented. This strategy significantly improved the cumulative incidence of achieving normal FT4 and TSH levels compared to conventional titration strategy (hazard ratio [HR], 4.44; 95% CI, 2.24–8.82; HR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.18–7.73, respectively), with a comparable safety profile. Predicted LT4 dose at euthyroid state (µg/kg/day) = (-0.016×body weight) + (0.109×baseline TSH level) + 2.661 for patients with Toxic-OHypo.

Conclusions

LT4 requirements vary depending on the subtype of ICI-related hypothyroidism. The rapid titration strategy reduced the time to achieve a euthyroid state without a significant increase in adverse effects compared to conventional LT4 replacement therapy.

2.1 Dosage

An initial intravenous loading dose of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection between 300 to 500 mcg, followed by once daily intravenous maintenance doses between 50 and 100 mcg, should be administered, as clinically indicated, until the patient can tolerate oral therapy. The age, general physical condition, cardiac risk factors, and clinical severity of myxedema and duration of myxedema symptoms should be considered when determining the starting and maintenance dosages of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection.

Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection produces a gradual increase in the circulating concentrations of the hormone with an approximate half-life of 9 to 10 days in hypothyroid patients. Daily administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection should be maintained until the patient is capable of tolerating an oral dose and is clinically stable. For chronic treatment of hypothyroidism, an oral dosage form of levothyroxine should be used to maintain a euthyroid state. Relative bioavailability between Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection and oral levothyroxine products has not been established. Based on medical practice, the relative bioavailability between oral and intravenous administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is estimated to be from 48 to 74%. Due to differences in absorption characteristics of patients and the oral levothyroxine product formulations, TSH and thyroid hormone levels should be measured a few weeks after initiating oral levothyroxine and dose adjusted accordingly.

2.2 Dosing in the Elderly and in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease

Intravenous levothyroxine may be associated with cardiac toxicity–including arrhythmias, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia and infarction, or worsening of congestive heart failure and death–in the elderly and in those with underlying cardiovascular disease. Therefore, cautious use, including doses in the lower end of the recommended range, may be warranted in these populations.

2.3 Reconstitution Directions

Reconstitute the lyophilized Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection by aseptically adding 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP only. Shake vial to ensure complete mixing. The resultant solution will have a final concentration of approximately 20 mcg per mL, 40 mcg per mL and 100 mcg per mL for the 100 mcg, 200 mcg and 500 mcg vials, respectively. Reconstituted drug product is preservative free and is stable for 4 hours. Discard any unused portion. DO NOT ADD LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM FOR INJECTION TO OTHER IV FLUIDS. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Thyroid, porcine [^113F3DaF]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Liothyronine (T3) may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T4) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) is suspected.

Myxedema Coma — Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. Levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV. Normal T4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3.

Introduction

The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are pivotal to activation of metabolic processes and overall well-being. T3, representing ∼20% of the hormones secreted by the thyroid gland, is mainly derived from metabolism of T4 by deiodination. Treatment of hypothyroidism can therefore rely on the sole administration of levothyroxine (LT4).

While untreated hypothyroidism can be fatal, recent studies have demonstrated that even mild hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in undertreated or overtreated patients may be associated with adverse health outcomes and excess mortality.

LT4 sodium is the standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism and is available in various forms, including tablets, soft-gel capsules, and solutions. LT4 formulations are made of synthetic LT4 and, being chemically equivalent, exert the same physiological effect as endogenous T4, thus maintaining crucial hormone balance.

LT4 bioavailability is significantly decreased with food. Coadministration of LT4 tablets with a high-fat high-calorie meal significantly reduced T4 C max by 40–49% and AUC 0–48 by 38–40% with respect to fasting conditions. For this reason, LT4, in any dosage form, is recommended to be administered in the fasting state at least 30, ideally 60, minutes before breakfast.

Indeed, the American Thyroid Association guidelines for treatment of hypothyroidism recommend that LT4 be consistently taken either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime (≥ 3 hours postdinner) for optimal consistent absorption. These strict recommendations are inconvenient for patients, who may find them challenging to work around their daily schedule, to the point where 20% or more do not comply with the dosing recommendations. Nonadherence to LT4 therapy is quite common, potentially contributing to difficulties in achieving and maintaining therapeutic targets.

Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T4, bound and free, and TSH.

T3may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T4) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of T4and T3is suspected.

Myxedema Coma - Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. T4and T3may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given intravenously. Normal T4levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO-T may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO-T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO-T [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 Dosage

An initial intravenous loading dose of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection between 300 to 500 mcg, followed by once daily intravenous maintenance doses between 50 and 100 mcg, should be administered, as clinically indicated, until the patient can tolerate oral therapy. The age, general physical condition, cardiac risk factors, and clinical severity of myxedema and duration of myxedema symptoms should be considered when determining the starting and maintenance dosages of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection.

Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection produces a gradual increase in the circulating concentrations of the hormone with an approximate half-life of 9 to 10 days in hypothyroid patients. Daily administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection should be maintained until the patient is capable of tolerating an oral dose and is clinically stable. For chronic treatment of hypothyroidism, an oral dosage form of levothyroxine should be used to maintain a euthyroid state. Relative bioavailability between Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection and oral levothyroxine products has not been established. Based on medical practice, the relative bioavailability between oral and intravenous administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is estimated to be from 48 to 74%. Due to differences in absorption characteristics of patients and the oral levothyroxine product formulations, TSH and thyroid hormone levels should be measured a few weeks after initiating oral levothyroxine and dose adjusted accordingly.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease

Overtreatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate UNITHROID therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive UNITHROID therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant UNITHROID and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the UNITHROID dose for one week and restart at a lower dose.

5.2 Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.

5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency

Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with UNITHROID [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism

UNITHROID has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or under-treatment with UNITHROID may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of UNITHROID carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using UNITHROID and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control

Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing UNITHROID [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

Moderate quality evidence". While "thrice-daily synthetic liothyronine may be associated with beneficial effects on parameters such as weight and lipids", pharmacologic considerations include that "multiple daily dosing is required to sustain serum T3 levels given the much shorter half-life of LT3, compared with LT4" and reported "half-life values ranging from 6 to 22 hours". Experimental data further indicate that "normalization of serum TSH and hypothalamic TRH expression with T3 monotherapy requires serum T3 levels in the supranormal range".

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^111esriY]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5–25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2–4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

DAT development and validation study design

The DAT was developed on pilot data as described in Supplemental Data. Briefly, the model parameters were derived from four blood draws analyzed for TSH and fT4 obtained during the first two weeks of LT4 therapy. We assumed a log-linear relationship between TSH and fT4, and we modeled individual TSH-fT4 response and fT4 pharmacokinetics informed by population data. Individual TSH-fT4 responses are illustrated in Figure 1. We tested the DAT in a prospective multicenter trial where participants were randomized to either application of the DAT or not (controls). We used an automated stratified randomization based on diagnosis and participating hospital. After surgery, and before randomization, all participants were prescribed an LT4 starting dosage, usually between 100 and 150 μg/day depending on diagnosis, body weight, age, and comorbidity. They were then asked to give pre-LT4 ingestion blood samples twice per week for two weeks postoperatively (Fig. 2). To reduce variation in the measurements and model, patients were instructed to take the medicine and give all blood samples in the morning. On days of blood samples, patients were instructed to delay intake of LT4 until the blood was drawn. Two to three weeks after surgery, the participants received a follow-up call advising them to either keep the current dosage or change it. In the DAT group, the responsible surgeon was assisted by the DAT with a graphical plot of the predicted fT4 and TSH given a suggested dosage change (Fig. 3). The DAT was disabled in the control group, but the same blood samples were available to the clinician. We collected preoperative data about diagnosis, TSH-target, height, weight, age, sex, surgery date, creatinine, albumin, TSH, fT4, and free triiodothyronine. Postoperative data were collected about LT4 dosage, TSH, and fT4.

Intravenous injection

IV LT4 injection is the first-line option for myxedema, a rare but lethal crisis commonly due to long-standing undiagnosed hypothyroidism or treatment noncompliance. An IV preparation can also be administered to patients who refuse to receive oral administration, those with presurgical preparation of nil by mouth, subtotal ileum resection, and intractable hypothyroidism treated with high oral doses of LT4. To conclude, thyroid emergencies and inability of oral LT4 are indications for IV administration. Of note, the appropriate IV equivalent dose is estimated to be 48% to 74% of a previously adequate oral LT4 dose. Hence, the American Thyroid Association recommends an IV LT4 dose of 75% of the oral dose.

IV injection is strongly not recommended for long-term treatment due to its rapid and great effect on TH homeostasis. LT4 IV injection can augment the calorigenic effect of norepinephrine within minutes and thus exerts direct, rapid effects on the myocardium, which may lead to cardiac arrest. In addition, previous research has shown a positive correlation between the dose of IV LT4 and mortality in patients with myxedema. A 3- to 5-day course of IV LT4 with subsequent oral tablets is recommended to prevent potential adverse events and to save costs.

In the absence of IV injection, the nasogastric route of oral preparation is an alternative for hypothyroid crisis.

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^114zQhmY]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

In some patients, LT4 can be administered once or twice a week as a large dose rather than smaller daily doses, suggesting that the effect is related more to the total amount absorbed and its bioavailability than to peak concentrations reached.

There are several limitations of this study. One limitation was not assessing results under total fasting conditions (i.e. continued fasting four hours postadministration). This extreme condition is quite uncommon in real life, therefore it was considered to be decidedly less relevant clinical information for physicians and patients alike. Furthermore, other relevant time points, such as one hour before breakfast or taking the medication with breakfast, were not evaluated.

External generalizability of our findings to real-world hypothyroid patients is also limited, given that our study was conducted in healthy subjects under highly controlled study conditions. Generalizability may be particularly limited to hypothyroid patients with comorbidities who may be on multiple concurrent medications and whose diets may vary from that examined in the study.

Another limitation is that the assumption of improved convenience and potentially improved compliance with a 15-minute time frame for LT4 administration before breakfast was based on investigators' opinions and not formally studied in LT4-treated hypothyroid patients.

In conclusion, in this randomized, controlled, PK crossover study, the baseline-adjusted systemic exposure profiles of a novel LT4 solution were considered equivalent when administered to healthy subjects 15 or 30 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal in a highly controlled research setting. We thus propose that the interval between administration of this LT4 solution and food intake may be shortened from 30 to 15 minutes.

We believe that reducing this time interval could potentially improve convenience for patients and possibly facilitate adherence to therapy. Further research is needed to evaluate the differences in overall bioavailability at other time points, including immediately before breakfast.

Furthermore, research is needed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of this novel LT4 preparation in the newly proposed administration conditions to optimize treatment outcomes in hypothyroid patients.

### Timing of levothyroxine administration affects serum thyrotropin concentration [^1118o9dj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Patients treated with levothyroxine typically ingest it in a fasting state to prevent food impairing its absorption. The serum thyrotropin concentration is the therapeutic index of levothyroxine action.

Objective

The study objective was to determine the effect of the timing of levothyroxine administration in relationship to food on serum thyrotropin levels.

Design

Participants were randomized to one of six sequences, each consisting of three 8-wk regimens in a three-period crossover design. These regimens were in a fasting state, at bedtime, and with breakfast. The concentrations of TSH, free T(4), and total T(3) during each of the three timing regimens were documented. The primary outcome was the difference between serum TSH concentrations under fasting conditions compared with concentrations during the other 8-wk regimens.

Setting

The study was conducted in an academic medical center.

Participants

Study participants were receiving levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or thyroid cancer.

Results

Sixty-five patients completed the study. The mean thyrotropin concentration was 1.06 ± 1.23 mIU/liter when levothyroxine was administered in the fasting state. When levothyroxine was taken with breakfast, the serum thyrotropin concentration was significantly higher (2.93 ± 3.29 mIU/liter). When levothyroxine was taken at bedtime, the serum TSH concentration was also significantly higher (2.19 ± 2.66 mIU/liter).

Conclusion

Nonfasting regimens of levothyroxine administration are associated with higher and more variable serum TSH concentrations. If a specific serum TSH goal is desired, thereby avoiding iatrogenic subclinical thyroid disease, then fasting ingestion of levothyroxine ensures that TSH concentrations remain within the narrowest target range.

Thyroid extracts versus levothyroxine in adults with primary hypothyroidism — recommendation: We recommend that levothyroxine be considered as routine care for patients with primary hypothyroidism, in preference to use of thyroid extracts. Although there is preliminary evidence from a short-duration study that some patients may prefer treatment using thyroid extracts, high-quality controlled long-term outcome data are lacking to document superiority of this treatment compared to levothyroxine therapy. Furthermore, there are safety concerns related to the use of thyroid extracts, such as the presence of supraphysiologic serum triiodothyronine levels and a paucity of long-term safety outcome data.

### Levothyroxine [^111CcJZx]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1–0.5 mU/L for nodules and 0.5–1.0 mU/L for multinodular goiter) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine sodium is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Myxedema Coma - Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, oral thyroid hormone drug products are not recommended to treat this condition. Thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration should be administered.

Figure 4.
The protocol of the LT4 absorption test and the simulated alteration of serum total T4 levels. Patient medical history should be taken and any possible conditions responsible for impaired LT4 bioavailability should be ruled out prior to the test. After fasting overnight, a high dose of LT4 (in tablet form for most patients) is ingested with water by the patient. The standardized dose is determined by the patient's age and body mass index (BMI), namely, 1000 µg for patients aged between 18 and 65 with a BMI < 40 kg/m 2, 1500 µg for patients aged between 18 and 65 and a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2, and 600 µg for patients aged > 65. Blood specimens are collected for 6 hours (at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours, respectively) and are subsequently tested for total T4 and TSH. At the end of the test, vital signs and symptoms are reassessed. In the process, no food or medication is permitted to be ingested. The term of LT4 absorption test can be extended to 72 hours postdosing (without fasting) or be shortened to 2 hours. The percentage of LT4 absorption is calculated with the formula below. A percentage of 60% is defined as normal absorption which indicates a diagnosis of pseudomalabsorption. % Absorbed = [Increment TT4 (µg/dL) × 10/total administered LT4 (µg)] × Vd (L) × 100 Increment TT4 = peak [TT4] – baseline [TT4] Vd (volume of distribution) = 0.442 × BMI.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Risk of Cardiac Complications in Elderly and in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease

Excessive bolus dosing of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection (greater than 500 mcg) are associated with cardiac complications, particularly in the elderly and in patients with an underlying cardiac condition. Adverse events that can potentially be related to the administration of large doses of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection include arrhythmias, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia and infarction, or worsening of congestive heart failure and death. Cautious use, including doses in the lower end of the recommended range, may be warranted in these populations. Close observation of the patient following the administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is advised.

5.2 Need for Concomitant Glucocorticoids and Monitoring for Other Diseases in Patients with Endocrine Disorders

Occasionally, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, which can lead to myxedema coma, may occur in association with other autoimmune disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and insulin–dependent diabetes mellitus. Patients should be treated with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of treatment with Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, until adrenal function has been adequately assessed. Failure to do so may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis when thyroid hormone therapy is initiated, due to increased metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids by thyroid hormone. With initiation of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, patients with myxedema coma should also be monitored for previously undiagnosed diabetes insipidus.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^114ogLS4]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine administration timing with meals and beverages — recommendation and absorption effects: Because co‑administration of food and levothyroxine is likely to impair levothyroxine absorption, we recommend that, if possible, levothyroxine be consistently taken either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime (3 or more hours after the evening meal) for optimal, consistent absorption. Weak recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Under optimum fasting conditions, the absorption of an orally administered dose of LT4 is about 70%–80%, and if oral medications cannot be taken the appropriate intravenous dose is approximately 75% of the oral dose. When LT4 is co‑administered with food, absorption is reduced; in one study in healthy volunteers, LT4 absorption with food was 64% compared with 80% in the fasting state.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^112nYLHB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conduct of Review

The present systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID 1061048). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in reporting this study (Supplemental Material 1).

Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. The search aimed to identify studies reporting the proportion of "euthyroid" patients at their first follow-up after thyroidectomy and the strategy employed to estimate the LT4 starting dose. Euthyroid patients were defined as those with TSH levels within the target range specified in each article. For benign diseases, a higher TSH range was used, whereas for malignant conditions, risk-stratified TSH targets were applied. The search was restricted to articles published in English from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2024. The online search was conducted by the following algorithm: [(levothyroxine) or (L-thyroxine) or (LT4)] and [(thyroidectomy) or (athyreotic)] and (dose). In the attempt to expand the search, references in the retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional studies.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were original studies reporting the number of patients achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy evaluation and the criteria used to prescribe the initial LT4 dose. Exclusion criteria were studies lacking data on postthyroidectomy follow-up or underlying thyroid pathology, review articles, and outdated publications. Two independent researchers (I.C. P.C.) screened titles and abstracts based on these criteria. Subsequently, all authors independently reviewed the full text of eligible articles to confirm their inclusion in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

For each included study, the following information was extracted independently by 2 investigators (I.C. P.C.) in a piloted form: (1) study details (authors, publication year, and country of origin); (2) patient demographics [median age, body mass index (BMI), and sex]; (3) underlying thyroid pathology (benign or malignant); (4) LT4 dosing method; (5) follow-up data for the first and second postthyroidectomy controls. Extracted data were cross-checked for accuracy, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When studies included 2 (or more) different populations according to the LT4 dosing strategy employed, they were reported as separate series.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^111t1Wyk]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules

The target level for TSH suppression in these conditions has not been established with controlled studies. In addition, the efficacy of TSH suppression for benign nodular disease is controversial. Therefore, the dose of LEVOTHROID®used for TSH suppression should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated.

In the treatment of well-differentiated (papillary and follicular) thyroid cancer, levothyroxine is used as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to < 0.1 mU/L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg/kg/day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be < 0.01 mU/L.

In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1 to either 0.5 or 1.0 mU/L) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine sodium is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, oral thyroid hormone drug products are not recommended to treat this condition. Thyroid hormone drug products formulated for intravenous administration should be administered.

### The use of levothyroxine absorption tests in clinical practice [^117PZQwr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although levothyroxine (LT4) is a widely prescribed drug, more than 30% of LT4-treated patients fail to achieve the recommended serum level of thyrotropin with a body weight-based dose of LT4. An LT4 absorption test (LT4AT) is part of the workup for confirming normal LT4 absorption or diagnosing malabsorption. We searched PubMed with the terms levothyrox*, L-T4, LT4, TT4, FT4, FT3, TT3, test, loading, uptake, absorp*, "absorb*, bioavailab*, bioequiv* malabsorb*, and pseudomalabsorb*. A total of 43 full-text publications were analyzed. The published procedures for LT4AT differ markedly in the test dose, formulation, test duration, frequency of blood collection, analyte (total thyroxine [TT4] or free thyroxine [FT4]), metric (absolute or relative peak or increment, or area under the curve) and the threshold for normal absorption. In a standardized LT4AT for routine use, the physician could advise the patient to not consume food, beverages, or medications the morning of the test; administer 1000 µg of LT4 in the patient's usual formulation as the test dose; ensure that the patient is supervised throughout the LT4AT; perform a 4-hour test, with hourly blood samples; assay FT4; and consider that normal LT4 absorption corresponds to an FT4 increment of more than 0.40 ng/dL (5.14 pmol/L) or a TT4 increment of more than 6 μg/dL (77.23 nmol/L) for a test dose of at least 300 µg, or a percentage TT4 absorption of more than 60%. If the test indicates abnormal LT4 absorption, the physician can increase the LT4 dose, change the formulation or administration route, and/or refer the patient to a gastroenterologist.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### Levothyroxine replacement therapy and overuse: a timely diagnostic approach [^111XeNao]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Levothyroxine (LT4) is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide. Once started, approximately 90% of patients continue treatment long term. However, accumulating evidence suggests that many patients, for whom the indication for its administration is not adequately established and the diagnosis is not well documented, are overusing it. This study aimed to evaluate the necessity for and determine potential prognostic factors of long-term LT4 supplementation.

Methods

A prospective clinical cohort follow-up study was carried out. In 291 subjects (84% females) aged 48 ± 16 years on LT4 replacement therapy without a solid diagnosis of hypothyroidism being provided, the treatment was paused. At the beginning and after six to eight weeks of treatment discontinuation, thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine levels were assessed, and thyroid ultrasound was performed. A TSH value of ≥ 4.5 IU/mL was considered as underlying hypothyroidism.

Results

Among the 291 individuals, 114 became hypothyroid (group A), while 177 subjects remained euthyroid off LT4 (group B; 39.2% vs. 60.8%, p < 0.001). The groups were comparable regarding sex, family history, age, body mass index, duration of treatment, basal TSH and free thyroxine values, thyroid volume, and presence of thyroid autoantibodies. However, diffuse inhomogeneous echogenicity on ultrasound examination was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in group A.

Conclusions

These findings suggest considerable overuse of thyroxine therapy. The results underline the initial need to establish the diagnosis firmly before treatment initiation and to undertake periodic evaluation of all patients on chronic LT4 treatment as to the necessity for treatment continuation. In all patients on long-term LT4 therapy in whom the diagnosis has not been definitively established, it appears rational to introduce a six- to eight-week period of LT4 replacement therapy discontinuation, preceded and followed by TSH tests, as the first-line approach-a procedure that could be implemented as part of a common strategy among the scientific community to decrease current LT4 overuse.

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^115Uk4Y6]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

The screening visit occurred within 28 days before first dose administration. All subjects were admitted to the clinic at least 10 hours before drug administration and remained onsite until the 48-hour postdose blood draw for each period, reflecting a highly controlled research setting. The 72-hour postdose samples were collected on return visits. Serum samples were taken at three different times at baseline, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. The washout period was at least 35 days.

The study lasted ∼2.5 months in total. Serum concentrations of total (bound and free) T4 were measured using a validated Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry method. Safety monitoring included adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory results (i.e. hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, and serology), vital signs, electrocardiogram, and physical examinations. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that occurred on or after study drug administration and were classified according to the MedDRA ® dictionary, version 23.0.

PK parameters

PK parameters were calculated using standard noncompartmental methods for total T4, using serum concentrations and baseline-adjusted serum concentrations. For baseline correction, the baseline value (mean of 3 predose samples) was subtracted from each measured concentration for each subject and in each period.

Parameters included maximum observed concentration (C max), time of observed maximum concentration (t max), and area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 to 48 hours (AUC 0–48) and to 72 hours (AUC 0–72).

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^115kUxCQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement at the first post-operative follow-up might be harder than it could be expected. Despite various LT4 dose choosing strategies were tested, there is no consensus on the most effective approach to achieve early euthyroidism.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, including studies published between 2000 and 2024 that reported the proportion of patients achieving euthyroidism at first follow-up after total thyroidectomy. Data from 11 studies comprising 2577 patients were analyzed. LT4 dosing strategies included fixed-dose, weight-based (dose/kg), and individualized algorithm-based methods. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Results

The pooled euthyroidism rate at first follow-up was 33.9%, with high heterogeneity across studies (I² = 82.68%). No dosing strategy consistently outperformed others: dose/kg methods achieved 29% euthyroidism, while fixed or algorithm-based approaches achieved 40%, though without statistical significance. Meta-regression analysis did not identify any statistically significant predictor. No significant differences emerged between patients treated for benign or malignant thyroid diseases or between retrospective and prospective study designs.

Conclusions

Only about one-third of patients achieve euthyroidism at first follow-up after thyroidectomy, regardless of LT4 dosing strategy. The current guidelines recommendation of applying a pro/kg dose may not be adequate, and even personalized algorithms yield inconsistent results. Future prospective studies are needed to refine individualized dosing protocols and identify additional factors influencing LT4 requirements.

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^117RZ7uW]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

The composition, calories, and fat content of the meal are not typical for breakfast; however, they are specifically recommended by the FDA and EMA to represent the worst-case scenario in food effect studies. The physiological conditions induced by a high-fat meal generally provide the greatest effects on gastrointestinal physiology and the maximum effects on the systemic availability of drugs.

The investigation in healthy volunteers rather than hypothyroid patients ensured that there were no medical conditions or concomitant medications that could significantly impact LT4 PKs and bias the results of this study, allowing for high standardization. Moreover, PK studies in healthy volunteers are the recommended methodology to evaluate the effect of food on drug absorption.

The study design administered a high single dose of 600 mcg in healthy volunteers since their individual serum concentration–time profiles for PK assessment have to be baseline adjusted to account for endogenous T4 to accurately detect the orally administered LT4 and ensure that the comparative relative bioavailability results are robust. The washout period was at least 35 days between treatments due to the long elimination half-life of T4 (6–9 days) and to ensure that a significant period effect would not be seen.

The overall extent of exposure in the present study was investigated using a truncated AUC up to 72 hours because differences between formulations of the same active ingredient (here LT4) can only result in differences in the absorption process, not in the elimination, and would therefore have been detectable within the first 72 hours after dosing.

It should be noted that C max and t max were not considered to be clinically relevant with respect to the assessment of PK and therapeutic equivalence, as LT4 is used chronically and is a prohormone of T3. C max is mainly related to the safety of LT4; therefore, presumably a lower C max could be potentially beneficial rather than detrimental. In addition, the peak generated by exogenous administration of LT4 does not mimic the physiological conditions, whereas normal endogenous T4 levels remain quite stable over the day.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^114C5Dxo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVO-T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVO-T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO-T dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVO-T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^116GLqG2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.
