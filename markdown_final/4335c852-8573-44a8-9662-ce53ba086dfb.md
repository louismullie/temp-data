## Question

whats a good way to taper prednisone on a patient that is admitted for copd exacerbation and has been on prednisone 40 for 8 days

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage prednisone tapering in a patient who has been on 40 mg daily for 8 days due to a COPD exacerbation, specifically whether a taper is necessary and, if so, how to do it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current evidence-based duration for systemic steroids in acute COPD exacerbations. Then, I should verify whether tapering is required after short courses. Next, I will check for any exceptions such as prior chronic steroid use or risk of adrenal suppression. After that, I should outline a practical, safe plan for stopping therapy now, including monitoring and follow-up. Finally, I will consider alternatives like eosinophil-guided strategies and summarize the bottom line recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for steroid duration in acute COPD exacerbations. Current guidelines consistently recommend 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for 5 days as the usual course, with no routine benefit to longer durations, and oral therapy is preferred if feasible [^1111cf8t] [^116SWGkW] [^117D8CyV]. Wait, let me verify the pivotal trial data: the REDUCE randomized trial showed that 5 days of prednisone 40 mg daily was noninferior to 14 days for time to next exacerbation and reduced cumulative steroid exposure by about 50%, supporting shorter courses as standard practice [^113xqzFL] [^116yypFs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tapering. I need to check whether tapering is necessary after a short burst. The REDUCE trial stopped at 5 days without a taper and demonstrated noninferior outcomes, and contemporary reviews and guidelines conclude that tapering is not required for short courses of systemic steroids in COPD exacerbations, especially when total duration is under about 2 weeks [^113xqzFL] [^113QLgrN] [^113rXDqd]. Let me reconsider: some older practices used tapers out of concern for adrenal suppression, but that concern is largely unfounded after brief exposures in otherwise steroid-naïve patients [^113QLgrN].

> I should confirm the physiologic rationale. Short-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy of less than about 3–4 weeks is generally not associated with clinically meaningful HPA axis suppression, so abrupt discontinuation is acceptable without taper in most cases, particularly when the patient is steroid-naïve and the course is brief [^113QLgrN] [^112yXkR9]. But wait, what if the patient had prior chronic steroid exposure or repeated short bursts? In that scenario, the risk of adrenal suppression rises, and a taper would be more appropriate to mitigate withdrawal and insufficiency risk [^112yXkR9].

> Let me now examine the specifics of this case. The patient has received 40 mg prednisone daily for 8 days. This exceeds the guideline-preferred 5-day duration by only 3 days and remains within the evidence-based range where tapering is not required for steroid-naïve patients, assuming no prior long-term steroid use or other HPA risk factors [^1111cf8t] [^113QLgrN]. I should double-check that there is no history of chronic systemic steroid therapy or recent repeated bursts, and if none are present, a direct stop is appropriate [^113QLgrN].

> Next, I should review the immediate action plan. The most evidence-concordant approach is to stop prednisone now without a taper, since the total duration is 8 days and the patient is presumed steroid-naïve; no additional steroid is needed if the exacerbation is clinically resolved or resolving [^1111cf8t] [^113QLgrN]. Wait, I should verify the route: if the patient can take oral medications, oral prednisone is as effective as intravenous therapy and is preferred for convenience and equivalent outcomes, reinforcing that an oral 5–8 day course without taper is acceptable [^114mGGWt] [^116heFe3].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up. I need to ensure close clinical reassessment within 24–48 hours for symptom recurrence, and I should monitor for withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgia, or mood changes, while recognizing that these are uncommon after a single 8-day course; if concerning symptoms emerge, I should reconsider adrenal insufficiency and evaluate accordingly [^111XXZCf]. Hold on, I should verify hyperglycemia risk: systemic steroids increase hyperglycemia risk, so checking fasting or random glucose before discharge and arranging outpatient follow-up is prudent, especially in patients with diabetes risk factors [^117PBi3B] [^115JFKuE].

> Let me consider patient education and safety netting. The patient should be counseled that stopping prednisone now is safe and guideline-concordant, and advised to seek care promptly if symptoms worsen or new features develop, while reinforcing inhaler technique, smoking cessation, vaccinations, and optimal maintenance therapy to reduce future exacerbation risk [^1111cf8t] [^116SWGkW]. I should confirm that the maintenance regimen is appropriate before discharge and that follow-up with primary care or pulmonology is arranged within a week [^116SWGkW].

> But wait, what if we want to minimize steroid exposure further? Eosinophil-guided strategies can safely reduce cumulative steroid dose in appropriate patients. The CORTICO-COP trial showed that administering prednisolone only on days with eosinophils ≥ 0.3 × 10⁹/L resulted in a median steroid duration of 2 days with noninferior outcomes, supporting a biomarker-driven approach in selected hospitalized patients when logistics allow [^111ENo2N] [^114z4Rzf]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies mainly to patients with an eosinophilic phenotype; in non-eosinophilic exacerbations, withholding steroids may be reasonable in research settings, but routine practice still favors a short fixed course when indicated [^1111cf8t] [^1123AvJ3].

> Bottom line, after double-checking the evidence and exceptions, I recommend stopping prednisone 40 mg daily immediately without a taper, given a total 8-day course in a steroid-naïve patient, and proceeding with standard exacerbation follow-up and prevention strategies [^1111cf8t] [^113QLgrN]. I should confirm no prior chronic steroid use before stopping, and if any doubt remains or the patient develops concerning symptoms, I would reassess for adrenal insufficiency and manage accordingly, but in the typical case, no taper is needed here [^113QLgrN] [^111XXZCf].

For a patient with a COPD exacerbation who has received 8 days of prednisone 40 mg daily, the best course is to **stop prednisone immediately without tapering**, as current guidelines support a total duration of 5–7 days [^117D8CyV] and tapering is unnecessary for courses under 2 weeks [^113QLgrN]. Prolonging steroids increases risks of hyperglycemia, infection, and osteoporosis [^117HDGBN] without added benefit [^113xqzFL]. If clinical deterioration occurs after stopping, reassess for alternative causes or incomplete treatment rather than resuming steroids [^notfound].

## Evidence and guidelines on corticosteroid duration in COPD exacerbations

Current guidelines and trials consistently support a **5–7 day course** of systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations:

- **VA/DoD guideline**: 30–40 mg prednisone equivalent daily for 5–7 days; no benefit from higher doses or longer duration [^117D8CyV] [^114X6ccs].
- **GOLD 2025**: 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent daily for 5 days; longer courses increase pneumonia and mortality risk [^1111cf8t] [^116SWGkW].
- **REDUCE trial**: 5 days of 40 mg prednisone was noninferior to 14 days, with fewer adverse effects and no need to taper [^113xqzFL] [^116yypFs].
- **Cochrane review**: Shorter courses (≤ 7 days) are as effective and safe as longer courses (10–15 days) [^112HtCuf] [^112hVY8p].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged corticosteroid therapy

Extending steroids beyond 7 days increases **clinically significant risks**:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Higher incidence with longer courses [^notfound].
- **Infections**: Increased risk of pneumonia and other infections [^114mMbZL] [^1111cf8t].
- **Osteoporosis**: Higher fracture risk with prolonged exposure [^112yXkR9] [^117HDGBN].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, insomnia, and mood changes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting deviation from standard duration

Certain situations may justify **individualized decisions**, though tapering is still generally unnecessary for short courses:

- **Long-term steroid use**: Gradual taper if chronic steroids were used before the exacerbation [^112xM1E2].
- **Recurrent exacerbations**: Consider taper if frequent relapses occur, though evidence is limited [^notfound].
- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Taper if clinically suspected or diagnosed [^115YWoqk].

---

## Recommended approach for current patient

Given 8 days of prednisone 40 mg daily, **immediate cessation without tapering** is appropriate because the course is under 2 weeks and tapering is unnecessary [^113QLgrN]. This approach minimizes adverse effects without compromising efficacy [^113xqzFL] [^116yypFs].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After stopping prednisone, **monitor for relapse** and adverse effects:

- **Relapse**: Reassess for incomplete treatment or alternative diagnoses [^notfound].
- **Adverse effects**: Watch for hyperglycemia, infections, and psychiatric symptoms [^113jdbvi] [^117PBi3B].
- **Follow-up**: Arrange close follow-up to ensure stability and adjust maintenance therapy [^116SWGkW].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Standard COPD exacerbation (≤ 7 days of steroids) | Stop immediately without tapering [^113QLgrN] |
| Prolonged steroid course (8–14 days) | Stop immediately without tapering [^113QLgrN] |
| Chronic steroid use or adrenal insufficiency | Gradual taper over weeks to months [^117MR557] |
| Recurrent exacerbations | Individualized decision; consider taper if frequent relapses [^notfound] |

---

The best course for this patient is to **stop prednisone immediately without tapering**, as the total duration is within the evidence-based window for short-course therapy and tapering is unnecessary. This minimizes adverse effects without compromising efficacy; if deterioration occurs, reassess the diagnosis and treatment rather than resuming steroids [^1111cf8t] [^113xqzFL].

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to attempt tapering corticosteroids in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy only if the underlying disease for which corticosteroids were prescribed is controlled, and corticosteroids are no longer required. Taper corticosteroids in these cases until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (4–6 mg prednisone).

### Oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115CNm2T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are widely used in the management of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, in combination with other treatments.

Objectives

To determine the effect of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcome in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

An initial search was carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomised controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo. Other interventions were standardised e.g. bronchodilators, antibiotics. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted by one of the reviewers and sent to authors for verification. All trials were combined using Review Manager (version 4.1) for analysis.

Main Results

We have identified 7 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were varied and few were common to all studies. The most commonly reported outcome, the FEV1 between 6–72 hours after treatment, showed a significant treatment benefit for corticosteroid over placebo treatment, weighted mean difference 120 mL 95% confidence intervals: 5, 190 ml. There were significantly fewer treatment failures in patients given corticosteroid treatment, but the number of studies reporting this outcome was smaller and there was significant heterogeneity between them. There was an increased likelihood of an adverse drug reaction with corticosteroid treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment with oral or parenteral corticosteroids increases the rate of lung function improvement over the first 72 hours of an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but at a significantly increased risk of an adverse drug reaction. There is no evidence that this benefit is maintained after 72 hours, or that other outcomes are improved.

As shown in Table 2, the number of days alive and out of hospital within 14 days was greater for the low–medium (mean 8.4 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0–8.8) than the 14-day regimen group (mean 4.2 days; 95% CI 3.4–4.9; p < 0.001; Fig. 2 A). The 14-day regimen group had longer hospital stays (mean difference 5.4 days [SE ± 0.6]; p < 0.0001; Fig. 2 B), and lower likelihood of discharge within 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5; 95% CI 0.4–0.6; p < 0.0001; Fig. 3). An adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed no difference between the two groups in mortality risk during the 6-month follow-up period (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.4–1.5; p = 0.45). Adjusted logistic models showed there were no differences between the two groups in risk of 'death or admission to an ICU' (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; 95% CI 0.8–2.3]; p = 0.15) or new/aggravated hypertension (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.9–2.7; p = 0.15) during the 6-month follow-up period.

### Duration of corticosteroid use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: improving prescribing practices on clinical teaching units with peer-to-peer teaching [^112c18GY]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (COPDE) contribute to long-term decline in lung function and cause serious morbidity and mortality. Systemic corticosteroids (CS) are the mainstay of therapy and are associated with shorter recovery, improved lung function and reduced hospital stay. The most recent Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease consensus recommends a total duration of 5 days of CS for the treatment of COPDE. Since inappropriate duration of CS use is associated with adverse events, we aimed to optimise the duration of CS therapy (5 days) in adults hospitalised for COPDE on medical clinical teaching units (CTUs) of an academic medical centre with peer-to-peer teaching.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^117HDGBN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Patients with COPD are also at greater risk of developing pneumonia, mainly due to the impairment of lung defence mechanisms and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In addition, patients hospitalised for COPD and pneumonia exhibit substantially higher rates of intensive care admission, mortality and longer length of hospital stay compared with persons without COPD.

Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendation for treatment duration of systemic corticosteroids (oral corticosteroids, OCS) for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) has changed over the last decades, ranging from treatment durations of 10–14 days,7–10 daysand is currently 5–7 days. The last reduction was based on a robust randomised controlled trial.

OCS are recommended to patients with COPD during acute exacerbations, and most COPD exacerbations can safely be managed in the outpatient setting.OCS have been found to shorten the length of hospital stays, improve lung function, and reduce the risk of early relapse and treatment failure in patients with non-pneumonia exacerbation. No effect has been observed regarding longer-term lung function, length of stay at intensive care unit and 30-day mortality. Most clinical trials investigating OCS for exacerbations were performed on patients who require hospitalisation, and only a few have described the effect of OCS in the outpatient setting.

OCS use is associated with a number of adverse effects including hyperglycaemia, ﬂuid retention, weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, adrenal suppression, deep vein thrombosis, osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. Even short courses of OCS (median days = 6) have been associated with adverse effects, and they increase with increased number of OCS courses. In addition, OCS have been shown to cause severe infections due to their immunosuppressive activity, which impairs phagocyte function and suppresses cell-mediated immunity. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 71 pooled controlled trials that showed a relative risk of 1.6 for infectious events in the prednisolone group (n = 2111) compared with the controls (n = 2087). However, the risk of severe infections and death following the use of OCS is in general unknown and mainly short-term follow-up endpoints have been reported in patients with COPD. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, observational cohort study to determine the association between duration of OCS treatment in outpatients with AECOPD and the risk of pneumonia hospitalisation and all-cause mortality during a 1-year study period and to explore how the timing of the exposure affects the risk estimates.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^1123AvJ3]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

COPD exacerbations characterised by enhanced airway eosinophilic inflammation are generally milder, as they are associated with lower mortalityand shorter length of hospital stay. Bacterial infections are rarely present, while the presence of viral infection in exacerbations characterised by airway eosinophilia remains controversial. Higher blood eosinophil count during exacerbations is predictive of clinical response to oral corticosteroids. An RCT evaluating 166 mostly moderate severity exacerbations demonstrated the safety of withholding systemic corticosteroids in those characterised by a blood eosinophil count of less than 2% of total white cell count at baseline. While studies evaluating stable COPD suggested a degree of variability in blood eosinophils over time, this did not appear to limit the results of this trial. However, use of additional eosinophil measurements to guide the administration of systemic corticosteroids may be preferable, especially for severe exacerbations. Indeed, the Corticosteroid Reduction in COPD (CORTICO-COP) trial demonstrated non-inferiority of a treatment protocol where daily eosinophil measurements were used to guide daily administration of systemic steroids for severe COPD exacerbations, compared with standard care. Based on this treatment protocol, which reduced cumulative prednisolone dose by 60%, corticosteroids were administered for a maximum of up to 5 days — on days when the blood eosinophil count was at least 0.3×10⁹ cells/L. In line with these RCTs, a post-hoc analysis of three clinical trials, using blood eosinophils to direct oral corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of COPD exacerbations, found increased treatment failure rates in patients with a blood eosinophil count ≥ 2% who did not receive prednisolone compared with patients who did (66% vs 11%). On the contrary, increased harm was observed in patients with blood eosinophil count of < 2%, when treated with prednisolone. There remains an ongoing debate as to the appropriate eosinophil count threshold for risk stratification. This has been investigated in more depth in studies evaluating treatment of stable COPD with ICS. Several studies have reported a 2% eosinophil threshold, while others have focused on the absolute eosinophil counts. Based on data from the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, a consistent linear relationship between eosinophil counts and exacerbation risk was seen. In the same study, multivariable logistic regression models using different eosinophil count cut-offs found that a threshold of 0.3×10⁹ cells/L was associated with the greatest sensitivity (72.6%) and specificity (66.0%) for identifying a risk of self-reported exacerbation of at least one event. The Copenhagen Lung Study showed an increase in exacerbations when blood eosinophilia count was above 0.34×10⁹ cells/l 94. Overall, blood eosinophils represent a continuous biomarker and a threshold with perfect performance characteristics is very unlikely to be found.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117PBi3B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality. They contribute to long-term decline in lung function, physical capacity and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment includes antibiotics, bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration.

Search Methods

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and checked references of included studies and trials registries. We conducted the last search in May 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo, or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD. Other interventions (e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics) were standardised for both groups. We excluded clinical studies of acute asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison systemic corticosteroid versus placebo and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met inclusion criteria for the comparison oral corticosteroid versus parenteral corticosteroid and three studies contributed data (n = 239). The mean age of participants with COPD was 68 years, median proportion of males 82% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) per cent predicted at study admission was 40% (6 studies; n = 633). We judged risk of selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias as low or unclear in all studies. We judged risk of performance bias high in one study comparing systemic corticosteroid with control and in two studies comparing intravenous corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by over half compared with placebo in nine studies (n = 917) with median treatment duration 14 days, odds ratio (OR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.67). The evidence was graded as high quality and it would have been necessary to treat nine people (95% CI 7 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure. There was moderate-quality evidence for a lower rate of relapse by one month for treatment with systemic corticosteroid in two studies (n = 415) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). Mortality up to 30 days was not reduced by treatment with systemic corticosteroid compared with control in 12 studies (n = 1319; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66).FEV1, measured up to 72 hours, showed significant treatment benefits (7 studies; n = 649; mean difference (MD) 140 mL; 95% CI 90 to 200); however, this benefit was not observed at later time points. The likelihood of adverse events increased with corticosteroid treatment (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.43). Overall, one extra adverse effect occurred for every six people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.86 to 4.19). For general inpatient treatment, duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment (MD -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18), with no difference in length of stay the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Comparison of parenteral versus oral treatment showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of treatment failure, relapse or mortality or for any secondary outcomes. There was a significantly increased rate of hyperglycaemia in one study (OR 4.89; 95% CI 1.20 to 19.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence to support treatment of exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroid by the oral or parenteral route in reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and relapse by one month, shortening length of stay in hospital inpatients not requiring assisted ventilation in ICU and giving earlier improvement in lung function and symptoms. There is no evidence of benefit for parenteral treatment compared with oral treatment with corticosteroid on treatment failure, relapse or mortality. There is an increase in adverse drug effects with corticosteroid treatment, which is greater with parenteral administration compared with oral treatment.

### Budesonide and formoterol fumarate (Breyna) [^111VDx2R]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.7 Transferring Patients From Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREYNA may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress, a severe asthma attack or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe asthma attack, or a severe COPD exacerbation.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREYNA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREYNA. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma or COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to inhaled corticosteroids or BREYNA may unmask conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

### Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review [^115mqp89]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The consequences of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation are many. Adverse effects of an exacerbation include a negative impact on patient quality of life, an effect on symptoms and lung function that are associated with a lengthy recovery, an accelerated rate of decline in lung function and hospital admissions. Moreover, exacerbations may result in significant mortality, particularly in cases that require hospitalization and are associated with a high socioeconomic burden, with exacerbations accounting for most of total COPD healthcare expenditure. Therefore, any COPD exacerbation should not be underestimated given their detrimental impact, and their prevention is a key goal of COPD treatment. It is useful to consider that exacerbations are heterogeneous events and the nature of exacerbations is likely to differ between different subgroups of patients with COPD, such as patients with chronic bronchitis or severe emphysema.

This narrative review focuses on identifying and managing patients with COPD according to their risk and type of exacerbation and discusses current and evolving preventative strategies. Selection of the studies included in the 'Pharmacologic therapies to prevent COPD exacerbations' section of this paper were identified via a PubMed search [details provided in Additional file 1]. Given the nature of this review, the studies referred to herein did not need to adhere to any pre-specified exacerbation definition.

Identifying patients at risk of COPD exacerbations

How do we define an exacerbation of COPD?

Although most guidelines define exacerbations similarly, there are differences in the exact definition used [see Additional file 1: Table S1, which provides a non-comprehensive list of exacerbation definitions used within a selection of societal guideline documents]. Variations in the definition of exacerbations within clinical studies also exist. Clinical trials use event-based definitions of exacerbation, which necessitate an increase in symptoms and the use of healthcare resources, and grade exacerbations based on their severity, e.g. moderate exacerbations as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids/antibiotics and severe exacerbations as those necessitating hospitalization. In an attempt to establish a uniform definition of exacerbations to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) task force defined an exacerbation as an increase in respiratory symptoms over baseline that usually requires a change in therapy. It is relevant to note that many exacerbations go unreported and untreated.

### Are corticosteroids useful in late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^111CNZvz]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by intense inflammation and alveolar-capillary disruption that can progress to a state of unresolving inflammation and disordered fibrosis, referred to as fibroproliferative, late-stage, or persistent ARDS. These pathophysiologic features may be responsive to corticosteroids, but early high-dose, short-duration therapy was proven ineffective. More recently, several small and one moderate-size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated low-to-moderate-dose prolonged corticosteroid treatment. The RCT and meta-analysis consistently demonstrated improved oxygenation and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with methylprednisolone. The largest RCT also revealed less pneumonia and shock, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, but more cases of severe myoneuropathy, with methylprednisolone. There were virtually identical 60-day and 180-day mortality rates for methylprednisolone and placebo in the largest RCT. Sub-group analysis of that study showed significantly higher mortality with methylprednisolone than with placebo when enrollment occurred > 13 days after onset of ARDS, but small sample size and differences in subject characteristics probably confound those results. Most meta-analyses demonstrated trends toward better survival with methylprednisolone, and, when restricted to patients enrolled in RCTs who received prolonged administration of methylprednisolone that was initiated within the first 14 days of ARDS, one meta-analysis demonstrated better survival with corticosteroids. Importantly, the aforementioned studies have methodological limitations, and the number of subjects enrolled was small. Experts differ in their recommendations regarding corticosteroids for late-stage ARDS, although one consensus group supported a "weak" recommendation of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids for ARDS of < 14 days duration. If corticosteroids are administered, infection surveillance, avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, and gradual taper of corticosteroids are recommended.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^116yypFs]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) was published by Jörg D Leuppi and colleagues in 2013 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the trial question was: is short-term systemic corticosteroid therapy noninferior to conventional corticosteroid therapy in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD? In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the population was: 311 patients (123 female, 188 male). The inclusion criteria were patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation. The key exclusion criteria were history of asthma, ratio of FEV1 to FVC > 70% as evaluated by bedside postbronchodilator spirometry, radiological diagnosis of pneumonia, estimated survival < 6 months due to severe comorbidity, pregnancy or lactation. In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the interventions were: n = 156 short-term treatment (40 mg of prednisone daily for 5 days) n = 155 conventional treatment (40 mg of prednisone daily for 14 days). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in recurrent COPD exacerbation at 6 months (35.9% vs. 36.8%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.29). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in need for mechanical ventilation (11% vs. 13.6%; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.63) Significant increase in hospital stay (8 days vs. 9 days; HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.59). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension. significant differences in mean cumulative prednisone dose (379 vs. 793 mg, p < 0.001). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the conclusion was: in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, short-term treatment was noninferior to conventional treatment with respect to recurrent COPD exacerbation at 6 months.

### Association of corticosteroid dose and route of administration with risk of treatment failure in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114NDCjw]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Systemic corticosteroids are beneficial for patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, their optimal dose and route of administration are uncertain.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of patients treated with low doses of steroids administered orally to those treated with higher doses administered intravenously.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A pharmacoepidemiological cohort study conducted at 414 US hospitals involving patients admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD in 2006 and 2007 to a non-intensive care setting and who received systemic corticosteroids during the first 2 hospital days.

Main Outcome Measures

A composite measure of treatment failure, defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 days of discharge. Length of stay and hospital costs.

Results

Of 79,985 patients, 73,765 (92%) were initially treated with intravenous steroids, whereas 6220 (8%) received oral treatment. We found that 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3%-1.5%) of the intravenously and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.7%-1.2%) of the orally treated patients died during hospitalization, whereas 10.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-11.1%) of the intravenously and 10.3% (95% CI, 9.5%-11.0%) of the orally treated patients experienced the composite outcome. After multivariable adjustment, including the propensity for oral treatment, the risk of treatment failure among patients treated orally was not worse than for those treated intravenously (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84–1.02). In a propensity-matched analysis, the risk of treatment failure was significantly lower among orally treated patients (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.95), as was length of stay and cost. Using an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, increased rate of treatment with oral steroids was not associated with a change in the risk of treatment failure (OR for each 10% increase in hospital use of oral steroids, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.03). A total of 1356 (22%) patients initially treated with oral steroids were switched to intravenous therapy later in the hospitalization.

Conclusion

Among patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD low-dose steroids administered orally are not associated with worse outcomes than high-dose intravenous therapy.

### A multi-center randomized, controlled, open-label trial evaluating the effects of eosinophil-guided corticosteroid-sparing therapy in hospitalised patients with COPD exacerbations-the CORTICO steroid reduction in COPD (CORTICO-COP) study protocol [^111BYcp9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study design, randomization and intervention

The study will be conducted as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study in hospitalised patients with AECOPD. In total, 320 patients are expected to be included in the project within 24 months. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to either an intervention group where guidance of prednisolone treatment is based on daily eosinophil count ("eosinophil-guided corticosteroid-sparing therapy") or a standard group in which guidance of prednisolone is based on an existing guideline, see below. Pre-stratified block randomization with blocks of varying (and blinded) size will be applied to ensure equal distribution of patients on site (four different pulmonary departments in Denmark) and age (above or below 70 years of age). The study was monitored according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by the GCP unit at Bispebjerg University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms:
Standard Care (SC) group: Intravenous methylprednisolone 80 mg on the first day followed by 37.5 mg of prednisolone tablets daily for 4 days.
Intervention group: Intravenous methylprednisolone 80 mg, followed by prednisolone tablet 37.5 mg daily (maximum of 4 days in all) on days where the blood eosinophil count is ≥ 0.3 × 10⁹ cells/L. On days with eosinophil count < 0.3 × 10⁹ cells/L systemic corticosteroid treatment will not be administered.

If a patient is discharged during the treatment period, a treatment based on the last measured eosinophil count will be prescribed for the remaining days within the 5 day-period.

Selection of participants

All consecutive patients admitted with AECOPD in participating centres will be considered for study enrolment (Fig. 1). Fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients will be invited to participate in the project. The aim is to enroll a sample representative of hospitalized patients with AECOPD in Denmark. Subjects on chronic systemic corticosteroids will be eligible for inclusion if they are receiving systemic corticosteroids corresponding to 5–10 mg daily. Patients receiving non-invasive ventilation (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Bilevel Positive airway pressure) were only recruited if they were admitted at one of the four recruiting departments.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: comparative effectiveness research in pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine [^111KDAvk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation comparative effectiveness — initial high-dose intravenous corticosteroids versus low-dose oral corticosteroids — is illustrated across efficacy, effectiveness, and observational designs with explicit eligibility, dosing, timing, and outcomes. Efficacy trial eligibility required Age > 50 yr, 20 pack-years or more smoked, and FEV1 < 50% of predicted. The efficacy oral intervention was initiated within 6 h of presentation with 40 mg/d x 10 d, while the intravenous comparator was initiated within 6 h using methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d. The efficacy primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 d of discharge. Effectiveness trial protocols initiated oral corticosteroids within 24 h of hospital admission at 40 mg/d x 10 d and intravenous corticosteroids within 24 h with methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d; patient-centered outcomes included return to baseline level of functional health, hospital length of stay, and readmission or death within 30 d. Observational definitions used ICD-9 discharge codes with Age > 50 yr and no exclusions; oral exposure was prednisone via mouth at least 40 mg/d for 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission, and intravenous exposure was methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h for at least 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^114mMbZL]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Key messages

This nationwide cohort study reports a strong association between the long course (10 days) of oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment and the sustained increase in risk of admission with pneumonia and all-cause mortality — up to 1 year after exposure — in outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as compared with a short course (5 days) of OCS.
There was a time-dependent change in the magnitude of risk: those with current exposure had a higher vulnerability to pneumonia and all-cause mortality.
Understanding how risk depends on patterns of OCS will contribute to improved benefits and harm assessment.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^115inyaU]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our data do not support using 14-day systemic corticosteroid regimens to treat hospitalised patients with COPD exacerbations. Patients who were randomly assigned to 2–5-day systemic corticosteroid regimens showed more favourable primary outcomes; a result driven by the substantially shorter admission durations. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these results are due to factors other than corticosteroid dose.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of COPD… [^116sLjh6]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do oral or parenteral corticosteroids improve clinical outcomes in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence-Based Answer Systemic corticosteroids improve symptoms of acute COPD exacerbations at three days and reduce the likelihood of treatment failure. There is no evidence that they reduce mortality or prevent recurrence at 30 days, but the existing studies may be too small to detect such a benefit. Adverse effects are common but generally are not serious. Practice Pointers This Cochrane review updates an earlier meta-analysis with two new studies. Although systemic steroids are widely used for the treatment of acute COPD exacerbations, the authors stress that it is important to know the magnitude of their benefit and the extent of associated side effects. The question of whether oral or intramuscular steroids are more effective was not addressed.

Four of the studies in this analysis involved oral prednisone with an initial dose of 30 to 60 mg tapering over nine to 14 days; in a fifth study, high-dose oral prednisone was compared with a moderate dose. In studies of intravenous methylprednisolone, a variety of dosing regimens were used, from a single 100-mg dose to 72 hours of methylprednisolone followed by a 57-day prednisone taper. Despite the differences between studies, the review authors were able to combine the results from seven studies of treatment failure and nine studies of mortality. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the likelihood of treatment failure. Respiratory symptom scores at 72 hours were significantly more likely to be improved if patients received steroids.

However, adverse events were common; the number needed to harm was 7 for any adverse event. In addition to steroids, albuterol should be used for bronchodilation because of its short onset of action. Ipratropium bromide may be added. Antibiotics also should be considered for exacerbations that are not clearly triggered by viral infections. 1.

### Medication regimens for managing COPD exacerbations [^114ziMd3]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a hallmark feature of COPD and contribute to morbidity and mortality. There is general agreement that the pharmacotherapy of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Strong evidence exists for the benefit of corticosteroids for exacerbations and of antibiotics in the acute hospital setting. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, in the best drug selection, dose, route, and duration of treatment. This article reviews the evidence base and expert recommendations for drug treatment of COPD exacerbations in the out-patient and in-patient settings.

### Association of systemic corticosteroid use with prognosis of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the intensive care unit: a propensity score-matched cohort study [^115BS6yH]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is clinically manifested as a series of respiratory symptoms resulting from persistent airflow restriction. Nearly 400 million patients are suffering from COPD, and it has been the third leading cause of death worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) play an important role in the disease progression which could accelerate the decline of lung function and increase the risk of mortality.

AECOPD is considered to be associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation caused by respiratory infections, air pollution, or other unknown factors. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) reports have recommended systemic corticosteroid for the treatment of severe acute exacerbations of COPD based on the evidence suggesting that the use of systemic corticosteroid can improve the lung function, shorten the length of hospital stay, and decrease the risk of treatment failure. However, little is known about the use of systemic corticosteroid in critically ill patients with AECOPD, because most of previous trials excluded those who were admitted to intensive care units (ICU) or needed mechanical ventilation. The two previous clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. A Spanish multicenter trial revealed that intravenous methylprednisolone treatment contributed to a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation and the rate of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) failure. Another Tunisian multicenter trial showed that oral prednisone has no impact on relevant outcomes. More importantly, both of the studies were stopped prematurely because of the poor recruitment, which made them underpowered to reach a definitive conclusion. Interestingly, another recent cohort study found that the systemic corticosteroids had a positive impact on the composite outcome which was defined as death or need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

In brief, the association between the administration of systemic corticosteroid and the prognosis of critically ill patients with AECOPD needs further investigation. We undertook this propensity score-matched cohort study using the Medical Information Mart in Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database to include patients with a larger sample size. Moreover, we performed subgroup analyses to further identify the potential responders to systemic corticosteroid therapy.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, corticosteroids, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering systemic corticosteroids (typically no more than 5 days) to improve FEV1, oxygenation, and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration in patients with acute exacerbation.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^111Pv5Mg]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This two-study meta-analysis showed that patients randomly allocated to the 2–5-day corticosteroid dose group had more days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment than those randomly allocated to the 14-day dose group. In addition, data recorded for the lengths of hospital stay and time to discharge favoured treatment with 2–5-day dose corticosteroids. Although there was no difference between the groups in the risks of ICU admission or death and new or aggravated hypertension, there was a trend towards poorer outcomes in the 14-day dose group. These observations are consistent with previous observational studies that have shown greater risks of infection and mortality when patients are treated with corticosteroids for 10 days rather than 5 days. As in this analysis, the REDUCE trial found that the median length of hospital stay in the 5-day group dose group was 1 day shorter than in the 14-day dose group. Other studies have reached similar conclusions regarding the duration of treatment. A recent meta-analysis compared short-term (≤ 7 days) with longer-term (> 7 days) systemic corticosteroid treatment of patients with exacerbation of severe or very severe COPD and found no differences in the likelihood of treatment failure, risk of relapse, change in lung function tests or adverse effects. Several studies suggest that an even shorter duration of systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g. 3 days, 5 days or 7 days) may be as effective as longer courses in hospitalised patients with AECOPD. These results are similar to those of previous systematic reviews and support the use of shorter systemic corticosteroid treatment regimens.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^114z4Rzf]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid administration for severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) reduces the duration of hospital stays. Corticosteroid-sparing regimens have showed non-inferiority to higher accumulated dose regimens regarding re-exacerbation risk in patients with AECOPD. However, it remains unclear whether 14-day or 2–5-day regimens would result in shorter admission durations and changes in mortality risk. We explored this by analysing the number of days alive and out of hospital based on two randomised controlled trials with different corticosteroid regimens.

Methods

We pooled individual patient data from the two available multicentre randomised trials on corticosteroid-sparing regimens for AECOPD: the REDUCE (n = 314) and CORTICO-COP (n = 318) trials. In the 14-day regimen group, patients were older, fewer patients received pre-treatment with antibiotics and more patients received pre-treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Patients randomly allocated to the 14-day and 2–5-day regimens were compared, with adjustment for baseline differences.

Results

The number of days alive and out of hospital within 14 days from recruitment was higher for the 2–5 day regimen group (mean 8.4 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0–8.8) than the 14-day regimen patient group (4.2 days; 95% CI3.4–4.9; p < 0.001). The 14-day AECOPD group had longer hospital stays (mean difference, 5.4 days [standard error ± 0.6]; p < 0.0001) and decreased likelihood of discharge within 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5; 95% CI 0.4–0.6; p < 0.0001). Comparing the 14-day regimen and the 2–5 day regimen group showed no differences in the composite endpoint 'death or ICU admission' (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; 95% CI 0.8–2.3; p = 0.15), new or aggravated hypertension (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.9–2.7; p = 0.15), or mortality risk (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.4–1.5; p = 0.45) during the 6-month follow-up period.

Conclusion

14-day corticosteroid regimens were associated with longer hospital stays and fewer days alive and out of hospital within 14 days, with no apparent 6-month benefit regarding death or admission to ICU in COPD patients. Our results favour 2–5 day regimens for treating COPD exacerbations. However, prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

### Improving adherence for management of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111Erv3q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend 40–60 mg of prednisone equivalent for 10–14 days for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the amount of corticosteroid prescribed varies widely in clinical practice. Using the electronic health record, we implemented an evidence-based order set to standardize treatment of patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Methods

This is a pre- and post-intervention study on patients hospitalized between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2012 with primary discharge diagnosis of COPD (International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) Revision code: 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496) and receipt of at least one dose of corticosteroid at our tertiary care hospital. Data on baseline demographics, dose of corticosteroid in prednisone equivalent administered during the first 48 hours and during the entire hospitalizations were collected from the electronic health record. Evidence-based guidelines were used to build and implement acute exacerbations of COPD management electronic ordersets in our electronic health record, Epic (Verona, WI). We divided the study into 2 time periods (January 1, 2009 through February 28, 2011 as pre- [n = 203] and March 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 as post-intervention periods [n = 217]). The primary outcome measure was corticosteroid dose administered in the first 48 hours. Secondary outcome measures were corticosteroid dosage during the entire hospitalization, length of stay, hospital follow-up rates, and 30-day readmission rates.

Results

A total of 420 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD were included in the study. In the post-intervention period, the median amount of corticosteroid used in the first 48 hours was significantly reduced (306.2 mg vs 156.25 mg, P < .0001), as was that used during the entire hospitalization (352.5 mg vs 175 mg, P < .0001). There was no difference in hospital follow-up rates, length of stay, or 30-day readmission rates between the 2 periods.

Conclusions

Evidence-based electronic ordersets improve compliance with clinical practice guidelines and reduce the total dose of corticosteroid administered in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

### Systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use in hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^113VD5ia]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective inpatient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management is critical to appropriately manage health care resources. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines provide recommendations on appropriate systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use, in select patients, for COPD exacerbation.

Objective

To determine the impact of GOLD guideline-recommended systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy in the hospital setting on clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbation.

Methods

This was a noninterventional, retrospective, single-center study. Adults admitted to a non-intensive care unit internal medicine service with documented COPD exacerbation were included. Two analyses were conducted evaluating systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy.

Results

A total of 220 patients were included in the systemic corticosteroid cohort. No difference in 30-day readmission rates was demonstrated for the standard (≤ 200 mg prednisone equivalents [PEs] for exacerbation course) and high-dose groups (> 200 mg PEs; 20.5% vs 13.1%, respectively; P = 0.15). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was significantly shorter for patients prescribed standard-dose therapy (3 days [2–4.5] vs 4 days [2–6]; P < 0.001). A total of 174 patients were included in the antibiotic cohort. For the appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic use groups, no significant differences were observed between 30-day readmission rates (15% vs 18.4%, respectively; P = 0.57) and hospital LOS (4 days [2–5] in both groups; P = 0.97). Conclusion and Relevance: Hospital LOS was shorter for patients prescribed standard-dose systemic corticosteroids; however, no differences in other clinical outcomes were found in either cohort. Use of guideline-recommended systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy is recommended for hospitalized patients with COPD exacerbation.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116SWGkW]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of exacerbations — pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for COPD exacerbations… [^112hVY8p]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are shorter courses of systemic corticosteroid therapy as safe and effective as conventional, longer courses for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence-Based Answer Treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD with a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids is likely to be as effective and safe as treating with longer courses. There is no significant difference in adverse effects between shorter and longer courses.

1. Practice Pointers COPD is a chronic, progressive lung condition resulting in airflow limitations. Patients with COPD are at risk of acute exacerbations, which may present as dyspnea, increased cough, and sputum production. Systemic corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment, but the necessary duration of treatment is debated.

The authors of this review assessed whether a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids was as safe and effective as the more conventional 10- to 14-day course. Five studies used oral prednisolone, one study used intravenous methylprednisolone, and two studies used a combination of oral and intravenous corticosteroids. Shorter courses of corticosteroids ranged from three to seven days of treatment; longer courses ranged from 10 to 15 days. This review did not discuss whether three days of treatment is equivalent to other courses of up to seven days of treatment. The studies included only patients with severe to very severe COPD, although the criteria for this were not well-defined or consistent among studies. Three studies used pulmonary function testing diagnostic criteria, but even those criteria were not uniform. Primary outcomes included treatment failure, relapse after treatment, and adverse drug effects.

There was no difference in any primary outcomes between patients who were treated with systemic corticosteroids for seven or fewer days and those who were treated for more than seven days. The investigators rated the evidence for primary outcomes as moderate, with imprecision as a reported limiting factor. As noted, the studies did not specifically address outpatient therapy for COPD exacerbations and excluded patients with mild or moderate COPD. Current guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommend treating acute exacerbations of COPD with oral prednisone, 40 mg per day for five days in most patients. 2 The practice recommendations in this activity are available at http: //www. cochrane. org/CD006897.

### Randomised, controlled trial of N-acetylcysteine for treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111LKniZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In contrast to N-acetylcysteine, prednisone and prednisolone are effective treatments for acute exacerbations of COPD. Davies et al studied 56 patients admitted to hospital with an exacerbation of COPD and found that prednisolone led to a greater improvement in lung function and shortened the hospital stay. Other studies have confirmed the efficacy of corticosteroids in severe exacerbations of COPD. There is evidence of increased numbers of eosinophils in the airways during exacerbations of COPD. Corticosteroids are very effective at suppressing eosinophilic inflammation in the airways and this may account for the benefit seen in exacerbations of COPD. When children with an exacerbation of asthma are treated with prednisone, there is a marked reduction in the concentration of 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate. 8-isoprostane is a marker of oxidative stress. If N-acetylcysteine prevents exacerbations of COPD because it is an anti-inflammatory agent and/or antioxidant, it may be difficult to see additional benefit in established exacerbations of COPD when the patients are also treated with prednisone, which has anti-inflammatory actions and the potential to reduce formation of reactive oxygen species from inflammatory cells.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111XJUZy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The risk of AI is also related to the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the OCS used (e.g. bioavailability, protein‐binding affinities, plasma half‐life and metabolic inactivation and clearance). Repeat courses of OCS are also a risk factor for AI, and patients with a predisposition to HPA axis dysfunction as a consequence of other underlying conditions or medications may be particularly susceptible to AI caused by OCS. Still, the risk of AI can be reduced, though not fully negated, by using the lowest effective dosage of OCS for the shortest amount of time.

Although the absolute risk of developing AI following a short course of OCS is often assumed to be low, clinically relevant HPA axis suppression may be substantially under‐recognized and under‐reported in clinical practice. In a study by Schuetz and colleagues, a 14‐day course of systemic corticosteroids (40 mg methylprednisolone injection once followed by 13 days of 40 mg oral prednisone) led to HPA axis suppression (as gauged by response to the 1 µg corticotropin [synthetic ACTH 1‐24] stimulation test) in 7 of 9 patients on the first day following commencement of corticosteroid treatment; this increased to 8 of 9 by the last day of therapy. Moreover, 21 days after discontinuation of treatment, 3 patients still had evidence of adrenal dysfunction. Although all 9 patients had an underlying diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 5 were on inhaled corticosteroids at the time of admission, none had received systemic corticosteroid therapy in the preceding 6 months.

Perhaps even more compelling are the findings of Henzen and colleagues, who examined suppression and recovery of adrenal response (using 1 µg corticotropin) in 75 hospitalized patients who were receiving glucocorticoid treatment at an equivalent of at least 25 mg prednisone daily for the first time in their lives. Overall, 41 (55%) patients were classified as having a normal adrenal response; the other 34 (45%) patients had stimulated plasma cortisol levels below the predefined cut‐off when tested between 24 h and 72 h after stopping glucocorticoid therapy. Those with a normal response had similar durations of treatment (median 8 days [range: 5–30]) as those with suppressed responses (median 10 days [range 5–30]), as well as similar median daily and cumulative dosages. Although the majority of patients showed a full recovery within 2 weeks, 2 patients continued to demonstrate suboptimal responses and required longer‐term follow‐up.

### Eosinophil-guided corticosteroid therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COPD exacerbation (CORTICO-COP): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^111ENo2N]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

Treatment with systemic corticosteroids in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with debilitating adverse effects. Therefore, strategies to reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure are urgently required and might be offered by a personalised biomarker-guided approach to treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether an algorithm based on blood eosinophil counts could safely reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure in patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial at the respiratory departments of three different university-affiliated hospitals in Denmark. Eligible participants were patients included within 24h of admission to the participating sites, aged at least 40 years, with known airflow limitation (defined as a post-bronchodilator FEV₁/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio ≤ 0.70) and a specialist-verified diagnosis of COPD, who were designated to start on systemic corticosteroids by the respiratory medicine physician on duty. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either eosinophil-guided therapy or standard therapy with systemic corticosteroids. Both investigators and patients were aware of the group assignment. All patients received 80 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on the first day. The eosinophil-guided group were from the second day given 37.5 mg of prednisolone oral tablet daily (for a maximum of up to 4 days) on days when their blood eosinophil count was at least 0.3 × 10⁹ cells per L. On days when the eosinophil count was lower, prednisolone was not administered. If a patient was discharged during the treatment period, a treatment based on the last measured eosinophil count was prescribed for the remaining days within the 5-day period (last observation carried forward). The control group received 37.5 mg of prednisolone tablets daily from the second day for 4 days. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment, assessed by intention to treat (ITT). Secondary outcomes included treatment failure at day 30 (ie, recurrence of acute exacerbation of COPD resulting in emergency room visits, admission to hospital, or need to intensify pharmacological treatment), number of deaths on day 30, and duration of treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The non-inferiority margin was 1.2 days (SD 3.8). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02857842, and was completed in January, 2019.

Findings

Between Aug 3, 2016, and Sept 30, 2018, 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 159 patients in the control group were included in the ITT analyses. There was no between-group difference for days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment: mean 8.9 days (95% CI 8.3–9.6) in the eosinophil-guided group versus 9.3 days (8.7–9.9) in the control group (absolute difference -0.4, 95% CI -1.3 to 0.5; p = 0.34). Treatment failure at 30 days occurred in 42 (26%) of 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 41 (26%) of 159 in the control group (difference 0.6%, 95% CI -9.0 to 10.3; p = 0.90). At 30 days nine patients (6%) of 159 in the eosinophil-guided group and six (4%) of 159 in the control group had died (difference 1.9%, 95% CI -2.8 to 6.5; p = 0.43). Median duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy was lower in the eosinophil-guided group: 2 days (IQR 1.0 to 3.0) compared with 5 days (5.0 to 5.0) in the control group, p < 0.0001.

Interpretation

Eosinophil-guided therapy was non-inferior compared with standard care for the number of days alive and out of hospital, and reduced the duration of systemic corticosteroid exposure, although we could not entirely exclude harm on some secondary outcome measures. Larger studies will help to determine the full safety profile of this strategy and its role in the management of COPD exacerbations.

### Dapagliflozin for prednisone-induced hyperglycaemia in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1154hvEm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is complicated by hyperglycaemia in 53% to 82% of patients without pre‐existing diabetes, and in 96% to 100% of patients with pre‐existing diabetes. 1 Hyperglycaemia during AECOPD is associated with longer hospitalization and higher mortality rates. 2

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently need systemic glucocorticoid therapy for AECOPD. Treatment with 30 to 40 mg prednisone for 5 to 14 days limits the duration and severity of an exacerbation. 3

As a side effect, prednisone increases endogenous glucose production and induces insulin resistance. 4 These phenomena result in a specific pattern of postprandial hyperglycaemia starting ~3 hours after administration and continuing for 24 to 36 hours. 1

Treatment of hyperglycaemia attributable to prednisone can be challenging because of severe insulin resistance. Current practice is insulin therapy, often administered in a sliding‐scale regimen. 5 However, high doses and frequent adjustments are required and, despite intensive treatment, glycaemic control is often inadequate. 6 Furthermore, duration of hospital stay for AECOPD is usually shorter than duration of prednisone therapy, so patients often finish their prednisone course at home. 3 Intensive insulin regimens may be difficult to execute outside the hospital, especially for insulin‐naïve patients.

Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral agents that block renal glucose reabsorption, leading to urinary glucose excretion and thereby to a reduction in blood glucose concentration. 7 Their mechanism of action is independent of β‐cell function and different from agents improving insulin sensitivity. SGLT2 inhibitors therefore have a complementary effect to routine diabetes medication in patients with pre‐existing diabetes. 8 The low risk of hypoglycaemia and rapid onset of action (maximum plasma concentration achieved within 1–2 hours after oral administration) make SGLT2 inhibitors an attractive option for treatment of prednisone‐induced hyperglycaemia during AECOPD. 9

The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of add‐on treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily with placebo in patients with prednisone‐induced hyperglycaemia during treatment for AECOPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112tBTNP]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Oral glucocorticoids — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), oral glucocorticoids have numerous side effects, including steroid myopathy which can contribute to muscle weakness, decreased functionality, and respiratory failure in people with very severe COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids for treating acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or during emergency department visits have been shown to reduce the rate of treatment failure, the rate of relapse and to improve lung function and breathlessness, whereas prospective studies on the long-term effects in stable COPD are limited. Therefore, while they play a role in the acute management of exacerbations, they have no role in the chronic daily treatment in COPD because of a lack of benefit balanced against a high rate of systemic complications.

### Prednisone (predniSONE tablets, USP, 20 mg) [^1176ye1G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

### Oral corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1168PZFo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic lung disorder, usually related to cigarette smoking, representing a major and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality. It is defined "as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases". The use of corticosteroids for their anti-inflammatory effects has been suggested.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids on the health status of patients with stable COPD.

Search Strategy

Searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and MEDLINE were carried out in December 2003 and 2004. Review articles and bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled prospective studies in adults with stable COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1 < 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC < 70%) and a history of smoking, excluding known asthmatics, in which oral steroid use was compared with placebo and use of co-interventions was matched in both groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted independently by two reviewers. All trials were combined using Review Manager (version 4.2.7).

Main Results

From 459 titles 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Treatment lasted three weeks or less in 19 studies, high dose oral steroid was used in 21 studies and subjects had moderate or severe COPD in 15 studies. There was a significant difference in FEV1 after two weeks treatment, WMD 53.30 ml; 95% confidence interval 22.21 to 84.39 favouring oral steroid use compared to placebo when 14 studies with available data (n = 396) were combined, with no significant heterogeneity. There was a significant increase in odds for individual patient FEV1 response greater than 20% from baseline with high dose oral steroid treatment compared to placebo, OR 2.71; 95% CI 1.84 to 4.01 (9 studies). It would be necessary to treat 7 patients (95% CI 5 to 12) with oral corticosteroids to achieve one extra case of increasing FEV1 by more than 20%, with a placebo group risk of 0.13. All differences in health-related quality of life were less than the minimum clinically important difference. There were small statistically significant advantages for functional capacity and respiratory symptom of wheeze with oral steroid treatment but no significant difference in risk of withdrawal from study due to an exacerbation or rate of serious exacerbations over 2 years with low dose oral steroid treatment. There was an increased risk of adverse effects, including increased blood glucose, adrenal suppression and reduced serum osteocalcin.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the long-term use of oral steroids at doses less than 10–15 mg prednisolone though some evidence that higher doses (≥ 30 mg prednisolone) improve lung function over a short period. Potentially harmful adverse effects e.g. diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis would prevent recommending long-term use at these high doses in most patients.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^111jTzcz]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbation of COPD — systemic corticosteroids beyond 30 days: For patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD in the outpatient or inpatient setting, we recommend that systemic corticosteroids not be given orally or intravenously for the sole purpose of preventing hospitalization due to subsequent acute exacerbations of COPD beyond the first 30 days following the initial acute exacerbation of COPD (Grade 1A). A remark clarifies this does not preclude the use of systemic corticosteroids for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and the underlying text notes they have not been shown to reduce exacerbations beyond 30 days and that no evidence supports long-term corticosteroids, with risks that far outweigh any benefits.

### TNF α antagonists for acute exacerbations of COPD: a randomised double-blind controlled trial [^113yQ3jX]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this randomised double-blind double-dummy placebo-controlled trial was to investigate whether etanercept, a tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) antagonist, would provide more effective anti-inflammatory treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than prednisone.

Methods

We enrolled 81 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD and randomly assigned them to treatment with either 40 mg oral prednisone given daily for 10 days or to 50 mg etanercept given subcutaneously at randomisation and 1 week later. Both groups received levofloxacin for 10 days plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary endpoint was the change in the patient's forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 14 days after randomisation. Secondary endpoints included 90-day treatment failure rates and dyspnoea and quality of life.

Results

At 14 days the mean ± SE change in FEV(1) from baseline was 20.1 ± 5.0% and 15.2 ± 5.7% for the prednisone and etanercept groups, respectively. The mean between-treatment difference was 4.9% (95% CI -10.3% to 20.2%), p = 0.52. Rates of treatment failure at 90 days were similar in the prednisone and etanercept groups (32% vs 40%, p = 0.44), as were measures of dyspnoea and quality of life. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with serum eosinophils > 2% at exacerbation tended to experience fewer treatment failures if treated with prednisone compared with etanercept (22% vs 50%, p = 0.08).

Conclusions

Etanercept was not more effective than prednisone for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. Efficacy of prednisone was most apparent in patients who presented with serum eosinophils > 2%.

### Systemic glucocorticoids in severe exacerbations of COPD [^111BpeWj]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the efficacies of 3-day and 10-day courses of methylprednisolone (MP) treatment in severe COPD exacerbations necessitating hospitalization for respiratory failure.

Design

Prospective, randomized, single-blind study.

Setting

Tertiary-care center.

Patients and Methods

Thirty-six patients were included in the study and randomized into two groups: group 1 received MP, 0.5 mg/kg q6h for 3 days, and group 2 was administered the same dosage of MP for the first 3 days, after which it was tapered and terminated on the tenth day. There was no difference between the groups for age, baseline FEV(1), PaO(2), PaCO(2), and pH levels. One patient in group 1 who developed pneumothorax and one patient in group 2 who had steroid-related psychosis could not complete the study.

Results

Both groups showed significant improvements in PaO(2) and FEV(1) levels, but these were more marked in group 2 (p = 0.012 and p = 0.019, respectively). There was a significant increase in FVC levels in group 2 only (p = 0.003). Group 2 also had a more marked improvement in dyspnea on exertion. There was no difference between the two groups with regards to other parameters, including pH, PaCO(2) levels, and other symptom scores. Six patients in group 1 and five patients in group 2 developed new exacerbations within the following 6 months. Hyperglycemia occurred in two patients in each group.

Conclusion

In severe COPD exacerbations, a 10-day course of steroid treatment is more effective than a 3-day course in improving the outcome, but has no benefit in reducing exacerbation rates.

### Oral or IV prednisolone in the treatment of COPD exacerbations: a randomized, controlled, double-blind study [^114mGGWt]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with systemic corticosteroids for exacerbations of COPD results in improvement in clinical outcomes. On hospitalization, corticosteroids are generally administered IV. It has not been established whether oral administration is equally effective. We conducted a study to demonstrate that therapy with oral prednisolone was not inferior to therapy with IV prednisolone using a double-blind, double-dummy design.

Methods

Patients hospitalized for an exacerbation of COPD were randomized to receive 5 days of therapy with prednisolone, 60 mg IV or orally. Treatment failure, the primary outcome, was defined as death, admission to the ICU, readmission to the ICU because of COPD, or the intensification of pharmacologic therapy during a 90-day follow-up period.

Results

A total of 435 patients were referred for a COPD exacerbation warranting hospitalization; 107 patients were randomized to receive IV therapy, and 103 to receive oral therapy. Overall treatment failure within 90 days was similar, as follows: IV prednisolone, 61.7%; oral prednisolone, 56.3% (one-sided lower bound of the 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.8%). There were also no differences in early (ie, within 2 weeks) treatment failure (17.8% and 18.4%, respectively; one-sided lower bound of the 95% CI, -9.4%), late (ie, after 2 weeks) treatment failure (54.0% and 47.0%, respectively; one-sided lower bound of the 95% CI, -5.6%), and mean (± SD) length of hospital stay (11.9 ± 8.6 and 11.2 ± 6.7 days, respectively). Over 1 week, clinically relevant improvements were found in spirometry and health-related quality of life, without significant differences between the two treatment groups.

Conclusion

Therapy with oral prednisolone is not inferior to IV treatment in the first 90 days after starting therapy. We suggest that the oral route is preferable in the treatment of COPD exacerbations.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112yXkR9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5–7 or 10–14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

5.7 Transferring Patients From Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although SYMBICORT may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress, a severe asthma attack or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe asthma attack, or a severe COPD exacerbation.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to SYMBICORT. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with SYMBICORT. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma or COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to inhaled corticosteroids or SYMBICORT may unmask conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116gCu8E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

COPD is a common condition, mainly related to smoking. Acute exacerbations of COPD, usually related to superimposed infection, occur commonly and systemic corticosteroids are widely used in their management in combination with other treatments including antibiotics, oxygen supplementation and bronchodilators.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcomes of acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomised controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies. The last search was carried out in August 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo control. Other interventions e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics were standardised. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data measured but not reported were sought from authors of included studies. Trials were combined using Review Manager for analyses.

Main Results

Eleven studies (n = 1081) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 10 studies contributed data for analyses (n = 1051). There were significantly fewer treatment failures within thirty days in patients given corticosteroid treatment, Odds Ratio (OR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.69 and Hazard Ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97. It would have been necessary to treat 10 patients (95%CI 7 to 16) with corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure in this time period. Duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment, mean difference -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18. For FEV1 there were significant treatment benefits with mean differences at the early time point (to 72 hours), 140 ml; 95% CI 90 to 190 mL and at end of treatment (up to 15 days) 80 ml; 95% confidence interval 10 to 160. There was a significant improvement in breathlessness and blood gases at both time points. There was no significant effect on mortality but an increased likelihood of an adverse event associated with corticosteroid treatment, OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.60 to 3.40. Overall one extra adverse effect occurred for every 5 people treated (95% CI 4 to 9). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased, OR 4.95; 95% CI 2.47 to 9.91.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of an exacerbation of COPD with oral or parenteral corticosteroids significantly reduces treatment failure and the need for additional medical treatment and shortens hospital stay. It increases the rate of improvement in lung function and dyspnoea and the improvement continues during treatment, but there is a significantly increase in the risk of an adverse drug event occurring. The optimal dose and length of treatment regime needs to be better defined.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to consider switching long-acting corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting corticosteroids are no longer needed.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111mP5Fh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) be treated with systemic corticosteroids (SCs) for seven to 14 days. Intermittent SC use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could therefore reduce the risk of adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven days or fewer) and longer-duration (more than seven days) SC treatment of acute COPD exacerbations in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials (to April 2011) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to April 2011), MEDLINE (from 1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (from 1980 to October 2010) and the reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of SC (seven days or fewer or more than seven days). Other interventions, e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardised; studies in other lung diseases were excluded, unless data on participants with COPD were available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data that were pooled them using Review Manager 5. We sought missing data from authors of studies published as abstracts only.

Main Results

We identified seven studies including 288 participants; two studies were fully published and five were published as abstracts. We obtained data for two studies published as abstracts from authors; these two abstracts and the two full papers contributed to meta-analysis. No study specified COPD diagnostic criteria and only one specified exacerbation criteria. Short course treatment varied between three and seven days and longer duration 10 to 15 days, at equivalent daily doses of corticosteroids; five studies used oral prednisolone (dose 30 mg, four studies, one tapered dose) and two studies used intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Mean ages of participants ranged from 64 to 73 years. We assessed the risk of allocation and blinding bias as low for these studies.

Primary Outcomes

risk of treatment failure did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but the confidence interval (CI) was too wide to conclude equivalence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.82; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.79) (three studies, n = 146). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) did not differ significantly when measured up to seven days (mean difference (MD) -0.07 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.05) or after seven days (MD -0.02 L;95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) in four studies (n = 187). The likelihood of an adverse event (four studies, n = 192) did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but again the CI was wide (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.40).

Authors' Conclusions

We based assessment of the efficacy of short (seven days or less) compared to longer duration (more than seven days) systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute exacerbations of COPD in this review on four of the seven included studies for which data were available. Two studies were fully published and two were published as conference abstracts but trialists were able to supply data requested for the review. The finding in this review that there is no significant increase in treatment failure with shorter systemic corticosteroid treatment for seven days or less for acute exacerbations of COPD, does not give conclusive evidence to recommend change in clinical practice due to a wide confidence interval around the estimate of effect. The four studies which contributed to the meta-analysis were of relatively low quality and five of the seven studies were not published as full articles. Thus there are insufficient data to allow firm conclusions concerning the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy of acute exacerbations of COPD to be drawn.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^113xqzFL]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; p = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; p = 0.005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^117MR557]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

HPA axis recovery following exogenous corticosteroid exposure

Recovery of HPA axis function is unpredictable, and there are little data that accurately describe an expected time course for the recovery of adrenal function. Following discontinuation of exogenous corticosteroids, HPA axis suppression may resolve quickly (within hours or days) or persist, in some cases for up to 1 year or longer. Moreover, in some patients, endogenous cortisol secretion remains permanently suppressed. Although even a single dose of corticosteroid can cause HPA axis suppression (this is the basis for the overnight dexamethasone suppression test used to screen for Cushing syndrome), recovery is usually rapid with no adverse clinical sequelae.

Longer courses (e.g. 4 weeks or more) have been linked with longer recovery times, and, as a general rule, slow tapering after long‐term OCS usage is almost always necessary to support the recovery of normal HPA axis function. In this context, complete HPA axis recovery is unlikely to be observed until at least 4 weeks after cessation of corticosteroids. In a systematic review of systemic glucocorticoid therapy and AI in adults, 75% of patients had persistent AI 10 weeks after discontinuation of OCS (≥ 4 weeks of use), whereas 15% still had AI 3 years beyond discontinuation. Glucocorticoid exposure varied significantly across studies, but no obvious correlations were noted when AI cases were stratified by dosage or duration of corticosteroid use. Across all groups, 14% of patients who received a medium cumulative dosage (0.5–5.0 g) and 50% of those who received a high cumulative dosage (> 5.0 g) developed AI.

Currently, there is little consensus as to the optimum approach for safely tapering corticosteroids. The decision of when and how to taper corticosteroids, and when and how to monitor for AI, is usually at the clinician's discretion and based on signs and symptoms of disease control. The fear of underlying AI may actually hinder a clinician's confidence in tapering OCS. Ideally, tapering should be individualized, with continuous monitoring of the disease and AEs.

### Effect of a 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116sjyde]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

From October 2005 to June 2006, we prospectively included nine consecutive patients aged 40 years or older, who were admitted to the University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, for acute exacerbation of COPD with > 1 of the following symptoms: increase in dyspnea, increase in sputum, discolouration of sputum. In all patients pneumonia was excluded by chest radiograph. All patients had a standardized steroid treatment with a single injection of 40 mg of methylprednisolone (Solumedrol ®), followed by an oral 13-day regime of 40 mg prednisone (Prednisone ®). In addition, in all patients a medical treatment with inhaled long acting β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids was initiated. Patients who received systemic glucocorticoid treatment within the last 6 months and patients with known Addison's disease, adrenal metastases, Cushing's disease or pituitary adenomas were excluded from the study.

After study inclusion, all patients were examined on 5 clinical visits, namely on days 2 and 14 (the second and the last day of steroid treatment) and on days 16, 21 and 35, respectively. On every visit, the patients' functional status and a clinical questionnaire, adapted from a published clinical adrenal insufficiency score were assessed (range 0–10 for each symptom, higher scores indicate greater discomfort). A subset of patients (n = 5) was asked at different time points to self-report their functional status with the help of a visual analogue scale, ranging from 0 (feeling extremely ill) to 100 (feeling completely healthy).

The study was approved by the institutional review board (Ethikkommission beider Basel, EKBB) and written informed consent was obtained from all included patients. All data were held and analyzed by the authors.

### Role of corticosteroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115jaowF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has become increasingly commonplace over the past two decades. This practice was controversial because a number of small clinical trials provided inconclusive evidence about efficacy. Experience from recent trials indicates that systemic cortico-steroids are modestly effective in this setting. Systemic corticosteroids administered to hospitalized patients reduces the absolute treatment rate by about 10%, increases the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) by about 100 mL, and shortens the hospital stay by 1 to 2 days. Treatment should not extend longer than 2 weeks. The optimal starting dose is not known. Hyperglycemia and possibly an increased rate of secondary infections are expected complications of treatment.

5.7 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may provide control of COPD symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress, or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their healthcare practitioner for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, or a severe COPD exacerbation.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. Lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).

Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms

During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

### Appropriate use of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD: the candidates for safe withdrawal [^111RfZWM]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

At 52 weeks, ICS withdrawal in a stepwise manner was non-inferior to ICS continuation with respect to the risk for moderate-to-severe exacerbations (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.94, 1.19; Figure 3). The decline in dyspnoea (change from baseline in modified Medical Research Council score) did not differ significantly between the two groups (0.035 and −0.028 for ICS withdrawal and ICS continuation, respectively; P = 0.06). St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score increased by 1.15 units in the ICS withdrawal group and decreased by 0.07 units in the ICS continuation group from baseline to week 52 (P = 0.047). Following complete withdrawal of ICS at week 18, the mean decline in trough FEV 1 was 38 mL greater in the ICS withdrawal group than in the ICS continuation group (P < 0.001; Figure 4), with the difference remaining similar (43 ml) at week 52. There were no differences in rates of pneumonia over 52 weeks (5.5 and 5.8% in the ICS withdrawal group and ICS continuation group, respectively).

Concerns have been raised about the duration of WISDOM, and whether a 1-year period is long enough to capture exacerbations. In addition, the inclusion criteria did not limit enrolment to frequent exacerbators as defined by GOLD (⩾2 exacerbations per year or ⩾1 exacerbation with hospitalisation)and patients with previous mild events were eligible for inclusion; furthermore, many patients were not receiving ICS treatment prior to study entry, suggesting a low exacerbation history. Commenters also suggested that by excluding patients with no exacerbations the study does not address patients in whom ICS were having a preventative effect on exacerbations. It is important to note that, although patients were all receiving triple therapy in the 6-week run-in period, only 39% were receiving triple therapy prior to study entry. Therefore, treatment was stepped up for many patients in run-in ahead of ICS withdrawal, which may have affected the outcomes.

### A multi-center randomized, controlled, open-label trial evaluating the effects of eosinophil-guided corticosteroid-sparing therapy in hospitalised patients with COPD exacerbations-the CORTICO steroid reduction in COPD (CORTICO-COP) study protocol [^114wkt51]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

COPD is a heterogeneous disease and is, by that, also associated with different responses to systemic corticosteroids for acute worsening of the disease. Although systemic corticosteroids improve some clinical outcomes in AECOPD - such as LOS, FEV 1 on day 3, treatment failure and re-exacerbation rate the first month - the magnitude of benefit is small and probably restricted to subgroups of patients.

The novel aspect of this study is to investigate non-inferiority of eosinophilic guided corticosteroid-sparing therapy against the current standardized treatment of 5 days to all AECOPD patients. The study investigates whether the accumulated dose of systemic corticosteroid treatment during admissions for AECOPD can be reduced, including the presumed side effects, while simultaneously attaining the optimal treatment effect. Studies have shown that systemic corticosteroids improve outcome in exacerbations associated with either serum eosinophil counts equal to or above 2% or eosinophil counts equal to or above 0.34 10 9 cells/L. However, on the other hand, this therapy might be detrimental in those with lower eosinophil counts. A recent retrospective study has found that blood eosinophil-positive (eosinophilia ≥ 2%) severe AECOPD require a lower daily dose of systemic corticosteroids during hospitalization compared to blood eosinophil-negative (eosinophilia < 2%) AECOPD. Thereby, the study concludes that the group with blood eosinophil-positive severe AECOPD respond better to systemic corticosteroids. Moreover, the former group had a shorter LOS (geometric mean 8.9 ± 1.5 versus 11.3 ± 1.5 days, respectively; p = 0.028). The result was supported by another sub-group analysis within a large randomized clinical trial which found shorter LOS in the group with eosinophilic (blood eosinophil count ≥ 200 cells/μL and/or ≥ 2% of the total leukocyte count) associated exacerbations (mean (range) 5.0 (1–19) vs. 6.5 (1–33), p = 0.015) following treatment with systemic corticosteroids.

Blood eosinophil count appears to be a promising biomarker that can be applied in the clinic to predict treatment response in patients with AECOPD. This could be beneficial by improving clinical outcome, decrease side effects and reduce any overuse of systemic corticosteroids. The study will contribute with data to make clinical decisions on how to rationally individualize prednisolone treatment in hospitalized patients with AECOPD with the aim of optimizing treatment effect and reducing side effects.

Trial status

Patient recruitment commenced in August 2016 and is ongoing.

Research needs

Well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes should be conducted in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia. These studies should stratify patients by eosinophil levels and exacerbation risk. It is unclear whether different threshold values for blood eosinophilia would affect outcomes, and we recommend further research to define the most predictive threshold values. Finally, research is needed to determine the relevance of measuring changes in blood eosinophil counts as a dynamic parameter, and whether this may correlate with treatment response.

Question 5: In Patients with COPD Who Have a History of Severe and Frequent Exacerbations despite Otherwise Optimal Therapy, Is Maintenance Oral Steroid Therapy More Effective than and as Safe as No Maintenance Oral Steroid Therapy?

Recommendation

In patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, we advise against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking mortality, exacerbations, dyspnea, hospital admissions, bone fractures, QOL, and treatment-emergent adverse events as critical outcomes.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 1,500 citations in MEDLINE (n = 777), Embase (n = 664), and the Cochrane Library (n = 59), with deduplication resulting in n = 932 warranting abstract screening. The majority (98.8%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, resulting in the screeners identifying 11 studies for final review inclusion. Four of the 11 studies were RCTs. The total sample size for the four RCTs was 477 patients; 290 (60.8%) of these patients were in the treatment/intervention arms and 187 (39.2%) were in the control (comparator) arms. The four studies were a combination of single- and multicenter designs.

We initially analyzed both RCT and observational (nonrandomized) evidence for this question given the available evidence, while recognizing that nonrandomized evidence can be affected by selection bias and residual confounding (e.g. confounding by indication). After the analysis, we judged the RCT evidence to be the optimal evidence on which to base this recommendation. As such, for the application of GRADE methods, we used the RCT evidence in determining the certainty of evidence, and we present the RCT evidence for the respective patient-important outcomes.

### Outpatient oral prednisone after emergency treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115cHPWe]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we studied the effectiveness of prednisone in reducing the risk of relapse after outpatient exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods

We enrolled 147 patients who were being discharged from the emergency department after an exacerbation of COPD and randomly assigned them to 10 days of treatment with 40 mg of oral prednisone once daily or identical-appearing placebo. All patients received oral antibiotics for 10 days, plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary end point was relapse, defined as an unscheduled visit to a physician's office or a return to the emergency department because of worsening dyspnea, within 30 days after randomization.

Results

The overall rate of relapse at 30 days was lower in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (27 percent vs. 43 percent, P = 0.05), and the time to relapse was prolonged in those taking prednisone (P = 0.04). After 10 days of therapy, patients in the prednisone group had greater improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second than did patients in the placebo group (mean [± SD] increase from base line, 34 ± 42 percent vs. 15 ± 31 percent; P = 0.007). Patients in the prednisone group also had significant improvements in dyspnea, as measured by the transitional dyspnea index (P = 0.04) and by the dyspnea domain of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Index Questionnaire (P = 0.02), but not in health-related quality of life (P = 0.14).

Conclusions

Outpatient treatment with oral prednisone offers a small advantage over placebo in treating patients who are discharged from the emergency department with an exacerbation of COPD.

### Budesonide / formoterol as effective as prednisolone plus formoterol in acute exacerbations of COPD. A double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, parallel-group, multicentre study [^113nizrG]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

It could be argued that the lack of a placebo arm is a limitation of this study and that a similar effect of the two treatments may reflect a lack of a clinical effect of either treatment. However, as it has been clearly and indisputably shown in placebo-controlled trials that glucocorticosteroids are beneficial in patients with COPD exacerbations, it was considered unethical to include a placebo group in the present study. As this study included only patients who had a deterioration of their clinical status during the last week prior to entry, and as there was a subsequent improvement in all evaluated parameters and a decrease in initially elevated CRP levels, we believe that there was a true clinical effect in both groups.

It could also be discussed whether all treatment effects were due to the initial single dose of oral steroid plus the nebulisation of bronchodilators. However, for safety reasons we found it hard not to give this treatment as the aim was to send all patients home for further randomized treatment and not to consider hospitalisation. Secondly, this acute treatment was given to all patients and it appears unlikely that a carry-over effect would have lasted for the duration of the study.

The comparator treatment in our study was oral prednisolone plus inhaled formoterol. We considered the duration of the prednisolone course (2 weeks) to be adequate because prolongation of prednisolone therapy to eight weeks has previously been shown to add no clinical benefit.

There was an improvement in FEV 1 of 8–9% and in FEV 1 predicted normal of approximately 3% in both groups. The improvement was already statistically significant at 1 week with budesonide/formoterol and after 2 weeks for both treatments. The small improvement in FEV 1 could be regarded as clinically irrelevant, but it should be noted that the observed improvements in FEV 1 were on top of baseline values obtained after acute treatment with nebulised bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids at study entry. In addition to similar effects on lung function in both groups, several secondary and clinically more relevant efficacy variables, such as symptoms, quality of life and need for reliever medication, were found to be equally improved in the budesonide/formoterol group and the prednisolone plus formoterol group. The occurrence of two treatment failures in the budesonide/formoterol group does not alter this conclusion as these were clearly unrelated to the randomized treatment.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^113ZiV3L]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this analysis included its relatively large sample size and the multi-centre RCT design of its constituent studies. It is a strength, that all patients were randomly allocated to a corticosteroid regimen, which eliminates the risk of bias by indication, otherwise a limitation that can be hard to overcome in pooled data; in both the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials, the corticosteroid doses administered were subject to randomisation, and not based on the severity of the disease. We used the primary outcome "Days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment" due to its high sensitivity as an outcome measure, and it was used to report the results of the CORTICO-COP trial. In addition, using this outcome measure avoids lead-time bias since patients who died early would not be counted as having a short length of stay. Systemic corticosteroid therapy seems to shorten the duration of hospital stays compared to placebo. Therefore, we only included studies in which corticosteroids were provided in both trial arms. To test our hypothesis, comparison with a placebo group was unnecessary. Some limitations do, however, need to be considered. We recognize that these two trials were conducted several years apart, and different treatment durations could have explanations other than corticosteroid dose (e.g. the length of hospital admission for an AECOPD may have changed due to better community COPD services). However, the studies are similar in many aspects because there have been few major changes in AECOPD treatment during the years between the trials. Approximately half of the patients in the CORTICO-COP trial were treated with inhaled corticosteroids. We did not have access to the corresponding data for the REDUCE study population; however, because this was a randomised trial, the proportion of patients who received ICS should be similar in the two arms of this trial. Importantly, baseline values differed between the two trials, with REDUCE study patients being more ill. Therefore, it was necessary to adjust for these differences in our analyses (Additional file 1: Table 1). It is also possible that the difference in length of admission and mortality risk between the 14-day regimen and the 2–5-day regimen groups may be attributable not only to corticosteroid dose but also to responsiveness to corticosteroids, which may be influenced by history of asthma, smoking status and blood eosinophil levels. All patients with asthma were carefully excluded from both trials. There was no difference in the number of current smokers between the groups. Unfortunately, there were no blood eosinophil count data from the REDUCE study. Finally, our study may have lacked the necessary power to reliably evaluate the risk of mortality. Therefore, further studies will be necessary to confirm our risk of mortality findings.

Material and methods

Study participants

We studied individual patient data from two investigator-initiated non-inferiority trials of systemic corticosteroids for exacerbated COPD. The first study was the REDUCE trial, a multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority study (n = 314) comparing a short-term (5 days) with a conventional (14 days) systemic corticosteroid treatment. From March 2006 through February 2011, consecutive patients with AECOPD were screened for eligibility at the emergency departments of five Swiss teaching hospitals. Inclusion criteria were exacerbation of COPD as defined by the presence of at least two of the following: change in baseline dyspnoea, cough, or sputum quantity or purulence, age older than 40 years, and a smoking history of 20 pack-years or more. Exclusion criteria were a history of asthma, ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) greater than 0.70 as evaluated by bedside post-bronchodilator spirometry prior to randomisation, radiological diagnosis of pneumonia, estimated expected survival of less than 6 months due to severe comorbidity, pregnancy or lactation, prior inclusion in the trial, and inability to provide written informed consent. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before randomisation. The follow-up period was 6 months.

The other study was the CORTICO-COP trial, a nationwide multicentre prospective trial (n = 318) investigating eosinophil-guided corticosteroid treatment for AECOPD. All consecutive patients admitted to the wards of the participating sites were eligible if they were included within 24 h of admission, were aged at least 40 years old, had known airflow limitation (defined as post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio ≤ 0.70), and a specialist-verified diagnosis of COPD based on stable disease-state data. Exacerbations were defined according to the consensus definition described by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) committee: acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. Exclusion criteria included any history of asthma (self-reported or physician-diagnosed), life expectancy of less than 30 days, severe COPD exacerbation requiring invasive ventilation or admission to an ICU, allergy to systemic corticosteroids, severe mental illness that could not be controlled by medication, people detained under the act on the use of coercion in psychiatry, severe language difficulties or the inability to provide written informed consent, pregnancy or lactation, systemic fungal infections, or patients receiving more than 10 mg of maintenance systemic corticosteroids daily. Written informed consent was obtained from patients before randomisation. Patients could only participate in the trial once.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112HtCuf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be treated with systemic corticosteroid for seven to 14 days. Intermittent systemic corticosteroid use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could reduce adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven or fewer days) and conventional longer-duration (longer than seven days) systemic corticosteroid treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Methods

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to June 2014 and ongoing trials registers up to July 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of systemic corticosteroid defined as short (i.e. seven or fewer days) or longer (i.e. longer than seven days). Other interventions-bronchodilators and antibiotics-were standardised. Studies with participants requiring assisted ventilation were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants (range 28 to 296) contributed to the meta-analysis. Mean ages of study participants were 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias. In four studies we did not find a difference in risk of treatment failure between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.46)), which was equivalent to 22 fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 51 fewer to 34 more). No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more). Time to the next COPD exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 311; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37). In five studies no difference in the likelihood of an adverse event was found between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 503; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.69, or nine fewer per 1000 (95% CI 44 fewer to 51 more)). Length of hospital stay (n = 421; mean difference (MD) -0.61 days, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.28) and lung function at the end of treatment (n = 185; MD FEV1–0.04 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10) did not differ between short-duration and longer-duration treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses. We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates. The studies in this review did not include people with mild or moderate COPD; further studies comparing short-duration systemic corticosteroid versus conventional longer-duration systemic corticosteroid for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD are required.

### Dapagliflozin for prednisone-induced hyperglycaemia in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111eug5W]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

2 METHODS

We enrolled patients hospitalized for AECOPD who were treated with at least 30 mg prednisone daily in a double‐blind randomized controlled study. Patients were eligible if they 1) had either a known history of type 2 diabetes or blood glucose > 10 mmol/L at admission; 2) had a prescription for systemic prednisone ≥ 30 mg for a period of 5 to 14 days; and 3) were aged ≥ 18 years and gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: intensive care unit admission; estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73m²; recurrent genital infection; current use of any SGLT2‐inhibiting agent; volume depletion; congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class IV; cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event within 2 months before inclusion; suspected liver disease; and pregnancy or breastfeeding.

Participants were randomly assigned to dapagliflozin or placebo as add‐on to their eventual routine diabetes medication. Randomization was carried out through a web‐based application. 10 Routine glucose‐lowering medication and treatment for AECOPD were at the discretion of the treating physician.

Participants continued study treatment until the end of the prednisone course, and also when participants continued prednisone treatment after hospital discharge. The maximum study duration was 14 days. Participants were counselled on the correct use of the glucose meter (OneTouch VerioIQ; LifeScan Inc. Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania) and on signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia.

Capillary glucose testing was done before each meal and at bedtime. During hospitalization, glucose values were also measured through a blinded subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device (iPro2; Medtronic, Northridge, California). The occurrence of adverse events was evaluated during hospitalization and at end of study.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1111cf8t]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD exacerbations — systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids: Data indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten recovery time and improve lung function, and also improve oxygenation, the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended; therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration, and nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative that provides similar benefits to intravenous methylprednisolone. Observational and safety data note that even short bursts are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death and use should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations, and longer courses are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (STARR2), prednisolone therapy guided by blood eosinophil count during acute COPD exacerbation was non-inferior to standard care including systematic prednisolone treatment (30 mg per day for 14 days) and allowed a 33% reduction in the proportion of patients receiving prednisolone; the authors concluded that blood eosinophil-directed prednisolone can be used to safely reduce systemic glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.

Exacerbation treatment

Despite a greater understanding of the biology and complexity of COPD exacerbations, this has not (yet) translated into novel therapies to treat exacerbations. There has been no new intervention to treat COPD exacerbations since the widespread adoption of non-invasive ventilation to treat exacerbations with hypercapnoeic respiratory failure in the early 1990s. From the first introduction of guidelines such as GOLD in 1997, the therapy for an exacerbation is unchanged. As described below, despite being commonly used, there remain significant research knowledge gaps in determining which exacerbations do and do not require treatments with antibiotics and corticosteroids.

Systemic corticosteroids were first used in rheumatological disease during the late 1940s. Despite evidence in the late 1980s that many hospitalised patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids, it was only at the turn of the millennium that small randomised clinical trails (RCTs)first documented clinical efficacy, suggesting benefit on lung function and outcomes such as length of hospital stay. Around the same time, the first small outpatient trials of steroids at exacerbation reported, with modest benefits confirmed in a larger 2003 RCT. Later it was defined that short course (5 days) treatment was as effective as longer 14 day courses, and without the need to taper dose. With a greater emphasis on exacerbation phenotyping, more recent studies have documented the ability to safely withhold steroids in exacerbations without an eosinophil signal. However, the practicality of achieving this at point-of-care, and the optimal blood eosinophil cut-off to guide steroid therapy remain to be determined, and there are ongoing trials in the area. Given the toxicity associated with repeated courses of corticosteroids, the need for effective novel anti-inflammatory agents is also great. Disappointingly, there is no evidence of benefit with the anti-TNF agent entanerceptor roflumilast, for example.

### Should you recommend inhaled corticosteroids for this patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113anPoX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 12 million adults in the United States receive a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year, and it is the fourth leading cause of death. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow obstruction and a constellation of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but other environmental exposures also may contribute. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2020 Report aims to provide a nonbiased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COPD. To date, no conclusive evidence exists that any existing medications for COPD modify mortality. The mainstay of treatment for COPD is inhaled bronchodilators, whereas the role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear. Inhaled corticosteroids have substantial risks, including an increased risk for pneumonia. Here, 2 experts, both pulmonologists, reflect on the care of a woman with severe COPD, a 50-pack-year smoking history, frequent COPD exacerbations, and recurrent pneumonia. They consider the indications for inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, when inhaled corticosteroids should be withdrawn, and what other treatments are available.

### Withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in individuals with COPD – a systematic review and comment on trial methodology [^111KsJxB]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is no conclusive evidence from the trials included in our review that withdrawal of ICS has an effect on the frequency or number of exacerbations. Two trials showed a statistically significant decrease in the time to first exacerbation. Effects on other outcomes are inconclusive. These results are not inconsistent with a recent review in which the authors suggest that the benefits of ICS in preventing COPD exacerbations may be overstated.

Strengths and limitations

We conducted a robust systematic review. Nevertheless, we did not assess publications in languages other than English and, given the small number of studies identified, could not assess publication bias. Limited data within the trial reports meant that we were only able to conduct one meta-analysis.

### Rational use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD [^1122cqdH]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

ICS withdrawal

In an effort to reverse the trend of over-prescribing, ICS withdrawal should be considered. For example, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines recommend ICS withdrawal in patients with COPD who do not have a history of frequent exacerbations (Fig. 4). Similarly, the American Thoracic Society conditionally recommends ICS withdrawal in patients with COPD receiving triple therapy if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year. The ERS guidelines strongly recommend that ICS should not be withdrawn in patients with blood eosinophil counts ≥ 300 cells/μl. For patients with an eosinophil count < 300 cells/μl, withdrawal is conditionally recommended, taking into account patient view and benefits vs. risks. The rationale for withdrawal is clearer at an eosinophil count < 150 cells/μl, if there is no history of exacerbations and the patient is receiving no objective benefit from ICS.

Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are an important therapy for severe asthma and COPD exacerbations, and their use is recommended for patients who do not respond to initial bronchodilator therapy (Table 2). Interestingly, although corticosteroids are recommended for both diseases, their benefit in COPD exacerbations seems to be driven by a subpopulation with high T2 inflammation and elevated eosinophil counts, drawing interest in using eosinophil levels to guide steroid administration among patients who are not critically ill.–

Strong evidence supports corticosteroids for asthma and COPD exacerbations treated in the acute care setting. – Few studies have evaluated corticosteroids in adult patients who are critically ill with asthma exacerbations, particularly those necessitating mechanical ventilation. For COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation (either noninvasive ventilation [NIV] or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), one study found that corticosteroids were associated with a reduction in duration of IMV and rate of NIV failure, whereas another study found no difference in outcomes.

Among patients managed in acute care settings, the recommended regimen is prednisone 1 mg/kg/d up to 50 mg/d or equivalent for 5 to 7 days for asthma and prednisone 40 mg/d for 5 days for COPD based on studies showing shorter courses (5–7 days vs 10–14 days) resulted in similar rates of treatment failure and relapse with reduced risk of pneumonia and death.– Of the few studies conducted in patients who are critically ill, most used higher doses. However, very high doses (ie, methylprednisolone > 240 mg/d) have been associated with increased treatment failure, duration of IMV, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and adverse events, including hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy and fungal infections. Currently evidence to suggest routine use of higher corticosteroid doses is limited, and we recommend prednisone 40 to 50 mg/d for at least 5 days with consideration of higher doses in patients with life-threatening disease or those not responding to initial therapy.

The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

### Appropriate use of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD: the candidates for safe withdrawal [^1166Mvvm]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

International guidance on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management recommends the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in those patients at increased likelihood of exacerbation. In spite of this guidance, ICS are prescribed in a large number of patients who are unlikely to benefit. Given the evidence of the risks associated with ICS and the limited indications for their use, there is interest in understanding the effects of withdrawing ICS when prescribed inappropriately. In this review, we discuss the findings of large ICS withdrawal trials, with primary focus on the more recent trials using active comparators. Data from these trials indicate that ICS may be withdrawn without adverse impact on exacerbation risk and patient-reported outcomes in patients with moderate COPD and no history of frequent exacerbations. Considering the safety concerns associated with ICS use, these medications should be withdrawn in patients for whom they are not recommended, while maintaining adequate bronchodilator therapy.

### Evidence suggesting that oral corticosteroids increase mortality in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113zJBSE]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In 1964, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was defined as a disease condition characterized by not reversible airflow limitation. Since then, oral corticosteroids have often been used to control COPD. In the 1980s, administration of 7.5 − 15 mg/day of long-term oral corticosteroids (LTOC) therapy was proved to improve the prognosis of patients with chronic airflow obstruction, a disease concept that partly overlaps with bronchial asthma and COPD. A meta − analysis in 1991 revealed that oral corticosteroids improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) in stable COPD patients. Various studies have repeatedly confirmed the favorable outcomes of therapy with systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbation of COPD. Guidelines published in 1995 thus indicated that LTOC may have beneficial effects for stable COPD patients.

However, other studies indicated that LTOC is potentially harmful for stable COPD patients because muscle strength and pulmonary function deteriorate after high dose of systemic corticosteroids, and because corticosteroids cause comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Furthermore, two prospective studies with a small number of patients reported that treatment of stable COPD patients with oral corticosteroids was not efficacious: in one study, two weeks of treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily did not improve pulmonary symptoms or function; in the other, a combination of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids for two years was not more effective than inhaled corticosteroids alone. The current guidelines do not recommend LTOC for stable COPD patients. In summary, many studies do not support the use of LTOC for stable COPD patients, but no study has clearly demonstrated a relationship between LTOC and life prognosis.

It is difficult to estimate how many patients worldwide is currently taking oral corticosteroids. But data from recently published randomized trial suggest that a considerable portion of patients with COPD is still taking oral corticosteroids. According to a report of the Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium trial published in 2008, 8.4% of 5992 stable COPD cases took oral corticosteroids.

Given this background, it was not feasible to undertake a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the influence of LTOC on the life prognosis of stable COPD patients. Such a potentially harmful study is not ethically allowed. Even if feasible, evaluation of life prognosis demands the observation of a large number of patients for many years. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the life prognosis of patients treated with LTOC using the propensity score matching method.

### Five-day steroid treatment effective for acute COPD… [^112ovfu5]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is a five-day course of systemic glucocorticoids effective in the treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bottom Line A five-day course of systemic glucocorticoids is at least as effective as a 14-day course in the treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD. Synopsis Glucocorticoid therapy reduces the length of hospital stay in adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, but the optimal dose and duration of treatment are unknown. These investigators identified adults who presented to one of five emergency departments in Switzerland and who met standard clinical criteria for acute exacerbations of COPD.

Eligible patients randomly received five or 14 days of systemic glucocorticoids, beginning with 40 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on day 1, followed by 40 mg of oral prednisone daily for days 2 through 5, and then 40 mg of oral prednisone daily or matched placebo for days 6 through 14. Individuals assessing outcomes remained masked to treatment group assignment. All patients received antibiotic therapy for seven days and an inhaled, nebulized, short-acting bronchodilator as clinically indicated during hospitalization. Additional standard treatments included inhaled glucocorticoids, beta agonists, and tiotropium given throughout the study duration. Approximately 8% of patients in each treatment group were discharged directly from the emergency department; the remaining patients were hospitalized. Complete follow-up occurred for 99% of patients at six months.

Using intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in recurrent COPD exacerbations between the short-term and conventional treatment groups:

35. 9% vs.
36. 8%, respectively, met the primary end point of no exacerbations within 180 days. The median time to exacerbation was 43. 5 days in the short-term treatment group and 29 days in the conventional group. In subgroup analyses, the authors found no differences in results by differing severities of COPD. There were also no treatment group differences in the need for mechanical ventilation, quality-of-life assessments, hypertension or hyperglycemia worsening, infection rates, gastrointestinal bleeding, or all-cause mortality. Study design: Randomized controlled trial.

BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Medication adherence

All patients discharged during the treatment period (< 5 days) will be contacted in order to confirm whether the prescribed medication has been taken. This is to control for adherence with prescribed medication and to keep an accurate record of doses of medication for each patient.

Withdrawal of study

In general, no subject should be removed from the study for a protocol violation prior to confirmation by the coordinating investigator. A patient is only to be withdrawn from the study if the participant explicitly asks for withdrawal.

Size of the study population and statistical considerations

Data will be analysed using intention-to-treat (ITT) principles, including all the data available regardless of whether the intervention is completed. The aim of the ITT analysis is also to provide unbiased comparisons among groups and avoid the effects of dropout and handle patients who deviates from the protocol, e.g. intubated patients during their hospitalization.

Patients in SC will be compared to patients with eosinophil guided prednisolone sparing therapy (Intervention group). The mean LOS (μ = 8) and standard deviation (σ = 3.81 days) after a hospitalization for AECOPD is estimated based on previous studies comparing systemic corticosteroids versus placebo. A two-sided 95%-confidence interval will be computed for the difference in LOS in the intervention group minus standard care group. We will accept a null hypothesis if the LOS in the intervention group does not exceed 1.2 days of the average LOS in the SC arm. The probability that the study will detect a treatment difference is 80% at a two-sided 5% significance level. This provides a sample size of 320 subjects. Sample-size calculation has been performed by using SAS software (version 9.4).

The results are expressed in mean (days) and SD if data is normally distributed, or as median (IQR). Data will be analysed using SAS software.

Trial Steering Committee & Data Safety Monitoring Board

A Trial Steering Committee has been established. We will meet twice a year with the Committee to advice the research team. Chair: MD, PhD Jens Ulrik Stæhr Jensen

A Data Safety Monitoring Board are in place to closely and independently monitor the safety of the CORTICO-COP study.

Mortality

Two studies (n = 241) assessed mortality risk. The studies revealed no significant difference in mortality with the use of oral steroid versus no oral steroid (RR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.28–3.70; P = 0.98). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 0 fewer per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 26 fewer to 98 more).

Exacerbations

Two studies (n = 108) assessed exacerbation risk. The studies revealed no significant difference in exacerbations with the use of maintenance oral steroid versus no oral steroid (RR 1.38; 95% CI, 0.90–2.10; P = 0.14). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 190 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 50 fewer to 550 more).

Dyspnea (daily symptom score, visual analog scale)

Two studies (n = 142) assessed dyspnea. The studies revealed no statistically significant difference in dyspnea with the use of maintenance oral steroids versus no oral steroid (SMD = −0.22; 95% CI, −0.56 to 0.12; P = 0.21). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 0.22 SDs lower; 95% CI, 0.56 lower to 0.12 higher).

Hospital admissions

One study (n = 191) assessed the risk of hospital admission. The study revealed no significant difference in admissions with the use of oral steroids versus no oral steroids (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.25–1.61; P = 0.34). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 42 fewer per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 88 fewer to 71 more).

Treatment-emergent adverse events

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events. The list of adverse events included (but was not limited to) hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring a consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 174 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Summary

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low" and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation as per GRADE guidance.

Committee discussion

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy has a potential for harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients who are prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad CIs around the point estimates. In addition, these studies occurred when there was a paucity of medications available for maintenance therapy. The quality of the underlying evidence was poor, and therefore the panel believed that a recommendation in favor of maintenance oral steroid use would be problematic given the concerns surrounding patient safety. The panel also believed that well-informed patients would place a greater value on avoiding the potential harms of adverse events and less value on the uncertain benefits of decreased dyspnea and hospital admissions.

After considering these issues and the low certainty of the evidence, the panel concluded that in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations, the balance of benefits of maintenance oral steroid therapy did not outweigh the risks when compared with no steroid use. Given that the panel recommended against the intervention, issues related to feasibility, acceptability, and health equity were not discussed.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — definition is symptom- and treatment-based: increased dyspnea above day-to-day variability with or without change in sputum amount or color; moderate to severe exacerbations are those that require antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids; patients with exacerbation within the past six months would be considered to have "severe COPD".

2.3 Data extraction

We used a pre‐defined data extraction form to extract data (Table 3). This details variable type, description, classification and study details, population characteristics, exposure and outcome.

We extracted data on the first author's name, year of publication, study location, sample size, population age, sex distribution, body mass index (BMI), baseline diabetes status and details about COPD exacerbation and maintenance therapy if available. We collected data on duration of follow‐up, study design and for RCTs details about randomisation, blinding and interventions in each arm. We extracted exposure data including glucocorticoid name, dose, frequency, route of administration and duration of treatment, whether or not the reference category from that study contained only participants not exposed to glucocorticoids, and description of tapering regimen if available. Outcomes of interest were hyperglycaemia (defined as new‐onset hyperglycaemia in people with or without diabetes before starting glucocorticoid treatment) and diabetes (defined as new‐onset diabetes in people without prior diagnosis of diabetes). Outcome‐related data included the following: number and percentage of participants with new hyperglycaemia or diabetes (in each study); method of diagnosing new‐onset hyperglycaemia or diabetes; new glucose‐lowering therapy in response to hyperglycaemia; and type of glucose‐lowering treatment. If the prevalence or effect measures were not reported, we calculated prevalence based on the number of people who developed new‐onset hyperglycaemia or diabetes among those exposed to glucocorticoids, and the effect measure based on the number of people who did and did not develop new‐onset hyperglycaemia or diabetes among exposed and non‐exposed.

We tested the feasibility of the data extraction form in a randomly selected sample of articles. Six authors (MHI, AC, OB, SCSM, NK and TN) contributed to the data extraction and data from every included article were extracted by two independent authors. RG and HM resolved the discrepancies.

2.4 Risk of bias

We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB2) toolfor RCTs and Newcastle–Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS)for observational studies. NOS rates the quality of observational studies in meta‐analyses based on three domains: selection, comparability of groups and ascertainment of exposure and outcome. Two independent reviewers performed risk of bias assessment for observational studies (MHI, SCSM) and two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias in RCTs (RG, HM).

2.5 Data synthesis

A minimum of three studies were required to conduct meta‐analysis; otherwise, we performed a narrative synthesis.

Managing the presenting problem. Is it a COPD exacerbation?

A COPD exacerbation is defined as 'an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variation and leads to change in medications'. The worsening symptoms are usually increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume and increased sputum purulence. All these symptoms are present in our patient who experiences an exacerbation triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection — the most common cause of COPD exacerbations. Apart from the management of the acute exacerbation that could include antibiotics, oral steroids and increased use of short-acting bronchodilators, special attention should be given to his on-going treatment to prevent future exacerbations. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids and a course of antibiotics can shorten recovery time, improve lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1)) and arterial hypoxaemia and reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure and length of hospital stay. Short-acting inhaled β 2 -agonists with or without short-acting anti-muscarinics are usually the preferred bronchodilators for the treatment of an acute exacerbation.

Reviewing his routine treatment

One of the concerns about this patient is that his COPD is inadequately treated. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) suggests that COPD management be based on a combined assessment of symptoms, GOLD classification of airflow limitation, and exacerbation rate. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scoreor the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT)could be used to evaluate the symptoms/health status. History suggests that his breathlessness has begun to interfere with his lifestyle, but this has not been formally asssessed since the diagnosis 6 years ago. Therefore, one would like to be certain that these elements are taken into consideration in future management by involving other members of the health care team. The fact that he had two to three exacerbations per year puts the patient into GOLD category C–D (see Figure 1) despite the moderate airflow limitation. Our patient is only being treated with short-acting bronchodilators; however, this is only appropriate for patients who belong to category A. Treatment options for patients in category C or D should include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) or long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs), which will not only improve his symptoms but also help prevent future exacerbations. Used in combination with LABA or LAMA, inhaled corticosteroids also contribute to preventing exacerbations.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^1123Q6U5]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and rationale

Current guidelines recommend that systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (n = 1700) assessed the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo in treating COPD exacerbations. Most of the studies from the meta-analysis were based on hospitalised patients. The meta-analysis showed that corticosteroids shorten hospital stays by approximately 1 day and have a moderately positive effect on pulmonary function tests and 30-day re-exacerbation rate, but do not seem to have any influence on survival. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in treating AECOPD are temporary, lasting only 3–5 days. The risk of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or re-exacerbations after the first month appears to be unaltered. Corticosteroids affect the expression of various genes, especially those regulating the innate and the adaptive immune system, leading to a variety of beneficial and harmful effects such as increasing the risk of acute or chronic infections, the onset or aggravation of diabetes mellitus, and osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, minimising the unnecessary exposure of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations to systemic corticosteroids is crucial. To date, two RCTs have investigated how such unnecessary exposure can be minimised, without attenuating the documented beneficial effects. In the REDUCE trial, patients hospitalised for AECOPD were randomly assigned to either 14 days (standard) or 5 days (intervention) of treatment with 40 mg of daily prednisone. The CORTICO-COP trial randomly assigned patients to 5-day (standard) or eosinophil-guided (intervention) therapy, with the latter regimen resulting in a median of 2 days of treatment with prednisolone.

However, it remains unclear whether 14-day or 2–5-day regimens would result in shorter admission durations and changes in mortality risk. We explored this by analysing the number of days alive and out of hospital based on two trial populations with different dosing regimens.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^112oFJDx]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — early prevention of rehospitalization with systemic corticosteroids: For patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD in the outpatient or inpatient setting, we suggest that systemic corticosteroids be given orally or intravenously to prevent hospitalization for subsequent acute exacerbations of COPD in the first 30 days following the initial exacerbation (Grade 2B). Underlying values and preferences place high value on reducing recurrent exacerbations in the first 30 days, recognize risks with short-term systemic corticosteroids including hyperglycemia, weight gain, and insomnia, and state that the benefits are believed to outweigh the risks.
