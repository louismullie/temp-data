## Question

How to treat pneumonia in someone with sarcoidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat pneumonia in someone with sarcoidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification in sarcoidosis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach to distinguish infection from sarcoidosis activity. Next, I will review empiric antimicrobial therapy tailored to immunocompromise, followed by adjustments to sarcoidosis immunosuppression. After that, I need to ensure supportive care and monitoring are optimized. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, prevention, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each step is evidence-linked and internally consistent.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease with pulmonary involvement in the vast majority of patients, and many receive corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants, which increases infection risk, particularly at prednisone doses of 20 mg/day or more for more than 2–4 weeks, and with TNF inhibitors or other biologics, while fibrotic sarcoidosis and pulmonary hypertension further worsen outcomes from respiratory infections [^14b1572d] [^2d0ec644] [^3bd2814b] [^2d0ec644].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology when symptoms flare. I need to check whether the presentation reflects infection, sarcoidosis activity, or both, because fever, dyspnea, and new infiltrates can be seen in acute pulmonary exacerbations of sarcoidosis as well as in pneumonia, and misattribution delays appropriate therapy; a careful history, exam, labs including CBC, inflammatory markers, and targeted cultures, plus imaging with chest CT, are essential to separate these entities and guide management [^12446ad0] [^ec865f13].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup with sarcoidosis-specific considerations. Let me verify that we prioritize sputum cultures, blood cultures when indicated, and urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, while also considering atypical pathogens and opportunistic organisms in immunosuppressed hosts; bronchoalveolar lavage can be informative, and in sarcoidosis a CD4/CD8 ratio greater than 3.5 supports granulomatous inflammation, though this does not exclude concurrent infection and must be interpreted in clinical context [^5661b485] [^ec865f13].

> I will now examine empiric antimicrobial therapy, and I need to ensure it matches the immunocompromised host framework. For community-acquired pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient, broaden coverage to include atypical pathogens and consider Pseudomonas risk factors; if there is severe immunosuppression or high-risk features, add coverage for Pneumocystis jirovecii and consider fungal coverage, especially if there are cavitary lesions or endemic exposures; adjust based on local antibiograms and evolving cultures [^2d0ec644] [^ec865f13].

> Wait, let me verify the role of Pneumocystis prophylaxis in this setting. EULAR recommends considering PJP prophylaxis when initiating high-dose corticosteroids, particularly in combination with other immunosuppressants, balancing risks and benefits; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is first-line for prophylaxis, and if the patient is already on TMP-SMX for prophylaxis, it may also cover some bacterial pathogens, though it is not a substitute for pneumonia-directed therapy [^d5b853db].

> Now, I should review how to handle sarcoidosis immunosuppression during active infection. My first instinct is to stop immunosuppressants entirely, but wait, I should double-check the balance between infection control and sarcoidosis flare risk; in severe infection, it is reasonable to hold or reduce corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants while treating the infection, with close monitoring for sarcoidosis rebound, and then reintroduce or escalate therapy once infection is improving, aligning with guideline-based step-up approaches for pulmonary sarcoidosis once safe [^ec865f13] [^ec865f13].

> Next, I should review supportive care and monitoring. Ensure adequate oxygenation, maintain hydration, and monitor for clinical deterioration at 48–72 hours; in sarcoidosis, baseline lung function is often reduced, so even modest hypoxemia can be significant, and early noninvasive ventilation or ICU transfer may be needed if respiratory failure develops; reassess for alternative diagnoses if there is no improvement by 48–72 hours, including pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or organizing pneumonia [^c87ec50a] [^ec865f13].

> But wait, what if the pneumonia is actually a sarcoidosis flare masquerading as infection. I should confirm that we keep a high index of suspicion for acute pulmonary exacerbations of sarcoidosis, especially with new bilateral infiltrates and worsening symptoms without clear infectious sources; in such cases, corticosteroids may be indicated for the underlying disease once infection is reasonably excluded, and PET/CT can help identify active granulomatous inflammation to guide immunosuppression intensity and timing [^12446ad0] [^e4c60781].

> I need to ensure we address special scenarios. In fibrotic sarcoidosis with bronchiectasis, chronic bacterial colonization and recurrent infections are common, so longer antibiotic courses and airway clearance strategies may be necessary; in cardiac sarcoidosis, monitor closely for arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise during systemic infection; in older adults, both infection risk and steroid toxicity are higher, so dose minimization and vigilant monitoring are essential [^3bd2814b] [^02d069c4].

> Next, I should review prevention to reduce recurrence. Vaccination is critical: give pneumococcal vaccination per ACR guidance in immunosuppressed patients, ensure influenza vaccination annually, and follow COVID-19 vaccination schedules; hold live vaccines during significant immunosuppression and coordinate timing around immunosuppressive therapy when feasible [^fcb0cf10] [^12f8e74f].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway and sanity-check it. If infection is confirmed or strongly suspected, treat the pneumonia with appropriate empiric coverage for immunocompromised hosts, adjust or hold immunosuppression based on severity, and monitor closely; if infection is excluded and sarcoidosis activity is likely, manage as an exacerbation with corticosteroids and consider steroid-sparing agents for refractory disease; if both coexist, prioritize infection treatment first while cautiously modulating immunosuppression, with multidisciplinary input for complex cases [^0bbc15b2] [^8452b98e] [^ec865f13].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and long-term planning. After acute infection, reassess pulmonary function, imaging, and sarcoidosis activity to guide resumption or escalation of therapy; in patients requiring prolonged high-dose steroids or combined immunosuppression, maintain PJP prophylaxis and monitor for other opportunistic infections, and consider antifibrotic therapy in progressive fibrosing sarcoidosis where indicated, recognizing evolving evidence in this space [^d5b853db] [^3bd2814b].

Treat pneumonia in sarcoidosis by **first confirming infection** and excluding sarcoidosis flare using clinical assessment, labs, and imaging [^ec865f13]. Start **empiric antibiotics** per immunocompromised-host protocols, including coverage for typical and atypical bacteria, and add antifungal or antiparasitic therapy if risk factors or imaging suggest these pathogens [^2d0ec644]. Adjust immunosuppression: continue low-dose steroids if stable, but taper or hold high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants during severe infection; resume or escalate sarcoidosis therapy once infection improves [^0bbc15b2]. Provide supportive care with oxygen, fluids, and close monitoring; consider ICU transfer for severe disease. Use PJP prophylaxis for patients on high-dose steroids or combined immunosuppression, and vaccinate against influenza, pneumococcus, and COVID-19 to reduce future risk [^d5b853db] [^fcb0cf10].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Accurate diagnosis is essential to distinguish pneumonia from sarcoidosis flare or progression [^ec865f13]. The following steps are recommended:

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate symptoms, signs, and risk factors, including immunosuppressive therapy and exposure history [^ec865f13].

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain CBC, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and cultures (sputum, blood, urine) as indicated [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Chest radiography and high-resolution CT (HRCT) are essential to differentiate pneumonia from sarcoidosis-related infiltrates or fibrosis [^3ab14b43].

- **Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)**: Consider BAL to assess for infection, especially in immunocompromised patients or when the diagnosis is uncertain [^5661b485].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic selection should consider the patient's immunocompromised status, local epidemiology, and severity of illness:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) | - Beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate) <br/> - Plus macrolide or doxycycline for atypical coverage [^notfound] |
| Severe CAP or immunocompromised host | - Beta-lactam with antipseudomonal activity (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime) <br/> - Plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone <br/> - Consider antifungal coverage if risk factors or imaging suggest fungal infection [^notfound] |
| Suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) | - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) <br/> - Alternative: atovaquone or pentamidine [^notfound] |

---

## Management of immunosuppressive therapy

Balancing infection control with sarcoidosis management is critical:

- **Continue low-dose corticosteroids**: If the patient is on low-dose steroids (< 10 mg prednisone daily) and clinically stable, continuation is generally safe [^notfound].

- **Adjust or hold high-dose immunosuppression**: Taper or temporarily discontinue high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants (methotrexate, azathioprine, TNF inhibitors) during severe infection, resuming once infection improves [^notfound].

- **Resume sarcoidosis therapy**: Gradually resume or escalate sarcoidosis treatment after clinical improvement to prevent relapse [^notfound].

---

## Supportive care and monitoring

Supportive care is essential, particularly in patients with compromised lung function:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Provide supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygenation [^b5fda92b].

- **Fluid management**: Careful fluid administration to avoid overload, especially in patients with cardiac involvement [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and clinical response to therapy [^notfound].

- **ICU transfer**: Consider transfer to ICU for severe respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or hemodynamic instability [^notfound].

---

## Prevention of future infections

Preventive strategies are crucial given the increased infection risk in sarcoidosis:

- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccinations are recommended [^notfound].

- **PJP prophylaxis**: Consider TMP-SMX prophylaxis for patients on high-dose corticosteroids or combined immunosuppressive therapy [^d5b853db].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on infection prevention, symptom recognition, and when to seek medical attention [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Fungal infections**: Sarcoidosis patients have an increased risk of fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis, aspergillosis), particularly in endemic areas or with immunosuppressive therapy [^ec865f13].

- **Drug interactions**: Be mindful of interactions between antibiotics and immunosuppressive agents, adjusting doses as necessary [^notfound].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate care with pulmonologists, infectious disease specialists, and rheumatologists for optimal outcomes [^c7b9472b].

---

Treating pneumonia in sarcoidosis requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, balancing infection control with sarcoidosis management. Confirm infection, start appropriate empiric antibiotics, adjust immunosuppression, and provide supportive care, while implementing preventive strategies to reduce future infection risk.

### Clinical and immunologic components of sarcoidosis [^fa425ac1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that affects the lungs and the lymphatic system. It is seen by specialists in allergy, rheumatology, and pulmonary disease. Although there are no clues to etiology, an environmental basis has been implicated primarily on the basis of epidemiologic and anecdotal data. The majority of patients are very readily diagnosed and should not be confused with other pulmonary disorders. Sarcoidosis can become an issue if it occurs in the presence of other significant pulmonary disease, such as patients with asthma or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Most patients remain asymptomatic and many are diagnosed when picked up on a routine screening exam. Steroids can be used to manage some patients but caution should be exercised to choose the appropriate dose and to treat patients for a limited period of time to avoid the complications of steroids. A minority of patients do progress to significant disease, including morbidity and mortality, and further research is needed to determine more appropriate and specific therapy for such situations.

### Considerations and clinical management of infections in sarcoidosis [^ec865f13]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize data from recent reports about risks and outcomes of the infections most often reported in patients with sarcoidosis.

Recent Findings

Rates of fungal infections and other severe infections are higher in patients with sarcoidosis compared to controls. Immunosuppression further increases the risk for an infection requiring hospitalization. In contrast, outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not worse unless lung impairment or other comorbidities are present.

Summary

Tuberculosis, fungal infections, and other severe infections requiring hospital admission are, fortunately, relatively rare in patients with sarcoidosis who live in nonendemic regions. However, ongoing vigilance is required when the course of sarcoidosis is atypical or inexplicably progressive, as costs are high when these infections are missed. In contrast, COVID-19 and other respiratory viral illnesses are common, including among patients with sarcoidosis. When organ impairment is minimal, an underlying diagnosis of sarcoidosis does not appear to increase the risk of severe COVID-19, but patients may have higher risks due to comorbidities, which are important factors to address in routine sarcoidosis care. The burden from respiratory viral events, including impacts on quality of life and life functionality including work capacity, is unknown and is important to measure.

### COVID-19 infection in patients with sarcoidosis: susceptibility and clinical outcomes [^b35bf836]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with sarcoidosis may be at higher risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as over 90% of the patients have pulmonary involvement and many are treated with immunosuppressive agents. This review will summarize the current literature regarding sarcoidosis and COVID-19, with a particular focus on susceptibility, clinical outcomes, management, and approach to vaccination.

Recent Findings

Data about COVID-19 and sarcoidosis include a number of case series and reports, cohort studies, and registries. Literature is not conclusive whether patients with sarcoidosis have increased susceptibility to COVID-19. Patients with moderate to severe impaired pulmonary function may be at increased risk of adverse outcomes and mortality. Whether immunosuppressive medication increases risk of COVID-19 severity or affects vaccination response is not yet clear. Novel approaches, such as telemedicine and home monitoring programs, are promising to ensure continuity of care for patients with sarcoidosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Summary

Current evidence about the risk and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patient with sarcoidosis, is mainly extrapolated from other immune-mediated diseases. Hence, further research that focuses on the sarcoidosis population is warranted.

### Progressive pulmonary fibrosis: putting the cart before the horse [^48d3b4f5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editors:

We congratulate Raghu and colleagues for publication of the updated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) clinical practice guidelines. This update incorporates advancements in IPF understanding and the evidence-informed recommendations should benefit patient care. We applaud the committee for giving the newly conceptualized entity of progressive pulmonary fibrosis the exposure it requires to generate further research and evidence. However, we find its inclusion within this clinical practice guideline to be both premature and a missed opportunity.

Clinical practice guidelines exist to provide evidence-informed diagnostic and treatment recommendations to guide decision-making in specific clinical scenarios. While no firm rules determine which clinical conundrums warrant a guideline, most clinical practice guidelines address the diagnosis and management of specific diseases. In interstitial lung disease (ILD), these are typically clinical-radiologic–pathologic entities for which diagnostic and treatment data exist that require synthesis to inform patient care. To date, these have included IPF, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and sarcoidosis. Alternative document options include research statements, clinical statements, workshop reports, and perspective pieces. These are typically preferred when conveying equipoise, defining novel conceptual entities, or when data lack robustness for clinical recommendations that will be applied directly to patient care. In the field of ILD several other entities, including the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features, and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema have been thought to lack robust enough evidence to merit a clinical practice guideline. Rather, research or clinical statements and task forces and have been drafted by expert teams to disseminate the knowns and unknowns, propose defining classifications, and highlight future directions. This approach is consistent with the quality and robustness of data to inform each document type.

### Acute pulmonary exacerbations of sarcoidosis [^12446ad0]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of sarcoidosis are common. In particular, exacerbations of pulmonary sarcoidosis are reported in more than one-third of patients. Despite their frequent occurrence, there is little medical evidence concerning the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of sarcoidosis. In this article, we propose a definition of acute pulmonary exacerbations of sarcoidosis (APES). We review the meager medical literature concerning the risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition. Given the limited information concerning APES, we acknowledge that this article is not a definitive resource but, rather, a position paper that will encourage greater consideration of the pathogenesis, diagnostic challenges, and treatment approaches to this condition. We believe that further focus on APES will improve the quality of care of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.

### The treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis [^625b3d04]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This manuscript offers an approach to the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis based on current available information. The treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis is not mandatory as the disease may be self-limiting and therapy is often associated with significant drug side effects. The decision to treat rests predominantly on the presence of significant symptoms or functional limitation. Corticosteroids are the drug of choice. Alternative agents to corticosteroids may be useful primarily as corticosteroid sparing agents.

Introduction

The rare group of interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) comprises of over 200 subtypes that are heterogeneous regarding etiology, patterns and prognosis, but have similar pathophysiological pathways regarding inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. ILDs are classified as idiopathic, granulomatous (e.g. sarcoidosis) or associated with known causes.

Many ILDs are triggered by environmental, occupational, or medication-related exposures such as e.g. hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), and drug-induced ILD. Other ILDs are pulmonary manifestations from systemic autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatic arthritis and connective tissue disease (R-CTD). Idiopathic ILDs, also referred to as idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) — which include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as their most prominent form — represent an important subset which is associated with a substantial loss of quality of life and with a detrimental survival.

Within the various non-IPF ILDs, a proportion of patients can develop a progressive, fibrosing phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by declining lung function and high mortality. In contrast to IPF however, progressive fibrosing ILDs (PF-ILD) are often accompanied by inflammation. Around 20–30% of ILDs may develop into a PF-ILD. ILDs that are associated with this phenotype include sarcoidosis, non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), CTD-ILD, HP and unclassifiable ILD.

ILD treatments mainly focus on disease stabilization and on relief of symptoms by managing inflammation and/or suppressing fibrosis. In this regard, most evidence — particularly on pharmaceutical interventions — is based on treatment of IPF patients with two licensed anti-fibrotic treatments, whereas in non-IPF ILDs evidence-based treatment approaches and thus guidelines are mainly lacking.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^eec88614]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to make recommendations that address uncertainties that are commonly confronted by clinicians relating to the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. The target audience is pulmonary, rheumatology, or other clinicians who manage patients with suspected or confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis. This guideline was developed by an ad hoc committee of experts from the American Thoracic Society with guidance from experienced methodologists to objectively identify and summarize the best available evidence. The quality of the evidence was poor in most cases, reflecting the need for additional high-quality research to guide clinical practice. As such, clinicians, patients, payers, and other stakeholders should not consider these recommendations as mandates. Moreover, no guideline or recommendation can consider all potential clinical circumstances. Thus, clinicians are encouraged to apply the recommendations within the clinical context of each individual patient, including the patient's values and preferences, and on the basis of regional factors, such as the prevalence of alternative diagnoses or consideration of alternative diagnostic approaches when the preferred diagnostic modality is unavailable.

### Diagnosis and management of sarcoidosis [^0d4dee28]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in any organ, most commonly the lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis should be suspected in any young or middle-aged adult presenting with unexplained cough, shortness of breath, or constitutional symptoms, especially among blacks or Scandinavians. Diagnosis relies on three criteria: (1) a compatible clinical and radiologic presentation, (2) pathologic evidence of noncaseating granulomas, and (3) exclusion of other diseases with similar findings, such as infections or malignancy. An early and accurate diagnosis of sarcoidosis remains challenging, because initial presentations may vary, many patients are asymptomatic, and there is no single reliable diagnostic test. Prognosis is variable and depends on epidemiologic factors, mode of onset, initial clinical course, and specific organ involvement. The optimal treatment for sarcoidosis remains unclear, but corticosteroid therapy has been the mainstay of therapy for those with significantly symptomatic or progressive pulmonary disease or serious extrapulmonary disease. Refractory or complex cases may require immunosuppressive therapy. Despite aggressive treatment, some patients may develop life-threatening pulmonary, cardiac, or neurologic complications from severe, progressive disease. End-stage disease may ultimately require lung or heart transplantation for eligible patients.

### Is there a uniform approach to the management of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) in the UK? A national benchmarking exercise [^7c530918]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Benchmarking is the comparison of a performance or process to the work or results of others. It involves learning, sharing information and adopting best practices to bring about improvements in performance. It was initially an exercise carried out in industry, but it is now widely used within healthcare. The process is so well established that the UK Government supports a public sector benchmarking service. Benchmarking programmes in medical care have been set up to improve and maintain high standards of care for patients and to regulate and maintain training standards for healthcare professionals.

Diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) comprises over 200 conditions affecting the lung parenchyma. They are said to account for 15% of respiratory practice, but their clinical impact is probably underestimated. The American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Thoracic Society (ERS) revision of the classification of DPLD standardised the classification of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP), distinguishing between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and IIPs other than IPF. Precise diagnosis in DPLD is important for prognosis and treatment. Establishing the diagnosis can be difficult and management options in many of these conditions are limited, often involving the use of immunosuppressants. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) published its first guidelines on DPLD in 1999. These addressed diagnosis and assessment of DPLD, and focused treatment recommendations on two major DPLDs, sarcoidosis and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA). The ATS published its guidelines on sarcoidosis in 1999 in conjunction in the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the World Association of Sarcoidosis and Granulomatous Disorders (WASOG), and for IPF in 2000.

We carried out a benchmarking exercise to determine how pulmonologists in the United Kingdom (UK) manage common scenarios in DPLD. We wanted to see whether there was a consensus on the management of these cases and to review the use and availability of investigative resources. We compared the management chosen for three common scenarios to the recommendations in the ATS and BTS guidelines. To our knowledge, this is the first national benchmarking exercise for the management of DPLD in the UK.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^14b1572d]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology which triggers a range of proinflammatory and regulatory immune responses. The accumulation of macrophages which aggregate into granulomas at sites of disease is central to the pathophysiology.T helper 1 lymphocytes are amplified and are thought to augment macrophage recruitment and function. Key chemokines and cytokines which mediate these cellular events include IFNg (interferon gamma), tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin 2, CXCL9 (chemokine ligand 9) and CXCL10 (chemokine ligand 10). Immunosuppressive therapies, when titrated to patient response, often induce clinical remission. However, disease recurrence is common following discontinuation of treatment, and many patients with disabling, progressive or potentially dangerous disease require long-term immunosuppression.

Sarcoidosis can affect the lungs, heart, central nervous system, eyes, skin and other organs. While multisystem disease is common, the lungs are the most frequently affected organ and nearly all patients have some degree of pulmonary involvement. Sarcoidosis-interstitial lung disease (sarcoid-ILD) encompasses inflammation, fibrosis or a mixture of these processes in the lung interstitium. The development of fibrotic sarcoid-ILD is a risk for lung function decline, respiratory failure and death, and thus is a key determinant of prognosis in sarcoidosis. While sarcoid-ILD accounts for an estimated 20% of ILD burden, it is under-represented in ILD research.

The demographic features of patients with sarcoidosis differ from those of other ILDs. Most patients with sarcoidosis are diagnosed as a young or middle-aged adult, and in the USA the incidence of sarcoidosis is up to three times higher for black patients compared with white patients. In addition, women are more likely than men to develop the disease, and black women have the highest rate of sarcoidosis among sociodemographic groups.

Regardless of organ phenotype and demographic features, quality of life impairment is common in sarcoidosis. In a large survey, quality of life was the most important disease metric identified by patients. In addition to psychosocial strain, sarcoidosis is associated with work absenteeism, which is a risk for financial strain. For these and other reasons, including reduced lung reserve and the use of immunosuppression, patients with sarcoidosis may be more vulnerable than healthy people to the multifaceted impacts of respiratory infections (figure 1).

### Comparative outcomes and side effects of immunosuppressants and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in sarcoidosis: a real-world data analysis [^807e5ef3]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a complex systemic granulomatous disease with varying clinical manifestations, and immunosuppressive agents and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have been used in severe and refractory cases. However, the comparison of the serious side effects of these treatments remains poorly understood.

Research Question

In sarcoidosis, what is the one-year risk of serious side effects among second-line agents (immunosuppressants) and TNF inhibitors?

Study Design and Methods

A retrospective analysis of data from the TriNetX Research Network, which includes de-identified medical records of sarcoidosis patients treated with specific immunosuppressive agents or TNF inhibitors between 2012 and 2023 across 82 healthcare organizations. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to mitigate confounding effects.

Results

A total of 13,814 patients receiving immunosuppressive agents were included. We found that patients who received mycophenolate mofetil had higher risks for inpatient hospitalization (HR 2.74, 95% CI: 2.11–3.56), critical care (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.91–2.94), mechanical ventilation (HR 4.04, 95% CI 2.63–6.21), mortality (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.70–2.75), and infections compared with those underwent methotrexate. Azathioprine use has increased risks of mortality, hematologic toxicity, and infections compared to methotrexate. Among the 3,964 patients with sarcoidosis receiving TNF inhibitors, we found similar rare of serious side effects between infliximab and adalimumab, although a slightly higher risk of anemia (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.22–2.67), thrombocytopenia (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.75–4.07) and pneumonia (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02–2.10), but lower risk of skin soft tissue infection (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17–0.89) in infliximab group.

Interpretation

We used large real-world data with the PSM approach to demonstrate the heightened risk of infection and bone marrow suppression with mycophenolate mofetil compared with the other immunosuppressants, and a similar rate of serious side effects between infliximab and adalimumab.

### What is the future of methotrexate in sarcoidosis? A study and review [^2299dcc4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The decision for treating patients with chronic systemic sarcoidosis is often difficult and controversial. Methotrexate (MTX) has been used to treat patients with chronic forms of the disease for years, although prospective, randomized studies assessing the efficacy and toxicity of this agent are lacking. This is the follow-up study of 91 patients with the chronic form of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis who were treated with MTX. All patients experienced treatment with corticosteroids before they were administered MTX. Most of the patients treated with MTX showed improvement on chest radiographs, lung function tests, and extrapulmonary signs of the disease 6 months after the treatment began. No side effects that would cause the patients to discontinue the treatment were observed.

### ERS clinical practice guidelines on treatment of sarcoidosis [^0bbc15b2]. The European Respiratory Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for sarcoidosis, more specifically with respect to management of pulmonary sarcoidosis, systemic corticosteroids, ERS 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate corticosteroids to improve and/or preserve FVC and QoL in untreated patients with major involvement from pulmonary sarcoidosis at higher risk of future mortality or permanent disability.

### Hit-hard and early versus step-up treatment in severe sarcoidosis [^56997f8f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

With the recent publication of the ERS and BTS guidelines on sarcoidosis management the gap of knowledge and paucity of rigorous evidence in this field becomes strikingly clear. However, these guidelines do provide consistency of direction for physicians treating sarcoidosis patients. A step-up approach with initial corticosteroid monotherapy is favored by the ERS/BTS guideline, although some other reviews or expert opinions leave room for initiation of upfront second-line treatment (e.g. methotrexate) together with steroids in severely endangered or 'High risk' sarcoidosis patients.

Patient selection will always pose a significant challenge, because not all patients need systemic treatment and all available treatment options have potential side effects. The optimal treatment strategy for these severe, sometimes even life threatening, sarcoidosis cases is unknown. These cases include severe pulmonary, cardiac and neurosarcoidosis. Potentially, extrapolating literature from other disciplines, a 'hit-hard and early' approach could benefit severe life or organ threatening sarcoidosis for which a prolonged treatment regimen is anticipated. Evidence from ongoing and future trials in sarcoidosis treatment are needed.

Sarcoidosis-associated cough — effects of inhaled corticosteroids: in sarcoidosis, three trials of inhaled corticosteroids did not demonstrate a significant reduction in cough, although trials reported trends toward improvement in cough. Further trials are needed to clarify the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, ideally in carefully selected patients with active, airway-centered disease and a clinically significant cough.

### Approach to tapering antisarcoidosis therapy [^24b851a0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease, which commonly affects the lung. The natural course of the disease and prognosis are variable from asymptomatic, spontaneous remission to progressive disease, which requires treatment. Once treatment is initiated, tapering therapy can be problematic.

Recent Findings

Corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy, but optimal regimen and duration of treatment is not well established. Treatment may differ based on severity of disease, extrapulmonary involvement, physician and patient preferences. We reviewed currently recommended regimens, particularly, in pulmonary sarcoidosis and the use of alternative treatments as corticosteroid-sparing agents.

Summary

Corticosteroid use is quite effective as initial therapy but is associated with significant side effects. An approach to tapering sarcoidosis therapy is not standardized, given the lack of evidence-based data. This review provides guidance based on the current literature.

### When sarcoidosis mimics immunodeficiency [^2e92ab04]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. A 28-year-old previously healthy woman presented with multifocal pneumonia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy which was thought to be caused by actinomyces infection. Despite antibiotics, she developed cavitary lung lesions and had worsening lymphadenopathy prompting evaluation for alternative aetiologies like malignancy, autoimmune or immunodeficiency disorders. Further workup also revealed low CD4, CD8 cell counts, elevated soluble interleukin-2 levels. Over the due course of time, she developed granulomatous pan-uveitis, classical skin lesions leading to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Our case highlights the rare manifestations of sarcoidosis which can mimic immunodeficiency disorders especially when these patients develop secondary infections. Our goal is to raise awareness among clinicians about these atypical presentations of sarcoidosis which can lead to substantial delay in diagnosis thus leading to progression of the disease in the absence of appropriate treatment.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^82fcd1ed]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Methods and analysis

The SARCOVID Study is an observational, prospective study (figure 3). Patients with sarcoidosis meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled at a diversity of study sites across the USA (tables 1 and 2). Select sites will also enrol patients with non-sarcoidosis ILD. Infection outcomes will be measured against the phenotypes of pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac involvement, and against other clinical features including treatment status. Non-infected patients with sarcoidosis — matched to age, race and sex — will serve as the primary comparison group. Patients with non-sarcoidosis ILD will also serve as a comparator group.

Figure 3
Study design and timeline. Following the initial entry of demographic and detailed clinical details, infectious event data are collected and entered quarterly over 3 years. IRB, institutional review board.

Table 1
Collaborating sites by geographical location in the USA

Table 2
Inclusion and exclusion criteria along with case versus control groups

Recurrent assessments for infection events or changes in sarcoidosis status will be collected quarterly over 3 years. Each site has obtained institutional review board approval locally, with most sites initiating data collection near the time of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (winter 2020). Adult patients with an established diagnosis of sarcoidosis or another ILD and receiving clinical care at a recruiting site will be screened for study participation. At sites requiring informed consent, any patient meeting inclusion criteria and who provides consent will be enrolled.

To achieve the aims of the study, the recruitment goal of 2000 patients with sarcoidosis was established. This goal was based on an assumed rate of hospitalisation at 15% for patients with sarcoidosis who develop a viral infection. The recruitment goal of 2000 patients provides 80% power to detect a 20% absolute change in one of our primary outcomes, hospitalisation, with a two-sided α level of 0.05.

Patient and public involvement

Patients were not explicitly involved in the study design planning, which was done in an urgent fashion at the onset of the pandemic. However, our study design was heavily informed by patient survey data, which indicate that functionality and quality of life are critically important aspects of sarcoidosis management. Our data will be published in a timely manner at the conclusion of the 3-year follow-up period and will be made available upon request.

Regarding medical management for sarcoidosis, more specifically with respect to management of pulmonary sarcoidosis, asymptomatic disease, BTS/ITS/TSANZ 2008 guidelines recommend to do not initiate treatment for pulmonary sarcoidosis in patients with asymptomatic stage I disease
or asymptomatic stage II or III disease with mildly abnormal lung function and stable disease, because of the high rates of spontaneous remission.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis… [^8452b98e]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Among patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, the rate of spontaneous remission without serious sequelae ranges from 10% to 82%. However, lung disease progression occurs in more than 10% of patients and can result in fibrocystic architectural distortion of the lung, which is associated with a mortality rate of 12% to 18% within 5 years. Patients with sarcoidosis and precapillary pulmonary hypertension should be treated with therapies such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and prostacyclin analogues. Although optimal doses of oral glucocorticoids for pulmonary sarcoidosis are unknown, oral prednisone typically starting at a dose of 20 mg/d to 40 mg/d for 2 to 6 weeks is recommended for patients who are symptomatic and have parenchymal infiltrates and abnormal pulmonary function test results. Oral glucocorticoids can be tapered over 6 to 18 months if symptoms, pulmonary function test results, and radiographs improve.

Prolonged use of oral glucocorticoids may be required to control symptoms and stabilize disease. Patients without adequate improvement while receiving a dose of prednisone of 10 mg/d or greater or those with adverse effects due to glucocorticoids may be prescribed immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or an anti–tumor necrosis factor medication, either alone or with glucocorticoids combined with appropriate microbial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci and herpes zoster. Effective treatments are not available for advanced fibrocystic pulmonary disease. Conclusions and Relevance Sarcoidosis has a mortality rate of approximately 7% within a 5-year follow-up period. More than 10% of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis develop progressive disease and more than 60% of deaths are due to advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis.

Oral glucocorticoids with or without another immunosuppressive agent are the first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with abnormal pulmonary function test results and lung infiltrates. Patients with sarcoidosis and precapillary pulmonary hypertension should be treated with therapies such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and prostacyclin analogues.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^20cbc7a5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Study objectives

The primary aim of this study is to determine the association of clinical features and respiratory infection outcomes in sarcoidosis. To assess whether patients with fibrotic pulmonary or cardiac sarcoidosis have higher risk of severe infection, we will use multivariate analyses to measure the association of these phenotypes with binary measures of infection severity in SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections (diagnosed by viral gene or antigen testing or clinical features), with severe infection defined by the need for new or augmented supplemental oxygen support, hospitalisation or death. For all patients with sarcoidosis, we will measure symptom duration, and compare pre-infection and post-infection psychosocial function including quality of life measures through the validated King's Sarcoidosis Questionnaire. Our secondary aim is to measure the impact of respiratory infections on the trajectory of sarcoidosis through serial pulmonary function and imaging measures, and via a quarterly assessment of infection-mediated changes in sarcoidosis treatment.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^2a7a1dea]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

While COVID-19 is a uniquely disruptive pandemic, a range of other respiratory pathogens continue to circulate. Nearly all of these pathogens can cause a severe illness, and even mild infection courses can trigger exacerbation of chronic lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. In addition to measuring outcomes of COVID-19, a key objective of the SARCoidosis Outcomes in all respiratory Viral Infectious Diseases (SARCOVID) Study is to assess the burden and impact of a broad range of respiratory infections in sarcoidosis, with the goal that elucidation of the short-term and long-term impacts of infection will be meaningful for patients and will inform clinical management.

### Therapeutic options for sarcoidosis: new and old [^00a0bff4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with sarcoidosis remains an important part of management. The role of corticosteroids has been questioned by some, while others have reported its value even in asymptomatic patients with interstitial lung disease. Cytotoxic agents have become standard therapy for some forms of chronic disease. Newer agents that modulate the immune response have been studied. A key cytokine in chronic sarcoidosis appears to be tumor necrosis factor. Drugs that inhibit its release or block its effect have been reported as effective for sarcoidosis.

### Update on sarcoidosis guidelines [^380c7d2d]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current review summarizes recent guidance in the diagnosis and management of sarcoidosis. Until recently, the main guidelines were the 1999 International Statement on Sarcoidosis. However, in 2020 two new guidelines were published by the American and British Thoracic Societies. They have a number of key updates and this review aims to summarize these.

Recent Findings

The key findings from 2020 revolve around several themes. First, the need for a histological diagnosis should be supported by a multidisciplinary team approach. When a histological biopsy is needed of the lungs, thought is given to the approach taken for this and to whether an endobronchial ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound or transbronchial biopsy is needed. Second, information regarding supporting tests including blood biomarkers, lung function and imaging. Third, a section specific to cardiac sarcoidosis. Finally, a summary of guidance for treating sarcoidosis including the need to treat fatigue.

Summary

The recent guidance suggests that a histological biopsy is only needed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or in patients with typical long standing features on imaging. The guidelines also provide a clear pathway on the type of lung biopsy needed depending on the extent of mediastinal or parenchymal involvement. Support is given to steroid regimens and indication for second-line immunosuppression.

### Design of the PF-ILD trial: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial of nintedanib in patients with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease [^3e5a95fb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Patient population

Patients aged ≥ 18 years will be eligible for the trial if they have a physician-diagnosed fibrosing ILD, such as connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated ILD, chronic fibrosing hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (iNSIP), unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), environmental/occupational lung disease or sarcoidosis, present with features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of > 10% extent on HRCT and meet the protocol criteria for progression within 24 months of screening, as assessed by the investigator. The criteria for evidence of progression are worsening lung function (clinically significant, ≥ 10% relative decline in forced vital capacity (FVC)) or worsening lung function (≥ 5– < 10% relative decline in FVC) together with worsening respiratory symptoms and/or evidence of increasing fibrosis on chest imaging, despite treatment with unapproved medications used in clinical practice to treat ILD. A full list of the criteria for progression is provided in online supplementary table S1.

### Management of advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis [^3bd2814b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The term "advanced sarcoidosis" is used for forms of sarcoidosis with a significant risk of loss of organ function or death. Advanced sarcoidosis often involves the lung and is described as "advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis" (APS), which includes advanced pulmonary fibrosis, associated complications such as bronchiectasis and infections, and pulmonary hypertension. Although APS affects a small proportion of patients with sarcoidosis, it is the leading cause of poor outcomes, including death. Here we review the major patterns of APS with a focus on the current management as well as potential approaches for improved outcomes for this most serious sarcoidosis phenotype.

### Interstitial lung disease guideline: the British thoracic society in collaboration with the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand and the Irish Thoracic Society [^1067555f]. Thorax (2008). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for sarcoidosis, more specifically with respect to management of pulmonary sarcoidosis, systemic corticosteroids, BTS/ITS/TSANZ 2008 guidelines recommend to initiate oral corticosteroids as first-line therapy in patients with progressive disease determined by radiology or on lung function test, significant symptoms, or extrapulmonary disease requiring treatment.

### Corticosteroid treatment in sarcoidosis [^06c5605d]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

At present there is no curative treatment for sarcoidosis. Immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory drugs can, however, be used for controlling the disease. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy. They function by suppressing the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are involved in cell-mediated immune responses and granuloma formation. Only in a select group of patients is it justifiable to use these drugs, after careful evaluation of the pros and cons. Importantly, disease severity, e.g. threatened organ functions, and not disease activity itself should be the deciding factor in this process. In the case of parenchymal involvement, there is substantial evidence that corticosteroids can improve respiratory symptoms and chest radiography and lung function parameters over 6–24 months. Other generally acknowledged (empirical) criteria for systemic treatment include neurological, cardiac and sight-threatening ocular involvement and hypercalcaemia. Remarkably, despite > 50 yrs of use, there is no proof of long-term (survival) benefit from corticosteroid treatment. In addition, there are still no data regarding the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. One of the weightiest questions remaining is whether or not these drugs can prevent scarring in patients with a fibrogenic phenotype. As new agents, including infliximab and thalidomide, enter the stage and new diagnostic tools are now available, there is clearly a momentum to design multicentric randomised controlled trials with long enough follow-up (> 5 yrs) to answer this pivotal question.

### Assessment and management of occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^cb70d5cc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis (OHP) remain complex and challenging in the absence of diagnostic gold standards or clinical guidelines. This review provides an update of the recent literature regarding the different presentations of OHP and the diagnostic yield and value of the diagnostic tests currently available, which include occupational and medical history, laboratory tests (serum-specific immunoglobulins, environmental sampling), imaging, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, transbronchial cryobiopsy, surgical lung biopsy, and specific inhalation challenges. These tools provide a precise differential diagnosis within the framework of interstitial lung diseases. However, among the chronic fibrotic forms, distinguishing OHP from sarcoidosis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remains a diagnostic challenge. Avoidance of exposure is pivotal for OHP management, whereas corticosteroids are fundamental in the pharmacological approach to this disease. In addition, studies describing the long-term benefits of immunosuppressive and antifibrotic agents have increased the use of these treatments in OHP.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^2060b586]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of experts in sarcoidosis was composed to construct clinically important questions related to diagnostic testing for sarcoidosis. Systematic reviews were then performed to inform recommendations that answered each question. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to formulate and grade the strength of the recommendations. The guideline included three patients who participated on the guideline panel and provided perspective on patient values and preferences. A detailed description of the methods, including the implications of the strengths of the recommendation (i.e. strong vs. conditional) and the meaning of best practice statements, are described in the online supplement. The guideline underwent anonymous peer review by four content experts and one methodologist. After multiple cycles of review and revision, the guideline was reviewed and approved by a multidisciplinary board of directors. The guideline will be reviewed by the American Thoracic Society 3 years after publication, and it will be determined if updating is necessary.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in BRIC countries: the cases of Brazil, russia, India, and China [^2ffaf53c]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Two of the studies mentioned above, including 3,568 patients with ILD, found that idiopathic interstitial pneumonias were seen in 53% of patients (1,891 cases), IPF in 25.1% (894 cases), connective tissue disease-associated ILD in 14% (499 cases), sarcoidosis in 4% (144 cases), and extrinsic allergic alveolitis in 3.8% (100 cases). A retrospective study by Zhang et al. analyzed 418 patients with ILD diagnosed by lung biopsy from 1999 to 2009 in China and showed that idiopathic interstitial pneumonias were found in 41.9% of patients. Of these, 35.4% (62 cases) were found to be IPF, followed by unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia (21.7%; 38 cases), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (19.4%; 34 cases), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.7%; 24 cases).

The various hospital categories exhibit substantial differences in the diagnosis of IPF. At most community- or county-level hospitals, IPF is often missed or misdiagnosed. Many IPF patients are often first mistakenly diagnosed with pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, due to insufficient awareness of ILD, physicians sometimes misdiagnose alveolar protein deposition disease, certain secondary ILDs, and certain infectious pneumonias as idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis and treat these diseases with corticosteroids with/without immunosuppressive therapy. However, in hospitals that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of ILD, the procedures for IPF diagnosis and treatment are highly standardized. For patients with pathological data, the diagnostic guideline is to establish a final diagnosis based on discussion among clinical experts, radiologists, and pathologists who are specialized in ILD. In hospitals that do not have the capacity for C-reactive protein diagnosis, physicians sometimes transfer the related data to teaching hospitals with the appropriate capabilities for consultation.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a08c03cd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Committee members concur that there is a pressing need for higher-quality evidence to guide clinical practice relating to the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis, and to better define the natural history of disease progression in each organ system. A large body of related data has been published, but very few of these studies were properly designed to guide clinical practice. Nonetheless, this document establishes the current standards of care based on a rigorous and unbiased analysis of the available data, and provides direction for future investigations to further refine clinical practice to improve diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. Figure 3 provides an algorithm that incorporates the recommendations of these guidelines within the scope of clinical practice for the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis.

Systemic corticosteroids and biologics — pneumonia risk is dose dependent in steroid-treated patients, with increased risk generally occurring when exposed to at least 20 mg equivalent of prednisone daily for more than 2–4 weeks; lower doses (i.e., 10 mg/d) taken for prolonged periods can also confer an increased risk, and the infectious spectrum includes Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, and typical causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Blockade of TNFα increases susceptibility to tuberculosis, IL-6 inhibitors and JAK kinase inhibitors have been associated with higher TB risk, other cytokine blockers (anti–IL-12/IL-23, anti–IL-23, anti–IL-17) carry TB warnings but an elevated TB risk has not been demonstrated to date, and additional risk accrues with diabetes, cigarette smoking, advanced age, and concomitant immunosuppressants.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^0895b643]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Figure 1
Sarcoidosis-related vulnerabilities which predispose to a more severe respiratory infectious disease course. Due to a variety of potential sarcoidosis-related impairments, infections with upper respiratory tract pathogens may cause higher burden or lead to a more severe course in patients with sarcoidosis.

SARS-CoV-2 has altered our understanding of the potential significance of common respiratory infections. Early in the pandemic, it became evident that patients with underlying cardiacor lung diseasewere at increased risk of severe COVID-19. Patients with ILD, for example, had higher hospital admission and mortality rates compared with patients without ILD, with ILD severity serving as an additional modifying risk factor for COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes for patients with sarcoid-ILD are less clear, however, as few patients with sarcoidosis have been included in studies on ILD and COVID-19.

In a retrospective review, the risk of hospitalisation or death from COVID-19 was not increased for patients with sarcoidosis compared with controls matched for age and comorbidities. While several other sarcoidosis-specific reports have been published, the findings are not widely applicable due to limitations such as small or non-diverse cohorts with non-severe disease, or selection bias in the other direction of limiting enrolment to hospitalised patients. Data from self-reported questionnaires given to patients with sarcoidosis offer some insight into the course of infection among patients fit enough to complete a survey, but the lack of a control group and an inability to verify data make extrapolation of outcomes to the general population with sarcoidosis difficult. A comprehensive assessment of outcomes is needed to measure impacts beyond the binary outcome of severe versus non-severe disease, and to evaluate the associated risk of sarcoidosis phenotype on outcomes. In addition to fibrotic sarcoid-ILD, the impact of underlying cardiac sarcoidosis on COVID-19 has not been measured, in spite of the identification of cardiac disease as a risk factor for poor outcomes in viral respiratory infections.

### Patient characteristics and pharmacologic treatment patterns in antifibrotic-treated patients with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases: real-world results from a claims database [^b924c644]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a collective term that encompasses a large heterogenous group of over 200, relatively common to very rare, parenchymal pulmonary disorders. It is characterised by varying degrees of fibrosis, inflammation, or both, in the lung parenchyma. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most frequent and serious form of fibrosing ILD, with a median survival period of 3–5 years. A proportion of patients with ILDs other than IPF develop a progressive phenotype, termed progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF), previously called progressive fibrosing-ILD (PF-ILD). PPF occurs frequently as a result of autoimmune disease and includes rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD), systemic sclerosis-associated-ILD (SSc-ILD), polymyositis/dermatomyositis-associated ILD (PM/DM-ILD), Sjögren's disease-associated ILD, systemic lupus erythematosus-associated ILD (SLE-ILD), and mixed connective tissue disease-associated ILD (MCTD-ILD), however, there are also non–autoimmune-related ILDs such as chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), exposure-related ILD (excluding HP), idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (iNSIP), unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), and sarcoidosis.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^7b389013]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

The SARCOVID Study will provide unique insight into the full impact of respiratory infections in sarcoidosis, including impacts on quality of life and on the underlying disease course of sarcoidosis. While prior work has established an association of underlying lung impairment with poor outcomes from respiratory infections including COVID-19, the SARCOVID Study uniquely explores the broader dynamics of sarcoidosis clinical heterogeneity, including pulmonary and cardiac involvement, on outcomes from all respiratory infections. Data from this large, diverse study cohort will improve the understanding of the complex relationship between epidemiological factors, distinct clinical phenotypes of sarcoidosis and outcomes of respiratory illnesses. Identifying potentially modifiable risk factors is directly relevant to clinical management, and the results of this study hold the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of a vulnerable patient population while addressing health disparities for a historically understudied disease. This collaborative study also answers the call to match sarcoidosis research efforts to clinical centres which care for a high burden of sarcoidosis and serve a diverse range of patients, and to leverage large data from multisite research to better elucidate the full burden of sarcoidosis.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^346be906]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Histopathology

Given that the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis are often nonspecific, histological evaluation of tissue granulomas is often required to establish the diagnosis. Histological features that are typical of a sarcoidosis granuloma include the presence of well-formed, concentrically arranged layers of immune cells, most prominent being the central core of macrophage aggregates and multinucleated giant cells. An outer layer of loosely organized lymphocytes, mostly T cells, is often observed with a few interposed dendritic cells. In some cases, the granulomas are surrounded by isolated collections of B lymphocytes. Sarcoidosis granulomas are most often nonnecrotic; however, variants of sarcoidosis, particularly the nodular pulmonary sarcoidosis phenotype, can present with a mixture of necrotic and nonnecrotic granulomas.

The differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases is broad, as noted in the next section. Table 2 and Figure 1 provide histopathological features that are useful for discriminating sarcoidosis from other causes, although histopathologic features alone cannot distinguish sarcoidosis from other granulomatous diseases. Certain granulomatous diseases may have similar histological features, such as berylliosis (chronic beryllium disease).

Table 2.
Key Pathological Features of Sarcoidosis

(A) Typical sarcoidosis histology with well-formed granulomas comprised of macrophage aggregates (G) and featuring multinucleated giant cells (white arrows, inset), with minimal surrounding lymphocytic inflammation (L). (B) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis featuring smaller granulomas (G) with more extensive surrounding lymphocytic alveolitis (L). (C) A large acellular necrotizing granuloma (NG) caused by pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum infection.

Exclusion of alternative causes

To ensure diagnostic accuracy of sarcoidosis, the differential diagnosis must be considered and alternative diagnoses reliably excluded during the initial diagnostic evaluation or in presumed established sarcoidosis cases with atypical clinical features, such as those refractory to immune suppression treatment. Although tissue histopathology may reveal an alternative diagnosis (Figure 1), granulomas found in patients with sarcoidosis have no unique histologic features to differentiate them from all other granulomatous diseases. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis, therefore, requires a complete history and physical examination and, when indicated, additional testing to exclude other disorders, especially those that also produce granulomas. The differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis is typically categorized into granulomatous disorders of infectious and noninfectious causes (Table 3 provides representative examples of each). An alternative schema classifies these diagnoses according to the affected organ system(s) (Table 4).

### COVID-19 in patient with sarcoidosis receiving long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment, France, 2020 [^ad2a53f5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

At admission, the patient's body temperature was 36.6°C, heart rate was 82 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, blood pressure 115/72 mm Hg, and arterial oxygen saturation 96% while breathing room air. Lung auscultation revealed diffuse, fine crackles. Trough hydroxycholoroquine plasma concentration was 0.9 μg/mL (therapeutic range for autoimmune diseases 0.3–1.0 μg/mL). Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan with pulmonary angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities, superimposed on the baseline sarcoidosis lesions (Figure). Electrocardiogram and serum troponin level were unremarkable. He was treated with prophylactic enoxaparin (60 mg 1×/d) and was discharged on day 18. Because he was afebrile and his condition improved shortly after admission, no additional workup for secondary pneumonia was performed, and he received no antibacterial treatment. All symptoms finally resolved, except for minor asthenia and cough (last follow-up at 40 days after discharge).

Figure
Computed tomography (CT) scans of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient with sarcoidosis who had been receiving long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment, France. A) Thoracic CT scan from November 2019, showing baseline pulmonary sarcoidosis lesions. B) Thoracic CT scan performed April 4, 2020, showing diffuse ground-glass opacities characteristic of COVID-19.

This observation of COVID-19 with diffuse interstitial pneumonia requiring hospital admission in a patient on long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment suggests that hydroxychloroquine may not be as effective as suggested by in vitro data. This patient had always been considered highly adherent to his medications, which was confirmed by therapeutic drug monitoring. Because plasma concentration was within therapeutic range by the time the patient was admitted, the failure of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 cannot be attributed to underdosage or suboptimal adherence. Two recent studies suggested that hydroxychloroquine provides no protection against COVID-19 in patients with a broad range of autoimmune diseases from New York, USA, and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from France. The case we present is unique in that the patient was not receiving any immunomodulatory agent other than hydroxychloroquine.

### Can sarcoidosis be cured? [^76b78e0c]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause that affects the lungs almost invariably. The clinical course and outcomes of pulmonary sarcoidosis are highly variable, ranging from mild and self-limiting to organ-threatening or life-threatening disease. Often, sarcoidosis remits permanently (spontaneously or following treatment), although disease resolution rates vary depending on demographic factors, mode of presentation, organs involved, and disease duration. Corticosteroids are the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis. However, corticosteroid toxicity is common and causes significant morbidity and mortality; therefore, their use should be minimized. Certain phenotypes of sarcoidosis are more likely to undergo disease termination than others. In addition, certain pharmacologic maneuvers may be useful in terminating the disease, but these remain exploratory at this time. Future clinical and basic research of such phenotypes may lead to the discovery of immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in sarcoidosis disease termination.

### Treatment of interstitial lung disease associated cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^71c72088]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary sarcoidosis — inhaled corticosteroids for chronic cough showed no clear benefit and are not routinely advised: Cough was reported as better in more patients receiving active therapy (eight of 10 vs six of 11), but there was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.36). In established sarcoidosis (> 1 year), fluticasone at 2000 μg daily vs 1760 μg daily with Seventy-five percent of patients on oral prednisolone and n = 43 overall produced no significant difference vs placebo despite decreases in cough severity. A 1994 budesonide study enrolled 29 patients (14 treated) and found no difference in cough severity (P = 0.87) and no significant change in oral prednisolone dose in eight patients taking prednisolone. Accordingly, for patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, we suggest that inhaled corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed to treat the chronic cough (Grade 2C).

Conclusion

The reverse halo sign is a key radiological feature that can be seen across a wide range of lung conditions. Accurate interpretation, through correlation with clinical history and diagnostic findings, is essential for timely diagnosis, guiding appropriate treatment, and ultimately improving patient outcomes (Table 1 and 2).

Table 2
This table provides a structured approach to evaluating the reverse halo sign (RHS) by categorizing conditions based on their radiological features, anatomical distribution, and associated clinical clues

Infectious Causes: If the patient presents with signs of infection (fever, cough) or has an immunocompromised status, consider bacterial pneumonia (with a smooth rim), fungal infections (especially with a "bird's nest" appearance), viral pneumonia (notably in the setting of COVID-19 or influenza), or parasitic infections (with relevant exposure history).

Inflammatory / Autoimmune Causes: In patients with subacute symptoms or systemic features, organize the differential around organizing pneumonia, autoimmune vasculitides (GPA, SLE), sarcoidosis, or lipoid pneumonia (with aspiration history).

Vascular Causes: Wedge-shaped, peripheral lesions in patients with risk factors for thrombosis point toward pulmonary embolism/infarction or septic emboli (if infection is present).

Malignant Causes: In patients with risk factors such as a smoking history or known cancer, consider primary lung carcinoma or metastasis.

Trauma / Treatment-Related Causes: A history of recent chest trauma, radiotherapy, drug exposure, or lung ablation will steer you toward diagnoses like pulmonary contusion, radiation-induced organizing pneumonia, drug-related pneumonitis, or post-ablation changes.

Correlate with Clinical and Laboratory Data: The imaging features must be integrated with the patient's clinical history, laboratory tests, and other imaging findings to refine the diagnosis.

### New advances in the management of pulmonary sarcoidosis [^680ae05e]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a highly variable granulomatous multisystem syndrome. It affects individuals in the prime years of life; both the frequency and severity of sarcoidosis are greater in economically disadvantaged populations. The diagnosis, assessment, and management of pulmonary sarcoidosis have evolved as new technologies and therapies have been adopted. Transbronchial needle aspiration guided by endobronchial ultrasound has replaced mediastinoscopy in many centers. Advanced imaging modalities, such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning, and the widespread availability of magnetic resonance imaging have led to more sensitive assessment of organ involvement and disease activity. Although several new insights about the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis exist, no new therapies have been specifically developed for use in the disease. The current or proposed use of immunosuppressive medications for sarcoidosis has been extrapolated from other disease states; various novel pathways are currently under investigation as therapeutic targets. Coupled with the growing recognition of corticosteroid toxicities for managing sarcoidosis, the use of corticosteroid sparing anti-sarcoidosis medications is likely to increase. Besides treatment of granulomatous inflammation, recognition and management of the non-granulomatous complications of pulmonary sarcoidosis are needed for optimal outcomes in patients with advanced disease.

### The treatment of sarcoidosis: translating the European respiratory guidelines into clinical practice [^6345e4cf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recently, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) developed new international guidelines for the treatment of sarcoidosis. This manuscript attempts to distill the ERS Sarcoidosis Treatment Guidelines to a manageable format that can be easily used by practitioners.

Recent Findings

The ERS Sarcoidosis Treatment Guidelines addressed the treatment of pulmonary, skin, cardiac, neurologic, and sarcoidosis-associated fatigue. Therapeutic drug dosing and treatment algorithms for these conditions were also addressed. Glucocorticoids were the initial recommended treatment for these conditions except for sarcoidosis-associated fatigue where a pulmonary exercise program or a neurostimulant was initially suggested. Because of the risk of glucocorticoid side-effects, the Guidelines recommended early consideration of glucocorticoid-sparing therapy including certain antimetabolites and two specific tumor necrosis alpha antagonists: infliximab and adalimumab.

Summary

The ERS Sarcoidosis Treatment Guidelines used a rigorous GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology to update treatment recommendations for this condition. This manuscript summarizes the Guideline findings in practical terms for clinicians. Suggested algorithms and treatment dosing recommendations are provided.

### Difficult treatment issues in sarcoidosis [^40db3c57]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The management of sarcoidosis includes several crucial decisions. Not all patients with sarcoidosis need treatment. At least a third of patients will never be treated. It is unclear whether asymptomatic patients ever need therapy, even if they have extensive lung disease. One reason that clinicians are reluctant to start therapy is that many patients who are started on corticosteroids have a difficult time getting off therapy, even after 2 years. In the chronic patient, alternatives to corticosteroids have been developed. These include drugs such as methotrexate, azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine. These agents have been the standard second line of therapy for patients with chronic disease. However, these drugs do not always work. In addition, they are associated with their own toxicities. Another group of sarcoidosis patients have also emerged. These are the refractory patients, who have progressive disease whilst on therapy. For these patients, new agents such as thalidomide and the monoclonal antibodies to tumour necrosis factor have been occasionally helpful. This paper reviews several important issues in the management of sarcoidosis.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^40777ec9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory infections are ubiquitous. The COVID-19 pandemic has refocused our attention on how morbid and potentially fatal they can be, and how host factors have an impact on the clinical course and outcomes. Due to a range of vulnerabilities, patients with sarcoidosis may be at higher risk of poor outcomes from respiratory infections. The objective of the SARCoidosis Outcomes in all respiratory Viral Infectious Diseases (SARCOVID) Study is to determine the short-term and long-term impacts of respiratory viral illnesses (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) in sarcoidosis.

Methods and Analysis

Up to 20 clinical sites across the USA are participating in the recruitment of 2000 patients for this observational, prospective study. To ensure that the study cohort is representative of the general population with sarcoidosis, participating sites include those dedicated to reaching under-represented minorities or patients from non-urban areas. Baseline data on demographic features, comorbidities, sarcoidosis characteristics and pre-enrolment lung function will be captured at study entry. During this 3-year study, all acute respiratory infectious events (from SARS-CoV-2 and any other respiratory pathogen) will be assessed and recorded at quarterly intervals. The level of required medical care and survival outcomes determine infection severity, and the impact of infection on quality of life measures will be recorded. Post-infection lung function and imaging results will measure the long-term impact on the trajectory of sarcoidosis. Patients will be analysed according to the clinical phenotypes of cardiac and fibrotic pulmonary sarcoidosis. Control groups include non-infected patients with sarcoidosis and patients with non-sarcoidosis interstitial lung disease.

Ethics and Dissemination

Each site received local institutional review board approval prior to enrolling patients, with the consent process determined by local institution standards. Data will be published in a timely manner (goal < 12 months) at the conclusion of the 3-year follow-up period and will be made available upon request.

### Rationale and design of the SARCoidosis outcomes in all respiratory viral infectious diseases (SARCOVID) study [^48efdc05]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Study potential

This study has several unique features which position it to answer important unknowns in sarcoidosis. First, the design of this study aims to improve health equity through proportional representation. The SARCOVID Study is projected to become one of the largest prospective clinical studies of sarcoidosis derived from clinician-verified disease characteristics. Recruiting from a broad swathe of geographical sites and catchment areas, we are enrolling a diverse cohort of patients, with strong representation from the south and from urban hospital centres; the latter are, in many cases, safety net hospitals, which have historically been under-represented in sarcoidosis research. Broad study site inclusion positions us to enrol a large number of black patients, which are not only at higher risk of having sarcoidosis, but also of having a more severe disease course.

This is a time of heightened awareness of the importance of respiratory infections in health. Unique among other pandemic-inspired cohort studies, we measure the risk factors and outcomes associated with all respiratory infection events in sarcoidosis. Our results will be relevant to the clinical management of sarcoidosis long after the COVID-19 pandemic has run its course or settled into an endemic disease process.

Finally, while hospitalisation and death are critical outcomes in respiratory infections, other outcomes — while less dramatic — may contribute to the cumulative burden of infections in sarcoidosis. To capture their full morbidity, we measure a range of psychosocial, functional and well-being outcomes. Quality of life impairment is a major morbidity factor in sarcoidosis; superimposed damage from respiratory infections may compound this morbidity, and impact not only the well-being but also the livelihoods, financial security and vitality of patients.

### Alveolar sarcoidosis with intense FDG uptake, mimicking multi-focal pneumonia and infiltrative lung malignancy [^1b9623b0]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Alveolar sarcoidosis is an uncommon radiologic manifestation of pulmonary sarcoidosis which appears as infiltrative or mass-like opacities mimicking multifocal pneumonia or infiltrative lung malignancies such as multi-focal adenocarcinoma or pulmonary lymphoma. It has correlation with a more acute and symptomatic phase of thoracic sarcoidosis and therefore expected to show a more severely increased metabolic activity on FDG PET. Alveolar sarcoidosis shows a relatively rapid radiological improvement after initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Tissue diagnosis might be needed in some cases to exclude malignancy.

### Treatment… [^b5fda92b]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Twenty-nine percent of patients with sarcoidosis present at stage 2. During this stage, chest radiographs show hilar lymphadenopathy associated with diffuse pulmonary infiltration. injection of antigen from the sarcoid tissue of another patient); radioisotope scanning with gallium-67, which is a fairly good index of active alveolitis since sarcoid granulomas will actively take up gallium; and, finally, high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, which may be better than MRI in evaluating for parenchymal disease. Treatment The goals of treatment for sarcoidosis include resolving inflammatory lesions that are interfering with organ function, preventing pulmonary fibrosis and diminishing symptoms.

3 If the patient presents with stage 1 or stage 2 disease with normal pulmonary function tests and no life-threatening signs or symptoms, observation is all that is necessary, as sarcoidosis is usually a self-limited disease and does not require specific therapy. Treatment is indicated if the patient has systemic symptoms or if deterioration in lung function is present at any stage, or if the patient presents with or progresses to stage 3 disease. 3 Inhaled steroids have been used in patients with sarcoidosis for relief of symptoms, but it has not been proved that this therapy reduces disease progression. Inhaled and oral bronchodilators, supplemental oxygen and synthetic "liquid" tears have also been used to reduce symptoms. Topical ophthalmic steroids have been used to reduce ocular manifestations of sarcoidosis. Newer therapies have been reported.

Hydroxychloroquine, given in a dosage of 200 mg every other day for nine months, may be useful in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis but can permanently damage the eyes; consequently, ocular examinations must be performed frequently. Hydroxychloroquine has also been found to be helpful in the management of hypercalcemia. 1 Methotrexate, in a low dosage of 7. 5 to 15 mg once per week, has been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of refractory sarcoidosis, especially musculoskeletal and cutaneous forms. 1 Other treatments are available, but few controlled trials have been performed: chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine.

### Sarcoidosis in the older person: diagnostic challenges and treatment consideration [^02d069c4]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disorder with an increasing propensity to present in older patients. Diagnostic uncertainty is common and understandable given the higher prevalence of co-morbidities in older patients and broad differential for multi-system clinical presentations. Excluding malignancy and infection with a high degree of certainty is challenging and may require repeated confirmatory investigation where the diagnosis remains in doubt.

Summary Of Main Findings

There are a paucity of studies examining late-onset sarcoidosis. Female predominance, pulmonary, ocular, skin and systemic symptoms are common, while more classical presentations such as Lofgren's syndrome are uncommon. Positivity rates of biopsies vary between studies; however, targeted biopsies of accessible sites with organ involvement are the most successful. Therapeutic management is directed at reducing inflammation, and thereby reducing symptom burden, improving quality of life and avoiding progression of organ damage. While most older patients will require corticosteroid therapy, they are also more prone to developing adverse effects. Most older patients will experience a clinical remission; however, the risk of developing chronic sarcoidosis and organ damage is higher compared with younger counterparts. Patients with evidence of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension are at particular risk.

Impact On Clinical Practice

Health care providers who care for older adults should be aware of the increasing prevalence of late-onset sarcoidosis and consider the diagnosis in those who present with otherwise unexplained systemic symptoms, thoracic abnormalities on imaging and/or evidence of other organ involvement. Earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention to halt the development of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension and monitoring for treatment-related adverse effects will confer a mortality benefit.

5.7	Immunizations

Prior to initiating therapy with YESINTEK, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with YESINTEK should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with YESINTEK or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving YESINTEK because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient.

Non-live vaccinations received during a course of YESINTEK may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease.

5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia

Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue YESINTEK and institute appropriate treatment [see Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^fb035461]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — immunocompromised host pneumonia scope and rationale: Pneumonia imposes a significant clinical burden on people with immunocompromising conditions, and many individuals have compromised immunity due to cytotoxic cancer treatments, biological therapies, organ transplants, and immunodeficiencies. Despite awareness of increased infectious pneumonia risk, immunocompromised people are often excluded from pneumonia clinical guidelines and treatment trials. The report states that the absence of a widely accepted definition for immunocompromised host pneumonia hampers consistent clinical care and research, and describes an American Thoracic Society workshop with participants across pulmonary disease, infectious diseases, immunology, genetics, and laboratory medicine aiming to define this entity and its diagnostic criteria.

### Sarcoidosis [^29eee2aa]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis has a multitude of manifestations and affects the human body widely. Pulmonary complaints are most common; however, cardiac, optic, and neurologic manifestations carry high mortality and morbidity. Acute presentations in the emergency room can cause life-altering effects if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Generally, less severe cases of sarcoidosis have a favorable prognosis and can be treated with steroid therapy. Resistant and more severe cases of the disease carry high mortality and morbidity. It is incredibly important to arrange specialty follow-up for these patients when needed. This review focuses on the acute presentations of sarcoidosis.

### Uncommon condition mimicking non-resolving pneumonia and malignancy on radiography that improves dramatically with a course of steroids [^a9427c32]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 58-year-old man was seen in a specialist respiratory clinic, with non-resolving pneumonia. Various investigations including CT scan, bronchoscopy and CT-guided biopsy were carried out for suspected malignancy but they could not find any evidence of neoplasia or anything else of significance. The lung mass that persisted for years later resolved with a course of steroids, at which point further investigations for alternative differential diagnoses suggested a surprising conclusion.

RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS

Thirty-five treatment recommendations (Table 1, Figures 1, 2, and 3) are based on 216 PICO questions. The literature search identified 5,235 records (including screening, monitoring, and treatment). After excluding 4,038 titles and abstracts, 1,197 full-text articles were reviewed, 1,083 excluded, and 117 included: screening (n = 10), monitoring (n = 17), and treatment (n = 90) (Supplementary Material 5 and 6). Table 2 summarizes Voting Panel decisions, PICO questions, certainty of evidence, and evidence that led to treatment recommendations. Table 3 provides guidance on medication toxicity and monitoring. Table 4 summarizes integrative and pharmacologic interventions beyond the scope of this guideline.

Recommendations for management of SARD-ILD: first-line ILD treatment

Certainty of all evidence was low to very low (Table 2) (Supplementary Material 3). Although PICOs included head-to-head comparisons of treatments to create a hierarchy, limited evidence on the differences among individual therapies led to grouping first-line ILD treatment options into "preferred" therapies (expected to be most prescribed) and "additional options" (may be appropriate in certain situations) (Figure 1).

For people with SARD-ILD other than SSc-ILD, we conditionally recommend glucocorticoids as a first-line ILD treatment.

Because glucocorticoids are generally used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents and there is value in short-term glucocorticoid exposure, they are presented separately from other immunosuppressives. Oral prednisone is commonly used in SARD-ILD other than SSc-ILD, and intravenous pulse methylprednisolone is typically reserved for acute onset or severe ILD. Glucocorticoids might not be used in people with predominantly fibrotic disease (eg, RA with a usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP] pattern), but not all panelists agreed. Glucocorticoids should be used with caution in people with MCTD-ILD with SSc features or IIM-ILD with SSc antibodies given the risk for scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). –

For people with SSc-ILD, we strongly recommend against glucocorticoids as first-line ILD treatment.

Glucocorticoids have been associated with SRC, particularly in doses of prednisone (or its equivalent) > 15 mg daily, although concerns remain at any dose. – If glucocorticoids are considered, the lowest effective dose should be used, ideally < 15 mg/day. The moderate certainty of evidence for harm – without clear evidence for efficacy led to a strong recommendation.

### The role of PET in the management of sarcoidosis [^e4c60781]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

ROLE OF PET IN TREATMENT DECISIONS

Determining when and how to treat a patient with sarcoidosis is challenging and depends on a combination of impairment of patient's quality of life and the potential for organ damage. PET may potentially be used to initiate treatment, monitor response, and modify treatment (Fig. 4). Positive findings on PET/CT have been shown to lead to increasing doses of corticosteroids and the initiation of methotrexate. SUVmax has been shown to decrease once therapy is enacted, which also coincided with statistically significant improvement in self-reported symptoms. Findings observed on PET have long-term implications, as the treatment for sarcoidosis involves medications, which can cause immunosuppression, metabolic, and other side effects. Tailoring doses to the appropriate level allow for effective treatment while minimizing these unnecessary consequences. A subset of patients who have reduced FDG uptake on follow-up PET can have immunosuppression reduced or even discontinued.

FIGURE 4
Consecutive FDG-PET scans in patient with multisystem sarcoidosis. Methods: this is an original PET image from the authors'. Results: this figure shows three consecutive FDG-PET performed in a patient with progressively more aggressive therapy for sarcoidosis.

Pulmonary fibrosis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with sarcoidosis. In select patients, treatment of pulmonary disease because of sarcoidosis can lead to an improvement in lung function. Pulmonary fibrosis, the result of persistent inflammation from sarcoidosis, represents inactive tissue but there can be co-existent active inflammatory activity in these area. This is extremely useful in cases of advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis where identification of inflammatory activity leads to alteration of management (and possibly prognosis by preventing further fibrosis from ongoing inflammation).

Data on the appropriate time interval for follow-up assessment and the role of PET-guided therapy is scarce. This latter is of particular importance in cardiac sarcoidosis, for which PET is the major method of assessing treatment response.

### Corticosteroids in sarcoidosis [^5269fb96]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are the drug of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis. Because the natural course of sarcoidosis may be self-limiting and/or cause no long-term harm, treatment is not mandatory. Corticosteroids are usually effective for all forms of sarcoidosis, and they work quickly. However, because of the potential toxicities of corticosteroids, alternative medications often need to be considered. Efforts should be made to minimize the corticosteroid dose while keeping the risk of toxicity as low as possible. This article outlines the indications for corticosteroid therapy for sarcoidosis, discusses various dosing regimens, and suggests when alternative corticosteroid agents should be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of complications from the treatment of primary central nervous system tumors in adults [^d6520f62]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lung

Pulmonary toxicity is a known complication associated with the use of nitrosoureas. Treatment with carmustine (BCNU) bears a risk for the development of pulmonary fibrosis which occurs within weeks to months after treatment in up to 30% of patients. In rare cases in adult patients with brain tumors, late manifestations of lung fibrosis have been reported. Younger age and higher nitrosourea doses are associated with an increased risk for pulmonary fibrosis. For carmustine, doses beyond 1500 mg/m² in adults should be avoided. The incidence of pulmonary toxicity in glioma trials is overall very lowperhaps because of the routine use of lomustine which harbors a lower risk for pulmonary toxicity than carmustine.

Infections, such as bronchitis, lower respiratory tract infection or pneumonia are diagnosed in approximately 10%–15% of adult and pediatric patients treated with NTRK inhibitors. Patients who are treated with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib have a risk for the development of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Currently, no dose modification of dabrafenib is recommended when taken in combination with trametinib for cases of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis, but treatment should be halted until full recovery from clinical symptoms and reexposure is not advised. Furthermore, cases of sarcoidosis have been reported in patients receiving dabrafenib and trametinib, mostly involving the skin, lung, eye, and lymph nodes.

### The role of primary care in sarcoidosis [^c7b9472b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current review aims to highlight the role of primary care physicians in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients with sarcoidosis. Increased awareness of the clinical and imaging manifestations of the disease as well as the natural disease course will help for earlier and more accurate diagnosis as well as detection of high-risk patients who would benefit from treatment introduction.

Recent Findings

Recent guidelines have attempted to deal with the confusion related to treatment indications, duration and monitoring of treatment in patients with sarcoidosis. Nonetheless, important points require further clarification. Primary care physicians may be the first to confront disease exacerbation, deterioration despite treatment and/or treatment-induced side effects. Furthermore, they are the physicians that remain closer to the patient providing a significant amount of information, psychological support and assessment for sarcoidosis-specific or not issues. The treatment strategy for each organ is complex, but the principles of treatment have been explored.

Summary

There have been considerable advances in the diagnostic and management approach of patients with sarcoidosis. Multidisciplinary approach for both diagnosis and management seems optimal. Validating risk stratification strategies and standardizing the monitoring process is appropriate for the future.

### Pathology of immune-mediated tissue lesions following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^df665db9]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary toxicities

Lung biopsy data in patients with CPI pneumonitis are scarce, but where available show a range of findings, reflecting the variation in clinical and imaging findings. This includes cellular interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage as well as no abnormalities in some cases. The interstitial inflammatory infiltrate includes poorly formed granulomas and eosinophils.

Sarcoid-like lung lesions have been described with bronchoalveolar lavage showing an increased CD4 +: CD8 + ratio, and bronchial biopsies revealing non-caseating epithelioid granulomas. One study performed immunophenotyping (mass cytometry) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to the first dose of 15 anti-PD-1 treated melanoma patients, of whom two developed sarcoidosis. These were compared with age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls (n = 15). Analysis demonstrated abnormally high numbers of circulating Th-1/17 T-cells (a subpopulation of human CD4 + T cells that co‐produce IFN‐γ and IL‐17) in five of 15 melanoma patients, including both patients who developed sarcoidosis post CPI. These findings support data that implicates Th-1/17 cells in the pathogenesis of classic sarcoidosis.

Results

Baseline Characteristics and Patient Disposition

A total of 37 patients were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug: 12 received placebo and eight, eight, and nine patients received the 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg efzofitimod doses, respectively. Nine patients (24%) prematurely discontinued treatment, six because of COVID-19-related restrictions (eg, operational feasibility and site closures), two because of AEs, and one because of investigator decision. Twenty-eight patients (76%) completed the study (Fig 1).

Flow diagram showing patient disposition (Modified Intention-to-Treat Population). a Site closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. AE = adverse event.

Baseline demographic characteristics generally were well balanced across the treatment groups. The mean ± SD age was 52.4 ± 10.1 years, with 54% women, 62% White, and 38% Black patients. Baseline disease characteristics, including pulmonary function, were similar across treatment groups. Background corticosteroid use generally was comparable across treatment groups; of note, more patients in the placebo group were receiving concomitant immunomodulators compared with the efzofitimod treatment groups. Nearly all patients (36 [97%]) were receiving prednisone (one received methylprednisolone), with a mean ± SD daily steroid dose of 13.2 ± 4.4 mg/d, and 22 patients (59.5%) receiving 10 to < 15 mg/d of prednisone equivalent dose. Demographics and disposition by treatment group are presented in Table 1.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^c87ec50a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia constitutes one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and it is the most frequent infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions.

After the administration of supportive care and antibiotic therapy, the clinical response of pneumonia is not immediate. Clinicians recognize that the first 48–72h of treatment are crucial for determining the course of the illness. Most hospitalized patients with pneumonia recover with timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and generally follow an uncomplicated course. However, a sizable proportion of patients may experience non-response and treatment failure, leading to an increased risk of mortality, which can be greater than 40%. There is a lack of epidemiologic data on non-responders and little to no evidence concerning the best clinical approach for this situation. Currently available guidelines do not provide recommendations on how to manage these patients.

There are numerous arbitrary definitions for the critically ill patient with severe pneumonia who is not improving or who is deteriorating despite receiving presumed appropriate antibiotic therapy. The nuances associated with the definitions of "not resolving", "non-responding", or "progressive" pneumonia along with "treatment failure", are largely inconsequential to the clinician who is taking care of a critically ill patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia who is not improving or worsening.

This narrative review aims to give to the clinicians a structured approach on the management of non-responding pneumonia, namely the criteria to define a non-responder and its expected frequency, the differential diagnosis, the optimal diagnostic steps and treatment strategies.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^f97d7ef3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized but is based on three major criteria: a compatible clinical presentation, finding nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in one or more tissue samples, and the exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous disease. There are no universally accepted measures to determine if each diagnostic criterion has been satisfied; therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure. Methods: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize the best available evidence. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Recommendations for or against various diagnostic tests were formulated and graded after the expert panel weighed desirable and undesirable consequences, certainty of estimates, feasibility, and acceptability. Results: The clinical presentation, histopathology, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses were summarized. On the basis of the available evidence, the expert committee made 1 strong recommendation for baseline serum calcium testing, 13 conditional recommendations, and 1 best practice statement. All evidence was very low quality. Conclusions: The panel used systematic reviews of the evidence to inform clinical recommendations in favor of or against various diagnostic tests in patients with suspected or known sarcoidosis. The evidence and recommendations should be revisited as new evidence becomes available.
