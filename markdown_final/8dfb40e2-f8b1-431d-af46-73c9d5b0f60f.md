## Question

Do studies suggest that delayed school start times reduce the risk of sleep disorders in adolescents?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether delaying school start times reduces the risk of sleep disorders in adolescents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which adolescent sleep disorders are most relevant and how they are defined. Then, I should verify the biological rationale linking early school start times to circadian misalignment and sleep restriction. Next, I will examine direct evidence on whether later start times change sleep disorder outcomes, followed by indirect evidence on sleep duration, timing, and social jetlag. After that, I should review professional society positions and guidelines. Finally, I will consider limitations, confounders, and synthesize a cautious conclusion with clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and definitions. In adolescents, the most common sleep disorders implicated by early school schedules are delayed sleep–wake phase disorder and insufficient sleep syndrome, with insomnia symptoms also common; these conditions reflect circadian misalignment and chronic sleep restriction rather than primary insomnia alone, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating insomnia phenotypes with circadian-driven sleep–wake problems [^114qWhzG] [^115Awi4H] [^1114sHHR] [^115XVuxc].

> I need to check the biological plausibility. Puberty shifts circadian timing later, making it hard to fall asleep before about 11 PM, while fixed early school start times force early awakenings, truncating total sleep and creating social jetlag; this mismatch is a key modifiable driver of adolescent sleep restriction and circadian misalignment, so a later start time should, in principle, reduce both insufficient sleep and circadian-phase mismatch if bedtime behavior is stable [^114qWhzG] [^116Sgc8u] [^112B9TWU].

> Now, I will examine direct evidence on sleep disorder outcomes. Wait, let me verify whether any high-quality studies actually measured reductions in incident or remission of diagnosed sleep disorders after start-time delays. The most rigorous cohort used actigraphy and found that delaying high school starts by 50–65 minutes increased school-night sleep by roughly 41–43 minutes without delaying bedtime, and reduced weekend catch-up sleep, which addresses insufficient sleep and social jetlag; however, the study did not report diagnostic outcomes for DSWPD or insomnia, so I cannot claim a reduction in disorder incidence from that study alone [^111LsPao]. Hold on, I should also review quasi-experimental policy data; a South Korean analysis showed an initial 19-minute gain in sleep duration that attenuated to about 7 minutes and became nonsignificant by one year, again without disorder-specific outcomes, limiting inference about disorder risk reduction [^111hCMT7]. I should double-check guideline statements; the AASM notes that later school start times can be sought for adolescents with DSWPD and may increase total sleep time and mitigate social impairment, but this is framed as a potential strategy rather than definitive evidence of disorder prevention, so I must be cautious not to overstate causality [^115Awi4H].

> Next, I should review indirect but relevant outcomes. Let me consider whether reductions in social jetlag and improvements in sleep timing plausibly lower disorder risk even if diagnoses weren't measured. Meta-analytic syntheses show later school start times are associated with longer weekday sleep duration and lower social jetlag, both of which are mechanistically linked to reduced severity of circadian misalignment and insufficient sleep, core features of adolescent sleep disorders; additionally, later starts correlate with less negative mood and improved developmental outcomes, which co-travel with better-regulated sleep–wake function, though these are not disorder endpoints per se [^112B9TWU] [^111dAWRt]. I should confirm whether behavioral correlates align; observational and quasi-experimental data link later starts to reduced depressive symptoms, less caffeine use, and improved weight-related behaviors, all of which intersect with sleep health and could reflect improved circadian alignment and sleep sufficiency, albeit indirectly [^114LcGuU] [^1155KNAM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to weigh the quality and limits of evidence. Systematic reviews emphasize that much of the literature is observational, heterogeneous, and at risk of bias, with few randomized designs, so causal inference about disorder incidence is limited; the Cochrane review judged the overall evidence quality as very low and explicitly could not draw firm conclusions, and a focused review likewise called for higher-quality data before making strong policy claims about health outcomes, including sleep disorders [^111yD7KL] [^115XgE2N]. But wait, what if professional consensus fills the gap? The AAP and AASM endorse 8:30 AM or later start times to enable sufficient sleep and mitigate circadian misalignment, and the CDC includes delayed start times as a population-level sleep health intervention; these positions reflect convergent biological rationale and available data, though they are not substitutes for randomized trials with disorder endpoints [^114qWhzG] [^116Sgc8u] [^1138aQ1S].

> I should also consider confounders and implementation realities. Let me verify whether sleep hygiene, evening light exposure, and chronotype modify or blunt effects. Evening screen use and light exposure can independently delay circadian phase and suppress melatonin, potentially offsetting gains from later wake times if bedtime drifts later; thus, disorder risk reduction likely depends on coupling start-time delays with sleep hygiene and light management, and benefits may vary by chronotype and socioeconomic context, which influence baseline misalignment and adherence to routines [^117KBvPo] [^1164GshJ] [^112B9TWU] [^111dAWRt]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that later starts alone would normalize DSWPD; given relapse rates with circadian treatments and the need for sustained behavioral and photic strategies, start-time policy should be viewed as a structural facilitator rather than a standalone cure for circadian disorders [^1161rjEp] [^112EJJgJ].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about certainty. Direct evidence that delaying school start times reduces incident or improves remission of diagnosed adolescent sleep disorders is limited; no high-quality trials to date have tested disorder outcomes as primary endpoints. However, convergent evidence shows later starts reliably increase total sleep time, reduce social jetlag, and improve mood and health behaviors, all of which are mechanistically aligned with lower risk and severity of circadian misalignment and insufficient sleep syndromes; professional societies reasonably extrapolate these findings to endorse later starts as a population-level intervention to mitigate adolescent sleep disorders, while calling for stronger experimental designs [^111LsPao] [^112B9TWU] [^111dAWRt] [^114qWhzG] [^116Sgc8u] [^111yD7KL].

> Clinically, I need to ensure recommendations are actionable and realistic. For adolescents with DSWPD or prominent insomnia symptoms, I should confirm that later school start times, when feasible, can be incorporated alongside evidence-based circadian therapies such as morning light exposure and strategically timed melatonin, plus consistent sleep–wake schedules and evening light minimization; I should also screen for comorbid mood, ADHD, and substance use that can perpetuate sleep problems, and coordinate with schools and families to address barriers to implementation and sustain gains over time [^112EJJgJ] [^112C2RCR] [^113skaEv] [^1159S8Yc] [^115XVuxc].

> Bottom line, after double-checking the totality of evidence: delaying school start times appears to reduce exposure to key risk factors for adolescent sleep disorders — chronic sleep restriction and circadian misalignment — and is therefore likely to lower disorder risk and severity at a population level, but definitive proof of reduced incident diagnoses awaits randomized trials with disorder endpoints; in the meantime, the balance of evidence and expert consensus supports later starts as a reasonable, low-risk, and potentially high-yield public health strategy within a broader package of circadian and behavioral sleep interventions [^111LsPao] [^112B9TWU] [^111dAWRt] [^114qWhzG] [^116Sgc8u].

Delayed school start times are associated with **longer sleep duration** [^111LsPao] and **reduced daytime sleepiness** [^114LcGuU] in adolescents, but there is **no direct evidence** that they reduce the incidence or prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders such as insomnia, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, or obstructive sleep apnea. Most studies measure sleep duration and quality rather than disorder diagnoses, and the evidence quality is limited by observational designs and lack of randomized trials [^111yD7KL]. Professional bodies (AAP, AASM) recommend later start times to improve sleep health, but **causal effects on sleep disorders remain unproven** [^114qWhzG] [^112exPBp].

---

## Evidence on sleep duration and quality

Several studies show that **later school start times increase total sleep time** and improve sleep quality:

- **Increased sleep duration**: A JAMA Pediatrics study found that delaying school start times by 50–65 minutes increased mean weekday sleep by 41–43 minutes without delaying bedtimes, reducing weekend catch-up sleep [^111LsPao].

- **Reduced daytime sleepiness**: Later starts are linked to less daytime sleepiness and improved alertness, suggesting better alignment with adolescent circadian rhythms [^114LcGuU] [^111dAWRt].

- **Improved sleep timing**: Later starts are associated with later wake times and reduced social jetlag, indicating better circadian alignment [^112B9TWU].

---

## Evidence on sleep disorders

Despite clear benefits for sleep duration and quality, **evidence that later start times reduce diagnosed sleep disorders is limited**:

- **Limited direct evidence**: Most studies do not assess diagnosed sleep disorders (e.g. insomnia, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, obstructive sleep apnea) and instead focus on sleep duration, timing, and daytime sleepiness [^notfound].

- **Indirect evidence**: Improved sleep duration and reduced daytime sleepiness may theoretically lower the risk of disorders like insomnia or delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, but this remains speculative without direct measurement [^notfound].

- **Need for rigorous studies**: Reviews emphasize the need for randomized controlled trials to determine whether later start times directly reduce sleep disorder incidence or severity [^notfound].

---

## Professional recommendations

Major pediatric and sleep organizations support later school start times for adolescent sleep health:

- **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)**: Recommends middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 AM to allow 8.5–9.5 hours of sleep, improve health, safety, and academic performance [^114qWhzG].

- **American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)**: Supports 8:30 AM or later start times to improve sleep duration, alertness, and reduce tardiness and absences [^112exPBp] [^116Sgc8u].

- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: Recognizes delayed start times as a population-level intervention to improve adolescent sleep [^116QM47H].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Current research has several limitations: studies are largely observational, lacking **randomized controlled trials** to establish causality [^111yD7KL]. Most do not use **validated diagnostic criteria** for sleep disorders, limiting conclusions about disorder prevalence or incidence. Many studies are short-term, so the durability of effects on sleep disorders is unknown. Additionally, variability in school contexts, student demographics, and implementation may limit **generalizability** [^111dAWRt].

---

## Conclusion and implications

Delayed school start times are associated with **longer sleep duration**, **reduced daytime sleepiness**, and **better circadian alignment**, but there is **no direct evidence** that they reduce the incidence or severity of diagnosed sleep disorders. Given the strong indirect evidence and professional endorsements, later start times are a reasonable policy to support adolescent sleep health, though **more rigorous research is needed** to assess their impact on sleep disorders.

### Later school start times for supporting the education, health, and well-being of high school students [^111yD7KL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A number of school systems worldwide have proposed and implemented later school start times as a means of avoiding the potentially negative impacts that early morning schedules can have on adolescent students. Even mild sleep deprivation has been associated with significant health and educational concerns: increased risk for accidents and injuries, impaired learning, aggression, memory loss, poor self-esteem, and changes in metabolism. Although researchers have begun to explore the effects of delayed school start time, no one has conducted a rigorous review of evidence to determine whether later school start times support adolescent health, education, and well-being.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the effects of a later school start time for supporting health, education, and well-being in high school students. Secondary objectives were to explore possible differential effects of later school start times in student subgroups and in different types of schools; to identify implementation practices, contextual factors, and delivery modes associated with positive and negative effects of later start times; and to assess the effects of later school start times on the broader community (high school faculty and staff, neighborhood, and families).

Search Methods

We conducted the main search for this review on 28 October 2014 and updated it on 8 February 2016. We searched CENTRAL as well as 17 key electronic databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts), current editions of relevant journals and organizational websites, trial registries, and Google Scholar.

Selection Criteria

We included any randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series studies with sufficient data points that pertained to students aged 13 to 19 years and that compared different school start times. Studies that reported either primary outcomes of interest (academic outcomes, amount or quality of sleep, mental health indicators, attendance, or alertness) or secondary outcomes (health behaviors, health and safety indicators, social outcomes, family outcomes, school outcomes, or community outcomes) were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently determined inclusion and exclusion decisions through screening titles, abstracts, and full-text reports. Two review authors independently extracted data for all eligible studies. We presented findings through a narrative synthesis across all studies. When two or more study samples provided sufficient information to permit effect size calculations, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses to synthesize effects across studies.

Main Results

Our search located 17 eligible records reporting on 11 unique studies with 297,994 participants; the studies examined academic outcomes, amount and quality of sleep, mental health indicators, attendance, and student alertness. Overall, the quality of the body of evidence was very low, as we rated most studies as being at high or unclear risk of bias with respect to allocation, attrition, absence of randomization, and the collection of baseline data. Therefore, we cannot be confident about the effects of later school start times. Preliminary evidence from the included studies indicated a potential association between later school start times and academic and psychosocial outcomes, but quality and comparability of these data were low and often precluded quantitative synthesis. Four studies examined the association between later school start times and academic outcomes, reporting mixed results. Six studies examined effects on total amount of sleep and reported significant, positive relationships between later school start times and amount of sleep. One study provided information concerning mental health outcomes, reporting an association between decreased depressive symptoms and later school start times. There were mixed results for the association between later school start times and absenteeism. Three studies reported mixed results concerning the association between later school start times and student alertness. There was limited indication of potential adverse effects on logistics, as the qualitative portions of one study reported less interaction between parents and children, and another reported staffing and scheduling difficulties. Because of the insufficient evidence, we cannot draw firm conclusions concerning adverse effects at this time. It is important to note the limitations of this evidence, especially as randomized controlled trials and high-quality primary studies are difficult to conduct; school systems are often unwilling or unable to allow researchers the necessary control over scheduling and data collection. Moreover, this evidence does not speak to the process of implementing later school starts, as the included studies focused on reporting the effects rather than exploring the process.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review on later school start times suggests several potential benefits for this intervention and points to the need for higher quality primary studies. However, as a result of the limited evidence base, we could not determine the effects of later school start times with any confidence.

### Delayed school start times and adolescent sleep: a systematic review of the experimental evidence [^114LcGuU]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Many schools have instituted later morning start times to improve sleep, academic, and other outcomes in response to the mismatch between youth circadian rhythms and early morning start times. However, there has been no systematic synthesis of the evidence on the effects of this practice. To examine the impact of delayed school start time on students' sleep, health, and academic outcomes, electronic databases were systematically searched and data were extracted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Six studies satisfied selection criteria and used pre-post, no control (n = 3), randomized controlled trial (n = 2), and quasi-experimental (n = 1) designs. School start times were delayed 25–60 min, and correspondingly, total sleep time increased from 25 to 77 min per weeknight. Some studies revealed reduced daytime sleepiness, depression, caffeine use, tardiness to class, and trouble staying awake. Overall, the evidence supports recent non-experimental study findings and calls for policy that advocates for delayed school start time to improve sleep. This presents a potential long-term solution to chronic sleep restriction during adolescence. However, there is a need for rigorous randomized study designs and reporting of consistent outcomes, including objective sleep measures and consistent measures of health and academic performance.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^112exPBp]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

During adolescence, internal circadian rhythms and biological sleep drive change to result in later sleep and wake times. As a result of these changes, early middle school and high school start times curtail sleep, hamper a student's preparedness to learn, negatively impact physical and mental health, and impair driving safety. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence shows that delaying school start times positively impacts student achievement, health, and safety. Public awareness of the hazards of early school start times and the benefits of later start times are largely unappreciated. As a result, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine is calling on communities, school boards, and educational institutions to implement start times of 8:30 AM or later for middle schools and high schools to ensure that every student arrives at school healthy, awake, alert, and ready to learn.

### Association of delaying school start time with sleep duration, timing, and quality among adolescents [^111LsPao]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Sleep is a resource that has been associated with health and well-being; however, sleep insufficiency is common among adolescents.

Objective

To examine how delaying school start time is associated with objectively assessed sleep duration, timing, and quality in a cohort of adolescents.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational cohort study took advantage of district-initiated modifications in the starting times of 5 public high schools in the metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota. A total of 455 students were followed up from grade 9 (May 3 to June 3, 2016) through grade 11 (March 15 to May 21, 2018). Data were analyzed from February 1 to July 24, 2019.

Exposures

All 5 participating schools started early (7:30 am or 7:45 am) at baseline (2016). At follow-up 1 (2017) and continuing through follow-up 2 (2018), 2 schools delayed their start times by 50 and 65 minutes, whereas 3 comparison schools started at 7:30 am throughout the observation period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Wrist actigraphy was used to derive indices of sleep duration, timing, and quality. With a difference-in-difference design, linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate differences in changes in sleep time between delayed-start and comparison schools.

Results

A total of 455 students were included in the analysis (among those identifying sex, 225 girls [49.5%] and 219 boys [48.1%]; mean [SD] age at baseline, 15.2 [0.3] years). Relative to the change observed in the comparison schools, students who attended delayed-start schools had an additional mean 41 (95% CI, 25–57) objectively measured minutes of night sleep at follow-up 1 and 43 (95% CI, 25–61) at follow-up 2. Delayed start times were not associated with falling asleep later on school nights at follow-ups, and students attending these schools had a mean difference-in-differences change in weekend night sleep of -24 (95% CI, -51 to 2) minutes from baseline to follow-up 1 and -34 (95% CI, -65 to -3) minutes from baseline to follow-up 2, relative to comparison school participants. Differences in differences for school night sleep onset, weekend sleep onset latency, sleep midpoints, sleep efficiency, and the sleep fragmentation index between the 2 conditions were minimal.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that delaying high school start times could extend adolescent school night sleep duration and lessen their need for catch-up sleep on weekends. These findings suggest that later start times could be a durable strategy for addressing population-wide adolescent sleep deficits.

### School start times for adolescents [^114qWhzG]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes insufficient sleep in adolescents as an important public health issue that significantly affects the health and safety, as well as the academic success, of our nation's middle and high school students. Although a number of factors, including biological changes in sleep associated with puberty, lifestyle choices, and academic demands, negatively affect middle and high school students' ability to obtain sufficient sleep, the evidence strongly implicates earlier school start times (ie, before 8:30 am) as a key modifiable contributor to insufficient sleep, as well as circadian rhythm disruption, in this population. Furthermore, a substantial body of research has now demonstrated that delaying school start times is an effective countermeasure to chronic sleep loss and has a wide range of potential benefits to students with regard to physical and mental health, safety, and academic achievement. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports the efforts of school districts to optimize sleep in students and urges high schools and middle schools to aim for start times that allow students the opportunity to achieve optimal levels of sleep (8.5–9.5 hours) and to improve physical (eg, reduced obesity risk) and mental (eg, lower rates of depression) health, safety (eg, drowsy driving crashes), academic performance, and quality of life.

Clinical evaluation for persistent sleep problems — Parents of students who are experiencing extreme difficulty awakening to arrive at school on time, or who experience significant daytime sleepiness, should consider scheduling a consultation with the adolescent's primary care provider or a sleep medicine specialist to evaluate for a sleep disorder, regardless of the student's school start time.

### High school start times and the impact on high school students: what we know, and what we hope to learn [^115XgE2N]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Several organizations have provided recommendations to ensure high school starts no sooner than 08:30. However, although there are plausible biological reasons to support such recommendations, published recommendations have been based largely on expert opinion and a few observational studies. We sought to perform a critical review of published evidence regarding the effect of high school start times on sleep and other relevant outcomes.

Methods

We performed a broad literature search to identify 287 candidate publications for inclusion in our review, which focused on studies offering direct comparison of sleep time, academic or physical performance, behavioral health measures, or motor vehicular accidents in high school students. Where possible, outcomes were combined for meta-analysis.

Results

After application of study criteria, only 18 studies were suitable for review. Eight studies were amenable to meta-analysis for some outcomes. We found that later school start times, particularly when compared with start times more than 60 min earlier, are associated with longer weekday sleep durations, lower weekday-weekend sleep duration differences, reduced vehicular accident rates, and reduced subjective daytime sleepiness. Improvement in academic performance and behavioral issues is less established.

Conclusions

The literature regarding effect of school start time delays on important aspects of high school life suggests some salutary effects, but often the evidence is indirect, imprecise, or derived from cohorts of convenience, making the overall quality of evidence weak or very weak. This review highlights a need for higher-quality data upon which to base important and complex public health decisions.

### School start times for middle school and high school students-United States, 2011–12 school year [^116QM47H]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Among the possible public health interventions for increasing sufficient sleep among adolescents, delaying school start times has the potential for the greatest population impact by changing the environmental context for students in entire school districts. However, a late school start time does not preclude the need for other interventions that have the potential to improve the sleep of adolescents. Health care providers who treat adolescents, both in and outside of school settings, should educate patients and parents about the importance of adequate sleep, as well as factors that contribute to insufficient sleep among adolescents. Parents can help their children practice good sleep hygiene (i.e. habits that help promote good sleep). A regular bedtime and rise time, including on weekends, is recommended for everyone, whether they are children, adolescents, or adults. †† In addition, adolescents with parent-set bedtimes usually get more sleep than those whose parents do not set bedtimes. Adolescents who are exposed to more light (such as room lighting or from electronics) in the evenings are less likely to get enough sleep. Technology use (e.g. computers, video gaming, or mobile phones) might also contribute to late bedtimes and parents might consider implementing a "media curfew" or removing these technologies from the bedroom. Finally, parents might benefit themselves and their children by setting a good example. Adolescent sleep habits tend to reflect their parents' sleep habits.

Summary

What is already known on this topic?

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has urged middle and high schools to modify school start times to enable adolescent students to get sufficient sleep and improve their health, safety, academic performance, and quality of life. AAP recommends that schools aim to start no earlier than 8:30 a.m.

What is added by this report?

During the 2011–12 school year, before publication of the new AAP recommendations, only 17.7% of public middle and high schools in the United States started school at 8:30 a.m. or later. The percentage varied greatly by state, ranging from 0% in Hawaii, Mississippi, and Wyoming to more than three quarters of schools in Alaska (76.8%) and North Dakota (78.5%).

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^116Sgc8u]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position statement — middle school and high school start times should be 8:30 AM or later to support "An adequate opportunity for adolescents to obtain sufficient sleep on school nights", "Optimal alertness in the classroom environment to help facilitate peak academic performance", and "Reduced tardiness and school absences to foster improved opportunities for learning". The AASM is "calling on communities, school boards, and state and federal policymakers to implement start times of 8:30 AM or later for middle schools and high schools". Supporting context includes that "teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours", that teenagers are "typically struggling to fall asleep before 11:00 PM", and that "a teenager who goes to bed at 11:00 PM will need to sleep until 7:30 AM or later in order to obtain sufficient sleep".

Delayed school start times — Implementation of later school start times for adolescents is associated with longer total sleep time, reduced daytime sleepiness, increased engagement in classroom activities, and reduced first-hour tardiness and absences; delayed school start times also are associated with reduced depressive symptoms and irritability, and reaction time improves, with crash rates declining by 16.5% following a school start time delay of 60 minutes. Extension of sleep time also facilitates behavioral weight loss interventions in adolescents.

### To the editor: early school start times in middle and high schools have profound implications for children and teens [^111EbBfW]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This letter to the editor aims to prompt medical students, residents, and sleep medicine fellows to actively support the implementation of delayed school start times in middle and high schools, considering the significant impact it holds for children and adolescents. During puberty, research has demonstrated that circadian changes result in a sleep-phase delay among adolescents, leading them to sleep and wake up later compared to other age groups. This, coupled with early school start times, contributes to sleep deprivation within this patient population, increasing the likelihood of drowsy driving accidents, mental health problems, academic underperformance, and a predisposition to chronic illnesses like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. As medical students, residents, and fellows in the field of sleep, we must prioritize advocating for healthy sleep and addressing the issue of early school start times. By doing so, we can safeguard the future of medicine and society, ensuring the well-being and success of our middle and high school students.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^117XGSqW]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Adolescent sleep duration and safety — United States high school students frequently obtain insufficient sleep, with 68.4% of students sleeping 7 hours or less on school nights, while 23.2% sleep 8 hours, 6.0% sleep 9 hours, and 2.4% sleep 10 hours or more; short sleep in adolescents is associated with poor school performance, obesity, metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular morbidity, increased depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, risk-taking behaviors, athletic injuries, and increased motor vehicle accident risk, and motor vehicle crashes account for 35% of all deaths and 73% of deaths from unintentional injury in teenagers. Increased motor vehicle accident risk is particularly concerning because young, novice drivers have a higher crash risk when sleep deprived.

### Do later school start times improve adolescents' sleep and substance use? A quasi-experimental study [^111hCMT7]. Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

A later school start time policy has been recommended as a solution to adolescents' sleep deprivation. We estimated the impacts of later school start times on adolescents' sleep and substance use by leveraging a quasi-experiment in which school start time was delayed in some regions in South Korea.

Methods

A later school start time policy was implemented in 2014 and 2015, which delayed school start times by approximately 30–90 minutes. We applied difference-in-differences and event-study designs to longitudinal data on a nationally representative cohort of adolescents from 2010 to 2015, which annually tracked sleep and substance use of 1133 adolescents from grade 7 through grade 12.

Results

The adoption of a later school start time policy was initially associated with a 19-minute increase in sleep duration (95% CI, 5.52 to 32.04), driven by a delayed wake time and consistent bedtime. The policy was also associated with statistically significant reductions in monthly smoking and drinking frequencies. However, approximately a year after implementation, the observed increase in sleep duration shrank to 7 minutes (95% CI, -12.60 to 25.86) and became statistically nonsignificant. Similarly, the observed reduction in smoking and drinking was attenuated a year after.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that policies that increase sleep in adolescents may have positive effects on health behaviors, but additional efforts may be required to sustain positive impacts over time. Physicians and education and health policymakers should consider the long-term effects of later school start times on adolescent health and well-being.

### School start times for middle school and high school students-United States, 2011–12 school year [^117RwbJE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Citing evidence of the benefits of delayed school start times for adolescents, AAP released a policy statement in 2014 that encouraged middle and high schools to modify start times to enable students to get sufficient sleep and subsequently improve their health, safety, academic performance, and quality of life. AAP recommended that schools start at 8:30 a.m. or later, but this was the case in only one in six U.S. public middle and high schools, with substantial variation by state. Because school start times are determined at the district or even individual school level, local stakeholders have the most influence on whether start times change in their communities.

Groups seeking to delay school start times in their district often face resistance. Common barriers to delaying school start times include concerns about increased transportation costs because of changes in bus schedules; potential for traffic congestion for students and faculty; difficulty in scheduling after-school activities, especially athletic programs; and lack of education in some communities about the importance of sleep and school start times. Advocates for delayed start times might benefit from 1) becoming familiar with research about the negative impact of insufficient sleep and early start times on adolescents' health, well-being, and academic performance; 2) identification of persons who might be impacted by the decision to delay start times, including parties involved in transportation and school athletic programs, as well as students, teachers, and school staff; and 3) preparing responses to common arguments against delaying start times. Many school systems have successfully overcome barriers to delay start times.

### School start times for middle school and high school students-United States, 2011–12 school year [^111ew9wJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Obtaining adequate sleep is important for achieving optimal health. Among adolescents, insufficient sleep has been associated with adverse risk behaviors, poor health outcomes, and poor academic performance. In view of these negative outcomes, the high prevalence of insufficient sleep among high school students is of substantial public health concern. Healthy People 2020 includes a sleep objective for adolescents: to "increase the proportion of students in grades 9 through 12 who get sufficient sleep (defined as 8 or more hours of sleep on an average school night)". § However, the proportion of students who get enough sleep has remained approximately 31% since 2007, the first year that the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey included a question about sleep, meaning that more than two thirds of high school students do not get enough sleep. Multiple contributors to insufficient sleep in this population might exist. In puberty, biological rhythms commonly shift so that adolescents become sleepy later at night and need to sleep later in the morning. These biological changes are often combined with poor sleep hygiene (including irregular bedtimes and the presence of televisions, computers, or mobile phones in the bedroom). During the school week, the chief determinant of wake times is school start time. The combination of delayed bedtimes and early school start times results in inadequate sleep for a large portion of the adolescent population.

### Sleep is essential to health: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^1138aQ1S]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

K–12 health education and school start times — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises schools to add sleep education to the K–12 curriculum, and delaying school start times is described as an important public health intervention with potential for widespread population impact; the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) states that middle and high school start times should be 8:30 AM or later.

### School start times and academic achievement – A systematic review on grades and test scores [^114TRffc]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Early school times clash with the late sleep of adolescents, leading to wide-spread sleep restriction in students. Evidence suggests that delaying school starts is beneficial for sleep and recent studies investigated whether this also translates into improved academic achievement. We thus conducted a systematic review of the literature on school start times, grades and test scores in middle and high-school students. We reviewed 21 studies following the PRISMA guidelines and assessed the evidence quality using a pre-defined risk of bias tool. Nine studies reported no association of later starts with achievement, while the remaining reported mixed (5), positive (5), negative (1) or unclear (1) results. Considering the heterogeneity in academic outcomes, study types, amount of delay and exposure, and the substantial risk of bias, a meta-analysis was not warranted - instead we provide grouped reviews and discussion. Overall, no generalisable improvements in achievement with later starts emerge beyond the level of single studies. This does not necessarily preclude improvements in students' learning but highlights shortcomings of the literature and the challenges of using grades and test scores to operationalise academic achievement. Given other previously reported positive outcomes, our results suggest that schools could start later while achievement is likely maintained.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^1159S8Yc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep hygiene practices for adolescents — Recommended practices include a regular, dark, quiet sleep environment; adequate time for 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night; consistent bedtimes and wake times on weekdays and weekends; a regular bedtime routine to cue the body that sleep is imminent; and morning light exposure, and the use of sleep-disrupting electronic devices near bedtime or during the night should be avoided because blue light emitted from electronic devices, particularly blue wavelengths, can suppress the production of melatonin and contribute to difficulty falling asleep.

### Adolescent sleep, school start times, and teen motor vehicle crashes [^112s29ez]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To assess the effects of delayed high-school start times on sleep and motor vehicle crashes.

Methods

The sleep habits and motor vehicle crash rates of adolescents from a single, large, county-wide, school district were assessed by questionnaire before and after a 1-hour delay in school start times.

Results

Average hours of nightly sleep increased and catch-up sleep on weekends decreased. Average crash rates for teen drivers in the study county in the 2 years after the change in school start time dropped 16.5%, compared with the 2 years prior to the change, whereas teen crash rates for the rest of the state increased 7.8% over the same time period.

Conclusions

Later school start times may both increase the sleep of adolescents and decrease their risk of motor vehicle crashes.

### Middle school start times and young adolescent sleep, behavioral health, and academic performance outcomes: a narrative review [^113ikKCU]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

This narrative review aims to synthesize peer-reviewed and gray literature research that associates middle school start times to adolescent sleep, health, and academic performance.

Methods

A systematic search of publications in PubMed, Scopus, ERIC, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, ProceedingsFirst, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses from 2002–2020 was conducted. Studies with middle school students that had either an empirical evaluation of the implementation of a change in school start time or a comparison of schools with different school start times, and which also reported outcomes related to sleep and health and quantitative academic measures were included. School characteristics, student demographics, study design, start times, and outcomes were extracted from the full-text review.

Results

The review identified 1,136 articles; after removing duplicates, 845 were screened. Following title and abstract review, 18 articles were eligible for full-text review. Nine studies did not meet inclusion criteria. Half of the reviewed 10 studies used cross-sectional designs, 8 evaluated sleep, 6 evaluated behavioral health, and 3 evaluated academic performance.

Conclusions

Late middle school start times can improve adolescents' sleep and reduce daytime sleepiness by increasing total sleep time and delaying waketime. The current studies provide promising evidence that late-start times can improve tardiness, executive function, negative affect and mood, grade-point average, and standardized test scores. Methodologically robust research on delayed middle school start times can inform public policy and promote change.

What are the implications for public health practice?

School start time policies are established at the district and individual school levels. Educating parents and school system decision-makers about the impact of sleep deprivation on adolescent health and academic performance might lead to adoption of later start times.

### Short sleep duration among middle school and high school students-United States, 2015 [^1148Jsiv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

To ensure their children get enough sleep, parents can support the practice of good sleep habits. One important habit is maintaining a consistent sleep schedule during the school week and weekends. Parent-set bedtimes have been linked to getting enough sleep among adolescents. Evening light exposure and technology use are also associated with less sleep among adolescents. Parents can limit children's permitted use of electronic devices in terms of time (e.g. only before a specific time, sometimes referred to as a "media curfew") and place (e.g. not in their child's bedroom) Other tips for better sleep are available at. One meta-analysis of school-based sleep education programs found that they produced significantly longer weekday and weekend total sleep time immediately after completion, but that these improvements were not maintained at follow-up. Researchers designing such programs might consider incorporating refresher sessions to maintain improvements in sleep duration and sleep hygiene (i.e. habits that support good sleep). School districts can also support adequate sleep among students by implementing delayed school start times as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^112tVMAs]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Future directions for pediatric sleep duration research — More studies are recommended between 8 and 10 hours in adolescents to systematically vary sleep opportunity and to examine longer time periods (e.g., 30 days), including weekdays and weekend days, to develop more precise dose–response curves; intervention studies are needed to help clarify whether modifying sleep duration improves health outcomes in children and to explain whether sleep duration has a causal role in health and functioning vs operating as a marker; studies are needed to delineate upstream physiologic, behavioral, social, environmental, genetic, and contextual contributors including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, neighborhoods, and school start times; and research should identify inexpensive, reliable, and feasible biomarkers of sleep need or sleep deprivation to advance clinical care, public health, policy, and more accurate sleep schedule recommendations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD), delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). An update for 2015: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115Awi4H]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders — In adolescents with delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD), "school non-attendance, unrestricted sleep during vacation periods, and (not surprisingly) motivation were all noted to be barriers to successful outcomes with light therapy", and "Patients fitting this profile are perhaps better suited to less complex interventions". In young adults with DSWPD and non-24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD) receiving melatonin, "a higher response rate correlated directly with shorter habitual TST, as well as a later age of onset" (total sleep time [TST]). For adolescents, "A later school start time may be sought for adolescents, if practical and available", and "This intervention also can significantly increase TST and mitigate associated social impairments", though "the implementation of this policy change frequently encounters staunch political resistance and is presently available in select regions only".

### Screen time and sleep among school-aged children and adolescents: a systematic literature review [^117KBvPo]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

We systematically examined and updated the scientific literature on the association between screen time (e.g., television, computers, video games, and mobile devices) and sleep outcomes among school-aged children and adolescents. We reviewed 67 studies published from 1999 to early 2014. We found that screen time is adversely associated with sleep outcomes (primarily shortened duration and delayed timing) in 90% of studies. Some of the results varied by type of screen exposure, age of participant, gender, and day of the week. While the evidence regarding the association between screen time and sleep is consistent, we discuss limitations of the current studies: 1) causal association not confirmed; 2) measurement error (of both screen time exposure and sleep measures); 3) limited data on simultaneous use of multiple screens, characteristics and content of screens used. Youth should be advised to limit or reduce screen time exposure, especially before or during bedtime hours to minimize any harmful effects of screen time on sleep and well-being. Future research should better account for the methodological limitations of the extant studies, and seek to better understand the magnitude and mechanisms of the association. These steps will help the development and implementation of policies or interventions related to screen time among youth.

### Effect of light flashes vs sham therapy during sleep with adjunct cognitive behavioral therapy on sleep quality among adolescents: a randomized clinical trial [^116UpdAL]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Multiple factors contribute to insufficient sleep in adolescence. Empirical data indicate that adolescents sleep less with age, even as the need for sleep remains constant or increases. This decrement in sleep is likely owing to a combination of later bedtimes, coupled with fixed, earlier school start times, which results in insufficient time for sleep. Later bedtimes are thought to be caused by a set of reinforcing influences: a naturally occurring delay in the timing of the circadian clockand increasing psychosocial activities at night (eg, work or homework, socialization, and use of electronics). These nocturnal activities can laten bedtime both directly and indirectly, owing to the concomitant evening light exposure that further delays the timing of the circadian clock.

Previous interventions have attempted to address this latening of bedtime using a combination of early morning phototherapy (to move the timing of the circadian clock to an earlier clock hour) and behavioral or education-based interventions (to target psychosocial and environmental factors), with mixed results. Classroom-based interventions, designed to improve sleep through education, or through administration of in-class morning light therapy, have not been successful in changing weekday sleep durations. One trial using light therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improved the sleep of adolescents meeting criteria for delayed sleep phase disorder, but its applicability to a broader population of teenagers with sleep difficulties is unknown. Although the use of CBT for insomnia is a widely validated method, it is unlikely to be useful as a stand-alone treatment for delayed sleep, which is not equivalent to insomnia, as there are innate biological reasons (ie, delay in circadian timing) that would be difficult to overcome with behavioral efforts. Use of behavioral therapy to promote sleep at an earlier circadian phase (without shifting the clock to an earlier phase) may, in fact, lead to the induction of insomnia.

### Just let Me sleep in: identifying and treating delayed sleep phase disorder in adolescents [^1114sHHR]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Individuals with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) are unable to naturally fall asleep and awake at conventional times; for this reason, DSPD is often mistaken for insomnia. However, unlike many patients with insomnia, those with DSPD struggle to get up at appropriate times. DSPD is associated with school refusal, academic difficulties, and lower employment rate. DSPD in youth has prevalence as high as 16%, and is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. Treatments include appropriate light exposure during the day, melatonin use, developing an evening routine that minimizes arousal-increasing activities, and gradually shifting sleep-wake times toward more functional ones.

### School start times, sleep, and youth outcomes: a meta-analysis [^111dAWRt]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review and meta-analyze existing evidence regarding the impact of school start times (SSTs) on youth sleep and developmental outcomes considering the moderating effects of youth and school characteristics. Scopus, ScienceDirect, JSTOR, Pubmed, PsychInfo, ERIC, Proquest, EBSCO, and Google Scholar were used through 2019 to select studies measuring (1) school start time and (2) sleep or other developmental outcomes. Data from 28 studies and 1774509 participants were extracted and analyzed using random-effects models with robust variance estimation.

Results

Later SSTs were associated with better overall developmental outcomes, longer sleep duration, and less negative mood. Specifically, new SSTs between 8:30 and 8:59 were associated with better outcomes than 8:00 to 8:29 start times. Later SSTs were more strongly associated with lower levels of sleepiness for high school (versus middle school) youth, and youth in private (versus public) schools reported better sleep and later wake times with later SSTs. Although this meta-analysis suggests an overall benefit of later SSTs, there was limited research to test outcomes such as sleep hygiene, naps, and behavioral and physical health outcomes.

Conclusions

There is converging evidence that later SSTs are associated with better overall developmental outcomes, longer sleep duration, and less negative mood. More research needs to consider student and school characteristics to obtain reliable estimates related to possible differences by sex, race, school size, percent free/reduced lunch, and percent minority.

### School start times for middle school and high school students-United States, 2011–12 school year [^112tetcm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Adolescents who do not get enough sleep are more likely to be overweight; not engage in daily physical activity; suffer from depressive symptoms; engage in unhealthy risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking tobacco, and using illicit drugs; and perform poorly in school. However, insufficient sleep is common among high school students, with less than one third of U.S. high school students sleeping at least 8 hours on school nights. In a policy statement published in 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) urged middle and high schools to modify start times as a means to enable students to get adequate sleep and improve their health, safety, academic performance, and quality of life. AAP recommended that "middle and high schools should aim for a starting time of no earlier than 8:30 a.m". To assess state-specific distributions of public middle and high school start times and establish a pre-recommendation baseline, CDC and the U.S. Department of Education analyzed data from the 2011–12 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). Among an estimated 39,700 public middle, high, and combined schools * in the United States, the average start time was 8:03 a.m. Overall, only 17.7% of these public schools started school at 8:30 a.m. or later. The percentage of schools with 8:30 a.m. or later start times varied greatly by state, ranging from 0% in Hawaii, Mississippi, and Wyoming to more than three quarters of schools in Alaska (76.8%) and North Dakota (78.5%). A school system start time policy of 8:30 a.m. or later provides teenage students the opportunity to achieve the 8.5–9.5 hours of sleep recommended by AAP and the 8–10 hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation.

### Impact of delaying high school start times on weight and related behaviors-the START study [^1155KNAM]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In the US, few adolescents get adequate school night sleep, largely due to early school start times. In the START study we aimed to test the following hypothesis: That following the implementation of later high school start times students have lesser longitudinal increases in body mass index (BMI) and shift to more healthful weight-related behaviors relative to students attending schools that retain early start times. The study enrolled a cohort of students (n = 2426) in five high schools in the Twin Cities, MN metro. Heights and weights were measured objectively, and surveys were administered annually from 9th through 11th grades (2016–2018). All study schools started early (either 7:30 am or 7:45 am) at baseline (2016). At follow-up 1 (2017) and continuing through follow-up 2 (2018), two schools delayed their start times by 50–65 min, while three comparison schools started at 7:30 am throughout the observation period. Using a difference-in-differences natural experiment design, we estimated differences in changes in BMI and weight-related behaviors over time between policy change and comparison schools. Students' BMIs increased in parallel in both policy change and comparison schools over time. However relative to changes in comparison schools after the start time shift, students in policy change schools had a modestly more healthful profile of weight-related behaviors - for instance they had a relatively greater probability of eating breakfast, having supper with their family, getting more activity, eating fast food less frequently, and eating vegetables daily. Later start times could be a durable, population-wide strategy that promotes healthful weight behaviors.

### The impact of school daily schedule on adolescent sleep [^114VmSmt]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was initiated to examine the impact of starting school on adolescent sleep, to compare weekday and weekend sleep times, and to attempt to normalize the timing of the circadian sleep/wake cycle by administering bright light in the morning. This was a collaborative project involving high school students and their parents, as well as high school and university faculty members, for the purpose of contributing information to the scientific community while educating students about research processes and their own sleep/wake cycles and patterns.

Methods

Sixty incoming high school seniors kept sleep/wake diaries beginning in August and continuing through 2 weeks after the start of school in September. Sleep diaries were also kept for 1 month in November and 1 month in February. Early-morning light treatments were given to 19 students in the last 2 weeks of November and the last 2 weeks of February. Neuropsychologic performance was measured with computer-administered tests. Paper-and-pencil tests were used for assessment of mood and vigor. A testing period consisted of 2 consecutive days at the beginning and end of November and at the beginning and end of February. Tests were given 3 times per day, ie, in the morning before school (6:30–8:00 AM), during midday lunch periods (11:30 AM to 1:00 PM), and in the afternoon (3:00–4:30 PM), on each of the test days.

Results

Adolescents lost as much as 120 minutes of sleep per night during the week after the start of school, and weekend sleep time was also significantly longer (approximately 30 minutes) than that seen before the start of school (August). No significant differences were found between weekday sleep in the summer and weekend sleep during the school year. Early-morning light treatments did not modify total minutes of sleep per night, mood, or computer-administered vigilance test results. All students performed better in the afternoon than in the morning. Students in early morning classes reported being wearier, being less alert, and having to expend greater effort.

Conclusions

The results of this study demonstrated that current high school start times contribute to sleep deprivation among adolescents. Consistent with a delay in circadian sleep phase, students performed better later in the day than in the early morning. However, exposure to bright light in the morning did not change the sleep/wake cycle or improve daytime performance during weekdays. Both short-term and long-term strategies that address the epidemic of sleep deprivation among adolescents will be necessary to improve health and maximize school performance.

### Normal sleep in children and adolescence [^113EW8vZ]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Adequate sleep is essential for healthy development in childhood and adolescence. Healthy sleep contributes to good physical health, immune function, mental health, and academic performance. The regulation and architecture of sleep change greatly across childhood and adolescence, and the ability to obtain sufficient sleep is impacted by a range of factors that change with maturation. This article describes normal sleep across childhood and adolescence and discusses some of the most common barriers to adequate sleep, including early school start times, technology use, and changes to circadian rhythms, and sleep homeostasis across puberty.

### Short sleep duration among middle school and high school students-United States, 2015 [^116muwtR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Insufficient sleep among children and adolescents is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, injuries, poor mental health, attention and behavior problems, and poor academic performance (1–4). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has recommended that, for optimal health, children aged 6–12 years should regularly sleep 9–12 hours per 24 hours and teens aged 13–18 years should sleep 8–10 hours per 24 hours (1). CDC analyzed data from the 2015 national, state, and large urban school district Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBSs) to determine the prevalence of short sleep duration (< 9 hours for children aged 6–12 years and < 8 hours for teens aged 13–18 years) on school nights among middle school and high school students in the United States. In nine states that conducted the middle school YRBS and included a question about sleep duration in their questionnaire, the prevalence of short sleep duration among middle school students was 57.8%, with state-level estimates ranging from 50.2% (New Mexico) to 64.7% (Kentucky). The prevalence of short sleep duration among high school students in the national YRBS was 72.7%. State-level estimates of short sleep duration for the 30 states that conducted the high school YRBS and included a question about sleep duration in their questionnaire ranged from 61.8% (South Dakota) to 82.5% (West Virginia). The large percentage of middle school and high school students who do not get enough sleep on school nights suggests a need for promoting sleep health in schools and at home and delaying school start times to permit students adequate time for sleep.

The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System was designed to estimate the prevalence of health risk behaviors among students that contribute to the leading causes of death and disability in the United States at the national, state, territorial, tribal, and large urban school district levels. * Students complete an anonymous, voluntary, school-based paper-and-pencil questionnaire during a regular class period after the school obtains parental permission according to local procedures. The national high school YRBS is conducted by CDC. It uses a three-stage cluster sample design to obtain a nationally representative sample of students in public and private schools in grades 9–12. In 2015, the student sample size was 15,624. † The school and student response rates were 69% and 86%, respectively, resulting in an overall response rate of 60%. §

### Delayed high school start times and graduation and attendance rates over 4 years: the impact of race and socioeconomics [^114dc8bh]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

The current study was designed to examine if improvements in high school graduation and attendance rates persist 4 years after start times later than 8:30 am. Socioeconomic status and race were accounted for in the graduation analysis.

Methods

School-wide attendance and graduation records (n = 28 schools) from 1999–2017 were analyzed in August of 2021 using a repeated-measures analysis of variance at 5 points in time, 1 year predelay and 4 consecutive years postdelay start times.

Results

Graduation rates for students in grade 12 (n > 47,000) after postdelay year 4 increased from 80% to 90% (P < .001) and attendance rates in grades 9–12 (n > 80,000) improved from 90% to 93% (P = 0.012).

Conclusions

Attendance and graduation rates for all students improved after 4 years following a delayed start. Economically disadvantaged students and Black students showed significant changes in graduation rates postdelay year 4 and White students significantly improved postdelay years 2, 3, and 4. Adolescent students, especially economically and racially disadvantaged students, have a vulnerability for obtaining adequate sleep. Delaying high school start times is a cost-effective intervention that could promote sufficient sleep and boost graduation and attendance rates.

### Can exercise regulate the circadian system of adolescents? Novel implications for the treatment of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder [^113nbjAH]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Adolescents are vulnerable to inadequate sleep due to a unique constellation of risk factors. In particular, the puberty-related phase delay in the timing of the circadian system postpones the onset of sleep. Resultantly, disordered sleep is common among teenagers and young adults, with the most common sleep problem being delayed sleep wake-phase disorder (DSWPD). Although current treatments for DSWPD show promise, novel ways to improve our youth's sleep are needed. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the evidence for the role of exercise as a method to shift and/or regulate circadian timing, and thus improve sleep, in adolescents and young adults. A growing body of evidence suggests that nocturnal exercise can delay circadian timing. However, exercise administered at different times of the 24-h day may result in phase advances, particularly when the timing of exercise is gradually advanced in small daily increments. The implications of these results for young people's sleep health are discussed and suggestions are provided for ways that exercise could be used clinically, to improve the treatment of DSWPD.

### Association between homeschooling and adolescent sleep duration and health during COVID-19 pandemic high school closures [^115gyWJj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In spring 2020, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic was declared. To limit the spread of infection, social contacts were markedly reduced. Many countries were forced to shut down most of public life, including schools. Thus, children and adolescents experienced extreme changes in daily life. Critical concerns about the negative effects of closures were raised and have since been supported by empirical evidence. The prevalence of mental health problems in adolescents increased substantially during lockdown. For example, increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety and decreases in life satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were observed in longitudinal studies. Furthermore, adolescents were less physically active and spent more time being sedentary in front of screens. Findings regarding substance use have been mixed; in general, fewer adolescents consumed substances such as alcohol during the lockdown, but the frequency of consumption seemed to increase.

Although, to our knowledge, there has been no controversy about the negative association of lockdown with adolescents' well-being, a potentially conflicting finding has also appeared consistently; adolescents slept significantly longer during school closures than before them. Sleep plays a crucial role in mental and physical health, and thus, a positive association of increased sleep with adolescent well-being and health could be expected. Studies investigating later school start times (SSTs) in the morning have shown this association; early SSTs conflict with adolescents' late biologic sleep phase and therefore contribute to the well-known chronic sleep deficit of many adolescents by preventing later wake times that compensate for biologically related delayed sleep times. Studies investigating the consequences of later SSTs have consistently found longer sleep duration together with positive associations with adolescents' health. The sleep gains observed during school closures can be interpreted similarly: because students in homeschooling do not need to commute to school, school closures create a naturalistic delay in SSTs. Thus, adolescents appear to have benefitted from school closures that aligned their sleep schedule better with their biologic sleep phase, allowing more sleep. However, to our knowledge, whether the longer sleep duration during school closures was associated with health benefits, as in SST delay studies, has not been investigated.

### Short sleep duration among infants, children, and adolescents aged 4 months-17 years-United States, 2016–2018 [^113agGs5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, sleep duration was obtained by parent report without objective measures, such as actigraphy or polysomnography. Second, parent reports of sleep duration might be less reliable than are self-report for older children or adolescents. Third, responses might be affected by recall bias, interpretation of items, or social desirability. Fourth, the statistical weighting might not completely account for nonresponse bias. Finally, the analyses with race/ethnicity were univariate and did not adjust for other covarying sociodemographic characteristics.

Insufficient sleep is an important risk factor for poor physical and mental health in infants, children, and adolescents. Parents can help persons aged 4 months–17 years get the sleep they need by supporting good sleep habits. Establishing a regular bedtime is a good foundation and is associated with more sleep. The AASM's Bedtime Calculator †††† identifies appropriate bedtimes based on age-specific sleep duration recommendations and provides tips on bedtime routines for parents of infants and children and for adolescents and adults. Clinicians and educators can guide parents about the importance of sleep at all ages and discuss sleep routines and sleep problems with parents, children, and adolescents, paying attention to those with special health care needs. When advising parents on how to improve their infant's, child's, or adolescent's sleep, challenges that they might face because of their social and environmental context should be considered. School districts can support adequate sleep for adolescents by delaying school start times as recommended by several medical associations.

### The sleepy adolescent: causes and consequences of sleepiness in teens [^112fPGyv]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of adolescents do not obtain the recommended amount of sleep, resulting in significant daytime sleepiness. For most adolescents, insufficient sleep results from the interaction between intrinsic factors such as puberty and extrinsic factors such as school start times. Insufficient sleep and sleepiness impact all areas of adolescent functioning, including academic, psychological and behavioural, which underscores the importance of evaluating sleepy adolescents. While polysomnography is required for the diagnosis of certain sleep disorders, causes of sleepiness are generally best identified with a detailed sleep history and daily sleep diary. The management of sleep problems in adolescents involves treating any underlying sleep disorders, increasing total sleep time and improving other environmental factors that impact sleep. Recognition and management of insufficient sleep and sleepiness is important for the health and functioning of adolescents.

### Recommended protocols for the multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test in children: guidance from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^116H2ajX]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in children — planning before the MSLT emphasizes age and sleep–wake schedule factors. MSLT may not be appropriate in children < 5 years of age due to lack of normative data in this age group, although consideration may be given to performing MSLT in children < 5 years of age in special circumstances such as classic symptoms of narcolepsy with cataplexy and/or inability to obtain CSF orexin testing. When interpreting results in prepubertal children, prepubertal children are less likely to fall asleep during the test than older adolescents, habitual naps are common in younger children and should be taken into account, and mean sleep latencies tend to decrease with advancing Tanner stages in pubescent children. For pretest preparation, documentation of sleep–wake schedules through sleep diaries and ideally for 2 weeks before testing is advised to ensure a consistent and sufficient amount of sleep leading up to the MSLT, and optimal sleep times by age as recommended by the AASM should be ensured. In an adult study, 52% of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome had MSLT findings necessary for narcolepsy diagnosis, suggesting adequate sleep duration is important for avoidance of false-positive results. For circadian phase delay, it is important to take steps to gradually advance bedtime and rise time on a schedule that aligns with school or social requirements prior to testing, and researchers have reported the presence of multiple SOREMPs on the daytime MSLT in 16% of healthy adolescent 10th graders with delayed circadian phase and experiencing early school start times. Additional scheduling guidance states correction of irregular sleep timing on weekdays and weekends is advised, testing should be conducted in line with the patient's habitual sleep–wake schedule, and guidance for shift workers can be found in the recommended protocols for MSLT and MWT for adults.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^1164GshJ]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Light is a potent circadian entraining agent. For many people, daily light exposure is fundamentally dysregulated with reduced light during the day and increased light into the late evening. This lighting schedule promotes chronic disruption to circadian physiology resulting in a myriad of impairments. Developmental changes in sleep-wake physiology suggest that such light exposure patterns may be particularly disruptive for adolescents and further compounded by lifestyle factors such as early school start times. This narrative review describes evidence that reduced light exposure during the school day delays the circadian clock, and longer exposure durations to light-emitting electronic devices in the evening suppress melatonin. While home lighting in the evening can suppress melatonin secretion and delay circadian phase, the patterning of light exposure across the day and evening can have moderating effects. Photic countermeasures may be flexibly and scalably implemented to support sleep-wake health; including manipulations of light intensity, spectra, duration and delivery modality across multiple contexts. An integrative approach addressing physiology, attitudes, and behaviors will support optimization of light-driven sleep-wake outcomes in adolescents.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine pediatric sleep duration consensus — discussion emphasizes fundamentals and scope: "Sleep is a necessity for health", with variability "explained by psychological, behavioral, social, cultural, and environmental factors", and "Sleep disorders also contribute to this variability". The panel "focused solely on the dimension of sleep duration", and recommendations "provide sleep durations that promote optimal health, but do not address other sleep factors"; studies included excluded "total sleep deprivation (no sleep for 24 hours)" because "Total sleep deprivation is not sustainable and thus not reflective of habitual sleep", In developmental context, "total sleep time is high in infants and toddlers, with gradual reduction over time as one approaches pre-adolescence and adolescence", paralleling cerebral metabolism "studied in 100 healthy children using positron emission tomography", and "The reduction in total sleep time over the first decade is felt to be related to an initial overproduction, and subsequent pruning away of unnecessary synapses". The panel noted that "too little sleep for each age group was unhealthy", discussed longer sleep durations, highlighted that longer sleep can be associated with sleep disorders and limited sleep-extension evidence, identified "a few U-shape curves that showed that both, too little and too much sleep were associated with poorer outcomes", and "strongly encourages future experimental studies to examine the effects of sleep extension on health outcomes". The guidance "reflect typical or habitual sleep duration, i.e., the ideal average sleep duration", while "sleep duration in the real world is a dynamic process" with "variable sleep schedules depending on school start times, work, and extracurricular activities that may curtail sleep on weekdays and extend sleep on weekends", and "More studies are needed to better characterize effects of this "social jet lag".

### Sleep, social media use and mental health in female adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1129XD27]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During the lockdown female adolescents reported an increase in sleep problems; mainly long sleep latency and total scores of PSQI, used more electronic devices and social media. However, differences in the frequency of anxiety and depression were not significant between the three periods. Poor sleep quality was correlated with social media use after the lockdown, but not during the lockdown, probably due to the flexibility of school schedules. Our results were similar to previous studies, showing that SM use was associated with poor sleep quality. A systematic review found that the vast majority of studies demonstrated that screen-based media consumption, delayed bedtimes, and reduced total sleep duration resulted in adverse sleep. Furthermore, poor sleep quality was associated with a higher likelihood of addiction to SM or online gaming. Interestingly, our study revealed that poor sleep quality was not correlated with SM use during the school break. The explanation for this might be that even though the students had a greater opportunity to sleep longer during the school break than during the semesters, the total duration of sleep was still below the recommended level, resulting in no difference in sleep quality scores. However, the data revealed that the proportion of students who slept for more than 8 h was higher during the school break than during the two semesters. A review of the literature related to school start times and sleep among adolescents also showed that delaying school start time increased sleep duration by delaying a wakening time.

The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Thailand could have inadvertently encouraged students to access SM due to the move to online learning, virtually with computers and mobile devices, making them more access to SM. Our study found that the average usage of SM and online gaming during the lockdown period (i.e. the break between the two semesters) were greater than that during the two semesters, when the students were back to school. Moreover, the use of SM on weekends and weekdays during the school break differed from the use during the first and second semesters. Students did not access SM before school start time because they tended to wake up late. This contrasted with the second-semester final examination period, when the proportion of SM users increased significantly after midnight both weekdays and weekends.

### Delaying school starting time by one hour: some effects on attention levels in adolescents [^1134Sjy7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of the study was to assess the attention level of middle-school students by providing a group of students with the opportunity for an additional one hour of sleep in the morning by delaying school starting time by one hour, as compared to another group received no additional sleep.

Method

For the first week of the study, the school starting time was delayed 1 h for the experimental group (N = 26). In the second week, these students returned to their regular school schedule. A control group (N = 21) remained on their regular schedule for these 2 weeks. Both groups were tested at the end of each week with 2 measures to assess their attention.

Results

The results showed that in the first week the experimental group slept an average of 55 minutes longer each night, for 5 nights (total 275 minutes). Students who slept longer performed better in measures of attention as assessed by the "Mathematics Continuous Performance Test" and the "d2 Test of Attention", indicating better performance in attention level, impulsivity, and the rate of performance.

Conclusions

The study strongly recommends that middle schools should consider delaying the school starting time by at least one hour. Such a change could enhance students' cognitive performance by improving their attention level, increasing rate of performance, as well as reducing their mistakes and impulsivity.

### How do teenagers sleep? Analysis of factors related to sleep disorders in a group of Polish high school students [^115Xh1ut]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder not only in the adult population but also among adolescents. According to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10), inorganic insomnia is defined as insufficient quantity and/or quality of sleep, occurring at least 3 times a week for at least one month, not caused by somatic and/or neurological causes, which results in deterioration of well-being and functioning. On the other hand, according to the DSM V criteria, insomnia is defined as the predominant sleep dissatisfaction despite having an appropriate opportunity to sleep, including difficulties in falling asleep and / or staying asleep and/or waking up early with an inability to return to sleep. Symptoms should persist for at least 1 month and cause significant suffering to the patient or limit his/her functioning, both socially and professionally. Insomnia is rarely an isolated symptom, it frequently coexists with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, somatization disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and correlates with harmful usage and addiction to alcohol, caffeine, tobacco or marijuana - substances that cause activation of the CNS, hindering falling asleep and restful sleep. Insomnia also often occurs in the course of somatic diseases - it accompanies chronic pain, cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease), respiratory diseases (obstructive lung diseases), digestive system diseases (reflux disease) or metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes). Applied pharmacotherapy of somatic diseases can also lead to sleep disorders. Despite the fact that these problems most often occur in the elderly, the studies conducted so far have shown that it may also affect from 4% to even 39% of adolescents. Causes may be both genetic factors (higher incidence of insomnia in children of sick parents), as well as the biological, social or environmental ones. Among biological factors changes like CNS development that causes shifts in the sleep architecture - slow reduction in the amount of slow-wave sleep and the start of the REM phase, prolongation of the N1 and N2 stages as well as the wakefulness interfered during sleep, shortening of N3 sleep associated with a sharp decrease in delta power, are taken into consideration. Genetically determined is also the so-called. "night owl" chronotype - increased activity shift towards evenings hours, resulting in a delay in falling asleep, difficulties in waking up and morning drowsiness. Sleep disorders are also clearly related to gender. Female sex determines hormonal changes, resulting in greater neuroendocrine sensitivity, and thus stress reactivity affecting sleep. Also, stress itself, as an environmental factor, is not without significance in reducing the amount and quality of sleep by activating the sympathetic nervous system and increasing cortisol secretion which puts the body in a state of agitation, which makes it difficult to fall asleep and also disturbs the continuity of sleep. Recently, the tendency to use electronic devices at bedtime, which is frequent, especially in the group of young people, has become very important -exposure to artificial light in the evening and also emotional approach to the posted content may hinder the process of falling asleep.

### Prevalence and stability of insufficient sleep measured by actigraphy: a prospective community study [^115Jw5Aw]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of insufficient sleep

To our knowledge, no one has previously provided prevalence estimates of insufficient sleep for school-aged children. Nevertheless, comparing sleep durations for children in different countries may shed some light on the variability of insufficient sleep depending on the region. Although children's sleep duration is found to vary depending on the region in survey studies, it does not vary in actigraphy studies. Therefore, we would expect to see similar prevalence rates of insufficient sleep in other countries; nevertheless, this remains to be investigated.

Regardless of conceptualization, insufficient sleep increased sharply with age in our study, which is consistent with studies showing a steady age decline in sleep duration during childhood and adolescence. The most apparent and simple explanation for this increase is that the need for sleep declines with age, whereas recommendations remain fixed for this age group. Another reason for this development may be that, with increasing age, parents more often leave decisions regarding bedtime to the child. At the age of 12 years, several children approach puberty, which is associated with a biologically based delayed circadian rhythmand a slowing of the homeostatic sleep pressure build-up. This, coupled with a stable school start time, often result in curtailed sleep. Moreover, extensive media use is associated with reduced sleep duration and later bedtimes; the increase in insufficient sleep might therefore also be influenced by the increase in media use in preadolescence.

Our finding of higher prevalence of nights with insufficient sleep on weekends than on weekdays during early middle childhood agrees with findings of shorter parent-reported sleep duration on weekdays for preschoolers and early school-aged children, but it does not agree with the results from a recent meta-analysis of objectively measured sleep that found no significant differences in sleep duration between weekend and weekday sleep at ages 9–11 years. Of note, unaltered averaged sleep duration might conceal increases in both longer and shorter sleep. Furthermore, as the weekday–weekend ratio was reversed after age 10 years, with preadolescents often sleeping too little during weekdays and "catching up" during weekends, the reason for the null finding in the meta-analysis may be that the 9–11-year age group includes both 9-year-olds sleeping less on weekends and 11-year-olds sleeping less on weekdays, thus canceling out the difference. Our results imply that the negative effects of too little sleep on school performancemight — at the population level — have its origins somewhere between the ages of 10 and 12 years.

### End-user perspectives to inform policy and program decisions: a qualitative and quantitative content analysis of lifestyle treatment recommendations by adolescents with obesity [^1123kboH]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Delay school start times (n = 4)

Adolescents commented on the complex interrelationship between lack of sleep and their other lifestyle habits. In particular, adolescents described impact on their dietary (e.g. skipping breakfast) and physical activity (e.g. decreased participation) choices due to feeling fatigued as a result of waking up early for school. When discussing sleep, adolescents described favouring later school start times to better match their sleep schedules. As such, adolescents made specific recommendations to delay school start times by approximately 1 hour. Courtney exclaimed:

"I'd probably change so that I didn't start until like nine in the morning kind of thing, like kind of have a spare first thing because then I wouldn't have to get up until seven thirty whereas right now I'm getting up at like six thirty and this is only my fourth day of school, but I'll need to start getting up sooner so I can like do everything".

As Nixy simply reiterated, "I just, like, I want more sleep". Given current regulations for fixed schedules in most schools, adolescents' earlier recommendations for their parents to provide bed time reminders may be relevant in this regard.

Remarkably, in all categories, a few adolescents reported individual responsibility for making choices in their current environments, yet not in influencing change. As Dipti and Michel described, respectively, in the context of the home, social, and built environments, "So I guess it's really the choice of the customer". and "Well, it depends, it's not really up to me to decide, but if I wanted to see change, it's to have more healthier options". It is possible that adolescents developed ambivalence about a system that they believed had failed them, resulting in perceived selfresponsibility for change. Nevertheless, these excerpts indicated that while these adolescents provided concrete recommendations for an environment conducive of a healthy lifestyle, they were equally unconvinced of ensuing changes in the context of both personal and policy actions.

### Sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1143N9oC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment and Outcomes: Inadequate Sleep Duration, SDB, and OSA

A detailed description of the treatment of OSA in youth is beyond the scope of this scientific statement, and at present there are no universally accepted criteria for initiation of treatment. Options for treatment of inadequate sleep duration, poor sleep efficiency, and OSA include behavioral, medical, and surgical intervention. Later school start times can improve sleep duration in adolescents, and the AAP recommends that middle and high schools start after 8:30. Whether later school start times will result in improved cardiometabolic health in children is an area for future study.

Sleep habits that improve sleep quality and duration include consistent bedtime and wake times. Consistent and earlier bedtimes among younger children lead to decreased sleep onset latency and increased sleep duration, in both longitudinal and interventional studies. Several small randomized controlled trials have shown that it is possible to improve sleep routines and sleep duration in children, and in adolescents, using educational interventions, phone‐ or text‐based coaching, the provision of beds and bedding if children and adolescents lack adequate bedding. Two randomized controlled trials demonstrated that not only are such interventions associated with improved sleep hygiene but have also been associated with reductions in adiposity. No randomized trials to date, however, have assessed the impact of such therapies on cardiovascular risk factors other than adiposity.

Over the past decade, treatment of OSA has been formalized with the recommendations encapsulated within the clinical guidelines of 3 societies: the AAP, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the AAO–HNS. The AAP, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and AAO–HNS generally agree on adenotonsillectomy as the first line of treatment of upper airway obstruction, with multiple studies indicating relief of upper airway obstruction as measured by polysomnography as well as symptoms. Watchful waiting is also suggested as a potential option for children with mild disease. The only randomized controlled trial comparing early adenotonsillectomy to watchful waiting in children 5 to 10 years of age, the CHAT (Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial), study found that surgery is superior in the domains of behavioral, quality‐of‐life, and symptom score outcomes.

### Later school start times: what informs parent support or opposition? [^115ZYRqi]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To investigate parental knowledge about adolescent sleep needs, and other beliefs that may inform their support for or objection to later school start times.

Methods

In 2014, we conducted a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey of a nationally representative sample of parents as part of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health. Parents with teens aged 13–17 years reported their children's sleep patterns and school schedules, and whether the parents supported later school start times (8:30 am or later). Responses associated with parental support of later school start times were examined with logistic regression analysis.

Results

Overall, 88% of parents reported school start times before 8:30 am, and served as the analysis sample (n = 554). In this group, 51% expressed support for later school start times. Support was associated with current school start times before 7:30 am (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 8.4]); parental opinion that their teen's current school start time was "too early" (OR = 3.8 [1.8, 7.8]); and agreement with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations about school start times (OR = 4.7 [2.2, 10.1]). Support also was associated with anticipation of improved school performance (OR = 3.0 [1.5, 5.9]) or increased sleep duration (OR = 4.0 [1.8, 8.9]) with later school start times. Conversely, parents who anticipated too little time for after-school activities (OR = 0.5 [0.3, 0.9]) and need for different transportation plans (OR = 0.5 [0.2, 0.9]) were often less supportive.

Conclusions

Parental education about healthy sleep needs and anticipated health benefits may increase their support for later school start times. Educational efforts should also publicize the positive experiences of communities that have made this transition, with regard to limited adverse effect on after-school activity schedules and transportation.

### Interactions between nocturnal melatonin secretion, metabolism, and sleeping behavior in adolescents with obesity [^112hSmRR]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

One common underlying cause of induced altered sleeping behavior and low melatonin secretion is the use of artificial light. In our patient cohort, late chronotype and social jetlag were associated with higher and later (after 10 pm) media consumption, which was consistent with previous studies. This delay of the individual circadian rhythm may result in sleep disorders like insomnia or daytime sleepiness with related physical and psychological disorders. Furthermore, worse academic performance and higher incidences of traffic accidents have been observed in this age group which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics even suggested postponing the daily start of school for adolescents.

### Parental survey of the sleep patterns and screen time in US school children during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic [^1174hudF]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Annually, the change in sleep schedules when school restarts every fall is an expected disruption to daily life. This is best illustrated in the study of children when they begin high school with earlier school times in the setting of physiologically later bed times leading to insufficient sleep, poor school performance and significant impact on quality of life. When schools restarted on the fall of 2020, the landscape of school schedules and learning models were even more challenging than usual because of the nature of the ongoing pandemic. Depending on physical class sizes, local mandates and school district resources, school formats ranged from entirely virtual to hybrid to all in-person. For the majority of school-aged children, there were still no daily in-person class start times dictating morning commute, so irregular wake times from the spring school closures likely continued. While little data are available describing the sleep patterns of children after a 6-month lockdown, it is imperative to determine how to assist school-aged children in maintaining healthy sleep habits during this ongoing health crisis and during future disruptions in school schedules that could derail day-to-day routines. Further, investigating how the pandemic has impacted the sleep health of children has been identified as an important area of focus to mitigate long-term damage to childhood development and quality of life. Even small shifts in the established daily routines can detrimentally affect the normal circadian rhythm leading to "social jet lag" and affecting overall health and wellness. Irregular sleep schedules, duration and quality could be part of the reason why more adolescents and young adults have been suffering from mental health disorders, including insomnia, during this pandemic.

This study was performed to test the hypothesis that the school closures in the beginning of the pandemic would be associated with a later bed time, later wake time and longer overall sleep duration in school-aged children but not improved sleep quality. We further hypothesized that the sleep patterns would not revert back to normal when the school year began in the fall of 2020 because of altered educational formats. This study included children attending public, private or home-school to allow for consideration of any socio-economic and scheduling confounders that could be related to sleep patterns. The intention was to identify children whose sleep was most impacted as important targets for education and potential intervention in this and future public health crises.

### Sleep hygiene intervention for youth aged 10 to 18 years with problematic sleep: a before-after pilot study [^113AcL3n]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It is well established that children and adolescents require an average of at least nine hours of sleep per night but unfortunately, it is also well known that children and adolescents are actually getting less than their recommended hours of sleep. For example, Gibson and colleagues found that 70% of students (aged 14–18 years) had less than eight and a half hours of sleep per night; with the average sleep time of the over 2000 students surveyed at about seven and a half hours. This inadequate sleep might be the reason why daytime sleepiness is prevalent in children and adolescents, with up to half of students surveyed in one study reporting daytime sleepiness at least once a week.

This pattern of inadequate sleep in children and adolescents is thought to be due to a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include natural, developmental changes such as a shift in circadian rhythm during puberty, delayed sleep phase syndrome (estimated to occur in 7% of adolescents), and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, insomnia type symptoms, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, seem to be the most prevalent cause of inadequate sleep with studies estimating insomnia type symptoms affecting up to 34% of adolescents. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, such as early school start times and sleep habits (also known as sleep hygiene) such as caffeine consumption and the use of electronic devices near bedtime have also been shown to adversely impinge on adolescent sleep time. Indeed, numerous studies have shown good sleep hygiene to be an important predictor of sleep quality in adolescents. As such, sleep hygiene has been used to try and alleviate the sleep problems found in adolescents today. For example, a behavioural sleep programme, incorporating sleep hygiene and stimulus control instructions was developed and trialled in University students in a bid to improve sleep quality. A similar study also looked at the effectiveness of a school-based intervention in increasing sleep knowledge and improving adolescent sleep problems in high school students. More interestingly, a behavioural sleep intervention utilizing a combination of sleep hygiene, cognitive therapy and stress reduction techniques has also been used as a means for improving sleep in the hope of lowering the risk for recidivism of substance abuse in adolescent substance users. These sleep hygiene studies have reported positive outcomes in various aspects of sleep quality and even drug use at 12 months follow-up. However, these studies have focussed on older aged adolescents and were delivered in a group or classroom setting. We have taken a different approach and developed a one-on-one sleep hygiene programme designed specifically for children and adolescents aged 10–18 years old. To the best of our knowledge, this sleep programme is the first of its kind to be developed for youth in consultation with children and adolescents themselves. The current study thus aimed to examine the changes following a novel sleep hygiene intervention on sleep hygiene, sleep quality, and daytime symptoms in children and adolescents. As a secondary outcome, the study also measured changes in BMI because of reported associations between inadequate sleep, disturbed sleep and overweight and obesity in children and adolescents.

### Electronic screen use and sleep duration and timing in adults [^115QtdnH]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

On average, an individual's circadian rhythm is slightly longer than 24 hours. Light exposure is the strongest zeitgeber, the environmental cue that entrains our circadian rhythms to a 24-hour light-dark cycle. Light exposure at night can disrupt sleep by disrupting this natural cycle through delaying the onset of melatonin. This can lead to reduced sleepiness and increased alertness, which may be reflected by self-reported lower quality of sleep. The increase in ALAN in our environment, coupled with a transition to our more urban lifestyles where we are not exposed to adequate levels of melanopic light (the specific intensity and wavelengths of light that act as a zeitgeber) are factors that are suspected to have contributed to decreased sleep duration the past several decades. Light therapy, the use of devices that emit melanopic light, has been used for treatment of some sleep phase disorders, as well as seasonal affective disorder.

Chronotype is latest during adolescence and early adulthood and shifts earlier as we age. The smaller association between disruptions to sleep and screen use among participants with early chronotypes compared with those with late chronotypes may be due to the more advanced sleep phase among those with early chronotypes countering the external stimuli of screen use; they are naturally more awake and alert in the mornings and drowsy at night. We observed this in our study with those reporting the latest chronotypes having bedtimes over an hour later than those with early chronotypes (eTable in Supplement 1). Those with a later chronotype (35.9% of our population) are at increased risk for poor sleep due social jetlag. Social jetlag is a term that was coined to describe the desynchrony between preferred sleep schedules and sleep dictated by social schedules. This is most common among those with a later chronotype, and corresponding later bedtimes, needing to awaken earlier than their preference because of work and school start times. This can lead to the accumulation of sleep debt, for which they may compensate by increasing sleep on free days. Exposure to screens, and the corresponding disruption to sleep patterns, may be further exacerbating these effects.

### Sleep is essential to health: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^1152aKCz]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Healthy People 2030 sleep objectives and baseline sleep sufficiency — These recommendations provide benchmarks for the Healthy People 2030 objectives to increase the proportion of children, high school students, and adults in the U.S. who get enough sleep. Baseline data from surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) show that 34.1% of children, 74.6% of high school students, and 32.5% of adults fail to get a sufficient duration of sleep on a regular basis. Other Healthy People 2030 sleep objectives are to reduce the rate of motor vehicle crashes due to drowsy driving and to increase the proportion of adults with sleep apnea symptoms who get evaluated by a health care provider, infants who are put to sleep on their backs, infants who are put to sleep in a safe sleep environment, and secondary schools with a start time of 8:30 am or later.

### Daylight saving time: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^116vwxTk]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chronic effects of daylight saving time (DST) and circadian misalignment — public health considerations: "There is little direct evidence regarding the chronic effects of DST", but reported associations include that "DST has been associated with a decrease in crime rate, and it may be associated with a modest overall decrease in risk of motor vehicle crashes, possibly due to hours of daylight lasting longer in the evening when most accidents occur, along with other, less obvious reasons", while during a prior policy test "when temporary, year-round DST was adopted in response to an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo, increased fatalities among school-aged children in the morning were noted between January and April". Circadian mechanisms suggest persistence, as "There is evidence that the body clock does not adjust to DST even after several months" and "Both early morning darkness and light in the evening have a similar effect on circadian phase, causing the endogenous rhythm to shift to later in the day". Sustained policy implications follow: "Permanent DST could therefore result in permanent phase delay, a condition that can also lead to a perpetual discrepancy between the innate biological clock and the extrinsic environmental clock, as well as chronic sleep loss due to early morning social demands that truncate the opportunity to sleep", "The chronic misalignment between the timing of demands of work, school, or other obligations against the innate circadian rhythm is called "social jet lag", and "Studies show that social jet lag is associated with an increased risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and depression". Additional considerations include that "Adopting permanent DST also would undo the benefits of delaying start times for middle schools and high schools" and that "During the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, minimal, if any, of the purported energy savings were actually observed in the United States".

### Effects of school start time and its interaction with the solar clock on adolescents' chronotype and sleep: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112B9TWU]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Adolescents' late chronotypes colliding with early school start times (SSTs) are associated with students' unhealthy sleep habits. Most studies comparing different SSTs associate later SSTs with longer sleep duration and lower social jetlag. However, the magnitude of the effect varies between studies and the effect of different SSTs on chronotype is not well established. Importantly, although human circadian rhythms are entrained by sunlight, when studying the effect of different SSTs on adolescents' sleep habits usually only the social clock, and not the solar clock, is considered. This meta-analysis investigates whether later SSTs affect adolescents' sleep habits and chronotype and it assesses factors that can modulate this effect, including the relative importance of social and solar clocks. Here, through a database search we identify 37 studies comparing the effect of different SSTs on adolescents' sleep habits and/or chronotype. Random effect meta-analyses showed that later SSTs are associated with later sleep timings and longer sleep duration on weekdays, lower levels of social jetlag, and later chronotypes. Several meta-regressions reveal that the distance between compared SSTs and the interplay between SSTs and the solar clock modulate the effect of different SSTs on sleep timings and duration on weekdays.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^1148hsWN]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Electric Lighting Exposure

Electric lighting is prevalent in schools, homes, workplaces and personal electronic devices. Adolescents are arguably at the greatest risk for circadian disruption by lighting relative to other developmental groups due to the discrepancy between their internal circadian timing, which promotes an extreme evening chronotype, and early school start times that promote an early rise time, even if the body is not well rested. Given that adolescents can spend much of the day indoors, daytime exposures can lack the high intensity and short wavelengths to robustly entrain the circadian system. Evening light exposures can also be of (relatively) high intensity, and long duration, with significant short-wavelength content to delay circadian phase and disrupt sleep patterns, while further promoting nighttime activities into the late evening. In subsequent paragraphs we describe this literature, though it should be noted that the conclusions drawn are limited by characterization of the photic stimuli for image forming vision, rather than for non-image forming vision.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^1118MFgn]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Alarm clock use contributes to pervasive short sleep duration among adults, and analysis of approximately 250 000 self-reports of sleep worldwide suggests that sleep duration on workdays has declined by approximately 3.7 minutes per year in the last decade, the significance of which is that sleep duration is associated with numerous chronic diseases. For example, sleep duration has a U-shaped association with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevalence. The mechanisms underlying the association between short sleep and increased T2DM risk will be discussed subsequently; the reason why long sleep is associated with increased T2DM risk is more contentious, but low socioeconomic status, depression, and other comorbidities are thought to contribute to this relationship.

An inverse association between sleep duration and adiposity is evident in observational studies. In addition, findings from a recent meta-analysis indicate that a negative association between sleep duration and waist circumference is apparent. Importantly, fat mass distribution is particularly salient to metabolic health, with central obesity linked to increased risk of several diseases. The relationship between sleep duration and adiposity is not limited to adults. Because chronotype delays during growth and is latest on reaching physical maturity, enforcing early school starts disrupts sleep timing and duration during adolescence, a critical developmental period and, once more, short sleep during this period is prospectively associated with obesity development. Relationships between sleep and adiposity are related to eating behaviors, and links between circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, dietary habits, and fat mass are further apparent in less common disorders like night eating syndrome.

In contrast to effects of jetlag and working demands on the circadian system and sleep, some individuals are at increased risk of circadian rhythm and sleep disruption regardless of cultural changes. At times this is environmentally driven. All 24 time zones converge at the Poles, for example, where low amplitude LD cycles and extreme temperatures are associated with health ramifications. In other instances, underlying pathologies are at fault. This is true in the case of circadian rhythm disruption in blind individuals without light perception, most of whom experience non-24-hour sleep/wake rhythm disorder in which sleep quality is highly variable. Sleep quality also deteriorates with advancing age, as do other circadian rhythms; thus, more of our ageing population is likely to experience circadian rhythm disruption. Furthermore, with senescence comes a predisposition to various diseases also characterized by circadian system disorganization, one of which is Alzheimer's disease.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^116X7vVN]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

In a case-control study over 2 weeks, adolescents with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) received less morning light and more evening light relative to controls. Interestingly, evening light levels (8:00 pm to 5:00 am) were relatively dim (< 48 lux) across both groups and all week days (school and non-school), with less morning light on school relative to non-school days. As adolescents slept in dim light, above findings suggest light exposure patterns among groups were well aligned with group differences in sleep schedule, and school versus non-school days. When data were reanalyzed relative to sleep onset rather than clock time, adolescents with DSWPD instead had less pre-sleep light exposure in the 9 h prior to sleep onset than controls, and showed no difference in light exposure in the 9 h post-sleep offset. The authors suggest increased evening light may not drive phase delays in adolescents with DSWPD, and instead reduced sensitivity to the advancing effects of morning light exposure may contribute. As individuals with DSWPD have longer circadian periods, resulting in a greater tendency to delay circadian rhythms relative to controls, the combination of decreased evening light and comparable morning light may serve to stabilize their rhythm, although at a later clock time.

These studies show that, especially for circadian disorders, individual differences in circadian physiology and activity preferences can reveal information otherwise obscured when data are referenced only to solar time. Further, it is important to understand the compounding effects of photic history over time. While strong daytime light exposures are protective against night time light exposures, day-to-day reinforcement of circadian amplitude would result in improved circadian amplitudes and robustness to perturbation by evening light. The temporal kinetics of these processes have yet to be determined in health or disease, but will better explain how photic history can attenuate (or facilitate) the acute effects of lighting.

### Actigraphic sleep health during adolescence predicts young adult cardiovascular health [^112xwTEh]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Lower SMEff, an indicator of sleep quality, among adolescents predicted poorer young adult CVH. Reduced SMEff connotes sleep fragmentation, which is correlated with lower levels of non-rapid eye movement stage 3, or slow-wave sleep (SWS). SWS is essential for physical restoration, and insufficient SWS may increase the risk for poor CVH. Personal and environmental factors may contribute both to later sleep timing and to poorer SMEff, such as anxiety symptomsand environmental noise, including digital disruptions in the bedroom, that could be targeted to help facilitate sleep onset and improve adolescent sleep quality.

Greater variability in TST and in sleep onset during adolescence predicted worse young adult CVH in the present study. High sleep variability may result in variable timing of exposure to light, which can lead to circadian misalignment, metabolic dysregulation, and poor CVH. Experimentally induced circadian misalignment has been shown to decrease energy expenditureand insulin sensitivity. Reducing sleep variability across the week may be achieved through consistent bedtimes and wake times among adolescents, emphasizing the need for later school start times to prevent short sleep during the week and long weekend catchup sleep.

### Impact of automated insulin delivery on subjective and objective sleep in children and young adults with very high HbA1c: sleep outcomes from the CO-PILOT randomised controlled trial [^116qmPeo]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sleep is a critical but often overlooked aspect of managing type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young people. Adolescents with and without T1D can experience chronic sleep deprivation due to multiple factors such as electronic device use, early school start times, caffeine consumption and normal adolescent circadian delay. Inadequate sleep is associated with reduced psychosocial well‐being, with higher rates of depression, anxiety and stress, and impaired school performance. Furthermore, insufficient sleep during adolescence can affect physical health, contributing to issues such as obesity, weakened immune function and a higher risk of developing chronic conditions later in life.

Many young people do not meet National Sleep Foundation (NSF) guidelines, with fewer young people with T1D achieving these recommendations. A meta‐analysis by Reutrakul et al. including three studies measuring sleep by PSG, found children and adolescents with T1D had shorter sleep duration than their non‐diabetic counterparts, with a mean of — 26.6 min. The relationship between sleep and T1D is thought to be bidirectional. For those with T1D, insufficient sleep can exacerbate cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and developmental risks. While sleep may affect glycaemia through a direct pathway (via reduced insulin sensitivity)and an indirect pathway (by reducing diabetes self management and self‐efficacy), T1D management factors such as nocturnal glucose monitoring, device alarms and fear of hypoglycaemia can also disrupt sleep.

Limited research exists on how diabetes technology, like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery (AID), impacts sleep, with many studies relying on subjective sleep measures and focusing on individuals with in‐target glycaemia. The CO‐PILOT randomised controlled trial addresses this gap by evaluating AID's effect on sleep in youth with elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), aiming to assess glycaemic and sleep benefits in this population.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^116zRTKB]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Beyond physiological changes, a number of behavioral and contextual changes present during adolescence may contribute to the observed delays in sleep-wake timing. For example, adolescents undergo a rising sense of independence, increased engagement in social and extracurricular activities, heightened use of electronic devices, and growing academic pressures – all of which contribute to delayed bedtimes. Late bedtimes combined with school-induced early rise times result in a sleep debt typically relieved by sleeping-in during the weekends. In turn, these late weekend rise times reduce adolescents' sleep pressure and delay their circadian phase further reinforcing this delayed sleep-wake cycle. This pattern fuels a cycle of 'social jet lag' in which this mismatch between delayed circadian timing and school schedule leaves adolescents sleepy and fatigued, particularly at the outset of the school week. This dysregulated sleep cycle may contribute to the emergence of mental and physical challenges in adolescents. Thus, improving adolescent light health may allay daytime impairment and mitigate risk for mental and physical health problems.

This narrative review summarizes the impact of electric light on adolescents, with particular reference to circadian phase response, melatonin suppression, cognitive arousal, and sleep disruption. It offers a research agenda to optimize adolescent circadian health through understanding the interactions between electric lighting parameters and behavior.

Sleep extension may also improve body composition. Indeed, increased sleep duration is prospectively associated with attenuated increases in adiposity in short-sleepers, and findings from a study of overweight, habitually short-sleeping young adults suggest that this may be related to increased energy expenditure. Among these individuals, 2 weeks of 2-hours of increased time in bed in home environments increased sleep duration and daytime energy expenditure, and reduced appetite and the desire for highly palatable foods. One factor that may influence the effects of sleep extension interventions on dietary habits is chronotype. Using a crossover design to change the time at which adolescents went to bed and thereby compare a 6.5-hour to a 10-hour sleep opportunity for five nights, longer sleep opportunity reduced evening eating among individuals with earlier chronotypes only, despite similar sleep timing and duration between chronotypes. Hence, there is a need to study further the influence of chronotype on appropriate bedtime recommendations. Finally, sleep extension may benefit other behaviors. A systematic review of naturalistic studies recently found that delaying school start times increases students' sleep durations, and there was some evidence for concomitant improvements in behavior and affect. Improvements in sleep hygiene are a natural starting point in attempts to achieve better sleep, and further research on optimizing such variables as sound, bedding, mattresses, and temperature may benefit sleep.

Pharmaceutical chronobiotics have potential in countering circadian rhythm disruption. For example, pharmaceutical inhibition of CK1 helps synchronize misaligned oscillators and hence speeds adaptation to LD cycle shifts in mice, as can therapeutic SCN neuropeptide modulation. Furthermore, an array of clock-enhancing small molecules may ultimately provide effective therapies for disorders of the circadian system. Intriguingly, a circadian clock was recently transplanted into a noncircadian organism for the first time, and such methods could have chronotherapeutic applications, such as regulation of timely drug release. This is particularly pertinent given that most of the highest-selling drugs target the products of rhythmically transcribed genes. Of note, pharmaceutical chronobiotics may also benefit metabolic health. REV-ERB agonists, for example, diminish adiposity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia in diet-induced obese mice. However, none of these compounds has yet been tested for safety or efficacy in humans.

### Sleep problems and health outcomes among urban American Indian and Alaska native adolescents [^114Hr23p]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

This study also adds to existing literature on how sleep is associated with important health outcomes among American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents. Sleep duration has been the most consistently studied sleep measure and has shown the most robust associations with cardiometabolic outcomes. Consistent with previous work among general adolescent samples and American Indian and Alaska Native adults, short sleep duration was associated with increases in depression, anxiety, likelihood of alcohol or cannabis use, DBP, and HbA 1c. Findings support policy initiatives to delay school start times, which have been identified as a factor associated with insufficient sleep among adolescents.

Our findings also add to the limited but emerging literature on indices of circadian misalignment, in this case measured as social jet lag and cardiometabolic outcomes. In the current sample, mean social jet lag was 1 hour and 24 minutes, indicating a significant discrepancy in weekday and weekend sleep-wake patterns. Such discrepancies are partly caused by the conflict between adolescents' biologically based circadian phase delay and early school start times. We found that greater social jet lag was associated with greater increases in DBP. Although mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood, adolescents with greater preferences toward eveningness (and therefore greater likelihood of experiencing social jet lag) tend to have shorter, more irregular, and disturbed sleep. They are also at greater risk for behaviors that can influence blood pressure, including poor diet, physical activity, substance use, and nighttime electronic media use. Unexpectedly, greater self-reported sleep disturbances were associated with lower BMI and waist circumference. This finding contrasts with prior longitudinal work demonstrating that sleep problems are associated with higher BMI, although most of this work has focused on short sleep duration.

Combined, our findings highlight the importance of focusing on multiple sleep parameters for which different interventions may be warranted and emphasize the value of considering multiple health domains potentially associated with sleep. Given that American Indian and Alaska Native youths are disproportionately burdened by mental and behavioral health problems, including depression, suicide, and substance use, as well as increased risk for cardiometabolic disease, these findings support treatment approaches that target sleep as a transdiagnostic process (ie, common pathway) linked with multiple, intersecting domains of health.

Nonpharmacologic prophylaxis — trigger avoidance and sleep hygiene in pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome: The guideline panel suggests trigger avoidance (e.g., proper sleep habits) for preventing CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence for benefits). Although other potential trigger avoidance (e.g., fasting, dehydration, overexertion, and specific foods) was viewed as potentially relevant for individual patients, there was no substantial research evidence to provide evidence‑based guidance. There were no studies that directly addressed this question in pediatric CVS; indirect evidence from pediatric migraine studies, including a cross‑sectional internet‑based survey on later school start times and an open‑label trial of a sleep hygiene intervention plus additional cross‑sectional studies on lifestyle factors, was used to inform the recommendation. The panel rated the desirable effects as moderate, noting that later compared to earlier school start time was associated with reduced headache frequency.

An update for 2015: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112EJJgJ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Children and adolescents with delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) — One non-blinded randomized controlled trial (n = 40) in adolescents aged 13–18 (mean ages 14.7 ± 1.7 and 14.7 ± 1.8 years) tested post-awakening light plus behavioral interventions over 8 weeks: active subjects (n = 23) received natural sunlight when available or a broad spectrum lamp (~1000 lux) for ≥ 30 minutes (2 hours maximum), with timing advanced 30 minutes daily until 06:00 was reached (3–5 weeks), after which a regular rise time between 06:30–07:30 was advised and six 45–60 minutes sessions (weekly then biweekly) addressed education and "reduce evening light"; controls were waitlisted (n = 17). Weekday outcomes showed significant differences for subjective sleep onset and sleep offset times (mean differences −42.00 minutes [CI −2.74 to −81.26] and −23.00 minutes [CI −0.87 to −45.13]); weekend sleep onset also differed (−93.9 minutes [CI −49.09 to −138.71]), with no weekend differences for TST, and at 6 months (n = 15) no significant differences except weekday sleep offset. The TF suggests that clinicians treat children and adolescents with DSWPD with post-awakening light therapy in conjunction with behavioral treatments (versus no treatment) [WEAK FOR], and the level of reviewed evidence was LOW.

The Developing Brain and Pediatric Considerations

Appropriate sleep has profound consequences in the developing brain; what is not well characterized are the consequences of disturbed sleep in the pediatric epilepsy patient.

The effects of sleep deprivation in children affect 4 important domains: (1) emotional functioning with increased anxiety and depression and insomnia; (2) cognitive functioning with poor attention, dropping school grades, and higher school dropouts; (3) behavioral issues including aggression, acting out, oppositional behavior, irritability, and low morale; and (4) daytime sleepiness with dozing off in class. Developmental consequences of acute sleep loss in children as revealed by functional neuroimaging include alterations in the frontoparietal, insular, and medial frontal cortex regions. Such alterations have unclear effects in the child with epilepsy who may have altered sleep on the basis of epilepsy or due to common causes of sleep deprivation such as prolonged digital media use,

The National Sleep Foundation has recently published a final report on the normal sleep requirements across childhood into adolescence. Although both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine strongly recommend later school times to promote longer sleep and account for the adolescent propensity for delayed sleep phase preference, implementation has been limited. The widespread social and technical pressures affecting normal children need to be evaluated in those with epilepsy as an at-risk population.

In summary, epilepsy has complex, bidirectional interactions between sleep and circadian phase, sleep disorders, and consequent comorbidities (Figure 1). These interactions are complex and require a multidisciplinary team approach for both investigations and treatment. Therefore, the most urgent need would be to bring together this team.

### Beyond sleep duration: sleep timing as a risk factor for childhood obesity [^111nT7H7]. Pediatric Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Similarly, another cross-sectional studyin children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years found that later sleep and wake times were associated with greater adiposity, regardless of sleep duration. The fact that the present and previous studies – report an association between sleep timing and increased BMI independent of sleep duration is interesting. Sleep onset time in the present study was in total 36 minutes later for the group of children with obesity. A logical assumption, based on the growing body of evidence demonstrating an association between short sleep duration and increased BMI in children, and the fact that the school day starts early (between 08.00 and 08.30), is that the group of children with obesity, due to having later sleep onset time, also would have shorter sleep duration. However, in this study we observed a compensatory delay in wake time on school days for the group of children with obesity, resulting in a sleep duration approximately the same in the two groups. The late wake-up time in the group of children with obesity makes it difficult for many in this group to reach school timely in the morning. This finding is supported by a recent meta-analysisthat found that the odds of being absent from school was 54% higher among children with obesity compared to normal weight peers. In the present study it is observed that children with obesity more rarely lived with both parents. It is known that treatment-seeking children with obesity have a high degree of psychological comorbidity and often unstable family situations with increased psychological and psychosocial stress, which may influence their wake-up time. Further, it is probable that a late wake-up time might result in omitting breakfast, which is associated with weight gain in children.

### Physical activity and sleep changes among children during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1128p8st]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study examined the PA and sleep behaviors of a cohort of children and adolescents with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children enrolled in this program aimed at reducing childhood obesity, experienced a sudden and significant decrease in objectively-measured PA and sleep. These changes correlated in time with COVID-19 related school closures, and started trending back toward pre-closure levels when schools reopened. Specifically, we found a group-level decrease in average daily step count of over 1655 steps (19% decrease), delays in sleep onset and waketime by about 1 h and 45 min, respectively, and decrease in overall sleep duration by 12 min (0.2 h) on an average (a decrease of 2.5%), during-closure compared to pre-closure.

Several studies assessing changes in PA and sleep habits in children and adolescents as public health guidelines were implemented and structured school activities were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic found similar disruption of PA habits and sleep routines globally. Median time spent in PA decreased by 435 min/week in children (n = 2426) in Shanghai, China, based on self-reported PA. Another study reported reduced PA by 91 min/day in March–April 2020 as compared to September-December 2019, as assessed using online questionnaires in a cohort of Spanish children. Additionally, multiple scoping and systematic reviews of studies across the globe reported reductions in PA time, later bed and wake times, and increased sleep duration among children and adolescents between the ages of 1–19 years, where majority of the included studies used self-reported data and fewer studies used accelerometer data –. Reported PA changes ranged anywhere from 10 min decrease per day, up to 90 min decrease per day –, with studies reporting that factors such as pre‐pandemic PA practices, socio‐economic status, race and, age influenced PA during the pandemic.

Sleep deprivation and sleep disorders are commonly seen in children and adolescents. They are often undiagnosed and undertreated. A balance of circadian rhythm and homeostatic drive determine sleep quality, quantity, and timing, which changes across the developmental years. Environmental and lifestyle factors can affect sleep quality and quantity and lead to sleep deprivation. A comprehensive assessment of sleep disorders includes parental report, children's self-report, and school functioning. Diagnostic tools are used in diagnosing and treating sleep disorders.

### Role of sleep duration and timing on paediatric BMI across childhood and adolescence: Do both matter? [^116WkDFK]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adequate sleep duration is a prevention factor for paediatric obesity, but the role of timing is still unclear.

Objectives

To investigate associations of sleep duration and timing with BMI in a large paediatric database.

Methods

Medical chart and survey data were collected from 29409 children aged 2–18years who attended well-child visits between Jan 2019 and Dec 2023 (repeated-measures cross-sectional design). Logistic and linear mixed effects regression models accounting for repeated measures estimated odds of overweight/obesity and continuous BMI-for-age CDC-based percentiles for each additional/later hour of sleep duration, midpoint (median of bedtime and wake time), and bedtime, adjusted for potential confounders and stratified by age groups.

Results

Among young children (2–5years), shorter sleep duration but not sleep timing was related to higher odds of overweight/obesity (21% higher odds with 95% CI: 3% to 36%). In mid-childhood (6–12years), shorter sleep duration and later midpoint were associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity (18%, 95% CI = 9%, 26%; 32%, 95% CI = 17%, 49%). Among adolescents (13–18years), each hour of later sleep midpoint equated to 12% higher odds of living with overweight/obesity (95% CI: 1% to 23%). Linear models were similar.

Conclusions

Shorter sleep duration at younger ages and later sleep timing in adolescence were associated with higher BMI.

### The etiology of delayed sleep phase disorder [^1161rjEp]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

According to classification manuals for sleep disorders, nine disorders are directly related to biological clock timing misalignments. Of all, delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) is the most commonly diagnosed, predominantly affecting adolescents, young adults, and insomnia patients. It is a persistent inability to fall asleep at earlier, more desirable and socially conventional times, coupled with extreme difficulty awakening in the morning. Considerable evidence shows a delay in the circadian clock to be associated with DSPD. Therefore, treatments have mainly focused on advancing the biological clock and sleep timing through pharmacotherapy, phototherapy and behavioral therapies. The clinical evidence indicates that these treatments are efficacious, at least in the short term. However, follow up studies show frequent patient relapse, leading researchers to speculate that alternative etiologies may be contributing to sleep and circadian clock delays in DSPD. The aim of the present paper is to review and collate current literature related to DSPD etiology in order to outline gaps in current knowledge and suggest future research.

### Roles of parental sleep / wake patterns, socioeconomic status, and daytime activities in the sleep / wake patterns of children [^115TUvS2]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine sleep/wake patterns of primary school children and their correlates.

Study Design

A total of 4470 sets of mother-father-child community-based trios were recruited in this study. We constructed 3 integrated models with structural equation modeling to predict sleep/wake patterns of children (bedtime, wakeup time, and time in bed [TIB]).

Results

Our best-fitting models explained 40% to 71% variances of various sleep/wake patterns of the children, which were influenced by a web of interactive factors including school start time, parental sleep/wake patterns, sociodemographics, and daytime activities. The strongest predictor of various sleep/wake patterns was school start time. Higher socioeconomic status would shorten TIB of both children and parents, but through different pathways (by advancing wakeup time and delaying bedtime in children but by delaying bedtime in parents). Media use and homework shortened TIB of children, while leisure extracurricular activities and later school start time lengthened it. The age and sex effects on sleep/wake patterns, at least in part, were mediated by daytime activities. Daytime activities of children also influenced their parental sleep/wake patterns, especially their maternal one. A consistent pattern of stronger mother-child than father-child associations were found in various sleep/wake patterns.

Conclusions

There was a complex and interactive relationship among school schedule, parental sleep/wake patterns, socioeconomic status, and daytime activities in determining the sleep/wake patterns of children. These findings have important clinical implications for the management of childhood sleep/wake habits and problems.

Children/adolescents with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) without comorbidities — melatonin therapy is supported by one randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded study in participants aged 6–12 years with three dose groups (0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg; mean doses 1.6 ± 0.4 mg [n = 16], 2.9 ± 0.9 mg [n = 19], 4.4 ± 1.0 mg [n = 18]) and a placebo arm. Seventeen participants were allocated to the placebo group, treatment lasted 6 nights, and melatonin was taken 1.5–2.0 hours prior to habitual bedtime with consistent nightly timing. Level of reviewed evidence: MODERATE. The TF suggest that clinicians treat children and adolescents with DSWPD (no comorbidities) with strategically timed melatonin (versus no treatment). [WEAK FOR]

### Parental survey of the sleep patterns and screen time in US school children during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic [^114pTfAs]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

At the onset of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, schools were closed abruptly and millions of school-aged children throughout the world were isolated at home. As children were no longer anchored to a regular morning routine controlled by bus schedules or school start times, there was an immediate disruption in daily sleep schedules. Large international studies have shown the pandemic disrupted the sleep of 40% of the world's population. Early data from the first outbreak areas found this extended to children as well. In one study, half of all school-aged children were going to bed later and waking up later, leading to more sleep overall.

Few studies have investigated if more sleep during lockdown meant higher sleep quality for children at the time. One possible reason children's sleep quality could have worsened was the marked increase in screen time. Pre-pandemic studies describing the recent trend towards increased screen use and social media exposure in youth and adolescents have found troubling connections to poor sleep quality and negative effects on school performance. During the lockdown, educational models reverted to entirely online platforms and all in-person social interactions were cancelled, leading to markedly increased amounts of daily screen time for children. One study reported the average increase in screen time in children was by 4 h per day during the pandemic; an amount which is itself double the recommended daily screen time by the American Academy of Pediatrics. While studies have tied this increase in screen time in COVID-19 to mental health, its impact on the sleep habits of children during this ongoing pandemic is not well described.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD), delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). An update for 2015: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^113woZej]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Children/adolescents with DSWPD and psychiatric comorbidity — trial protocols and evidence profile indicate strategically timed fast-release melatonin may be effective at specific doses and timings. Strategically timed fast-release melatonin at dosages ranging from 3–5 mg may be effective for children/adolescents with DSWPD and psychiatric comorbidity. Level of reviewed evidence: LOW (Appendix, Table S4). Two randomized, placebo-controlled studies by the same group examined the use of melatonin among children/adolescents with psychiatric comorbidities (all diagnosed with ADHD); participants aged 6–12 years received fast-release melatonin for 4 weeks at doses of 3 or 5 mg at either 18:00 or 19:00, with the more recent study using weight-based dosing 3 mg if < 40 kg and 5 mg if ≥ 40 kg taken at 19:00, while the earlier protocol provided 5 mg at 18:00. No significant group differences were noted with respect to TST, and subjective assessments failed to demonstrate significant group differences in TST (n = 31), ISL (n = 33), or sleep-onset (n = 33) or offset (n = 33) times.

### Ten-year secular trends in sleep / wake patterns in shanghai and Hong Kong school-aged children: a tale of two cities [^1123qtPF]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

To compare the secular trends of sleep/wake patterns in school-aged children in Hong Kong and Shanghai, two major metropolitan cities in China with two different policies that school start time was delayed in Shanghai, but advanced in Hong Kong in 10 years' time.

Methods

Participants were from two waves of cross-sectional school-based surveys of children aged 6 to 11 years. In Shanghai, 4,339 and 13,795 children participated in the 2005 and 2014 surveys, respectively. In Hong Kong, 6,231 and 4,585 children participated in the 2003 and 2012 surveys, respectively. Parents reported their children's bedtime and wakeup time, and thus sleep duration, short sleep (≤ 9 hours) and weekend oversleep (difference in sleep duration between weekday and weekend > 2 hours) were determined.

Results

Hong Kong children had later bedtime and wakeup time and slept consistently less than their Shanghai counterparts at both survey time points. The shorter sleep duration was particularly marked during weekdays. Over the interval period, weekday sleep duration significantly decreased from 9.2 to 8.9 hours as wakeup time became earlier for Hong Kong children, but increased from 9.4 to 9.6 hours as wakeup time became later for children in Shanghai. Children from both cities slept longer on the weekends. Prevalence of weekend oversleep significantly increased in Hong Kong children, but no interval change was found in Shanghai children.

Conclusions

The findings indicate subcultural differences in sleep/wake patterns in Shanghai and Hong Kong school-aged children. In particular, sleep duration had increased for Shanghai children, but decreased for Hong Kong children over 10 years. The benefits and barriers of delaying school start time for optimizing sleep health in school-aged children should be further explored.

### Changes in chronotype and social jetlag during adolescence and their association with concurrent changes in BMI-SDS and body composition, in the Donald study [^111NaiiE]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, the amount of missing covariables was low (n = 63, 11%). Full case analyses would have likely biased our results differentially, meaning bias toward or away from the null. Therefore, multiple imputations were the best option to take care of missing data for the current analyses.

Our results contribute to the formulation of public health strategies regarding the risk reduction of overweight development during adolescence. Medical doctors should monitor adolescents carefully, especially from approximately age 12 years onwards, regarding changes in chronotype, since this change may contribute to circadian disruptions leading to adverse effects on body composition. Targeted advice regarding good sleep practices, for instance consistent sleep timing or reduction of blue light exposure e.g. screen time before bed, appears promising. Monitoring of bedtimes by parents may influence the sleep timing and therefore decrease the level of SJL. However, since chronotype preferences seem to be a naturally occurring phenomenon another strategy is to delay school starting times. If school is not delayed it would be advisable to maintain early bedtime schedules across the week and during the weekend to reduce behavioral as well as metabolic changes. Future studies should consider stratification by puberty status or at least age to unmask a potential dilution of the overall association due to the dynamic nature of this population in terms of biological and physiological changes. So far, the direction of the association between chronotype or SJL and fat mass remains to be studied. Therefore, the next step requires the analyses of chronobiological changes during adolescence and the impact on adult body composition which would help to clarify on the temporal ambiguity.

To conclude, changes in chronotype and SJL were associated with changes in body composition particularly with body fat during adolescence and between 12 and 15 years of age. Improvements of the social environment to support adolescents in line with their late internal clock, would be helpful to reduce their risk for unfavorable changes in body composition in this critical life stage.

### Cognitive dysfunction in children with sleep-disordered breathing [^115p3dxy]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Two daily school periods are mandatory in Brazil owing to a shortage of academic facilities, which can decrease cognitive performance, especially in children with sleep-disordered breathing. This study aimed to verify the influence of starting time to school on cognition, comparing children with sleep disorders and normal children. Cognition was assessed in 79 children with sleep-disordered breathing, 468 children with nonrespiratory sleep disorders, and 633 normal control children. We analyzed total sleep time, starting time to school (morning or afternoon), and grades. First grade morning students with sleep-disordered breathing had 8.04 higher odds for cognitive dysfunction than normal children. For children with sleep-disordered breathing, second and third grade morning students had higher odds for cognitive dysfunction than those who studied in the afternoon (3.69 and 4.07). Fourth grade morning students had 8.27 higher odds for cognitive dysfunction than first grade children. In conclusion, sleep-disordered breathing, grades, and starting time to school interact to affect cognition in Brazilian children.

### Sleep among Brazilian adolescents before and after the COVID-19 pandemic: repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses [^113eKCQu]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Our interaction analysis suggests some group differences, especially regarding the school shift, where studying in the morning or afternoon had a moderating effect on some sleep variables. The school shift differentiation is more common in low- and middle-income countries, such as Brazil, and a previous study has identified that the school shift can affect sleep timing, duration and regulation, where adolescents who study in the afternoon shift have later bed time and wake up later, and those who study in the morning have shorter sleep duration, but higher sleep efficiency.

The study's findings suggest that school health policies should prioritize promoting healthy sleep behaviors among adolescents by implementing flexible start times, sleep health education, and addressing environmental factors like high academic demands and screen use. Although pandemic-related disruptions normalized over time, consistent routines remain crucial for maintaining sleep health. Additionally, policies should ensure equitable access to sleep-supportive environments, as students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may face unique challenges. School-based interventions should be designed to support diverse student needs and prevent long-term negative sleep outcomes.

It is important to acknowledge several limitations in this study. For example, the sample may only partially represent some adolescents in Brazil and device-based measures are limited by their inability to accurately distinguish between sleep and quiet wakefulness and their susceptibility to inaccuracies due to movement artifacts. Another limitation is that our study did not include a direct measure of subjective sleep satisfaction or quality. While our approach was informed by the Peds B-SATED theoretical framework, which includes six dimensions of sleep health, we were only able to include five: sleep-related behaviors, alertness/sleepiness, sleep timing, sleep efficiency and continuity, and sleep duration. The exclusion of the satisfaction/quality dimension may limit the comprehensiveness of our sleep health assessment, particularly given the importance of perceived sleep quality in relation to mental health. This study benefits from several strengths such as the use of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs to answer the same research question, the inclusion of many accelerometer-measured sleep variables beyond sleep duration, and the inclusion of adolescents from a middle-income country (Brazil), contributing to the literature overrepresented by papers from high-income countries. Finally, data collection encompassed pre-COVID-19 (2019) and post-reopening phases, providing a robust timeframe for examining longer-term behavioral changes among high school students in response to the pandemic.

### Age-related changes in sleep / wake patterns among Korean teenagers [^112oES7y]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

As children go through the transition from childhood to adolescence, many shifts occur in sleep/wake patterns related to intrinsic and extrinsic developmental changes. These shifts have been shown to result in corresponding shifts in sleep phase (later sleep onset) and sleep deprivation among teenagers in Western societies. However, the effect of these developmental changes on the sleep habits of Korean teenagers has not been analyzed. This study aims to quantify age-related changes in sleep/wake patterns among Korean teenagers and elucidate cultural and other factors causing these changes.

Methods

The School Sleep Habits Survey was administered in homeroom classes to students in grades 5 to 12 (mean age: 13.7 ± 2.4 years) selected via a 2-way stratification sampling method. The survey included items regarding usual sleep/wake patterns over the previous 2 weeks as well as measures of daytime sleepiness, sleep/wake-problem behavior, depressed mood, and morningness/eveningness.

Results

A total of 1457 students (52.9% male) completed the survey. The higher the grade, the later bedtime was found to be on both school days and weekends. There was a similar relationship between increasing grade and earlier wake time on school days, but higher grades were associated with later wake time on weekends. Total sleep time decreased by approximately 3 hours on school nights and 1 hour on weekend nights from grades 5 to 12. Adolescents were severely sleep deprived, with mean school-night total sleep times of 6.02, 5.62, and 4.86 hours for 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders, respectively. In the higher grades, there was a greater discrepancy between school nights and weekends in terms of bedtime and wake time, and the magnitude of weekend oversleep increased. Older students also reported more daytime sleepiness, more sleep/wake-problem behavior, more depressed mood, and more eveningness preference. The chief reasons students cited for their sleep deprivation differed across grades: Academic demands and entertainment (such as Internet and television) were reported by 5th- and 6th-graders, entertainment and then academic demands by 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders, and early school start time and academic demands by 10th-, 11th- and 12th-graders.

Conclusions

This study clearly demonstrates that Korean adolescents do not get adequate sleep and that they have profound discrepancies in their sleep/wake patterns between school and weekend nights. Compared with previous studies from other countries, Korean students display even greater sleep deprivation and also more irregular sleep/wake patterns. This study also demonstrates that academic demands/stress and early school start time are the most important contributing factors for sleep deprivation among Korean adolescents. These findings stress the need to promote awareness of the magnitude of adolescent sleep deprivation and its detrimental effects in Korean society.

### Melatonin treatment in adolescents with delayed sleep phase syndrome [^1124k857]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

This retrospective study describes the effects of long-term treatment with melatonin in 33 adolescents (age range, 10–18 years) with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). Patients were treated with oral melatonin, 3 to 5 mg/day for an average period of 6 months. During the treatment, sleep onset was advanced and sleep duration was longer. Treatment was also associated with a decrease in the proportion of patients reporting school difficulties. No adverse effects of melatonin were noted. This study indicates that long-term treatment with melatonin can be beneficial for adolescents with DSPS in terms of sleep-wake schedule and school performance.

### Sleep disorders in adolescents [^115XVuxc]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic sleep deprivation is a common, treatable condition among adolescents. Growing literature supports a myriad consequences that impact overall health, behavior, mood, and academic performance in this vulnerable age group during a time when there are rapid changes in physical development and emotional regulation. This article reviews the epidemiology and health effects of sleep deprivation in adolescents as well as common disorders leading to sleep loss and evidence to support treatment. Although a variety of important sleep disorders may disrupt quality of sleep in adolescents, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, and narcolepsy, this article will focus on common disorders that affect the quantity of sleep, such as poor sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm disorders, and insomnia.
