## Question

What's the mechanism of action of Tadalafil?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tadalafil's mechanism of action across its indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology of PDE5 inhibition and cGMP signaling. Then, I should verify tissue distribution and how that maps to clinical effects. Next, I will examine the primary therapeutic mechanisms for erectile dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH. After that, I need to check selectivity versus off-target PDEs and the clinical implications. Finally, I will integrate pharmacokinetics, drug–drug interactions, and safety considerations to complete the picture.

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism. Tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5, which degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate; by blocking PDE5, tadalafil increases intracellular cGMP concentrations, thereby enhancing nitric oxide–mediated smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation in target tissues, which is foundational to its clinical effects across indications [^113Hcdym] [^112en98P].

> I need to verify tissue distribution next, because the clinical effects mirror where PDE5 is expressed. PDE5 is abundant in the corpus cavernosum, pulmonary vasculature, prostate, bladder, urethra, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, heart, liver, testis, seminal vesicle, and pancreas, which explains efficacy in ED, PAH, and LUTS/BPH and informs potential off-target effects in retina and other organs [^113Hcdym] [^112en98P].

> Now, for erectile dysfunction, let me think about the sequence precisely. Sexual stimulation triggers nitric oxide release from nerve endings and endothelium, NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase to generate cGMP, cGMP drives smooth muscle relaxation in penile arteries and trabeculae, increasing blood inflow and producing erection; PDE5 normally hydrolyzes cGMP and limits this response, so PDE5 inhibition preserves cGMP and augments erection, but only in the presence of sexual stimulation, which I should explicitly confirm, and yes, the label states there is no effect without stimulation [^113Hcdym] [^1127RobV].

> For pulmonary arterial hypertension, I should confirm the pathophysiology and therapeutic effect. PAH is characterized by impaired endothelial NO release and reduced cGMP in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle; PDE5 predominates in pulmonary vessels, so tadalafil's PDE5 inhibition increases cGMP, relaxes pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, lowers pulmonary vascular resistance, and improves hemodynamics and exercise capacity, with randomized trials showing meaningful gains in 6-minute walk distance at 40 mg daily [^112en98P] [^112nBr7t].

> For lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because the exact mechanism remains incompletely defined. I should double-check the leading hypotheses: increased cGMP promotes smooth muscle relaxation in prostate, bladder neck, and urethra; cGMP/PKG signaling may downregulate Rho-kinase activity and reduce smooth muscle tone; there may be improved pelvic organ perfusion; modulation of bladder afferent signaling; and anti-inflammatory effects within prostate tissue, all of which plausibly contribute to symptom improvement even though flow rates change little, and guideline panels endorse 5 mg daily tadalafil as a reasonable option for bothersome LUTS irrespective of ED status [^113Hcdym] [^115pgQGr] [^113PrDKM] [^113EtvMG].

> Next, I should review selectivity and off-target PDE interactions, because these drive adverse effects. Tadalafil is highly selective for PDE5 over PDE1, PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, and PDE7, with potency differentials exceeding 10,000-fold, which limits cardiac PDE3–mediated contractility concerns; however, there is modest cross-reactivity with PDE6 in the retina and PDE11 in multiple tissues including prostate and testis, with PDE6 inhibition linked to rare visual disturbances and PDE11 inhibition of uncertain clinical significance, though human data have not shown clear reproductive harm at therapeutic doses [^111Z4NMj] [^112en98P] [^114r4Qbk].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics to connect mechanism with clinical use. Tadalafil has a long terminal half-life around 15–17.5 hours in healthy subjects and even longer in PAH, supporting once-daily dosing and sustained cGMP augmentation; absorption is not affected by food, exposure increases approximately linearly with dose, and steady state is reached within about 5 days of daily dosing, which aligns with observed prolonged windows of erectile responsiveness up to 36 hours after a single dose [^113AAg2D] [^114H2aSv] [^1112ajkX].

> But wait, what about drug–drug interactions that could amplify effects or toxicity. I need to ensure I cover CYP3A4 and nitrates. Tadalafil is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A, so potent CYP3A inhibitors increase exposure and may necessitate dose adjustments, whereas clinical studies show negligible effects of tadalafil on CYP3A substrates; critically, coadministration with nitrates is contraindicated due to profound hypotension, with the interaction persisting at least 24 hours and often longer given tadalafil's half-life, so nitrates should be avoided during that interval [^115u4K6Q] [^117PDJn3].

> I should confirm key safety signals and monitoring. Common adverse effects reflect vasodilation and include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, flushing, and nasal congestion; rare but serious events include nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and sudden hearing loss, and patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease may be more sensitive to hypotensive effects, so careful assessment and counseling are warranted before prescribing [^115Sb5cV] [^114qxQeS] [^115EzmyW].

> Let me reconsider the mechanistic throughline to ensure coherence. Across ED, PAH, and LUTS/BPH, tadalafil's principal action is PDE5 inhibition with cGMP accumulation, translating into smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation in tissues where PDE5 is expressed; in ED this augments NO-driven erectile responses, in PAH it reduces pulmonary vascular resistance and improves exercise capacity, and in LUTS/BPH it likely modulates outlet resistance, afferent signaling, and prostatic inflammation, even as the precise dominant pathway remains under study [^113Hcdym] [^112en98P] [^115pgQGr].

---

Tadalafil works by **selectively inhibiting PDE5** [^113Hcdym], which degrades cGMP [^111Z4NMj]; this increases cGMP in vascular and smooth muscle, causing relaxation and vasodilation [^1127RobV]. In erectile tissue, this enhances NO-mediated smooth muscle relaxation and blood flow during sexual stimulation [^113Hcdym] [^111ToP1P]. In pulmonary arteries, it reduces vascular resistance and improves exercise capacity in PAH [^112nBr7t] [^116VJhQb]. In the lower urinary tract, it relaxes prostate and bladder smooth muscle, easing LUTS/BPH symptoms [^116oeEE9] [^113PrDKM]. Tadalafil is highly selective for PDE5 [^111Z4NMj], with minimal off-target effects, and requires sexual stimulation for erectile effects [^113Hcdym].

---

## Molecular mechanism of action

- **Target enzyme**: Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) [^113Hcdym], which hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP [^notfound].
- **Inhibition**: Tadalafil binds PDE5 and blocks cGMP degradation, increasing cGMP in vascular and smooth muscle [^113Hcdym] [^111Z4NMj].
- **Signal transduction**: Elevated cGMP activates PKG, which phosphorylates proteins that lower intracellular calcium and cause smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation [^111ToP1P] [^111QPeGL].

---

## Pharmacological effects in specific tissues

### Erectile tissue

In erectile tissue, **NO release** during sexual stimulation activates guanylate cyclase, increasing cGMP and causing smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow [^113Hcdym] [^111ToP1P]. PDE5 inhibition by tadalafil **preserves cGMP**, sustaining relaxation and enhancing erectile function [^113Hcdym] [^1127RobV].

---

### Pulmonary vasculature

In pulmonary vasculature, **pulmonary hypertension** reflects impaired NO/cGMP signaling and reduced cGMP in pulmonary smooth muscle [^112en98P]. Tadalafil increases cGMP, relaxes pulmonary vessels, lowers pulmonary vascular resistance, and improves exercise capacity [^112nBr7t] [^1156rJms].

---

### Lower urinary tract (prostate and bladder)

In the lower urinary tract, **smooth muscle tone** in the prostate and bladder contributes to LUTS/BPH [^notfound]. Tadalafil relaxes prostate and bladder smooth muscle, easing urinary symptoms [^113tGJqa] [^113ZjLQb].

---

## Selectivity and specificity

Tadalafil is **highly selective for PDE5** [^111Z4NMj], with minimal activity at PDE1–4, PDE6–11, reducing off-target effects [^112en98P].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Erectile dysfunction**: Improves erectile function with a long duration of action (up to 36 hours) [^116ZGNoK] [^115LGXcL].
- **Pulmonary arterial hypertension**: Improves exercise capacity and delays clinical worsening [^112nBr7t] [^1156rJms].
- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia**: Reduces urinary symptoms and improves quality of life [^115FiRPW].

## Mechanism of action and clinical effects

| **Tissue** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical effect** |
|-|-|-|
| Erectile tissue | PDE5 inhibition → ↑cGMP → smooth muscle relaxation | Improved erectile function |
| Pulmonary vasculature | PDE5 inhibition → ↑cGMP → vasodilation | Improved exercise capacity in PAH |
| Prostate/bladder | PDE5 inhibition → ↑cGMP → smooth muscle relaxation | Reduced LUTS in BPH |

---

Tadalafil's clinical effects stem from **PDE5 inhibition and cGMP elevation**, producing vasodilation and smooth muscle relaxation in erectile tissue, pulmonary vessels, and the lower urinary tract [^113Hcdym].

Background

The PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil is investigation for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Several clinical studies of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors have reported significant symptom reduction but limited urinary flow rate improvement. This manuscript reviews the published literature describing the pathophysiology of male LUTS, with an emphasis on mechanisms that may be modulated or improved by phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition.

Methods

Literature (through March 2010) was obtained via Medline searches and from the individual reviewers files. Articles were selected for review based on describing in vitro, preclinical, or clinical studies of pathological processes contributing to LUTS, or possible effects of PDE5 inhibition in the lower urinary tract.

Results

Major mechanisms contributing to LUTS include: reduced nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling; increased RhoA kinase pathway activity; autonomic overactivity; increased bladder afferent activity; and pelvic ischemia. Tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors have demonstrated beneficial effects on smooth muscle relaxation, smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation, nerve activity, and tissue perfusion that may impact LUTS in men.

Conclusions

The pathophysiology of male LUTS is complex and not completely understood. LUTS may occur independently of BPH or secondary to BPH but in both cases involve obstructive or irritative mechanisms with substantial pathophysiological overlap. While the precise mechanism remains unclear, inhibition of PDE5 seems to have an effect on several pathways that may impact LUTS.

### Tadalafil (Tadliq) [^111Z4NMj]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tadalafil is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium and consequent reduction of cGMP concentrations in the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle. PDE5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in relaxation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed.

Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, visceral smooth muscle, corpus cavernosum, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, and pancreas.

In vitro studies have shown that the effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. These studies have shown that tadalafil is > 10,000 times as potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, PDE4, and PDE7 enzymes, which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, leukocytes, skeletal muscle, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000 times as potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. Additionally, tadalafil is 700–fold as potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is > 9,000-fold as potent for PDE5 than for PDE8, PDE9, and PDE10. Tadalafil is 14 times as potent for PDE5 than for PDE11A1 and 40 times as potent for PDE5 than for PDE11A4, two of the four known forms of PDE11. PDE11 is an enzyme found in human prostate, testes, skeletal muscle and in other tissues. In vitro, tadalafil inhibits human recombinant PDE11A1 and, to a lesser degree, PDE11A4 activities at concentrations within the therapeutic range. The physiological role and clinical consequence of PDE11 inhibition in humans have not been defined.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tadalafil, a novel phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, in treatment of erectile dysfunction [^114ybcCi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Advances in molecular biology and protein chemistry, along with increasing understanding of the mechanisms of penile erection, have spurred development of pharmacologic approaches to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The next generation of oral agents includes tadalafil, a potent, highly selective phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor. In vitro studies have shown that tadalafil enhances relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle, and clinical trials have supported its efficacy and tolerability in a broad population of men with ED. The effect of tadalafil in enhancing the erectile response to sexual stimulation is relatively rapid in onset and lasts for ≥ 24 hours. The ability of patients with ED treated with tadalafil to achieve improved erectile function is demonstrated by significantly increased subjective measures of penetration ability, successful intercourse, and sexual satisfaction. Partners have expressed similar or higher levels of satisfaction with the results of treatment. Men with ED of psychogenic, organic, or mixed etiology and in a range from mild to severe have experienced significant improvment with tadalafil treatment. Response to treatment in men with diabetes has been robust and not affected by disease severity. Tadalafil has been well tolerated. Adverse events have generally been mild or moderate and have abated with continued treatment. Headache and dyspepsia have been most frequently reported. Changes in color vision have been rare (< 0.1%) with tadalafil across all clinical trials. Tadalafil appears to be a safe and effective treatment for men with ED.

### Finasteride and tadalafil (Entadfi) [^1153nrAU]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

ENTADFI is a combination of finasteride and tadalafil.

Finasteride:

The development and enlargement of the prostate gland is dependent on the potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Type II 5α-reductase metabolizes testosterone to DHT in the prostate gland, liver and skin. DHT induces androgenic effects by binding to androgen receptors in the cell nuclei of these organs.

Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase with which it slowly forms a stable enzyme complex. Turnover from this complex is extremely slow (t½~ 30 days). This has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor. In man, the 5α-reduced steroid metabolites in blood and urine are decreased after administration of finasteride.

Tadalafil:

The mechanism for reducing BPH symptoms has not been established. Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). PDE5 is found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, prostate, and bladder as well as in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, urethra, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, heart, liver, testis, seminal vesicle, and pancreas.

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor differentiation based on selectivity, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy profiles [^111ToP1P]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The mechanism of action of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (i.e., sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil) involves inhibition of the PDE5 isoenzyme located in penile vascular smooth muscle cells. Sexual stimulation triggers the release of nitric oxide (NO), stimulating the release of guanylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations, a decrease in intracellular calcium, and ultimately relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and penile erection. The PDE5 inhibitors have no effect on the penis in the absence of sexual stimulation. Although the various PDE5 inhibitors differ with respect to selectivity and pharmacokinetic profiles, efficacy and safety of these agents are comparable in broad populations of men with erectile dysfunction (ED), including those with diabetes or those taking multiple antihypertensive agents. The most frequently reported adverse events of the PDE5 inhibitors are related to their mild vasodilatory effects and include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and nasal congestion or rhinitis. Side effects are generally reversible and tend to diminish during continued treatment. Differences in pharmacokinetic properties among the PDE5 inhibitors include the fact that sildenafil and vardenafil have a shorter duration of action (approximately 4 h) compared with the longer period of responsiveness observed with tadalafil (up to 36 h). In addition, in the presence of high-fat food, absorption of sildenafil and vardenafil may be delayed; however, the rate and extent of tadalafil absorption are unaffected by high-fat food.

### Do vardenafil and tadalafil have advantages over sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction? [^112GTZFH]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2006). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects up to 50% of men between the ages of 40 and 70 years of age. Sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil have all been shown to be similarly effective in the treatment of men with ED of vary etiologies, to have similar adverse effects profiles, and to improve quality-of-life by similar amounts. As these phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors all increase the hypotensive effects of nitrates, they are not suitable for use in patients taking nitrates for the treatment of ischaemic heart disease. All three inhibitors must be used with caution in patients taking alpha(1)-adrenoceptors antagonists for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although nonarteritic anterior ischaemic neuropathy has been reported in some users of the PDE5 inhibitors, there is no conclusive evidence that PDE5 inhibitors cause this rare effect. Tadalafil has a longer half-life than sildenafil or vardenafil, and a longer duration of action than sildenafil and vardenafil. Most preference studies have shown tadalafil to be preferred, but there are serious limitations to some of these studies. One approach to treatment is to give each patient a short- and long-acting agent, and for individuals to decide their preference.

### The association of tadalafil exposure with lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in a general population of men with erectile dysfunction [^112qU338]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths of this study include the large database, the length of follow‐up, the adjustment for confounding risk factors and medicines. Weaknesses include the retrospective nature of the study, the possibility of unknown confounding variables and the unknown issue of whether the drug conferred direct benefit or whether sexual activity promoted by the drug led to a benefit. However, in one previous study, while PDE5 inhibitors were associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events, another drug that is used to treat ED (alprostadil) did not have a benefit on cardiac outcomes, suggesting that the PDE5 inhibitors themselves had a cardioprotective effect. However, alprostadil is a local injectable drug, typically used intermittently and likely in men with more severe ED; so, the comparison between alprostadil and more chronic use of PDE‐5 inhibitors should be considered as exploratory. Another weakness of our study is that we did not compare tadalafil directly with short acting agents in the class of drugs of PDE‐5 inhibitors. Such a comparison would be worth pursuing in future studies, but was beyond the scope of our current study and central hypothesis, which was limited to tadalafil exposure versus no tadalafil exposure.

A crucial next step is the design of prospective, randomized, controlled studies to further explore this potential benefit in men and women and clinical applications. Our study was not designed to determine the mechanism of action of the benefit of tadalafil. However, several theories have been proposed to explain the potential cardioprotective effects of the PDE‐5 inhibitors. These include an improvement in endothelial function, vasodilation of systemic blood vessels resulting in small reductions in blood pressure and afterload, a direct protective effect on myocardial cells, an anti‐inflammatory property, and an antiplatelet effect. Future studies are needed to further explore the mechanism/s whereby PDE‐5 inhibitors may have cardioprotective effects.

### Macitentan and tadalafil (Opsynvi) [^117CktRM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Macitentan

Endothelin (ET)-1 and its receptors (ETA and ETB) mediate a variety of deleterious effects, such as vasoconstriction, fibrosis, proliferation, hypertrophy, and inflammation. In disease conditions such as PAH, the local ET system is upregulated and is involved in vascular hypertrophy and in organ damage.

Macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist that inhibits the binding of ET-1 to both ETA and ETB receptors. Macitentan displays high affinity and sustained occupancy of the ET receptors in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. One of the metabolites of macitentan is also pharmacologically active at the ET receptors and is estimated to be about 20% as potent as the parent drug in vitro. The clinical impact of dual endothelin blockage is unknown.

Tadalafil

Tadalafil is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). PAH is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium and consequent reduction of cGMP concentrations in the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle. PDE5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in relaxation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed.

Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in corpus cavernosum, vascular smooth muscle, visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, PDE4 and PDE7, enzymes which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, an enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also > 9,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE8, PDE9 and PDE10.

### Effect of long and short half-life PDE5 inhibitors on HbA1c levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125cs5p]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, owing to their mechanism of action, have been gaining recognition as a potential case of drug repurposing and combination therapy for diabetes treatment. We aimed to examine the effect of long and short half-life PDE5 inhibitors have on Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with elevated HbA1c (> 6%) to assess mean difference in HbA1c levels from baseline versus controls after any PDE5 inhibitor intervention of ≥ 4 weeks, excluding multiple interventions. Cochrane CENTRAL, PMC Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were searched without language restrictions up to September 30, 2024. Summary data from published data were extracted. PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines used to extract and assess data using a random-effects meta-analysis. This study is registered with the Research Registry, reviewregistry1733.

Findings

Among 1096 studies identified, in analysis of 13 studies with 1083 baseline patients, long half-life PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil, PF-00489791) had decreases in HbA1c while short half-life PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, avanafil) had no change. Five (38.5%) studies had a low risk of bias, and eight (61.5%) had some concerns. Long half-life inhibitors had significant mean decrease of -0.40% ([-0.66, -0.14], p = 0.002, I² = 82%, 7.70% baseline HbA1c). Short half-life inhibitors had insignificant mean difference of +0.08% ([-0.16, 0.33], p = 0.51, I² = 40%, 7.73% baseline HbA1c). In ≥ 8-week trials with participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and mean HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, long half-life inhibitors had significant mean decrease of -0.50% ([-0.83, -0.17], I² = 88%, p = 0.003); short half-life inhibitors had significant mean increase of +0.36% ([0.03, 0.68], I² = 3%, p = 0.03).

Interpretation

At the well-controlled HbA1c of the participants, previous literature shows current diabetes treatments have similar HbA1c decreases, so the HbA1c mean difference of long half-life PDE5 inhibitors may indeed be clinically relevant. This suggests future investigation into PDE5 inhibitors as part of combination therapy or as therapy for high HbA1c individuals is needed, especially because of variable risk of biases, homogeneity, and sample sizes in our study.

### Tadalafil [^113Hcdym]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Tadalafil inhibits PDE5. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.

The effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP concentration in the corpus cavernosum and pulmonary arteries is also observed in the smooth muscle of the prostate, the bladder and their vascular supply. The mechanism for reducing BPH symptoms has not been established.

Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, prostate, and bladder as well as in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, urethra, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, heart, liver, testis, seminal vesicle, and pancreas.

### The role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor therapy [^112mrspP]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2006). Low credibility.

Differences in clinical pharmacology of the currently marketed phosphodiesterase (PDE)5 inhibitors sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil are largely determined by their pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and their PDE5 inhibitory activity profile. This review outlines the basic concepts of pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships and their relevance to dose selection and applied pharmacotherapy. It is followed by a detailed comparative discussion on the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationship of the currently available PDE5 inhibitors, including known drug-drug interactions and dosage adjustments in special populations. The review is aimed at providing a critical assessment of the pharmacokinetics of PDE5 inhibitors, which may assist clinicians in tailoring drug and/or treatment regimens to the unique needs of each individual patient with erectile dysfunction.

### Latest evidence on the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115pgQGr]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Several preclinical reports, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and posthoc analyses corroborate the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) in the treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE).

Objective

Update of the latest evidence on the mechanisms of action, evaluate the current meta-analyses, and emphasize the results of pooled data analyses of PDE5-Is in LUTS/BPE.

Evidence Acquisition

Literature analysis of basic researches on PDE5-Is, systematic literature search in PubMed and Scopus until May 2015 on reviews of trials on PDE5-Is, and collection of pooled data available on tadalafil 5mg.

Evidence Synthesis

Latest evidences on the pathophysiology of LUTS/BPE has provided the rationale for use of PDE5-Is: (1) improvement of LUT oxygenation, (2) smooth muscle relaxation, (3) negative regulation of proliferation and transdifferentiation of LUT stroma, (4) reduction of bladder afferent nerve activity, and (5) down-regulation of prostate inflammation are the proven mechanisms of action of PDE5-Is. Data from eight systematic reviews demonstrated that PDE5-Is allow to improve LUTS (International Prostate Symptom Score mean difference vs placebo: 2.35–4.21) and erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function mean difference vs placebo: 2.25–5.66), with negligible change in flow rate (Qmax mean difference vs placebo: 0.01–1.43). Pooled data analyses revealed that tadalafil 5mg once daily allows the clinically-meaningful improvement of LUTS and nocturnal voiding frequency independent of both erectile dysfunction severity and improvement.

Conclusions

PDE5-Is are safe and effective in improving both LUTS and erectile function in appropriately selected men with LUTS/BPE. Data on the reduction of disease progression, long-term outcomes, and cost-effectiveness analyses are still lacking.

Patient Summary

We reviewed recent literature on phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with prostatic enlargement. We found evidence to confirm that phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are a valid treatment option for men affected by bothersome urinary symptoms with or without erectile dysfunction.

### Effect of long and short half-life PDE5 inhibitors on HbA1c levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113C8XJP]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, owing to their mechanism of action, have been gaining recognition as a potential case of drug repurposing and combination therapy for diabetes treatment. We aimed to examine the effect of long and short half-life PDE5 inhibitors have on Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with elevated HbA1c (> 6%) to assess mean difference in HbA1c levels from baseline versus controls after any PDE5 inhibitor intervention of ≥ 4 weeks, excluding multiple interventions. Cochrane CENTRAL, PMC Medline, and WHO ICTRP were searched without language restrictions up to September 30, 2024. Summary data from published data were extracted. PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines used to extract and assess data using a random-effects meta-analysis. This study is registered with the Research Registry, reviewregistry1733.

Findings

Among 1096 studies identified, in analysis of 13 studies with 1083 baseline patients, long half-life PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil, PF-00489791) had decreases in HbA1c while short half-life PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, avanafil) had no change. Five (38.5%) studies had a low risk of bias, and eight (61.5%) had some concerns. Long half-life inhibitors had significant mean decrease of −0.40% ([−0.66, −0.14], p = 0.002, I² = 82%, 7.70% baseline HbA1c). Short half-life inhibitors had insignificant mean difference of +0.08% ([−0.16, 0.33], p = 0.51, I² = 40%, 7.73% baseline HbA1c). In ≥ 8-week trials with participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and mean HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, long half-life inhibitors had significant mean decrease of −0.50% ([−0.83, −0.17], I² = 88%, p = 0.003); short half-life inhibitors had significant mean increase of +0.36% ([0.03, 0.68], I² = 3%, p = 0.03).

Interpretation

At the well-controlled HbA1c of the participants, previous literature shows current diabetes treatments have similar HbA1c decreases, so the HbA1c mean difference of long half-life PDE5 inhibitors may indeed be clinically relevant. This suggests future investigation into PDE5 inhibitors as part of combination therapy or as therapy for high HbA1c individuals is needed, especially because of variable risk of biases, homogeneity, and sample sizes in our study.

### Tadalafil [^113AAg2D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Over a dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg, tadalafil exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose in healthy subjects. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 5 days of once per day dosing and exposure is approximately 1.6-fold greater than after a single dose. Mean tadalafil concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 20 mg and single and once daily multiple doses of 5 mg, from a separate study, (see Figure 4) to healthy male subjects are depicted in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Plasma tadalafil concentrations (mean ± SD) following a single 20-mg tadalafil dose and single and once daily multiple doses of 5 mg

Absorption — After single oral-dose administration, the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of tadalafil is achieved between 30 minutes and 6 hours (median time of 2 hours). Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined.

The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food; thus tadalafil tablets may be taken with or without food.

Distribution — The mean apparent volume of distribution following oral administration is approximately 63 L, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins.

Results

Study selection

Figure 1 shows the literature search process in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and SCOPUS (March 2012 to December 2013 and updated in May 2014). We identified 9,168 studies as potentially relevant. Of these, 8,727 were excluded based on title and abstract content and 417/441 were excluded after full text analysis due to: non-English language, non-human studies, not RCTs, no outcome of interest, PDE5i co-administered with other drugs. RCTs with PDE5i given on demand or for less than 30 consecutive days were excluded. A total of 24 RCTs were eligible and included in the review (18 administering sildenafil, 4 tadalafil and 2 vardenafil).

### Tadalafil (Cialis) [^1127RobV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Tadalafil inhibits PDE5. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.

The effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP concentration in the corpus cavernosum and pulmonary arteries is also observed in the smooth muscle of the prostate, the bladder and their vascular supply. The mechanism for reducing BPH symptoms has not been established.

Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, prostate, and bladder as well as in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, urethra, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, heart, liver, testis, seminal vesicle, and pancreas.

### Tadalafil to improve cutaneous flap perfusion in smokers: a case series and literature review [^113Vobym]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The viability of cutaneous flaps and grafts is dependent on adequate circulation and perfusion. Smoking, excessive tension or pressure, arterial insufficiency, and venous congestion are factors that can contribute to flap failure due to poor perfusion. Early identification of tissue ischemia and its intervention can improve flap survival. Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that increases blood flow by vasodilation of the peripheral vasculature as well as inhibition of platelet aggregation. Although current indications for tadalafil by the US Food and Drug Administration are for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, its mechanism of action is theoretically beneficial in increasing blood perfusion in patients who are at risk of flap or graft ischemia due to poor circulation. The following case series presents the successful off-label use of tadalafil in preventing tissue ischemia in high-risk patients and treating patients with early signs of tissue necrosis.

### Effect of tadalafil on cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated clearance: studies in vitro and in vivo [^1173Ppta]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Tadalafil was examined in vitro and in vivo for its ability to affect human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-mediated metabolism.

Methods

Reversible and mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A by tadalafil was examined in human liver microsomes. The ability of tadalafil to influence CYP3A activity was also examined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. The effect of tadalafil on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A probe substrates was evaluated in human volunteers before and after coadministration with either a single dose or multiple doses of tadalafil (10 or 20 mg).

Results

Negligible competitive inhibition of CYP3A was observed in vitro. Mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A was detected, albeit with a low potency. In human hepatocytes, exposure to 1 micromol/L or greater of tadalafil resulted in increased CYP3A protein expression; however, as with a combined effect of induction and inhibition, a corresponding increase in CYP3A activity did not occur. The clinical pharmacokinetics of midazolam and lovastatin, probe substrates of CYP3A, were unaffected by up to 14 days of tadalafil administration (90% confidence intervals for the ratio of least squares means for the pharmacokinetic parameters of tadalafil were contained within the no-effect boundaries of 0.7 to 1.43).

Conclusions

In vitro results suggested that tadalafil would have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical studies demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of 2 different CYP3A substrates, midazolam and lovastatin, were virtually unchanged after tadalafil coadministration. Thus therapeutic concentrations of tadalafil do not produce clinically significant changes in the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A.

### Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic overview of low-dose daily administration of tadalafil [^114jjkp7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are commercially available for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Development of the first once-daily alternative dosing regimen with a PDE5 inhibitor was motivated by the behavioral complexities associated with sexual intimacy.

Aim

To provide an alternative dosing option for certain men who may benefit from the removal of the temporal linkage between administration of an ED therapy and sexual intimacy or for men and their partners who anticipate at least twice-weekly sexual activity.

Methods

Pharmacokinetic predictions of tadalafil plasma concentrations were generated based upon empirical data following 20-mg, single-dose administration coupled with tadalafil usage patterns from as-needed clinical trials. To support the pharmacokinetic simulations and pharmacodynamic assumptions, clinical trials were conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of once-daily, low-dose tadalafil 2.5 and 5 mg.

Main Outcome Measures

Simulated tadalafil plasma concentrations and comparison with safety and efficacy measures from clinical trials.

Results

Based upon pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data, once-daily doses of tadalafil 5 mg were predicted to provide therapeutic concentrations that would be maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. Additionally, for a subgroup of men who anticipate at least twice-weekly sexual activity and are currently taking tadalafil 20 mg, a reduction in daily tadalafil exposure was predicted. To support the hypothesis that low-dose, once-daily tadalafil may be a safe and effective treatment alternative, clinical trials were conducted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of once-daily tadalafil 2.5 and 5 mg. These results were similar to those of historical as-needed studies evaluating tadalafil 10 and 20 mg.

Conclusions

Consistent with pharmacokinetic predictions, data from clinical trials indicate that once-daily use of low-dose tadalafil is a safe and effective treatment for men with ED.

### Tadalafil: a long-acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115GWBiA]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Objective

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic properties, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, and dosage and administration of tadalafil in patients with PAH.

Methods

A literature search of MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1960 through September 5, 2010) was conducted with the search terms tadalafil, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. Data found from orignial research and case series published in English were screened for relevancy to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety, and tolerability. Relevant articles from the bibliographies of the identified published articles were also obtained. Unpublished data and posters were obtained from the manufacturer of tadalafil and the FDA Web site.

Results

By selectively inhibiting PDE-5, tadalafil causes nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature. Tadalafil has a greater affinity (10,000-fold) for PDE-5 compared with the other PDE inhibitors and has a t(½) of 17.5 hours. In a controlled clinical study in patients with PAH, patients receiving tadalafil in a total daily dose of 40 mg had significant improvements in their 6-minute walk distance (33 m from baseline) and time to clinical worsening compared with those receiving placebo (both, P < 0.05). Tadalafil had adverse effects similar to placebo, with headache being the most commonly reported (42%).

Conclusions

In the small number of studies available, tadalafil was effective and well tolerated when used to treat patients with PAH. Compared with placebo, tadalafil was associated with significant improvements in exercise capacity and reduced time to clinical worsening (68% relative risk reduction; P = 0.038). There is limited evidence comparing tadalafil with sildenafil and vardenafil, and the studies are limited by short treatment durations.

### Phosphodiesterase 11 (PDE11): is it a player in human testicular function? [^114r4Qbk]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

PDE11, the newest member of the PDE family of phosphodiesterases, has become the center of controversy. Four splice variants were recently identified, PDE11A1–4. Historical data have suggested that PDE11A3 is found in the testis while PDE11A4 is found in the prostate. The controversial issue is the inhibition of PDE11 by tadalafil. In the light of tadalafil's commercial success, its inhibition of PDE11A has been the subject of heated debate. A variety of published reports addressed this issue, suggesting that the target organ of tadalafil's inhibition, the testis, is not adversely affected. Daily tadalafil given to healthy volunteers did not alter semen analysis parameters or blood hormonal parameters, seemingly mitigating the clinical effect of the PDE11 inhibition. However, two recent papers published in this journal have added fuel to this proverbial fire. In this perspective, Sharron Francis, a noted PDE expert, and a co-author of one of the recent papers mentioned above, sheds further light on this contested topic.

### Effect of low-dose tadalafil once daily on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and erectile dysfunction: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^111auJCc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complication of diabetes that is underdiagnosed and mostly left untreated. Based on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, the prevalence of ED is estimated to be > 50% in men with diabetes and approximately 3.5 times higher in men with diabetes than in those without. Diabetic ED involves vascular and neurological mechanisms. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a significant role in normal penile erection, and a lack of NO in diabetes triggers ED. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors selectively block the hydrolysis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the penile corpus cavernosum, thus enhancing NO-mediated smooth muscle relaxation, increasing blood flow to the penis, and facilitating erection. PDE-5 inhibitors result in increased levels of cGMP and NO. Exploratory studies have reported beneficial effects of PDE-5 inhibitors on ED in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, or both. Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with the development of endothelial dysfunction and a reduction in NO bioavailability. In humans, endothelial dysfunction is linked with diabetes mellitus via a mechanism that interrupts intracellular signaling pathways of insulin and NO production. Endothelial NO mediates the insulin-induced effects by increasing intracellular levels of cGMP in human vascular smooth muscle cells. The increase in glucose transport is stimulated by insulin via the endothelium-derived NO/cGMP pathway. Reduced NO synthesis in endothelial cells contributes to impaired insulin action in patients with T2D. Therefore, treatments that amplify NO/cGMP signaling could improve microvascular recruitment and muscle glucose uptake. Moreover, recent evidence from animal models and in men with ED suggests that PDE-5 inhibition may have metabolic benefits. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of PDE-5 inhibitors studies showed little benefit in improving glycemic control.

### Phosphodiesterase inhibition in cognitive decline [^1157j1Mw]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Understanding the cellular and molecular processes involved in learning and memory will help in the development of safe and effective cognitive enhancers. The cAMP response element-binding (CREB) may be a universal modulator of processes required for memory formation, and increasing the levels of second messengers like cAMP and cGMP could ultimately lead to CREB activation. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors regulate signaling pathways by elevating cAMP and/or cGMP levels, and they have been demonstrated to improve learning and memory in a number of rodent models of impaired cognition. The aim of this review is to summarize the outstanding progress that has been made in the application of PDE inhibitors for memory dysfunction. In addition, we have introduced some recent data we generated demonstrating that tadalafil could be considered as an optimal candidate for drug re-positioning and as a good candidate to enhance cognition.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction: the best of both worlds [^117Nn1kM]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are established as first-line therapy in erectile dysfunction. There is emerging evidence that they may have a role in treating patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) from benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Recent Findings

All three commonly used PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil) appear to improve LUTS as measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score. However, to date, no change in urinary flow rates have been demonstrated.

Summary

Erectile dysfunction and LUTS frequently coexist in men of advancing age. There appears to be an emerging role for PDE-5 inhibitors as a treatment for both conditions. Further studies are required to elicit the exact mechanism of action in LUTS.

### The association of tadalafil exposure with lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in a general population of men with erectile dysfunction [^112ozsku]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The phosphodiesterase‐5 inhibitors (PDE‐5is) have been shown to be effective for treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Recent retrospective studies have suggested that PDE‐5i use may be associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality, especially in subgroups of men with diabetes; some have suggested a dose effect. Most studies have not focused on a single PDE‐5i in a general population of men with ED. If exposure is an important feature, then we would predict that a long acting PDE‐5i, such as tadalafil (17.5‐hour half‐life) may have a pronounced association between exposure and lower rates of MACE. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between tadalafil use and the extent of exposure with cardiovascular outcomes (MACE: composite of cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, unstable angina, heart failure, and stroke) and mortality from any cause in men with ED.

Tadalafil

Tadalafil is another PDE-5 inhibitor that has been studied for the treatment of PAH. Tadalafil has the same mechanism of action as sildenafil. However, tadalafil's longer half-life (around 18 hours compared with 4 hours) has led some investigators to consider it a suitable alternative to sildenafil. Tadalafil's longer half-life means it can be given once daily, whereas sildenafil is usually given three times daily; as a result, patient adherence may be greater with tadalafil than with sildenafil. Also, in terms of adverse effects, tadalafil is more selective for PDE-5, while sildenafil also inhibits other phosphodiesterases, which may result in increased risk of adverse events such as visual disturbances, flushing and tachycardia.

Mukhopadhyay et al studied the effects of tadalafil over a 12-week period in 16 patients with PAH-CHD. 6MWD increased by 12.50% and PVR decreased by 31.21%; WHO FC improved by at least one class in all 16 patients. No patient experienced any adverse events.

Vardenafil

Vardenafil is the third major PDE-5 inhibitor. Unlike sildenafil and tadalafil, vardenafil is not currently approved for the treatment of PAH. Vardenafil was shown to improve 6MWD and CI, while decreasing PVR and mPAP in a 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with PAH. No studies exist to evaluate vardenafil's role in the management of PAH-CHD.

### Efficacy and safety of tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: results of integrated analyses [^116KQV7d]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We conducted integrated analyses of the efficacy and safety of tadalafil, a potent, selective phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

A total of 1,112 men with a mean age of 59 years (range 22 to 82) and mild to severe erectile dysfunction of various etiologies were randomized to placebo or tadalafil, taken as needed without food or alcohol restrictions, at fixed daily doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg up to a maximum of once daily [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] in 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials lasting 12 weeks. The 3 co-primary outcomes were changes from baseline in the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function and the proportion of "yes" responses to questions 2 and 3 of the Sexual Encounter Profile. Additional efficacy instruments included a Global Assessment Question.

Results

Compared with placebo, tadalafil significantly enhanced all efficacy outcomes. Patients receiving 20 mg. tadalafil experienced a significant mean improvement of 7.9 in International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain score from baseline (p < 0.001 versus placebo), 75% of intercourse attempts (Sexual Encounter Profile question 3, a secondary efficacy outcome) were successfully completed (p < 0.001 versus placebo) and 81% reported improved erections at end point compared with 35% in the control group (p < 0.001). Tadalafil was consistently efficacious across disease severities and etiologies, as well as in patients of all ages. Tadalafil was well tolerated, and headache and dyspepsia were the most frequent adverse events.

Conclusions

Tadalafil was effective and well tolerated in this patient population.

### PDE5 inhibitors beyond erectile dysfunction [^113ZWke9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

The phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5) inhibitors sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil are widely used first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED). Since the advent of sildenafil in 1998, more than 40 million men worldwide have been successfully treated with these compounds. The safety and high tolerability of PDE5 inhibitors make them an attractive tool to investigate further physiological functions of PDE5, for example the modulation of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) pools. As cGMP is a key component of intracellular signaling this may provide novel therapeutic opportunities beyond ED even for indications in which chronic administration is necessary. The approval of sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in 2005 was a notable success in this area of research. A number of other potential new indications are currently in various phases of preclinical research and development. In recent years, extensive but very heterogeneous information has been published in this field. The aim of this review is to summarize existing preclinical and clinical knowledge and critically discuss the evidence to support potential future indications for PDE5 inhibitors.

### The efficacy of tadalafil daily vs on demand in the treatment of erectile dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114a6GoP]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

We present a review comparing the use of tadalafil daily vs on-demand for erectile dysfunction. We examined randomized controlled trials and observational studies that examined the use of tadalafil for at least 8 weeks of follow-up with the primary outcome of International Index for Erectile Dysfunction-Erectile Function domain. Eight studies that examined the desired dosing regimens were identified. Of these, 6 studies included the primary end point of 12 weeks. Those patients taking tadalafil daily for 12 weeks scored on average 1.82 points higher in International Index for Erectile Dysfunction-Erectile Function domain scores, although the difference may not be clinically significant (Fig. 1).

### Effect of long and short half-life PDE5 inhibitors on HbA1c levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116myfxN]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Thus, the indirect mean difference between long half-life PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. tadalafil and PF-00489791) and short half-life PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil and avanafil) stands at 0.58% (6.4 mmol/mol) in overall analysis and 0.86% (9.3 mmol/mol) in subgroup analysis, though this relationship would best be directly tested with RCTs. These results suggest long half-life PDE5 inhibitors as a potential drug choice. This disparity can be deemed clinically significant among patients with diabetes having an average baseline HbA1c of 7% (53 mmol/mol) levels under single drug treatmentand will be investigated further.

The only available tadalafil RCT with high baseline HbA1c levels is Hegazy 2024 which shows far more significant drug effect at a baseline of near 10%, having a statistically significant HbA1c decrease with a mean difference of −2.81% (+30.7 mmol/mol, 95% CI [−3.88%, −1.74%], 95% CI [−42.5 mmol/mol, −19.0 mmol/mol], p = 0.03). We also found that the only available tadalafil non-RCT with high baseline A1c levels was a case seriesalso having baseline A1c levels near 10%, with a mean difference of −2.26% (−24.7 mmol/mol, 95% CI [−3.03%, −1.49%], 95% CI [−33.1 mmol/mol, −16.3 mmol/mol], p < 0.00001) (Fig. 2 f). Both of these trails align with expected effect of current diabetes medication (Fig. 2 e). Therefore, this outcome underscores the importance for the clinical research community to explore the drug effects of long half-life PDE5 inhibitors in patients with higher HbA1c levels. Furthermore, with a mechanism that differs from many front-line diabetes medication, long half-life PDE5 inhibitors are a potential candidate for combination therapy. Hence, these results advocate for the inclusion of long half-life PDE5 inhibitors in patients with high HbA1c levels to optimise their conditions through combination therapy and a multi-faceted approach for maximal reduction of HbA1c levels.

Tadalafil in PAH — randomized placebo-controlled trial findings on 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and functional class (FC): A placebo-controlled trial randomized 405 patients with PAH to placebo or tadalafil 2.5, 10, 20, or 40 mg once daily for 16 weeks, with approximately one-half treatment naive and one-half on background ETRA. The primary outcome, a P < .01 difference in placebo-adjusted increase in 6MWD at 16 weeks, was met only in the highest-dose group; the mean placebo-corrected increase in 6MWD was 33 m for patients receiving 40 mg once daily, with mean increases of 24 m in WHO FC I or II and 36 m in WHO FC II or IV. There were no differences in the proportions with improved or worsened WHO FC between tadalafil and placebo, and there were fewer clinical worsening events in the 40 mg daily tadalafil group (with events defined on-page), predominantly due to fewer worsened WHO FC events.

14.2 Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for ED

The efficacy and safety of tadalafil tablets for once daily use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction has been evaluated in 2 clinical trials of 12-weeks duration and 1 clinical trial of 24-weeks duration, involving a total of 853 patients. Tadalafil tablets, when taken once daily, was shown to be effective in improving erectile function in men with erectile dysfunction (ED).

Tadalafil tablets were studied in the general ED population in 2 randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm design, primary efficacy and safety studies of 12-and 24-weeks duration, respectively. One of these studies was conducted in the United States and one was conducted in centers outside the US. An additional efficacy and safety study was performed in ED patients with diabetes mellitus. Tadalafil tablets were taken once daily at doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg. Food and alcohol intake were not restricted. Timing of sexual activity was not restricted relative to when patients took tadalafil tablets.

Results in General ED Population — The primary US efficacy and safety trial included a total of 287 patients, with a mean age of 59 years (range 25 to 82 years). The population was 86% White, 6% Black, 6% Hispanic, and 2% of other ethnicities, and included patients with ED of various severities, etiologies (organic, psychogenic, mixed), and with multiple co-morbid conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other cardiovascular disease. Most (> 96%) patients reported ED of at least 1-year duration.

### Overview of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition in erectile dysfunction [^116FEmci]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Since the early 1980s, research on the mechanisms of penile erection has done much to clarify erectile physiology and pathophysiology. More recent studies have identified the importance of neurochemical mediators in erection. These include the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) cell-signaling system-a complex molecular pathway that mediates smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inactivates cGMP, which terminates nitric oxide-cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. Inhibition of PDE5 is expected to enhance penile erection by preventing cGMP degradation. Development of pharmacologic agents with this effect has closely paralleled the emerging science. The prototype of this new therapeutic class of PDE5 inhibitors is sildenafil, which was approved for treatment of erectile dysfunction in 1998. Tadalafil and vardenafil are new agents in this class. These agents have demonstrated improvement in erectile function and have been shown to be well tolerated in diverse populations comprising thousands of men worldwide. Profiles of these 3 PDE5 inhibitors are reviewed herein.

Dose-Response Relationship

Dose-response relationships, between 20 mg and 40 mg, were not observed for 6-minute walk distance or pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in subjects with PAH in the placebo-controlled study. Median change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance was 32 meters and 35 meters at 16 weeks in subjects receiving 20 mg and 40 mg daily, respectively. Mean change from baseline PVR was -254 dynes*sec*cm⁻⁵and -209 dynes*sec*cm⁻⁵at 16 weeks in patients receiving 20 mg and 40 mg daily, respectively.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Over a dose range of 2.5 to 20 mg, tadalafil exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose in healthy subjects. In PAH patients administered between 20 and 40 mg of tadalafil, an approximately 50% greater AUC was observed indicating a less than proportional increase in exposure over the entire dose range of 2.5 to 40 mg. During tadalafil 20 and 40 mg once daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations were attained within 5 days, and exposure was approximately 30% higher than after a single dose.

Absorption — After single oral-dose administration, the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of tadalafil is achieved between 2 and 8 hours (median time of 4 hours). Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined.

The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food; thus, TADLIQ may be taken with or without food.

Distribution — The mean apparent volume of distribution following oral administration is approximately 77 L, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins.

Metabolism — Tadalafil is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A to a catechol metabolite. The catechol metabolite undergoes extensive methylation and glucuronidation to form the methylcatechol and methylcatechol glucuronide conjugate, respectively. The major circulating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. Methylcatechol concentrations are less than 10% of glucuronide concentrations. In vitro data suggests that metabolites are not expected to be pharmacologically active at observed metabolite concentrations.

### Erectile dysfunction and heart failure: the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors [^113gSseu]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the release of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, in March 1998, this class of medicines has become the first line of therapy for millions of men with erectile dysfunction (ED). 1 In 2003, vardenafil and tadalafil were added to the list of approved PDE-5 inhibitors. The mechanism of action of PDE-5 inhibitors is well understood, and their efficacy in treating ED is well established. 2 However, the role of PDE-5 inhibitors as potential therapy for other diseases is still under investigation. The three PDE-5 inhibitors each reduce endothelial dysfunction. 3, 4, 5, 6 As a result of the endothelial dysfunction that can occur with some types of ED, links between cardiovascular diseases and ED have been discovered. 7, 8 ED is associated with coronary artery disease, 9 hypertension 10 and now heart failure (HF). 11

The goal of this review is to describe the prevalence of ED in HF patients, causes of ED specific to patients with HF, the cardiac risk assessment of sexual activity, the safety of PDE-5 inhibitors to treat ED in HF patients, the efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitors for ED in HF patients, the hemodynamic effects of PDE-5 inhibitors on HF, the potential mechanisms by which PDE-5 inhibitors improve HF and role of PDE-5 inhibitors in pulmonary hypertension.

### Molecular mechanisms that could contribute to prolonged effectiveness of PDE5 inhibitors to improve erectile function [^116XZSE5]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in penile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) plays a key role in promoting penile erection. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) in VSMC breaks down cGMP to counter this effect. Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis), treatments for erectile dysfunction, inhibit PDE5 action. Many men with erectile dysfunction have improved erectile function after plasma inhibitor concentration falls below therapeutic levels. Maximum effect plus onset and duration of action of inhibitor determines its efficacy. The rate and extent of cellular drug accumulation and efflux of drug from smooth muscle cells plus persistence of drug effects in these cell impact these parameters. We propose possible molecular mechanisms that could account for prolonged action of PDE5 inhibitors including (1) persistence of biochemical effects after inhibitor is cleared from cells, and (2) retention of drug in VSMC beyond plasma clearance.

### Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and the heart: compound cardioprotection? [^111QPeGL]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Progression of heart failure (HF) is driven in part by maladaptive responses of cardiac muscle to pathological stress. There is growing evidence that stimulation of a signalling pathway within cardiac myocytes, the cyclic GMP (cGMP)–protein kinase-G (PKG) axis, dampens these cardiac stress responses, and its activation can attenuate pathological hypertrophy, protect against ischaemic injury and enhance cell survival. One means of potentiating cGMP–PKG is by inhibiting the degradation of cytosolic cGMP by phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5, figure 1). PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5is) such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra) have proven efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Underlying their utility in both conditions is a well-defined action on the vasculature through enhancement of cGMP derived from nitric oxide (NO), leading to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and vasodilatation. With discovery that PDE5 is also expressed in cardiac muscle and upregulated in hypertrophy and failure, attention has shifted towards direct myocardial effects of PDE5is.

Figure 1
Cyclic nucleotide signalling in cardiac myocytes and its relation to contraction and arrhythmias. (A) Competing effects of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) within the cardiac myocyte. Sildenafil (left side) inhibits phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) leading to the accumulation of cGMP within the cell. cGMP activates protein kinase-G (PKG) resulting in phosphorylation of the L-type Ca 2+ channel and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). These effects are negatively inotropic. cAMP (right), for example, following stimulation of β 1 -adrenoceptors and β 2 -adrenoceptors by epinephrine, activates PKA leading to positive inotropic and proarrhythmic actions. In addition, there is also potential for crosstalk between the two axes; cGMP can inhibit phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) to increase cAMP. (B) Excitation–contraction coupling in the cardiac myocyte. Opening of L-type Ca channels (LTCC) during the action potential lead to influx of Ca and stimulation of Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), initiating myofilament contraction. (C) Overload of the SR, as occurs in HF and under β 1 -adrenergic and β 2 -adrenergic stimulation, leads to spontaneous Ca waves, which activate Na + –Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) channels to cause after depolarisations and triggered arrhythmias.

### A phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trial of tadalafil for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^113ecDSu]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

A short-term dosing study conducted in boys with DMD 8 to 13 years of age taking corticosteroids informed the tadalafil doses for this clinical trial. Tadalafil improved blood flow regulation in exercising forearm muscle in a dose-dependent manner without affecting blood flow in resting forearm muscle. The oral tadalafil was dosed short term at 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg (approximating maximum adult doses for erectile dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension, respectively). For transition to once-daily administration in the trial, doses are 30% lower because tadalafil has a long elimination half-life and thus accumulates in plasma.

Several other strengths of the trial design include the unprecedented DMD sample size and outstanding cohort retention and medication compliance with pharmacokinetic proof that the study achieved desired levels of 24-hour drug exposure. In our pediatric DMD participants, the 2 daily tadalafil doses produced steady-state drug concentrations that were comparable to those achieved when healthy adults are given the maximal allowable daily doses, but unrelated to individual differences in the primary study outcome of 6MWD. Thus, the negative primary and secondary outcomes were not due to insufficient statistical power or drug exposure. We do not believe the negative outcomes are explained by the somewhat lower mean baseline values of 6MWD in the tadalafil groups because baseline 6MWD was a covariate in the primary analysis and no tadalafil effect was seen when the analysis was stratified by baseline 6MWD > 30 or 300 m.

### Tadalafil (Tadliq) [^114H2aSv]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Elimination — Following 40 mg, the mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 3.4 L/hr and the mean terminal half-life is 15 hours in healthy subjects. In patients with pulmonary hypertension not receiving concomitant bosentan, the mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 1.6 L/hr, and the mean terminal half-life is 35 hours. Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as metabolites, mainly in the feces (approximately 61% of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose).

Population pharmacokinetics — In patients with pulmonary hypertension not receiving concomitant bosentan, the average tadalafil exposure at steady-state following 40 mg was 26% higher when compared to those of healthy volunteers. The results suggest a lower clearance of tadalafil in patients with pulmonary hypertension compared to healthy volunteers.

Geriatric patients

In healthy male elderly subjects (65 years or over) after a 10 mg dose, a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25% higher exposure (AUC) with no effect on Cmaxwas observed relative to that in healthy subjects 19 to 45 years of age.

Renal impairment

In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 10 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment. In subjects with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, there was a doubling in Cmaxand AUC was 2.7- to 4.1 times as high following single-dose administration of 10 or 20 mg tadalafil, respectively. Exposure to total methylcatechol (unconjugated plus glucuronide) was 2- to 4 times as high in subjects with renal impairment, compared to those with normal renal function. Hemodialysis (performed between 24 and 30 hours post-dose) contributed negligibly to tadalafil or metabolite elimination [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### The two phases of the clinical validation of preclinical translational mechanistic research on PDE5 inhibitors since viagra's advent. A personal perspective [^113jVaBb]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The FDA approval of Viagra (sildenafil) for the on demand treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) through relaxation of the corporal and cavernosal vascular smooth muscle that results in an increase in blood flow to the corporal tissues stemmed from 2 decades of research, mainly at academic centers. This culminated in the finding of the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway as the mediator of penile erection, followed by some years of basic studies and clinical validation at Pfizer. Further on, new translational laboratory and animal research from our group initiated a second phase when we proposed an alternative therapeutic schedule and mechanism of action for PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5i) in both corporal veno-occlusive dysfunction (CVOD) and Peyronie's disease (PD), specifically, continuous long-term administration (CLTA) to achieve sustained levels of cGMP within the penis. Due to the extended half-life of the long-acting PDE5i, tadalafil, this new alternative encompasses preferentially daily administration, although shorter half-life PDE5i, like sildenafil and vardenafil work too, depending on the duration, dose, and frequency of their administration This novel use was initially supported by showing the antifibrotic/antioxidant effects of nitric oxide and cGMP, produced by the induction of iNOS, as a mechanism of defense against collagen deposition in the localized fibrotic plaque of PD in an avascular tissue, the tunica albuginea. Our studies on iNOS and the progressive diffuse fibrosis occurring in the smooth muscle in CVOD, led to proposing the CLTA of PDE5i for maintaining sustained cGMP levels both in PD and in CVOD in order to halt or regress the penile fibrosis. In CVOD, we showed that PDE5i protect the corporal smooth muscle and reduce myofibroblast activation and number, counteracting the underlying corporal tissue pathology that causes CVOD, and potentially ameliorating long-term CVOD or even curing it. This review is focused on this novel PDE5i anti-fibrotic therapeutic concept.

Effects on Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of a single 100-mg dose of tadalafil on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak tadalafil concentration in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo, and active (intravenous ibutilide) - controlled crossover study in 90 healthy males aged 18 to 53 years. The mean change in QTc(Fridericia QT correction) for tadalafil, relative to placebo, was 3.5 milliseconds (two-sided 90% CI = 1.9, 5.1). The mean change in QTc(Individual QT correction) for tadalafil, relative to placebo, was 2.8 milliseconds (two-sided 90% CI = 1.2, 4.4). A 100-mg dose of tadalafil (5 times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose yields exposures covering those observed upon coadministration of tadalafil with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or those observed in renal impairment. In this study, the mean increase in heart rate associated with a 100-mg dose of tadalafil compared to placebo was 3.1 beats per minute.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Over a dose range of 2.5 mg to 20 mg, tadalafil exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose in healthy subjects. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 5 days of once per day dosing and exposure is approximately 1.6-fold greater than after a single dose. Mean tadalafil concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 20 mg and single and once daily multiple doses of 5 mg, from a separate study, (see Figure 4) to healthy male subjects are depicted in Figure 4.

Absorption — After single oral-dose administration, the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of tadalafil is achieved between 30 minutes and 6 hours (median time of 2 hours). Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil following oral dosing has not been determined.

The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food; thus tadalafil tablets may be taken with or without food.

Distribution — The mean apparent volume of distribution following oral administration is approximately 63 L, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins.

Less than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil) effects on esophageal motility: a systematic review [^114juRQm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal motility disorders are a group of disorders associated with swallowing dysfunction ensuing from the dysregulation of peristaltic motions of the esophagus caused by abnormalities in neuromuscular structures and their function. These disorders include but not limited to achalasia, nutcracker esophagus, and hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Symptoms mainly include dysphagia to solid and liquid, and chest pain; other symptoms such as odynophagia, regurgitation, heartburn, and weight loss could manifest in some of the patients. Moreover, complications following aspiration and respiratory problems might occur as a result of malfunctioned swallowing. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases are of great importance in order to both palliate the symptoms and prevent further complications. Achalasia is characterized by impaired LES relaxation in response to swallowing and lack of esophageal peristalsis. The primary pathophysiological mechanism behind achalasia is proposed to be the inhibition of nerve function resulting from selective loss of inhibitory ganglions in the myenteric plexus as a result of cell-mediated and antibody-mediated autoimmune attacks targeting myenteric nerves in the esophagus, followed by a decrease in nitric oxide (NO), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the gastrointestinal tract. Evaluation of achalasia includes endoscopy, high-resolution manometry, and barium radiography. Botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic dilation, and Heller myotomy are available treatments which help with symptom relief. Direct activation of guanylyl cyclase by NO results in an increase in intracellular 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), leading to initiation of a signaling cascade which consequently relaxes smooth muscles or reduces contractions. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 5 terminates actions of cGMP. PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil cause cGMP accumulation by inhibiting PDE5, which prompts smooth muscle relaxation. Sildenafil is a potent PDE5 inhibitor used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Moreover, it is found to decrease the LES pressure and inhibit esophageal propulsive force. The accordance of the pathophysiology of esophageal motility disorders with the mechanism of action of PDE5 inhibitors raises the question of whether PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil are effective treatment options for esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia. Moreover, there is a need for less invasive treatments for these disorders due to several adverse effects reported after these invasive treatments. Therefore, we set out to address the existing knowledge gap regarding the benefits of the utility of these medications by systematically reviewing the studies evaluating the efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitors in the possible improvement of esophageal motility disorders.

Results in Studies to Determine the Optimal Use of Tadalafil Tablets — Several studies were conducted with the objective of determining the optimal use of tadalafil tablets in the treatment of ED. In one of these studies, the percentage of patients reporting successful erections within 30 minutes of dosing was determined. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, 223 patients were randomized to placebo, tadalafil tablets 10 mg, or 20 mg. Using a stopwatch, patients recorded the time following dosing at which a successful erection was obtained. A successful erection was defined as at least 1 erection in 4 attempts that led to successful intercourse. At or prior to 30 minutes, 35% (26/74), 38% (28/74), and 52% (39/75) of patients in the placebo, 10-mg, and 20-mg groups, respectively, reported successful erections as defined above.

Two studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of tadalafil tablets at a given timepoint after dosing, specifically at 24 hours and at 36 hours after dosing.

In the first of these studies, 348 patients with ED were randomized to placebo or tadalafil tablets 20 mg. Patients were encouraged to make 4 total attempts at intercourse; 2 attempts were to occur at 24 hours after dosing and 2 completely separate attempts were to occur at 36 hours after dosing. The results demonstrated a difference between the placebo group and the tadalafil tablets group at each of the pre-specified timepoints. At the 24-hour timepoint, (more specifically, 22 hours to 26 hours), 53/144 (37%) patients reported at least 1 successful intercourse in the placebo group versus 84/138 (61%) in the tadalafil tablets 20-mg group. At the 36-hour timepoint (more specifically, 33 hours to 39 hours), 49/133 (37%) of patients reported at least 1 successful intercourse in the placebo group versus 88/137 (64%) in the tadalafil tablets 20-mg group.

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor tadalafil — trial characteristics and outcomes in LUTS/BPH: The evidence review identified 10 key reports from 10 trials that compared tadalafil 5 mg to placebo (n = 5,129); one study started with 5 mg and escalated the dose to 20 mg after 6 weeks, and all studies had a relatively short follow-up period of 12 weeks and were industry funded. Seven trials were conducted in multiple countries, one in Japan, one in Korea, and one in the US; eight trials were rated as low ROB and 2 as moderate; and all trials included men with an IPSS of 13 or more. The mean age was 63 years (61–66), baseline IPSS was 16 points (16–22), and seven trials reported a mean BPH Impact Index score of 5.3 at baseline; several trials reported that 80% of participants had ED at baseline (range 59%-71%), with ED reported in 66% of participants in one trial and 100% in another. In one trial with a moderate ROB and 281 participants using a 4-week placebo run-in, participants randomized to tadalafil started at 5 mg daily and were escalated to 20 mg daily after 6 weeks; at 3 months, the 20 mg group had a greater response defined as a change from baseline of ≥ 3 points in IPSS, 61% versus 43% (RR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.13, 1.80; ARD: 18%; 95%CI: 7, 30; Number Needed to Treat [NNT] = 6), and on the 5 mg dose at 6 weeks the response was 49% versus 36%. Across the 10 trials, IPSS change from baseline showed little to no difference versus placebo, -5.4 points versus -3.6 points (IMD: -1.7 points; 95%CI: -2.4, -1.35), with high quality of evidence.

### Update on phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes as pharmacologic targets in urology: present and future [^112PXB72]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives & Methods

Diseases of the human urinary tract represent common morbidities characterized by a high prevalence in the population of most westernized countries. The existence of a significant number of affected patients and the recent increase in scientific attention has resulted in various experimental and clinical efforts in order to evaluate the mechanisms controlling the function of urinary tract organs. This review attempts to describe the physiology and pharmacology of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes with special regard to their (potential) use in disorders of the human urogenital tract.

Results

The promising clinical data for the orally active phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil, used in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction (MED), has boosted research activities on the significance of the cyclic GMP- and cyclic AMP pathway in other genitourinary tract tissues, such as the bladder, prostate, ureter, urethra, as well as female genital tissues. Based on the more extensive understanding of the pathways controlling the function of the male and female urogenital tract, orally administered phosphodiesterase inhibitors are considered a logical and straightforward approach for treating urological diseases. Due to the unending charge to conceive advanced first-line treatments, new therapeutic options taking into consideration the cyclic nucleotide signaling have been introduced or might be launched in the near future. Upcoming strategies will not only focus on the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP cascade but also on compounds modulating signal transduction mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate, as well as combined agents in order to affect multiple peripheral intracellular targets.

Conclusions

The article highlights cGMP- and cAMP-pathways, PDE subtypes and their present or putative future clinical significance in urological practice.

### Adherence to initial PDE-5 inhibitor treatment: randomized open-label study comparing tadalafil once a day, tadalafil on demand, and sildenafil on demand in patients with erectile dysfunction [^111jSD5j]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) is frequently discontinued; adherence may vary depending on the initial regimen.

Aim

To evaluate the effects of initiating treatment with tadalafil once a day (OaD), tadalafil on demand (pro re nata [PRN]), or sildenafil PRN on treatment adherence.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label study, men (≥ 18 years) with ED, naïve to PDE-5 inhibitors, were randomized (1:1:1) to tadalafil 5 mg OaD, tadalafil 10 mg PRN, or sildenafil 50 mg PRN. An 8-week randomized treatment (RT) period (dose adjustment possible) was succeeded by 16 weeks of pragmatic treatment (switches between PDE-5 inhibitors allowed).

Main Outcome Measures

Treatment adherence was measured as time to discontinuation of RT (any cause), estimated by Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Treatment-group differences were estimated as hazard ratio (HR; Cox proportional hazards).

Results

Seven hundred seventy patients (mean age 53 years) were randomized to tadalafil OaD (N = 257), tadalafil PRN (N = 252), and sildenafil PRN (N = 261). Kaplan-Meier estimates for patients discontinuing RT were 52.2, 42.0, and 66.7%, respectively. Median time to discontinuation of RT was significantly longer for tadalafil OaD and PRN (130 and > 168 days) compared with sildenafil (67 days) (HR [97.5% confidence interval]: 0.66 [0.51, 0.85] and 0.49 [0.37, 0.65]; P < 0.001). Reasons for discontinuation with significant differences between groups (P < 0.05) included "lack of efficacy (duration of erection)" (sildenafil 9.2% vs. tadalafil OaD 4.3%, PRN 2.8%), "time constraints due to short window of action" (sildenafil 4.2% vs. tadalafil OaD 0%, PRN 0.4%), and "feel medication controls my sexual life" (sildenafil 2.7% vs. tadalafil OaD 0%). No between-group differences were found in International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain change from baseline to end of RT (least squares mean: 9.4–10.0, P = 0.359) or discontinuations due to adverse events (1.2–1.6%). The most common adverse event (≥ 4%) was headache.

Conclusions

ED patients assigned to tadalafil OaD or PRN adhered significantly longer to initial treatment than patients assigned to sildenafil PRN. Improvement of erectile function and safety profiles were similar in all three treatment groups.

### Time course of the interaction between tadalafil and nitrates [^115u4K6Q]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the time course of nitrate interaction with tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor with a half-life (t(1/2)) of 17.5 h.

Background

The PDE5 inhibitors augment the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of nitrates, yet the time course of this interaction is unclear. Recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend that nitrates be withheld for 24 h after taking sildenafil (t(1/2) = 4 h).

Methods

Male subjects (n = 150) received seven consecutive daily doses of placebo or tadalafil (20 mg). On day 7 and beyond, subjects received repeated doses of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) after the last dose of placebo or tadalafil. After a 10- to 21-day washout period, subjects crossed over to either placebo or tadalafil, and nitrate dosing was repeated.

Results

In response to nitroglycerin at 4, 8, and 24 h, standing systolic BP fell below 85 mm Hg in more subjects on tadalafil compared with placebo (p < 0.05), with no difference in the response to nitroglycerin at 48, 72, and 96 h (p > 0.2). Similar observations were made for standing diastolic BP < 45 mm Hg, decrease in systolic BP > 30 mm Hg, and decrease in diastolic BP > 20 mm Hg. Nitroglycerin also evoked greater mean maximal decreases in standing systolic BP at 8 and 24 h after taking tadalafil versus placebo (p < 0.02), with no significant difference at 48, 72, or 96 h (p > 0.49).

Conclusions

The hemodynamic interaction between tadalafil and sublingual nitroglycerin lasted 24 h, but was not seen at 48 h and beyond. Similar to other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil should not be administered in combination with organic nitrates.

### Microvascular complications in diabetic erectile dysfunction: do we need other alternatives? [^114qqd1B]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

PDE5 INHIBITORS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM CLINICAL PRACTICE

Efficacy

All three PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil) have undergone extensive evaluation in patients with ED secondary to either hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, nerve injury, diabetes, or postradical pelvic surgeries. The response rate of ED patients with these conditions is impressive and can be as high as 60–70%. Diabetic men have displayed impaired response rates in all therapeutic trials. The major predictors for treatment success have been identified as having few diabetic complications and good glycemic control. Patients with ED secondary to radical prostatectomy is another difficult-to-treat group of patients with ED and are of major interest for urologists.

Differences in pharmacokinetic profiles

Several recent publications have emphasized that the onset time of response after the oral administration of sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil may be as short as 15 min. However, such data may lead to mistreatment because the onset of response in the majority of the patients occurs usually when the maximum plasma concentration is reached (∼1 h for sildenafil and vardenafil and ∼2 h for tadalafil). Furthermore, patients taking PDE5 inhibitors should be told to avoid fatty meals when taking these drugs orally, especially sildenafil and vardenafil, to get a satisfying erection.

The duration of action of the different PDE5 inhibitors has been well documented in all premarketing clinical trials. Initially, it was reported that sildenafil and vardenafil have a short duration of action (maximum 4 h). Clinical experience has now shown that their duration of action is longer and that it may be as long as 8–12 h. On the other hand, the duration of action of tadalafil was reported initially to be 24 h. Consecutive trials and clinical use have shown a consistent efficacy of tadalafil for up to 36 h.

It is quite common that physicians prescribe drugs to their patients without any explanation. When prescribing PDE5 inhibitors, the importance of taking medication on an empty stomach and timing between drug intake and intercourse, as well as the need for sexual stimulation to get an erectile response, are crucial issues that need to be explained to patients to ensure drug efficacy. The results of several studies have identified inappropriate instructions and lack of follow-up as the most common causes for the poor response to PDE5 inhibitors or poor drug compliance. It has been reported that 30–50% of the initial nonresponders to PDE5 inhibitors can be converted to responders when patients are given proper instructions on how to use the drug.

### Tadalafil (Tadliq) [^114qxQeS]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypotension

TADLIQ has vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. Prior to prescribing TADLIQ, carefully consider whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with preexisting hypotension, with autonomic dysfunction, with left ventricular outflow obstruction, may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators.

5.2 Worsening Pulmonary Vascular Occlusive Disease

Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Since there are no clinical data on administration of TADLIQ to patients with veno-occlusive disease, administration of TADLIQ to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when TADLIQ is administered, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered.

5.3 Visual Loss

When used to treat erectile dysfunction, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, including tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio ("crowded disc"), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5–11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥ 50 in the general population. An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, typical of erectile dysfunction treatment, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate doubling in the risk of NAION. Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of "crowded" optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies.

Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended.

### Efficacy of tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction at 24 and 36 hours after dosing: a randomized controlled trial [^115LGXcL]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the therapeutic effects of tadalafil on erectile dysfunction (ED) at 24 and 36 hours after dosing.

Methods

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 348 men (mean age 57 years) with ED was conducted in Europe and the United States. Patients were stratified by baseline severity of ED using the Erectile Function domain score of the International Index of Erectile Function and then randomly allocated within the severity group to receive tadalafil 20 mg (n = 175) or placebo (n = 173). Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to two 4-week treatment intervals, during which they were requested to attempt sexual intercourse approximately 24 or 36 hours after tadalafil or placebo dosing. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts (completed to ejaculation) according to patient self-report using the Sexual Encounter Profile diary.

Results

Of the 348 patients, 327 (94%) completed the trial (163 of 175 in the tadalafil group and 164 of 173 in the placebo group). Thirty-six hours after tadalafil dosing, 59.2% of intercourse attempts were successful versus 28.3% in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The proportion of successful intercourse attempts at approximately 24 hours after treatment was also significantly greater with tadalafil (52.9%) than with placebo (29.1%; P < 0.001). Tadalafil was well tolerated. The incidences of four treatment-emergent adverse events were significantly greater in the tadalafil group than in the placebo group (all P < 0.05): headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and myalgia.

Conclusions

Tadalafil 20 mg is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED that has a period of responsiveness of up to 36 hours.

### Tadalafil treatment in patients with cerebral small vessel disease: the ETLAS-2 randomized clinical trial [^115zStBJ]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Improving vascular reactivity in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a promising method to reduce the CSVD burden. CSVD has a substantial clinical impact, as it causes 25% of ischemic stroke events, and it is second only to Alzheimer disease in causing dementia by leading to vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia. It is also strongly associated with the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage.CSVD is radiologically characterized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by recent subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), microbleeds, superficial siderosis, enlarged perivascular space (EPVS), and brain atrophy.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of CSVD involve the endothelial cells of brain vessels, where endothelial dysfunction reduces cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). A key component in CVR is the response to vascular or neuronal activation through the molecular pathway of NO and cGMP. NO, produced in endothelial cells or neurons, diffuses to adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, where it stimulates cGMP production, inducing relaxation via downstream mechanisms. In CSVD-induced endothelial dysfunction, the NO-cGMP cascade is impaired, reducing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CVR, as confirmed by numerous studies.

PDE-5 (phosphodiesterase 5) inhibitors, used in erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, target NO-cGMP signaling by inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP, leading to vasodilation. Repurposing PDE-5 inhibitors to improve CVR and CBF seems promising to reduce the impact of CSVD. The overall hypothesis is that tadalafil can improve vascular function and reduce CSVD burden.

This study was designed as a feasibility study to test whether daily intake of the PDE-5 inhibitor tadalafil was feasible in at least 90% of included participants with previous stroke and signs of CSVD. Feasibility was defined as achieving a medication compliance rate of at least 90% throughout the planned trial period. In addition, we hypothesized that tadalafil treatment would reduce MRI markers of CSVD based on the Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging (STRIVE) criteria and improve cognition and mental well-being.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^115Sb5cV]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction — Men with ED should be informed regarding the treatment option of an FDA-approved oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), including discussion of benefits and risks/burdens, unless contraindicated. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). When men are prescribed an oral PDE5i for the treatment of ED, instructions should be provided to maximize benefit/efficacy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For men who are prescribed PDE5i, the dose should be titrated to provide optimal efficacy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The FDA-approved oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) available for management of ED in the U.S. include sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil. PDE5i medications have been extensively studied, with nearly a quarter of a million men evaluated from the general ED population and approximately 25,000 men evaluated from various special populations; analyses and systematic reviews suggest that sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil have similar efficacy in the general ED population, dose-response effects across PDE5i are small and non-linear, and on-demand dosing versus daily dosing for tadalafil appears to produce the same level of efficacy; the data suggest that men with diabetes and men who are post-prostatectomy respond less robustly to PDE5i. The most frequently reported adverse events in men using PDE5i are dyspepsia, headache, flushing, back pain, nasal congestion, myalgia, visual disturbance, and dizziness; average rates are similar across medications with the exception of dyspepsia (lowest with avanafil), flushing (lowest with tadalafil), and myalgia (lowest with vardenafil and avanafil), and most AEs followed a dose-response pattern such that men who were randomized to active treatment reported statistically significantly higher rates of AEs than did men who were randomized to placebo.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112mfbCx]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I) — tadalafil for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is the most studied; an RCT and several uncontrolled studies showed improvement after daily use of 5 mg tadalafil. In a randomized trial, 140 young men (aged 45 or younger) with moderate to severe CP/CPPS and concomitant erectile dysfunction (ED) received either 5 mg daily tadalafil or placebo for 6 weeks; when compared to placebo, the tadalafil group was significantly better at 6 weeks for NIH-CPSI total, urinary, and QOL subscores, while post-treatment pain subscores did not differ significantly. Compared to baseline, 51% of the tadalafil group versus 5% of the placebo group reported ≥ 25% score reduction. Safety guidance states tadalafil should not be used concomitantly with nitrates; concomitant use of medications such as nonselective α-adrenergic antagonists and cytochrome P450 inhibitors should be assessed for possible drug interactions; and potential adverse events include back pain, dyspepsia, headache, and dizziness.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^113wPEa9]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Tadalafil

Results for continuous efficacy outcomes for tadalafil are shown in Table 4. Average results for percentage successful attempts at intercourse, for the erectile function domain score, and for the change in the erectile function domain score from baseline were consistently available for 20 mg fixed dose, but there were 109 men or fewer using 10 mg or less. Combined data for 10 mg and 20 mg fixed doses are reported (10/20).

Results for dichotomous variables of efficacy and adverse events are shown in Table 6. For efficacy, the NNT for improved erections was 1.9 for both the 20 mg fixed dose and combined 10 plus 20 mg analysis. Combining all information on 10 mg and 20 mg, improved erections in 1651 men were reported in 75% of men on tadalafil and 24% on placebo (Figure 1). The NNT was 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.1).

Table 6
Summary of dichotomous outcomes for tadalafil

NNT is given in standard font, NNTp in bold, and NNH in bold italic. No NNT/NNTp/NNH was calculated unless there was a statistically significant difference

Combining all information on 10 mg and 20 mg, both all cause and lack of efficacy withdrawals reported in about 1400 men, were lower with tadalafil than with placebo, with NNTp values of 15 (8.8 to 46) and 24 (14 to 69) respectively. Adverse event withdrawals were higher with tadalafil than with placebo, with an NNH of 52 (29 to 260).

Combining all information on 10 mg and 20 mg, particular adverse events were reported in 600 to 1800 men, and were generally higher with tadalafil than with placebo, except serious adverse events, which were not different, and rhinitis, where there were few events. NNH values varied between 4.6 (3.4 to 7.2) for men reporting at least one adverse event (47% of men taking tadalafil), to 24 (18 to 38) for men reporting dyspepsia. Headache was the most commonly reported individual adverse event in 13% of men taking tadalafil, followed by dyspepsia reported in 10% and flushing in 4.8%. The majority of trials reported that adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and frequently transient.

### PDE5 inhibitors blunt inflammation in human BPH: a potential mechanism of action for PDE5 inhibitors in LUTS [^1157Eg6f]. The Prostate (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH)/low urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are often comorbid. Chronic inflammation is one of the putative links between these diseases. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are recognized as an effective treatment of BPH-related LUTS. One proposed mechanism of action of PDE5 is the inhibition of intraprostatic inflammation. In this study we investigate whether PDE5i could blunt inflammation in the human prostate.

Methods

Evaluation of the effect of tadalafil and vardenafil on secretion of interleukin 8 (IL-8, a surrogate marker of prostate inflammation) by human myofibroblast prostatic cells (hBPH) exposed to different inflammatory stimuli. We preliminary evaluate histological features of prostatic inflammatory infiltrates in BPH patients enrolled in a randomized, double bind, placebo controlled study aimed at investigating the efficacy of vardenafil (10mg/day, for 12 weeks) on BPH/LUTS.

Results

In vitro treatment with tadalafil or vardenafil on hBPH reduced IL-8 secretion induced by either TNFα or metabolic factors, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein, oxLDL, to the same extent as a PDE5-insensitive PKG agonist Sp-8-Br-PET-cGMP. These effects were reverted by the PKG inhibitor KT5823, suggesting a cGMP/PKG-dependency. Treatment with tadalafil or vardenafil significantly suppressed oxLDL receptor (LOX-1) expression. Histological evaluation of anti-CD45 staining (CD45 score) in prostatectomy specimens of BPH patients showed a positive association with MetS severity. Reduced HDL-cholesterol and elevated triglycerides were the only MetS factors significantly associated with CD45 score. In the MetS cohort there was a significant lower CD45 score in the vardenafil-arm versus the placebo-one.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition improves β-cell function in metabolic syndrome [^117AuciZ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Glucose homeostasis

Neither ramipril nor tadalafil affected insulin sensitivity (Fig. 1). No treatments altered glucose effectiveness, a measure of insulin-independent glucose disposal (0.017 ± 0.006, 0.017 ± 0.008, 0.017 ± 0.009, and 0.015 ± 0.007 min −1 for placebo, tadalafil, ramipril, and ramipril plus tadalafil, respectively).

Ramipril did not affect β-cell function. In contrast, tadalafil significantly improved β-cell function after controlling for sex (P = 0.01) (Fig. 1) or baseline fasting glucose (P = 0.05). In a subgroup analysis, tadalafil improved β-cell function in women (154.4 ± 48.0, 331.9 ± 209.3, 229.1 ± 202.1, and 259.7 ± 95.8 μ · mmol −1 · l −1 during placebo, tadalafil, ramipril, and ramipril plus tadalafil treatment, respectively; P = 0.01 for tadalafil effect) but not in men. There was a trend toward improved β-cell function during tadalafil treatment in individuals with baseline fasting hyperglycemia (195.3 ± 103.1, 278.7 ± 114.0, 157.2 ± 52.6, and 210.6 ± 72.3 μ · mmol −1 · l −1 during placebo, tadalafil, ramipril, and ramipril plus tadalafil treatment, respectively; P = 0.06 for tadalafil) but not in subjects with normal fasting glucose. There was no effect of race and no interactive effect of ramipril or tadalafil on β-cell function.

Ramipril (P = 0.02) and tadalafil (P = 0.02) improved the disposition index in women but not in men after controlling for fasting glucose. This was attributable to a synergistic effect of ramipril and tadalafil on the disposition index (1,001.8 ± 909.5, 977.8 ± 728.5, 1,308.8 ± 976.2, and 1,982.2 ± 1,982.2 units during placebo, tadalafil, ramipril, and ramipril plus tadalafil, respectively; P = 0.05 for ramipril plus tadalafil).

### The renoprotective effects of tadalafil on ischemia-reperfusion injury during partial nephrectomy in an animal model [^115821TM]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the pretreatment of partially nephrectomized Sprague–Dawley rats with tadalafil before IR injury exerts renoprotective effects against inflammation and oxidative stress by reducing the levels of KIM-1, iNOS, eNOS, MPO, and inflammation-related markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CD4, and CD8). Furthermore, treatment with tadalafil preserved renal function by significantly suppressing the loss of viable glomeruli. These findings provide evidence that administering tadalafil before partial nephrectomy may preserve renal function in humans. Large studies are needed to clarify tadalafil's mechanisms of action.

### Analysis of the therapeutic effect of tadalafil on male ED after transurethral resection of prostate [^116tXuN7]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of Tadalafil on male ED after transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). Using the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), ED was assessed in 104 male patients who experienced ED after TURP. These patients were assigned randomly into the therapy group and matched group on the basis of the degree of ED. The patients of the therapy group received Tadalafil, and the patients of matched group received placebo of starch. According to their actual conditions, all patients were informed of the action mechanism and administration of Tadalafil in detail, and advised to use the drug 1 h before sexual activity as recommended. The dose was increased from 10 to 20 mg by week 2 and 4, depending on the effects and adverse reactions. After 8 weeks, ED was re-assessed by IIEF-5. In therapy group, ED was cured in 28 cases, improved in 17 cases, and nonresponsive in 7 cases, with an overall effective rate of 86.5%. In matched group, ED was cured in 6 cases, improved in 7 cases, and non-responsive in 39 cases, with an overall effective rate of 25%. The statistical difference was significant (P < 0.05). No significant adverse reaction was observed in any patient. In conclusion, Tadalafil is safe and effective, and can be used as the first-line medication for the clinical treatment of post-TURP ED.

### Single-dose tadalafil reduces opening urethral pressure: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in healthy women [^116ep4XR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the majority of AEs that emerged in this study were anticipated side effects to tadalafil, transient and mild in severity, the frequency of these tadalafil-related AEs was higher than that in longer-term studies involving male participants with erectile dysfunction and premenopausal women with sexual dysfunction. This increased frequency might be attributed to the study design, which involved a single high dose of the drug. In contrast, the referenced studies employed lower doses over an extended period, where the AE frequency generally appeared to decrease.

In addition to the restricted generalizability of the study results owing to the healthy study population, other limitations need to be considered. First, the urethral pressure measurements were specifically conducted during the storage phase. Consequently, we are unable to directly infer the impact of tadalafil on the female urethra during the voiding phase. Furthermore, the single-dose — and single-outcome measurement design — provided only a snapshot of the pharmacodynamic profile of tadalafil. If the maximal plasma concentration in some of the participants was reached substantially earlier or later than the anticipated 2 h according to the summary of product characteristics, the urethral pressure recordings may not have captured the maximum effect of tadalafil. Nevertheless, we do not expect that the direction of the effect would change, only the magnitude of the effect. Indeed, the trial design is based on our experience from previous single-dose UPR studies with healthy participants, demonstrating that the drugs under investigation exhibited their maximum effect on urethral pressure very close to the estimated t max. Finally, we did not include sonographic evaluation of post-void residuals as part of our assessment of voiding function. Instead, we standardized the bladder volume by emptying the bladder, followed by the instillation of 300 mL (2 × 150 ml) of saline. The immediate recording of voided volume allowed us to estimate any potential post-void residuals. Although the participants typically voided more than the instilled volume, with only four exceptions (ranging from 261 to 297 ml), we cannot completely rule out minor post-void residuals due to the continuous diuresis occurring during the time lapse between bladder drainage and voiding. Nevertheless, given our crossover study design and clear instructions to the participants to maintain consistent fluid intake on both clinic visits, we anticipate that any such residuals would not significantly affect our results. In fact, our findings indicated no statistically significant differences in voided volume between the clinic visits (-11 mL [CI -41 to 18.0, p = 0.4]).

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^117BjWfi]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — tadalafil randomized trials: Figure 3 reports 10 RCT with 3,754 participants, where the mean change in IPSS was -5.4 points with tadalafil versus -3.6 points with placebo for a mean difference of 1.74 lower, and this demonstrates that tadalafil results in little to no difference in mean change in IPSS compared to placebo. In data not shown, treatment responders defined as ≥ 3 points IPSS decrease in 281 participants (1 RCT) had RR 1.43 (1.13 to 1.80), suggesting that tadalafil probably greatly increases response to the IPSS compared to placebo. The BPH Impact Index exceeded the minimal detectable difference of 0.4 points (MD: -0.6 points; 95%CI: -0.81, -0.37), while nocturia frequency showed little to no difference (MD: -0.13 times per night; 95%CI: -0.26, 0.01). Overall withdrawals were 8% with tadalafil and 9% with placebo (IRR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.77, 1.16; [ARD: -0.5%; 95%CI: -2.2, 1.3]), and withdrawals due to adverse events were 3% versus 2% (IRR: 1.64; 95%CI: 1.02, 2.62); [1%; 95%CI: 0.3, 2.1]. Adverse events were higher with tadalafil, 26% versus 22% ([RR 1.22; 95%CI: 1.09, 1.37] [ARD: 5%; 95%CI: 2, 8]; Number Needed to Harm [NNH] 20), with headache, nasopharyngitis, and back pain most commonly reported; totals for the figure were Tadalafil = 1,877 and Placebo = 1,877 with I² = 0%.

### Tadalafil [^116ZGNoK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Do not split tadalafil tablets; entire dose should be taken.

2.1 Tadalafil Tablets for Use as Needed for Erectile Dysfunction

The recommended starting dose of tadalafil tablets for use as needed in most patients is 10 mg, taken prior to anticipated sexual activity.
The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day in most patients.
Tadalafil tablets for use as needed were shown to improve erectile function compared to placebo up to 36 hours following dosing. Therefore, when advising patients on optimal use of tadalafil tablets, this should be taken into consideration.

2.2 Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for Erectile Dysfunction

The recommended starting dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 2.5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity.
The tadalafil tablets dose for once daily use may be increased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability.

2.3 Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The recommended dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day.
When therapy for BPH is initiated with tadalafil tablets and finasteride, the recommended dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day for up to 26 weeks.

2.4 Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for Erectile Dysfunction and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The recommended dose of tadalafil tablets for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patient to read the FDA-Approved patient labeling (Patient Information)

Inform patients that tadalafil is also marketed as CIALIS for erectile dysfunction (ED) and for the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Advise patients taking TADLIQ not to take CIALIS or other PDE5 inhibitors.
Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes while taking TADLIQ. Such an event may be a sign of NAION. Also discuss with patients that there is an increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors.
Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing while taking TADLIQ. These events may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114cmtLu]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We sought randomised trials of three PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), with placebo or active comparator, in men with erectile dysfunction of any causation. Previous systematic reviews were used to source trials or trial data, supplemented by electronic searches of PubMed (to June 2005) and the Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2005) using drug names and randomis(z)ed trial.

For inclusion a trial had to be randomised and double blind, use one of the three oral PDE-5 inhibitors in men with erectile dysfunction, be conducted in the home setting, last three weeks or longer, have a minimum of 10 men per group, and report useful information on efficacy or adverse events. Abstracts were read, and potentially useful reports retrieved in full paper copy. Decisions on inclusion or exclusion were made by consensus. No information was taken from posters or abstracts, and studies were read carefully to avoid including duplicate material. Studies were scored for reporting quality using a common method utilising reporting of randomisation, blinding and withdrawals. The maximum score possible was 5 points, and no study could be included with fewer than 2 points.

Information extracted from studies included the number of men studied, the cause of erectile dysfunction, and country where the study was performed. Any type of outcome was initially extracted from the studies, in continuous or dichotomous form, and with any dispersion information available. Outcomes could be reported in tables, in graphs, or in text. The following outcomes were sought particularly:

Efficacy

- Improved erections ("Has the treatment you have been taking over the past four weeks improved your erections?")

- Erections per week

- Successful attempts at sexual intercourse

- More than 60% or 75% successful

- More than 40% successful

- Final score or change from baseline on question 3 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) ("Over the past four weeks, when you attempted sexual intercourse, how often were you able to penetrate your partner?")

- Final score or change from baseline on question 4 of the IIEF ("Over the past four weeks, during sexual intercourse, how often were you able to maintain your erection after you had penetrated your partner?")

- Final score or change from baseline on the IIEF erectile function domain score

- Normal erectile function at end of study (IIEF total score of 22 or more out of 30)

Withdrawal

- All cause

- Lack of efficacy

- Adverse event

### Combination of alfuzosin and tadalafil exerts an additive relaxant effect on human detrusor and prostatic tissues in vitro [^113tGJqa]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and erectile dysfunction (ED) are highly prevalent in aging men and are strongly linked. Alpha₁-blockers such as alfuzosin are effective monotherapies for LUTS. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as tadalafil are the first-line treatment for ED. Both drugs act by two different mechanisms of action on common urogenital target organs and, thus, may have additive effects.

Objectives

We evaluated in vitro the effects of alfuzosin, tadalafil, and the combination of both on human detrusor and prostatic smooth muscle.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prostatic and bladder tissue were obtained from patients (n = 20 and n = 17, respectively) undergoing cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer.

Measurements

In organ baths, isolated prostatic strips and isolated bladder strips were incubated with vehicle, tadalafil (10⁻⁶ M and 10⁻⁵ M), alfuzosin (3×10⁻⁸ M or 10⁻⁶ M and 10⁻⁵ M) or a combination. Concentration-response curves (CRCs) to norepinephrine were generated on prostatic strips and detrusor strips precontracted with carbachol. Strips were also submitted to electrical field stimulation (EFS).

Results and Limitations

When alfuzosin and tadalafil were combined, the maximal relaxation to norepinephrine on carbachol-precontracted detrusor strips was significantly increased compared with tadalafil alone, and EFS-induced detrusor contractions were better inhibited compared with each compound alone. Tadalafil significantly inhibited norepinephrine-induced prostatic strip contractions by reducing the maximal effect, whereas alfuzosin shifted the CRC of norepinephrine to the right. Combining both tadalafil and alfuzosin resulted in a greater relaxant effect. Likewise, the combination was more effective at reducing EFS-induced contractions compared with each compound alone.

Conclusions

The combination of alfuzosin and tadalafil exerts an additive effect of inhibiting adrenergic smooth muscle tone of prostatic tissue and EFS-induced detrusor contractions and conversely, of enhancing adrenergic relaxation of detrusor precontracted with carbachol. These experiments provide experimental support for the clinical investigation of the combination of α1-blockers and PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of LUTS.

### Ambrisentan (Letairis) [^113ZEaQK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent autocrine and paracrine peptide. Two receptor subtypes, ETAand ETB, mediate the effects of ET-1 in the vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. The primary actions of ETAare vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, while the predominant actions of ETBare vasodilation, antiproliferation, and ET-1 clearance.

In patients with PAH, plasma ET-1 concentrations are increased as much as 10-fold and correlate with increased mean right atrial pressure and disease severity. ET-1 and ET-1 mRNA concentrations are increased as much as 9-fold in the lung tissue of patients with PAH, primarily in the endothelium of pulmonary arteries. These findings suggest that ET-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH.

Ambrisentan is a high-affinity (Ki = 0.011 nM) ETAreceptor antagonist with a high selectivity for the ETAversus ETBreceptor (> 4000-fold). The clinical impact of high selectivity for ETAis not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, positive- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, healthy subjects received either Letairis 10 mg daily followed by a single dose of 40 mg, placebo followed by a single dose of moxifloxacin 400 mg, or placebo alone. Letairis 10 mg daily had no significant effect on the QTc interval. The 40 mg dose of Letairis increased mean QTc at tmaxby 5 ms with an upper 95% confidence limit of 9 ms. For patients receiving Letairis 5–10 mg daily and not taking metabolic inhibitors, no significant QT prolongation is expected.

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)

In AMBITION [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], the decrease in NT-proBNP in patients on Letairis plus tadalafil was observed early (Week 4) and was sustained, with a reduction of 63% on Letairis plus tadalafil, 50% on Letairis alone, and 41% on tadalafil alone at Week 24.

The study PASSION was published by Marius M Hoeper and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure and Pulmonary hypertension. In the PASSION study, the trial question was: what is the role of tadalafil in patients with HFpEF and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension? In the PASSION study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PASSION study, the population was: 125 patients (91 female, 34 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy or lactation. In the PASSION study, the interventions were: n = 62 tadalafil (target dose of 40 mg once daily) n = 63 placebo (matching placebo). In the PASSION study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in time to first HF hospitalization or death (27% vs. 32%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.01). In the PASSION study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in time to clinical worsening (27% vs. 38%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.39) Significant increase in improvement in mean 6MWD (5.2 m vs. 16.3 m; MD 11.1, 95% CI 12.6 to 34.8). In the PASSION study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the PASSION study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension, tadalafil was not superior to placebo with respect to time to first HF hospitalization or death.

Phosphodiesterase 11 (PDE11) is the latest isoform of the phosphodiesterase family to be identified. Interest in PDE11 has increased recently because tadalafil, an oral phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, cross reacts with PDE11. The function of PDE11 remains largely unknown, but growing evidence points to a possible role in male reproduction. The published literature on PDE11 structure, function and expression is reviewed.

Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors

In addition to adrenergic fibers, key actors in micturition are the nonadrenergic-noncholinergic fibers. This neural system is implicated in the release and increase of nitric oxide (NO), a cardinal molecule for intracellular signaling which causes an increase of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), consequently catabolized by the enzyme PDE. After its fundamental discovery in the cavernous tissue and the development of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), researchers have demonstrated the presence of PDE-5 isoenzymes all along the lower urinary tract: they are in fact expressed in the detrusor, the prostate, the urethra and in pelvic vessels. Here PDE-5 inhibition determines intracellular cGMP increase, which in turn may promote micturition via different though yet unclear mechanisms of action. First, cGMP phosphorylates and inactivates a protein kinase G (ρ-kinase) to promote smooth muscle cells relaxation. In addition, this ρ-kinase stimulates endothelin-1, which is a potent vasoconstrictor which can mediate muscle contraction. Therefore, PDE-5 inhibition, via a cGMP increase, reduces ρ-kinase activity and thus increases relaxation in the lower urinary tract. Additionally, PDE inhibition enhances smooth muscle cell relaxation increasing NO activity as observed in the bladder neck, where nitrergic innervation is prominent, in the prostate, were PDE inhibition determines a dose-dependent tissue relaxation, and in urethral tissue. Finally, PDE-5 inhibition leads to increased perfusion of pelvic organs with the hypothesis that pelvic atherosclerosis with consequent ischaemia may have a role in male LUTS, the vasodilatation and increased end-organ perfusion determined by PDE-5 inhibitors on blood vessels may be beneficial for LUTS. Of note, Bertolotto et al. demonstrated increased prostatic perfusion on contrast-enhanced ultrasound after administration of tadalafil 20 mg. Moreover, soluble cGMP plays a key role in the NO-mediated inhibition of leukocyte rolling, and PDE5 inhibition may reduce atherosclerotic damage and overall inflammation by reducing leukocyte recruitment. Tadalafil was shown to attenuate in vitro the expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1βin pulmonary arteries and of TNF-α and IL-8 in endothelial cells. Finally, cGMP modulates afferent nerve fibers from the bladder and urethra, and PDE inhibitors may decrease the sensation of bladder filling, thus reducing urgency. In this context Minagawa et al. found that tadalafil significantly decreased afferent activity from the bladder in response to bladder filling in a rat model and Behr-Roussel et al. reported a reduction of afferent signaling in rats with spinal cord injury in response to bladder filling after treatment with vardenafil.

### Pulmonary hypertension in bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^111956AS]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacotherapy to modify the nitric oxide pathway

Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors are the most commonly employed drugs acting on the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, namely sildenafil and tadalafil. PDE5 inhibitors inhibit primarily PDE5 (NO/cGMP pathway), thus inducing vasodilation through vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation, and also exhibit anti-proliferative effects.STARTS-1 and its extension phase, STARTS-2, were the first pediatric randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in PAH. The STARTS study demonstrated improvement in secondary outcomes among those PH patients on medium- or high-dose sildenafil, including functional class and PVR. Controversially, the STARTS trial detected an increase in mortality among those subjects receiving high-dose sildenafil vs. placebo group, which in 2013 led to a warning of the EMA not to use higher doses, and rejection of approval by the FDA. Nevertheless, sildenafil is — by most centers and experts — regarded as a safe and efficacious first-of-choice drug for PH/PVD in children, and its widespread use and recommendation in formal guidelines continues. Sildenafil at standard dose should be considered in children with BPD-PH as improvements of clinical status and PAP have been demonstrated for oral sildenafil therapy. Tadalafil is reported to be widely used in North America due to its reduced dosing frequency, compared to sildenafil. Common to all PDE5 inhibitors, gastroesophageal reflux is an often reported unwanted effect that is also highly relevant to neonates and infants. Riociguat is a novel oral agent with dual mode of action that acts in synergy with endogenous NO and directly stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase, with only very limited pediatric experience.

### Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114SEeS1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is prevalent in old men and often results in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, etc.) are first-line treatments for erectile dysfunction. Recently, PDE5 inhibitors have been found to regulate smooth muscle tone in human prostate. This article focuses on the use of PDE5 inhibitors for BPH/LUTS treatment and highlights the clinical significance.

Recent Findings

Preclinical and clinical studies have provided promising evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may be an effective and well tolerated treatment option for BPH/LUTS. Combination therapy using PDE5 inhibitors and alpha1-adrenergic blockers resulted in greater improvements in BPH/LUTS than did either drug alone.

Summary

There has been increasing interest in the use of PDE5 inhibitors to treat BPH/LUTS. Combination of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha1-adrenergic blockers may have an additive beneficial effect on BPH/LUTS compared with monotherapy. Mechanisms of action of nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate/PDE5 pathway in the treatment of BPH/LUTS deserve further investigations. Larger-scale, well designed clinical trials in future are needed to ascertain the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of LUTS secondary to BPH.

### Efficacy of continuous dosing of tadalafil once daily vs tadalafil on demand in clinical subgroups of men with erectile dysfunction: a descriptive comparison using the integrated tadalafil databases [^111Yptek]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Numerous factors such as age, weight, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, smoking, arterial hypertension, and alcohol use can play a role in the development of erectile dysfunction (ED). – Owing to the various physical and psychosocial aspects of ED, treatment of ED extends beyond improving erectile function (EF) response and satisfaction. –

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors represent the first-line drug treatment for ED. The PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil, with on-demand (PRN) – and once-daily (OAD) – dosing regimens, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of ED. Psychosocial outcomes, spontaneity, and time concerns have shown significant improvement after treatment with long-acting compared with short-acting PDE5 inhibitors. Treatment with tadalafil OAD has improved EF in patients with mild and mild to moderate impairments in EF after PRN PDE5 inhibitor therapy. Other studies have shown that the OAD dosing regimen leads to high treatment satisfaction for the patient and his partner,– and allows patients to have spontaneous sexual activity, thereby changing the requirement for dosing and sexual activity to be linked. An OAD dosing regimen also improves the patient's ability to achieve and maintain erections and improves treatment satisfaction and psychosocial outcomes. In addition, early initiation of the tadalafil OAD regimen protects against penile length loss after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors in male sexual dysfunction [^115NnRDP]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors are preferred by most men for the oral treatment of erectile dysfunction. In many guidelines, this therapy is recommended as first-line therapy because of convenience, high efficacy, and low rates of side-effects. Sildenafil was the first drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, introduced in 1998. There are now two new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and tadalafil, for which approval was recently given in the European Union and is expected this year in the United States.

Recent Findings

Sildenafil has proved to be a very effective medicinal product. According to initial studies, vardenafil and tadalafil have demonstrated efficacy comparable to that of sildenafil. However, fewer data are available evaluating the adverse effects of vardenafil and tadalafil, particularly on their long-term use and their use in high-risk groups. Interestingly, vardenafil and tadalafil have a higher potency than sildenafil. Moreover, the long life of tadalafil has been associated with an erectogenic potential of the drug lasting for more than 24 h. The advantage of this is the possibility of a patient engaging in sexual activity more than once after a single administration of the drug.

Summary

In the future, in addition to sildenafil, the new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors vardenafil and tadalafil will play an important role in the management of erectile dysfunction, depending on the patient's health profile.

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors' extended duration of response as a variable in the treatment of erectile dysfunction [^116cw7t8]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2006). Low credibility.

The phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, are a class of medications that are safe and effective in treating erectile dysfunction (ED). Yet, resuming sexual activity following a period of abstinence in response to ED may be anxiety-provoking for the man, his partner and their relationship, causing the sexual encounter to become a stressful event. The differences between PDE5 inhibitors in terms of duration of action can be successfully utilized by healthcare professionals to mitigate some of the psychosocial barriers that interfere with treating ED. PDE5 inhibitors with a longer duration of responsiveness provide some men with ED and their partners, a treatment option that may offer greater flexibility and potentially less anxiety surrounding the resumption of sexual activity. Shorter-acting PDE5s may be preferred by men/couples with predictable sexual scripts, excellent communication strategies and concerns regarding the duration of side effects.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of once-a-day dosing of tadalafil 5mg and 10mg in the treatment of erectile dysfunction: results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113FfBtG]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a chronic disease; however, therapy is currently administered as needed with oral phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like tadalafil. Because the 17.5-h half-life of tadalafil enables therapeutic plasma levels to be sustained with daily administration, tadalafil is a good candidate for once daily dosing therapy.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week study enrolled 268 men 1:2:2 to placebo, tadalafil 5mg, and tadalafil 10mg taken once daily. Primary efficacy measures included changes in the International Index of Erectile Function Erectile Function domain (IIEF EF), Sexual Encounter Profile diary Questions 2 (SEP2: successful penetration), and 3 (SEP3: successful completion of intercourse), and tolerability. Secondary measures included percentage of patients at endpoint who reported improved erectile function (EF), and percentage who reported "no ED" (IIEF EF score 26–30).

Results

For patients who took placebo, tadalafil 5mg, and tadalafil 10mg, changes from baseline to endpoint were, respectively, 0.9, 9.7, and 9.4 for IIEF EF; 11.2, 36.5, and 39.4 for SEP2; and 13.2, 45.5, and 50.1 for SEP3. At endpoint, 28.3%, 84.5%, and 84.6% reported improved erections, and 8.3%, 51.5%, and 50.5% reported "no ED", respectively. All comparisons between tadalafil and placebo were significant (p < 0.001). Adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients were dyspepsia, headache, back pain, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia; nine patients (3.4%) discontinued because of adverse events.

Conclusions

Once-a-day tadalafil 5mg or 10mg was well tolerated and significantly improved EF in men with ED.
