## Question

In the ASPREE trial, how did daily low-dose aspirin affect all-cause mortality in otherwise healthy older adults compared with placebo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how daily low-dose aspirin affected all-cause mortality in otherwise healthy older adults compared with placebo in the ASPREE trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population to ensure the results apply to the right group. Then, I should verify the primary mortality outcomes and their statistical significance. Next, I will examine the cause-specific mortality signal, especially cancer, and check whether it explains the all-cause difference. After that, I need to consider safety signals that might contextualize harm. Finally, I should review extended follow-up and guideline implications to synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't jump to conclusions. ASPREE was a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 19,114 community-dwelling older adults aged 70 years or older (≥ 65 years for U.S. minorities) without cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability, randomized to 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin versus matching placebo for a median 4.7 years, with excellent adherence monitoring and adjudicated outcomes, which supports the internal validity of the mortality findings [^6866dd0e] [^c31984ec].

> Now, I should verify the all-cause mortality result itself. The primary analysis showed higher all-cause mortality with aspirin: 12.7 per 1,000 person-years on aspirin versus 11.1 per 1,000 person-years on placebo, with a hazard ratio of 1.14 and 95% CI 1.01 to 1.29, indicating a statistically significant 14% relative increase in death from any cause, which was an unexpected and prespecified secondary outcome in the trial [^6866dd0e] [^b9f29392].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking cause-specific mortality. The excess mortality was driven primarily by cancer-related death: 3.1% in the aspirin group versus 2.3% in the placebo group, corresponding to an HR of 1.31 (95% CI 1.10–1.56), and the authors explicitly note that cancer accounted for essentially all of the excess all-cause mortality signal, which strengthens the causal interpretation of that component [^6866dd0e] [^b9f29392].

> Wait, let me verify whether this reflects more cancer incidence or more fatal cancer presentations. Detailed cancer analyses show that aspirin was associated with more incident cancers presenting at advanced stage and higher cancer mortality, rather than a large increase in overall cancer incidence, suggesting a possible adverse effect on cancer evolution or detection dynamics in this older population, although this remains hypothesis-generating and warrants caution in overgeneralization [^534abb26] [^6bb453f9].

> I need to check safety signals that might compound harm. Major hemorrhage occurred more frequently with aspirin (8.6 vs 6.2 per 1,000 person-years; HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18–1.62), and intracranial bleeding was also increased, which, while not the principal driver of the mortality difference, contributes to net clinical harm in primary prevention among healthy older adults [^dd1392ef] [^e755c57c].

> Next, I should review extended follow-up to see if the mortality signal persists or attenuates. In ASPREE-XT, over a total median follow-up near 8–9 years, there was no long-term effect of randomized aspirin on the composite of death, dementia, or persistent disability, and no long-term effect on deaths overall, suggesting that the early increase in all-cause mortality attenuates with longer observation, although the early harm signal remains a valid in-trial finding [^1f9e93df].

> But wait, what if guideline positions conflict with this single trial signal? I should confirm alignment. Contemporary guidelines and evidence syntheses, including USPSTF 2022 and ACC/AHA 2019, recommend against routine initiation of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention in adults 60 years and older, largely due to increased bleeding and lack of cardiovascular benefit, with ASPREE's mortality signal reinforcing caution in the ≥ 70-year group, even though the absolute excess mortality was modest at 1.6 per 1,000 person-years [^2a1d43eb] [^73e59db8] [^6866dd0e].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. In ASPREE, daily low-dose aspirin increased all-cause mortality by 14% in otherwise healthy older adults, with the excess entirely explained by higher cancer mortality and accompanied by more major bleeding; there was no cardiovascular benefit, and extended follow-up suggests no long-term survival disadvantage, but the in-trial harm is clinically meaningful and supports avoiding routine aspirin initiation for primary prevention in this age group [^6866dd0e] [^1f9e93df] [^dd1392ef].

In the ASPREE trial, daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg) **increased all-cause mortality** in otherwise healthy older adults compared with placebo, with a hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01–1.29) [^6866dd0e]. This excess mortality was **primarily due to cancer-related deaths**, which occurred in 3.1% of the aspirin group versus 2.3% in the placebo group (HR 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10–1.56) [^6866dd0e]. Aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular mortality and increased major hemorrhage risk, including intracranial bleeding [^dd1392ef] [^e755c57c]. These findings led to recommendations against routine aspirin use for primary prevention in adults aged 70 years or older [^2a1d43eb] [^73e59db8].

## Study design and population

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
- **Population**: 19,114 community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 70 years (≥ 65 years for U.S. minorities) without cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability [^c31984ec].
- **Intervention**: 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin daily vs placebo.
- **Follow-up**: Median 4.7 years [^c31984ec].

---

## All-cause mortality results

- **All-cause mortality**: Higher with aspirin (12.7 per 1,000 person-years) vs placebo (11.1 per 1,000 person-years); HR 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01–1.29) [^6866dd0e].
- **Absolute risk increase**: 1.6 per 1,000 person-years (about 1 extra death per 625 person-years).
- **Cancer mortality**: Major contributor; 3.1% with aspirin vs 2.3% with placebo (HR 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10–1.56) [^6866dd0e].

---

## Cardiovascular mortality

Cardiovascular mortality did not differ between groups (1.0% aspirin vs 1.2% placebo; HR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62–1.08) [^b9f29392].

---

## Safety outcomes

Major hemorrhage was more frequent with aspirin (3.8% vs 2.8% placebo; HR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18–1.62) [^c31984ec], and intracranial bleeding was also increased (1.1% vs 0.8%; HR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.03–1.84) [^e755c57c].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

These findings led to recommendations against routine aspirin use for primary prevention in adults aged ≥ 70 years [^2a1d43eb] [^73e59db8]. The USPSTF advises against initiating aspirin for primary prevention in adults ≥ 60 years due to bleeding risk and lack of net benefit [^notfound]. The ASPREE results do not apply to secondary prevention, where aspirin remains indicated [^da4688ce].

## Summary of ASPREE mortality findings

| **Outcome** | **Aspirin group** | **Placebo group** | **Hazard ratio (95% ci)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| All-cause mortality | 12.7 per 1,000 person-years | 11.1 per 1,000 person-years | 1.14 (1.01–1.29) |
| Cancer mortality | 3.1% | 2.3% | 1.31 (1.10–1.56) |
| Cardiovascular mortality | 1.0% | 1.2% | 0.82 (0.62–1.08) |

---

In sum, ASPREE showed that daily low-dose aspirin **increased all-cause mortality** in healthy older adults, driven by cancer deaths, without cardiovascular benefit and with more bleeding; thus, it should not be used for primary prevention in this population [^6866dd0e] [^2a1d43eb].

### Effect of aspirin on all-cause mortality in the healthy elderly [^6866dd0e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the primary analysis of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial, now published in the Journal, we report that the daily use of aspirin did not provide a benefit with regard to the primary end point of disability-free survival among older adults. A numerically higher rate of the secondary end point of death from any cause was observed with aspirin than with placebo.

Methods

From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling persons in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥ 65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. Deaths were classified according to the underlying cause by adjudicators who were unaware of trial-group assignments. Hazard ratios were calculated to compare mortality between the aspirin group and the placebo group, and post hoc exploratory analyses of specific causes of death were performed.

Results

Of the 19,114 persons who were enrolled, 9525 were assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 1052 deaths occurred during a median of 4.7 years of follow-up. The risk of death from any cause was 12.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.29). Cancer was the major contributor to the higher mortality in the aspirin group, accounting for 1.6 excess deaths per 1000 person-years. Cancer-related death occurred in 3.1% of the participants in the aspirin group and in 2.3% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.56).

Conclusions

Higher all-cause mortality was observed among apparently healthy older adults who received daily aspirin than among those who received placebo and was attributed primarily to cancer-related death. In the context of previous studies, this result was unexpected and should be interpreted with caution.

### Effect of aspirin on all-cause mortality in the healthy elderly [^b9f29392]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study ASPREE was published by McNeil JJ and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiovascular disease prevention, Coronary artery disease, Acute ischemic stroke, Intracerebral hemorrhage and Subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the ASPREE study, the trial question was: what is the effect of daily aspirin in otherwise healthy older adults? In the ASPREE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ASPREE study, the population was: 19114 patients (10782 female, 8332 male). The inclusion criteria were adult healthy patients (≥ 65 years of age) without CVD, dementia, or disability. The key exclusion criteria were history of a diagnosed CVD event, AF, serious illness likely to cause death within the next 5 years, current or recurrent condition with a high risk of major bleeding, uncontrolled BP, anemia, current use of aspirin for secondary prevention, or current continuous use of other antiplatelet drug or anticoagulant. In the ASPREE study, the interventions were: n = 9525 aspirin (100 mg daily) n = 9589 placebo (matching tablet). In the ASPREE study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the incidence of death from all causes (12.7/1000 py vs. 11.1/1000 py; HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.29). In the ASPREE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in cancer-related death (3.1% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.56) No significant difference in death from CVD, including ischemic stroke (1% vs. 1.2%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.08) No significant difference in death from major hemorrhage, including hemorrhagic stroke (0.3% vs. 0.3%; HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94). In the ASPREE study, the conclusion was: in adult healthy patients (≥ 65 years of age) without CVD, dementia, or disability, aspirin was inferior to placebo with respect to the incidence of death from all causes.

### Aspirin and healthy lifespan in older people: main outcome of the ASPREE-XT observational study [^1f9e93df]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2025). High credibility.

Background

In the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) clinical trial, low-dose aspirin was not associated with survival free of dementia and persistent physical disability (a measure of a healthy lifespan); however, there was a small increased risk of death. Given the long pre-clinical phase of many ageing conditions, we aimed to examine the legacy effect (post-trial) and the longer-term effect of aspirin versus placebo through extended follow-up in the ASPREE-XT observational study.

Methods

Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014, 19114 community-dwelling people in Australia and the USA, aged predominantly 70 years and older, were randomly assigned to low-dose aspirin or placebo for a median of 4·7 years as part of the ASPREE trial. Post-trial observational follow-up continued for a median of 4·3 years (IQR 4·1–4·6). All components of the primary endpoint (ie, incident dementia, persistent physical disability, and death) were adjudicated by masked expert panels. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards models with intention-to-treat.

Findings

15633 participants (8836 [56·5%] were women, 6797 [43·5%] were men; 981 [6·3%] were not White) were eligible for and agreed to observational follow-up. There was no effect of randomisation to aspirin (34·37 events per 1000 person-years) versus placebo (33·68 per 1000 person-years) on the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02; 95% CI 0·94–1·11; p = 0·63) in the ASPREE-XT period. Similarly, over the period of both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT, no long-term effect of aspirin versus placebo was observed on the composite outcome of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability over almost a decade of follow-up (HR 1·01; 95% CI 0·95–1·08; p = 0·65), including no long-term effect on deaths (1·06; 0·99–1·14; p = 0·10). No effect of aspirin on incident major haemorrhagic events as compared with placebo was found in ASPREE-XT; however, aspirin was associated with an increased hazard for incident major haemorrhagic events across both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT (1·24; 1·10–1·39).

Interpretation

Low-dose aspirin does not appear to be effective in promoting a healthy lifespan in initially healthy, community-dwelling older people.

### Effect of aspirin on deaths associated with sepsis in healthy older people (ANTISEPSIS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial [^19dcb04e]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a serious global health issue and a major cause of death and disability. The availability of a simple, community-based preventive strategy could substantially reduce the burden of sepsis. We aimed to establish whether low-dose aspirin reduced deaths or hospital admissions associated with sepsis in older people.

Methods

ANTISEPSIS was a substudy of ASPREE (a randomised controlled primary prevention trial of low-dose aspirin [100 mg per day] compared with placebo in community dwelling older adults conducted in Australia and the USA), with the Australian cohort included in the ANTISEPSIS substudy. Inclusion criteria were participants aged at least 70 years who did not have major illnesses. Participants were block randomised (1:1) via a centralised web portal and stratified by general practice and age. Participants, investigators, and staff were masked to the intervention. Teams of clinical specialist investigators assessed potential sepsis events to establish if they satisfied the primary endpoint of death associated with sepsis. The analyses were by intention-to-treat with univariate survival analysis methods, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12613000349741.

Results

Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014, of 20288 individuals assessed for eligibility, 16703 participants aged 70 years and older at trial entry were enrolled and followed up for a median of 4·6 years (IQR 3·6–5·6). 8322 (49·8%) participants were assigned to receive aspirin and 8381 (50·2%) to placebo. 203 deaths were considered to be associated with sepsis. Univariate analysis showed similar rates of death associated with sepsis in the two study groups (hazard ratio for aspirin vs placebo 1·08, 95% CI 0·82–1·43; p = 0·57). Adverse events were previously reported in the ASPREE trial.

Interpretation

Daily low-dose aspirin treatment did not reduce deaths associated with sepsis in community dwelling older adults. Our findings do not support the use of aspirin as a primary prevention strategy to reduce the burden of sepsis in this population.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^b5ba2181]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The lowest effective daily dose of aspirin for long-term antiplatelet prophylaxis ranges between 50 and 100 mg, with no evidence that higher doses are more effective, consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inactivation at low doses. This evidence is based on indirect comparisons of RCTs employing different aspirin dosing regimens, as well as on a limited number of head-to-head randomized comparisons of a lower vs. a higher dose, both in acute coronary syndromesand stable patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

There is also no convincing evidence that the dose requirement for the antithrombotic effect of aspirin varies in different clinical settings or as a function of body weight. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effect of aspirin on major vascular events is influenced by gender, age, concomitant treatments, or primary vs. secondary prevention. In the ASPREE trial involving 19 114 healthy elderly persons (median age, 74 years) who did not have known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significantly lower risk of CVD than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.08]. However, the widely cited message from ASPREE that low-dose aspirin is ineffective in old age is potentially misleading, for the following reasons: (i) CVD was not the primary endpoint of ASPREE; (ii) CVD, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was a composite of platelet-dependent as well as platelet-independent events, i.e. fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure; and (iii) when the analysis was restricted to a traditional composite of fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, or fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, the rate of this endpoint was 7.8 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 8.8 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77–1.03). Such a moderate treatment effect is identical to that reported for younger subjects (< 65 years) in a setting of primary prevention, an effect that ASPREE failed to detect as statistically significant in a population at low cardiovascular risk (< 1.0% per year) because it was largely underpowered. Despite serious limitations, these results were published as a separate, stand-alone paper in the New England Journal of Medicine and named as one of the 12 'game changers' of 2018.

### Effect of aspirin on cancer incidence and mortality in older adults [^34a19294]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg) vs placebo in 19 114 Australian and US adults aged 70 years or older (or aged 65 years or older among US African Americans and Hispanics) who were free of known cardiovascular disease, dementia, or physical disability at trial entry. We recently reported that ASPREE participants randomized to aspirin experienced higher all-cause mortality. This became evident at 3 years postrandomization and was largely attributable to death from cancer.

This finding was unexpected in the context of results from prior RCTs and meta-analyses. Generally, these studies, conducted in a younger average age group, reported that aspirin did not affect the short-term risk of cancer although Rothwell et al. recently reported an increase in cancer incidence during the early years of follow-up among older trial participants. With more prolonged follow-up, participants randomized to daily aspirin had a reduced risk of incident cancer and death from cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. This led the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 to recommend low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and colorectal cancer among US adults aged 50–59 years with a greater than 10% 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. However, this advice did not extend to adults aged 70 years and older where the evidence was considered insufficient.

The present report now provides a more detailed analysis of the effect of aspirin on cancer incidence and mortality occurring in the ASPREE participants with the aim of better understanding the findings and implications of the study.

### Effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events and bleeding in the healthy elderly [^dd1392ef]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Aspirin is a well-established therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. However, its role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is unclear, especially in older persons, who have an increased risk.

Methods

From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling men and women in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥ 65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability; results for this end point are reported in another article in the Journal. Secondary end points included major hemorrhage and cardiovascular disease (defined as fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure).

Results

Of the 19,114 persons who were enrolled in the trial, 9525 were assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. After a median of 4.7 years of follow-up, the rate of cardiovascular disease was 10.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.3 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.08). The rate of major hemorrhage was 8.6 events per 1000 person-years and 6.2 events per 1000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.62; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The use of low-dose aspirin as a primary prevention strategy in older adults resulted in a significantly higher risk of major hemorrhage and did not result in a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease than placebo.

### A randomised controlled trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of fractures in healthy older people: protocol for the ASPREE-fracture substudy [^9b530027]. Injury Prevention (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Disability, mortality and healthcare burden from fractures in older people is a growing problem worldwide. Observational studies suggest that aspirin may reduce fracture risk. While these studies provide room for optimism, randomised controlled trials are needed. This paper describes the rationale and design of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE)-Fracture substudy, which aims to determine whether daily low-dose aspirin decreases fracture risk in healthy older people.

Methods

ASPREE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial designed to assess whether daily active treatment using low-dose aspirin extends the duration of disability-free and dementia-free life in 19000 healthy older people recruited from Australian and US community settings. This substudy extends the ASPREE trial data collection to determine the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on fracture and fall-related hospital presentation risk in the 16500 ASPREE participants aged ≥ 70years recruited in Australia. The intervention is a once daily dose of enteric-coated aspirin (100mg) versus a matching placebo, randomised on a 1:1 basis. The primary outcome for this substudy is the occurrence of any fracture-vertebral, hip and non-vert-non-hip-occurring post randomisation. Fall-related hospital presentations are a secondary outcome.

Discussion

This substudy will determine whether a widely available, simple and inexpensive health intervention-aspirin-reduces the risk of fractures in older Australians. If it is demonstrated to safely reduce the risk of fractures and serious falls, it is possible that aspirin might provide a means of fracture prevention.

Trial Registration Number

The protocol for this substudy is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000347561).

### Effect of aspirin on cancer incidence and mortality in older adults [^534abb26]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths of ASPREE include the use of blinded expert reviewers to categorize both tumor stage and causes of death, thus minimizing bias or misclassification. However, limited statistical power was available to examine the effect of aspirin within subgroups or on specific cancer subtypes, and consideration about the multiplicity of statistical analyses also constrains some of our conclusions. Finally, although we did not observe a differential effect of aspirin on cancer mortality according to a history of prior aspirin use, our overall results do not specifically address whether aspirin use initiated at a younger age should be discontinued after ages 65 to 70 years.

If confirmed, the clinical implications of these findings could be important for the use of aspirin in an older population. If low-dose aspirin were to hasten the progression of cancers, its role as a primary prevention agent would be further diminished. However, the increased risk in ASPREE was small (an extra 1.5 deaths from cancer per 1000 person-years) in comparison with the risk of mortality from other causes. Several RCTs are currently underway to address the use of aspirin after diagnosis and treatment of cancer with curative intent, and these results may be of particular value in supporting or refuting these findings, provided they include sufficient numbers of older subjects.

In summary, among generally healthy adults predominantly 70 years of age or older at enrollment and followed for a median of 4.7 years, daily low-dose aspirin was associated with an increased risk of incident solid cancers presenting at an advanced stage. Mortality from both localized and advanced cancers was higher in those taking aspirin, suggesting a possible adverse effect of aspirin on cancer evolution in older adults. Cancer molecular and genetic data give reason to suggest that the potential adverse impact of aspirin identified in ASPREE might be specific to this age group. The cohort continues to be followed to explore the possibility of a delayed reduction in cancer incidence and/or mortality that may emerge with longer-term observation.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^0729d7cc]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Aims

Guidelines recommend against routine initiation of low-dose aspirin in older adults for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. This study aimed to estimate long-term and post-trial effects of aspirin on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major haemorrhage using extended follow-up of participants from the ASPREE trial.

Methods

In-trial (2010–17) and post-trial (2017–22) data were analysed. At enrolment, participants were aged ≥ 70 years (≥ 65 years for US minorities) without prior cardiovascular events, dementia, or independence-limiting physical disability. Randomization was to daily low-dose aspirin or matching placebo for the 4.7 years of the trial.

Results

Of the 19 114 participants randomized (9525 aspirin, 9589 placebo), 15 668 without in-trial MACE consented to post-trial follow-up. No long-term benefit of randomization to aspirin was observed for MACE for the entire in-trial and post-trial period [hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI).94, 1.15]. However, during the post-trial period (median 4.3 years), there was a higher rate of MACE (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01, 1.36) in those randomized to aspirin compared with placebo. Over the entire period, a higher rate of major haemorrhage was observed in the randomized aspirin group compared with placebo (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10, 1.39).

Conclusions

The present study provides novel evidence concerning long-term MACE and haemorrhage following aspirin use in initially healthy older adults. The finding of no long-term MACE benefit needs to be considered in clinical decision-making if aspirin is being considered for use in this context.

### Short-and long-term impact of aspirin cessation in older adults: a target trial emulation [^33c30f95]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The net clinical benefit of daily low-dose aspirin initiation in older populations without clinical manifestation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was unknown until 2018 when the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study was published. The ASPREE trial found that aspirin did not extend disability-free survival or reduce CVD events but increased the risk of major bleeding and cancer death. This evidence led to a recommendation in clinical guidelines against aspirin initiation in older adults for primary prevention of CVD. Notwithstanding this, a recent US national population survey of 50,000 + respondents showed that 46% of individuals aged ≥ 70 years who had no prior history of CVD reported regular aspirin use in 2019, after the ASPREE trial findings were published. As 89% of participants in the ASPREE trial reported no regular aspirin use prior to enrollment, the main ASPREE results primarily addressed whether aspirin should be initiated in older adults and not whether aspirin should be ceased in those who reach older ages while already taking aspirin. Whether it is safe to cease aspirin remained a subject of debate. A randomized trial of deprescribing aspirin (compared to continuation of aspirin use) would be optimal to provide definitive evidence to answer this question. However, such a trial is unlikely to be conducted, and we recognized that ASPREE participants as they transitioned from the trial to post-trial observational follow-up could be informative.

At the conclusion of the ASPREE trial and after a median of 4.7 years of follow-up, approximately 63% of participants were still taking randomized study medication (62% in the aspirin arm and 64% in the placebo arm). All participants received a notification letter directing them to immediately cease study medication. The letter also advised that any participants taking open-label aspirin by recommendation of their doctor should continue to take their aspirin. This provided a unique opportunity to utilize observational data from the period immediately following the intervention phase of ASPREE to emulate an aspirin deprescribing trial. In this context, we designed an analysis of ASPREE's post-intervention period to examine whether aspirin cessation, compared to continuation, impacted short- and long-term risk of CVD, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding in participants who had not experienced any CVD-related clinical event and hence had no indication for aspirin use.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^063d9a35]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Guidelines recommend against routine initiation of low-dose aspirin in older adults for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. This study aimed to estimate long-term and post-trial effects of aspirin on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major haemorrhage using extended follow-up of participants from the ASPREE trial.

Methods

In-trial (2010–17) and post-trial (2017–22) data were analysed. At enrolment, participants were aged ≥ 70 years (≥ 65 years for US minorities) without prior cardiovascular events, dementia, or independence-limiting physical disability. Randomization was to daily low-dose aspirin or matching placebo for the 4.7 years of the trial.

Results

Of the 19 114 participants randomized (9525 aspirin, 9589 placebo), 15 668 without in-trial MACE consented to post-trial follow-up. No long-term benefit of randomization to aspirin was observed for MACE for the entire in-trial and post-trial period [hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) .94, 1.15]. However, during the post-trial period (median 4.3 years), there was a higher rate of MACE (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01, 1.36) in those randomized to aspirin compared with placebo. Over the entire period, a higher rate of major haemorrhage was observed in the randomized aspirin group compared with placebo (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10, 1.39).

Conclusions

The present study provides novel evidence concerning long-term MACE and haemorrhage following aspirin use in initially healthy older adults. The finding of no long-term MACE benefit needs to be considered in clinical decision-making if aspirin is being considered for use in this context.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^e755c57c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Low-dose aspirin has been widely used for primary and secondary prevention of stroke. The balance between potential reduction of ischemic stroke events and increased intracranial bleeding has not been established in older individuals.

Objective

To establish the risks of ischemic stroke and intracranial bleeding among healthy older people receiving daily low-dose aspirin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily low-dose aspirin was conducted among community-dwelling people living in Australia or the US. Participants were older adults free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. Recruitment took place between 2010 and 2014, and participants were followed up for a median (IQR) of 4.7 (3.6–5.7) years. This analysis was completed from August 2021 to March 2023.

Interventions

Daily 100-mg enteric-coated aspirin or matching placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Stroke and stroke etiology were predetermined secondary outcomes and are presented with a focus on prevention of initial stroke or intracranial bleeding event. Outcomes were assessed by review of medical records.

Results

Among 19 114 older adults (10 782 females [56.4%]; median [IQR] age, 74 [71.6–77.7] years), 9525 individuals received aspirin and 9589 individuals received placebo. Aspirin did not produce a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71–1.11). However, a statistically significant increase in intracranial bleeding was observed among individuals assigned to aspirin (108 individuals [1.1%]) compared with those receiving placebo (79 individuals [0.8%]; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.03–1.84). This occurred by an increase in a combination of subdural, extradural, and subarachnoid bleeding with aspirin compared with placebo (59 individuals [0.6%] vs 41 individuals [0.4%]; HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.98–2.16). Hemorrhagic stroke was recorded in 49 individuals (0.5%) assigned to aspirin compared with 37 individuals (0.4%) in the placebo group (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.87–2.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found a significant increase in intracranial bleeding with daily low-dose aspirin but no significant reduction of ischemic stroke. These findings may have particular relevance to older individuals prone to developing intracranial bleeding after head trauma.

### Daily low-dose aspirin and incident type 2 diabetes in community-dwelling healthy older adults: a post-hoc analysis of efficacy and safety in the ASPREE randomised placebo-controlled trial [^9653bb08]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. This study investigated the randomised treatment effect of low-dose aspirin on incident type 2 diabetes and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations among older adults.

Methods

ASPREE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily oral low-dose aspirin. The study population included community-dwelling individuals aged 70 years or older (≥ 65 years for US minority ethnic groups) in the USA and Australia who were free of cardiovascular disease, independence-limiting physical disability, or dementia. For the post-hoc analysis, we excluded participants with diabetes at baseline or with incomplete or missing incident diabetes data during follow-up. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to oral 100 mg daily enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. Incident diabetes was defined as self-reported diabetes, commencement of glucose-lowering medication, or a FPG concentration of 7·0 mmol/L or more assessed at annual follow-up visits among participants with no diabetes at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards models and mixed-model repeated measures to assess the effect of aspirin on incident diabetes and FPG concentrations in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed major bleeding in participants who had taken at least one dose of study medication.

Findings

Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014, a total of 16209 participants were included (8086 [49·9%] randomly assigned to aspirin and 8123 [50·1%] randomly assigned to placebo). During a median follow-up of 4·7 years (IQR 3·6–5·7), 995 (in 6·1% individuals) incident cases of type 2 diabetes were recorded (459 in the aspirin group and 536 in the placebo group). Compared with placebo, the aspirin group had a 15% reduction in risk of incident diabetes (hazard ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·75 to 0·97]; p = 0·013) and a slower rate of increase in FPG concentration at year 5 (between-group difference estimate -0·048 mmol/L [95% CI -0·079 to -0·018]; p = 0·0017). Major bleeding (major gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and clinically significant bleeding at other sites) occurred in 510 (3·2%) of 16104 participants (300 [3·7%] in the aspirin group and 210 [2·6%] in the placebo group). Compared with placebo, the aspirin group had a 44% increase in risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio 1·44 [95% CI 1·21 to 1·72]; p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Aspirin treatment reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes and slowed the increase in FPG concentration but increased major bleeding among community-dwelling older adults. Given the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes among older adults, the potential for anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin to prevent type 2 diabetes or improve glucose levels warrants further study with a comprehensive assessment of all potential safety events of interest.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the elderly [^da1f9b3d]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This trial has many important implications. Previous studies have provided heterogeneous estimates of the benefit of aspirin for primary prevention, but pointed to an increased benefit of aspirin in the elderly. The ASPREE trial has shown that elderly patients that take aspirin prophylactically will derive only harm. At this stage, clinical practice guidelines should not recommend the use of aspirin for otherwise well patients aged 70 or older (or 65 if African–American or Hispanic). Many guidelines already advise not to use aspirin for primary prevention, including the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. However, other guideline organisations offer more circumspect guidance and acknowledge the previous lack of evidence. For instance, the United States Prevention Task Force currently states: 'The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 70 years or older'.he ASPREE trial should lead to a change of guidance.

The study authors of the ASPREE trial published two other linked randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of aspirin on all-cause mortalityand disability free-survival. The results of these studies further support the recommendation not to use aspirin prophylactically in the elderly. Patients that took aspirin had higher rates of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.14; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.29); specifically they had higher rates of cancer-related death (HR, 1.31; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.56). Furthermore, the rate of disability (a composite of death, dementia or persistent physical disability) was no different between those that took aspirin and those that took a placebo (HR, 1.01; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; p = 0.79).

In healthy, community-dwelling elderly people aged 70 and older, aspirin does not prevent cardiovascular disease and does increase one's risk of major haemorrhage. Clinicians should not offer aspirin as primary prevention to otherwise well elderly patients.

### The effect of low-dose aspirin on reversing frailty status in older prefrail and frail adults: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomised clinical trial [^7eb9d781]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that daily low-dose aspirin did not significantly improve frailty status compared to placebo among older adults who were initially classified as prefrail or frail at enrolment into the ASPREE trial. These null findings were consistently supported across multiple analytic approaches and subgroups.

This study assessing the effect of aspirin on frailty reversal in the subset of ASPREE participants who were frail and prefrail at baseline complements our previous work evaluating the effect of aspirin on frailty prevention in the ASPREE participants who were robust at baseline. In that earlier study, we found no statistically significant difference in the development of frailty between the aspirin and placebo groups (FFP HR: 1.04, 95% CI 0.96–1.13, P = 0.39; FI HR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.97–1.10, P = 0.29), which aligns with the findings of the current study. Similar consistency was also observed in the analysis tracking frailty score change over time. The continuity of null findings across both preventive and interventional contexts suggests a lack of clinical benefit from low-dose aspirin on managing frailty in older adults regardless of their baseline frailty status. This has provided important evidence further supporting the current clinical guidelines discouraging routine low-dose aspirin use in adults aged 70 years or older who were free of CVD.

### Effect of aspirin on cancer incidence and mortality in older adults [^9c522a47]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial Design

Details of the ASPREE trial have been described elsewhere (Trial Registration No.: ASPREE ClinicalTrials.gov No. NCT01038583). From March 2010 through December 2014, a total of 19 114 participants across Australia (n = 16 703) and the United States (n = 2411) gave written informed consent and were randomly assigned to receive daily 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin (n = 9525) or matching placebo (n = 9589). A previous history of cancer was not an exclusion criterion and was present in 19% of those randomly assigned. However, all participants were required to be in good health and free of major diseases and expected to survive for at least 5 years (details of follow-up and compliance in Supplementary Methods, available online).

Ascertainment of Cancer Outcomes

Fatal and nonfatal cancers occurring during the randomized treatment phase were a prespecified secondary endpoint. Detailed clinical records, including histopathology reports, were sought from treating practitioners and health-care institutions when evidence of a new or recurrent cancer was recorded, or after a participant had died. If available, TNM staging and histological grading were also collected. When death certificates were the only source of information, cases where cancer was included as the underlying cause of death were included within the dataset (details of blinded adjudication and definitions in Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Box 1 and Supplementary Figure 1, available online).

Analyses were conducted by "person" and by "incident cancer," the former analysis accounting for the number of individuals developing 1 or more "cancer events" (either a new incident cancer that could be localized or distant, or a metastatic recurrence of a cancer diagnosed prior to study entry) during the period of the trial. The incident cancer analysis included each new cancer subtype diagnosis reported and confirmed after random assignment and included the possibility for participants to contribute 2 or more distinct cancer endpoints if the subtype differed. For example, a participant diagnosed with prostate cancer after being randomly assigned, who subsequently developed pancreatic cancer, would contribute 2 incident cancers. If a subsequent death was considered the result of cancer, the cancer considered most likely to have led to the death was determined. Among those who entered the trial with a history of cancer, any new cancer type was included among incident cancers, whereas a local recurrence of the same type was not (see Supplementary Figure 2, available online). Distant recurrence of a primary tumor present at baseline was included as a new metastatic cancer (details in Supplementary Methods, available online).

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^67d6fe97]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The study ASPREE (secondary analysis) was published by Geoffrey C Cloud and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke, Intracerebral hemorrhage and Subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the ASPREE (secondary analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose aspirin in community-dwelling healthy older adults? In the ASPREE (secondary analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ASPREE (secondary analysis) study, the population was: 19114 patients (10782 female, 8332 male). The inclusion criteria were adults, aged ≥ 70 years, without a history of AF, stroke, TIA, or myocardial infarction. The key exclusion criteria were past history of a cardiovascular event or established CVD or AF; dementia; conditions with a high current or recurrent risk of bleeding; anemia; conditions likely to cause death within 5 years; uncontrolled hypertension. In the ASPREE (secondary analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 9525 low-dose aspirin (100 mg enteric-coated aspirin) n = 9589 placebo (matching placebo). In the ASPREE (secondary analysis) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in ischemic stroke (1.5% vs. 1.7%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11). In the ASPREE (secondary analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in hemorrhagic stroke (0.5% vs. 0.4%; HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.04) No significant difference in other intracranial bleeding (0.6% vs. 0.4%; HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.16) Significant increase in total intracranial bleeding (1.1% vs. 0.8%; HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.84). In the ASPREE (secondary analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adults, aged ≥ 70 years, without a history of AF, stroke, TIA, or myocardial infarction, low-dose aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to ischemic stroke.

### Daily low-dose aspirin and risk of serious falls and fractures in healthy older people: a substudy of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^213f6461]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Falls and fractures are frequent and deleterious to the health of older people. Aspirin has been reported to reduce bone fragility and slow bone loss.

Objective

To determine if daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg) reduces the risk of fractures or serious falls (fall-related hospital presentations) in healthy older men and women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This substudy of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial studied older adult men and women in 16 major sites across southeastern Australia. The ASPREE-FRACTURE substudy was conducted as part of the Australian component of the ASPREE trial. Between 2010 and 2014 healthy (free of cardiovascular disease, dementia or physical disability), community-dwelling volunteers aged 70 years or older were recruited to participate in the ASPREE trial. Potentially eligible participants were identified by medical practitioners and trial personnel and were then sent a letter of invitation to participate. Interested participants were screened for suitability. Eligible participants with medical practitioner authorization and adherent to a 4-week run-in medication trial were randomized. Data were analyzed from October 17, 2019, to August 31, 2022.

Interventions

Participants in the intervention group received a daily dose of oral 100 mg enteric-coated (low-dose) aspirin. The control group received a daily identical enteric-coated placebo tablet.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome of ASPREE-FRACTURE was the occurrence of any fracture. The secondary outcome was serious fall resulting in hospital presentation.

Results

In total, 16 703 people with a median (IQR) age of 74 (72–78) years were recruited, and 9179 (55.0%) were women. There were 8322 intervention participants and 8381 control participants included in the primary and secondary outcome analysis of 2865 fractures and 1688 serious falls over the median follow-up of 4.6 years. While there was no difference in the risk of first fracture between the intervention and control participants (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.06; P = 0.50), aspirin was associated with a higher risk of serious falls (total falls 884 vs 804; incidence rate ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03–1.33; P = 0.01). Results remained unchanged in analyses that adjusted for covariates known to influence fracture and fall risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this substudy of a randomized clinical trial, the failure of low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of fractures while increasing the risk of serious falls adds to evidence that this agent provides little favorable benefit in a healthy, White older adult population.

Trial Registration

This substudy is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000347561).

### Effect of aspirin vs placebo on the prevention of depression in older people: a randomized clinical trial [^25136e71]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Depression is associated with increased inflammation, which may precede its onset, especially in older people. Some preclinical data suggest potential antidepressant effects of aspirin, supported by limited observational data suggesting lower rates of depression in individuals treated with aspirin. There currently appears to be no evidence-based pharmacotherapies for the primary prevention of depression.

Objective

To determine whether low-dose aspirin (100 mg) reduces the risk of depression in healthy older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was a substudy of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial, which examined if aspirin increased healthy life span, defined as survival free of dementia and disability. The prespecified secondary outcome was depression. Individuals of all races/ethnicities older than 70 years in Australia, as well as white individuals older than 70 years and black and Hispanic individuals older than 65 years in the United States, were included.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to aspirin (100 mg daily) or placebo, with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 4.7 (3.5–5.6) years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a proxy measure of major depressive disorder defined as a score of 8 or more on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 10-item (CES-D-10) scale.

Results

Of the 19 114 participants enrolled in the trial, 9525 received aspirin and 9589 received a placebo. The mean (SD) age was 75.2(4.0) years in the aspirin group and 75.1(4.5) years in the placebo group; 9531 (56.4%) were women. Participants' demographics and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar between groups. A total of 79 886 annual CES-D-10 measurements were taken, with a mean of 4.2 measurements per participant. There were no significant differences at annual visits in the proportions of CES-D-10scores of 8 or more between the aspirin and placebo groups. The incidence rate of new CES-D-10scores of 8 or more was 70.4 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 69.1 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96–1.08]; P = 0.54).

Conclusions and Relevance

Low-dose aspirin did not prevent depression in this large-scale study of otherwise healthy older adults.

### Role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^da4688ce]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits of aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, and low-dose aspirin is uniformly recommended in this setting. However, no clear consensus exists about whether, and if so in whom, aspirin therapy is appropriate for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Three trials of low-dose aspirin versus placebo in three populations at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the absence of established cardiovascular disease were reported in 2018. The ASPREE trial in elderly people was terminated early for futility because aspirin had no effect on disability-free survival but significantly increased the risk of major haemorrhage and, unexpectedly, all-cause mortality. In the ASCEND trial in patients with diabetes mellitus and no evidence of vascular disease, aspirin significantly reduced serious vascular events but increased major bleeding. In the ARRIVE trial in people with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, aspirin had no effect on major cardiovascular events but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this Review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to appraise whether the new evidence is likely to enable the more targeted use of aspirin in particular individuals for whom the net benefit is both clinically worthwhile and statistically definite.

### Effect of low-dose aspirin versus placebo on incidence of anemia in the elderly: a secondary analysis of the aspirin in reducing events in the elderly trial [^682f3c2b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Daily low-dose aspirin increases major bleeding; however, few studies have investigated its effect on iron deficiency and anemia.

Objective

To investigate the effect of low-dose aspirin on incident anemia, hemoglobin, and serum ferritin concentrations.

Design

Post hoc analysis of the ASPREE (ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01038583).

Setting

Primary/community care in Australia and the United States.

Participants

Community-dwelling persons aged 70 years or older (≥ 65 years for Black persons and Hispanic persons).

Intervention

100 mg of aspirin daily or placebo.

Measurements

Hemoglobin concentration was measured annually in all participants. Ferritin was measured at baseline and 3 years after random assignment in a large subset.

Results

19114 persons were randomly assigned. Anemia incidence in the aspirin and placebo groups was 51.2 events and 42.9 events per 1000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.12 to 1.29]). Hemoglobin concentrations declined by 3.6 g/L per 5 years in the placebo group and the aspirin group experienced a steeper decline by 0.6 g/L per 5 years (CI, 0.3 to 1.0 g/L). In 7139 participants with ferritin measures at baseline and year 3, the aspirin group had greater prevalence than placebo of ferritin levels less than 45 µg/L at year 3 (465 [13%] vs. 350 [9.8%]) and greater overall decline in ferritin by 11.5% (CI, 9.3% to 13.7%) compared with placebo. A sensitivity analysis quantifying the effect of aspirin in the absence of major bleeding produced similar results.

Limitations

Hemoglobin was measured annually. No data were available on causes of anemia.

Conclusion

Low-dose aspirin increased incident anemia and decline in ferritin in otherwise healthy older adults, independent of major bleeding. Periodic monitoring of hemoglobin should be considered in older persons on aspirin.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^355da099]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prior to 2018, there was insufficient evidence to reliably inform whether daily, low-dose aspirin offered a potential benefit in older persons without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized clinical trial (RCT) found that aspirin did not extend disability-free survival or significantly reduce CVD events over a median of 4.7 years, but increased the risk of major haemorrhage and cancer death. This evidence contributed to new recommendations in clinical guidelines against routine aspirin initiation in older adults for primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD events. Notwithstanding this, after the guidelines were updated, an estimated 23%–46% of older adults in the US population still regularly take low-dose aspirin for primary prevention.

We have previously reported the immediate effects of aspirin within the ASPREE trial, both as a randomized comparison with placebo(and according to actual use and non-use of aspirin) including a hazard ratio (HR) of.95 [95% confidence interval (CI).83, 1.08] for CVD events, a secondary endpoint. We also reported effects on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included the conditions related to ischaemia and thrombosis that are most likely to be affected favourably by low-dose aspirin. Concerning MACE, a HR of.89 (95% CI.77, 1.03) for effects of aspirin vs placebo was seen in-trial. This, while not statistically significant, was of a magnitude consistent with significant results in meta-analyses. Specifically, meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention both before and after ASPREE and two contemporary trials [A Study of Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes (ASCEND) and Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events (ARRIVE) in patients at moderate risk of CVD] showed significant reductions in vascular event rates in those assigned aspirin. These meta-analyses also found that any reduction in vascular events was accompanied by significantly elevated risk of major haemorrhage and no significant benefit on either vascular or all-cause death. Thus, consideration of aspirin for use in the primary prevention of MACE must weigh up relatively small cardiovascular benefits against established bleeding risks. This balance is of particular importance in older adults for whom the risks of both CVD events and bleeding are substantially elevated and in whom the ASPREE study found an elevated risk of all-cause death with aspirin.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^18bd4c6c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of ASPREE was disability-free survival (defined as survival free of physical disability and dementia), and this was not different between aspirin and placebo groups. This has been reported, along with overall mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

Stroke and hemorrhagic events were predetermined secondary end points. Suspected events within these categories were independently adjudicated by at least 2 members of an expert committee (G.C.C. J.D.W. C.B.E. and G. A.D.). Adjudications were supported by copies of patient routine hospital care records; these included results of key investigations, such as reports from brain and vascular imaging studies and cardiological testing. Disagreements were adjudicated by a third member and consensus reached. Further details of the adjudication processes were described previously.

Using modified Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria, 4 subgroups of ischemic stroke were reported. These were cardioembolic (ischemic stroke with a clear cardiac cause, typically atrial fibrillation), large-vessel atherosclerosis (ipsilateral ischemic stroke with a ≥ 50% extra or intracranial stenosis seen on vascular imaging), small-vessel occlusion (ischemic stroke with a clinical lacunar stroke syndrome and evidence on imaging of a lacunar infarction [subcortical infarct of < 15-mm maximal diameter]), and undetermined etiology (reported when ≥ 2 causes were identified, the evaluation was complete and no cause found, or etiological investigations were incomplete).

Intracranial hemorrhage was reported according to the location identified on imaging (ie, basal ganglionic, lobar, brainstem, or other) or as subarachnoid, subdural, or extradural. Such bleeding was required to have led to hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, surgery, or death.

### Association of aspirin use with mortality risk among older adult participants in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial [^d2fc8246]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin use of 10 years or more is estimated to reduce cancer incidence and mortality. Across epidemiological studies, the most significant reductions in risk have been noted in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Notably, results from the NIH-AARP study, the Nurses' Health Study, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, demonstrated that long-term regular aspirin use was associated with reduced risk of obesity- and inflammation-associated cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). This result has been additionally illustrated in a 2010 meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. The association of aspirin with reduced cancer incidence and mortality has been consistently robust among GI cancers; however, there is limited evidence suggesting that aspirin use is associated with reduced mortality risk among other cancer types. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends low-dose aspirin use for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and CRC among average-risk individuals aged 50 to 59 years with a 10% or greater 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease; however, individuals aged 60 to 69 years should have an individualized approach, while evidence for use among individuals 70 years and older remains insufficient. It is important to note that a 2015 systematic review of the literature by the USPSTFfound that individuals with daily aspirin dosing up to 1200 mg for a duration of 4 or more years exhibited a significant reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality, demonstrating a similar benefit of low-dose and standard aspirin.

Recently, the results of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) studydrew further attention of the potential cancer preventive effect of aspirin. The ASPREE study was a randomized clinical trial conducted in the United States and Australia investigating the efficacy of 100 mg of aspirin daily vs placebo in extending disability-free survival among elderly individuals (recruitment age 65 years or 70 years) during 4.7 years of follow-up. Unexpectedly, an increased risk of all-cause and cancer-related death was observed in the group randomized to aspirin.

Thus, based on the results of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial that conflict with the preponderance of data showing a benefit of aspirin use, we examined the association of aspirin use with mortality risk among older adults enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. In addition, given data suggesting that aspirin may be less effective among individuals who are overweight or obese, we conducted exploratory analyses stratified by body mass index (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

### The effect of low-dose aspirin on reversing frailty status in older prefrail and frail adults: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomised clinical trial [^74826c20]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that low-dose aspirin, compared to placebo, does not attenuate progression or improve frailty in prefrail or frail older adults. Future research may need to explore an integrated approach involving both pharmacological treatment and lifestyle modification for managing frailty.

### Effect of aspirin on disability-free survival in the healthy elderly [^c31984ec]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Information on the use of aspirin to increase healthy independent life span in older persons is limited. Whether 5 years of daily low-dose aspirin therapy would extend disability-free life in healthy seniors is unclear.

Methods

From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling persons in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥ 65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or physical disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg per day of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo orally. The primary end point was a composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability. Secondary end points reported in this article included the individual components of the primary end point and major hemorrhage.

Results

A total of 19,114 persons with a median age of 74 years were enrolled, of whom 9525 were randomly assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 56.4% of the participants were women, 8.7% were nonwhite, and 11.0% reported previous regular aspirin use. The trial was terminated at a median of 4.7 years of follow-up after a determination was made that there would be no benefit with continued aspirin use with regard to the primary end point. The rate of the composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability was 21.5 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 21.2 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 1.11; P = 0.79). The rate of adherence to the assigned intervention was 62.1% in the aspirin group and 64.1% in the placebo group in the final year of trial participation. Differences between the aspirin group and the placebo group were not substantial with regard to the secondary individual end points of death from any cause (12.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group), dementia, or persistent physical disability. The rate of major hemorrhage was higher in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (3.8% vs. 2.8%; hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.62; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Aspirin use in healthy elderly persons did not prolong disability-free survival over a period of 5 years but led to a higher rate of major hemorrhage than placebo. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging and others; ASPREE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01038583 .).

### Effect of aspirin on cancer incidence and mortality in older adults [^7b7c42f9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Cox proportional-hazards models were used in intention-to-treat analyses to compare aspirin and placebo groups on time-to-event cancer outcomes during the intervention phase of the trial (on or prior to June 12, 2017, median of 4.7 years follow-up for both groups). An analysis was performed for the event of "first diagnosis" of cancer of any type (ie, incident cancers) that occurred during the trial, and a separate set of analyses, 1 for each anatomical cancer type, was also conducted. These analyses were all time to first event, and if participants experienced multiple anatomical cancer types, then only their first occurrence contributed to the analysis of "cancer of any type," and their first occurrence of each specific anatomical type contributed to that anatomical type's analysis. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HR) were determined for total cancer, nonmetastatic cancer, metastatic cancer, and specific cancer types with censoring at the time of the competing risk of death. The proportional hazards assumption was checked for all models by using a test based on Schoenfeld residuals. A competing risk model was used to develop the cumulative incidence plots.

Subgroups that were prespecified in the trial protocol included country of residence, age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index category, prior regular use of aspirin, baseline history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and prior cancer history. Effect heterogeneity between subgroups was assessed with omnibus tests of whether coefficients for interaction terms in Cox proportional-hazards models were different from zero. All P values are 2-sided, with cut point for statistical significance P less than.05, and all analyses were restricted to events that occurred on, or prior to, the end of the treatment phase.

Compliance With Ethical Standards

The ASPREE trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1964 as revised in 2008, the National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines on Human Experimentation, the federal patient privacy (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) law, and the International Conference of Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. ASPREE also follows the Code of Federal Regulations as it relates to areas of clinical research.

### Evaluation of aspirin use with cancer incidence and survival among older adults in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial [^1c51effa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin is recommended for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in individuals aged 50 to 59 years with high risk for that disease, with the additional stated benefit of a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. However, for those aged 60 to 69 years, recommendations are based on personalized risk-benefit profiles, and there is limited data for individuals younger than 50 years or older than 70 years. Despite potential risks, between 25% and 50% of adults in the United States have reported taking aspirin daily or every other day, with usage increasing with age. Long-term aspirin use has been associated with decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer (particularly gastrointestinal cancers), and all-cause mortality. Recent research suggests that aspirin use may offer protection against the development of and mortality from other cancer types as well. However, the benefits and harms of taking low-dose aspirin in older individuals is still debated, particularly in light of data from the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study that indicated increased cancer-associated mortality — but not cancer incidence — with long-term aspirin use in individuals aged 65 years or older who were not taking aspirin before study enrollment.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^30d372c8]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The ASPREE was a large-scale placebo-controlled randomized trial (NCT01038583) of daily low-dose (100 mg) enteric-coated aspirin conducted in 19 114 adults aged over 70 years residing in Australia and the USA (≥ 65 years for US minorities) who had no prior cardiovascular events, dementia, or independence-limiting physical disability at trial enrolment. The median enrolment age of the cohort was 74 years [interquartile range (IQR) 72–78]. Recruitment was undertaken between 2010 and 2014, and participants were followed for a median of 4.7 years (IQR 3.6–5.7) during the in-trial period. The ASPREE protocol included the annual distribution of study drug supply bottles to participants with receipt and pill counting, of the prior year's unused medication.

The trial ended 6 months early on 12 June 2017 due to conditional power calculations showing it was unlikely that a beneficial effect on the primary endpoint of disability-free survival would be shown. At this time, a notification letter was sent to all participants advising them to cease taking study medication immediately and return unused pills to their study coordinator. The letter also advised that any participant taking open-label aspirin on the recommendation of their treating doctors should continue to do so.

From 13 June 2017, participants provided consent to ASPREE-eXTension (ASPREE-XT), an extended observational period. For a further 15 months, participants remained blinded to their study medication assignment and unaware of the trial's principal findings. An unblinding letter including a summary of the trial's findings was sent to all participants on 14 September 2018 when the results were published.

During both the ASPREE (in-trial) and ASPREE-XT (post-trial) periods, a wide range of clinical data were collected from participants via scheduled annual in-person visits and 6-monthly telephone calls. For those who were unable to be seen directly or contacted, a telephone call visit or review of the participant's medical records was conducted by research staff. The present analysis uses data from randomization until the fourth ASPREE-XT annual visit, conducted in 2021–22.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^28c6702c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

These data extend previously reported findings on stroke outcomes in ASPREE by focusing on first stroke and bleeding events and by directly comparing the potential benefit of aspirin on ischemic stroke prevention with risks of intracranial bleeding. Findings relate to a relatively healthy older population with extensive levels of blood pressure and lipid management and without preexisting cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. No subgroups were identified in which the effect of aspirin was substantially different from the mean.

The lack of an effect of aspirin in reducing ischemic stroke was notable given the higher age-related risk in this population and reported efficacy of aspirin in secondary stroke prevention. Of strokes occurring in the trial, 78.4% were adjudicated as ischemic in origin, and among etiological subtypes, the largest differences between individuals assigned to aspirin or placebo were in strokes caused by small vessel occlusion (11 cases fewer) and those of presumed cardioembolic origin (9 cases fewer). However, there was little difference in ischemic strokes of large-vessel origin in which an antiplatelet like aspirin may be anticipated to be most effective. The lack of benefit in this subgroup may be due to chance with small numbers. However, the finding is in keeping with the results of an early randomized placebo-controlled trial of aspirin (325 mg/d) in 372 individuals with a 50% or greater asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis, which showed no evidence of benefit over 2 years of follow-up.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^d8c6b4f4]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, the ASPREE randomized clinical trial is the first large-scale trial to study the risks and benefits of aspirin in an exclusively older primary prevention population, in which an increased tendency to bleeding may alter the balance of risks and benefits of aspirin. This is particularly relevant to intracerebral events because intracranial hemorrhage is typically less treatable than ischemic events and more frequently fatal or disabling. With previous aspirin trials in mostly younger participants, an excess of intracerebral hemorrhagic events was frequently noted among individuals receiving active treatment, although numbers were small and in most cases did not approach statistical significance.

The principal finding of this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial was an increase in intracerebral hemorrhagic events, which in absolute terms outweighed a smaller and nonsignificant reduction in ischemic strokes. Despite the older age of the cohort, incidences of both types of events were low, with an overall rate of 5.8 per 1000 person-years of follow-up. The incidence of ischemic stroke was 0.5 incidents per 1000 person-years of follow-up lower, which was not statistically significant, while that of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.7 incidents higher, which was statistically significant.

### Short-and long-term impact of aspirin cessation in older adults: a target trial emulation [^71a60102]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The net benefit of aspirin cessation in older adults remains uncertain. This study aimed to use observational data to emulate a randomized trial of aspirin cessation versus continuation in older adults without cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

Post hoc analysis using a target trial emulation framework applied to the immediate post-trial period (2017–2021) of a study of low-dose aspirin initiation in adults aged ≥ 70 years (ASPREE; NCT01038583). Participants from Australia and the USA were included if they were free of CVD at the start of the post-trial intervention period (time zero, T0) and had been taking open-label or randomized aspirin immediately before T0. The two groups in the target trial were as follows: aspirin cessation (participants who were taking randomized aspirin immediately before T0; assumed to have stopped at T0 as instructed) versus aspirin continuation (participants on open-label aspirin at T0 regardless of their randomized treatment; assumed to have continued at T0). The outcomes after T0 were incident CVD, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), all-cause mortality, and major bleeding during 3, 6, and 12 months (short-term) and 48 months (long-term) follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) comparing aspirin cessation to continuation were estimated from propensity-score (PS) adjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression models.

Results

We included 6103 CVD-free participants (cessation: 5427, continuation: 676). Over both short- and long-term follow-up, aspirin cessation versus continuation was not associated with elevated risk of CVD, MACE, and all-cause mortality (HRs, at 3 and 48 months respectively, were 1.23 and 0.73 for CVD, 1.11 and 0.84 for MACE, and 0.23 and 0.79 for all-cause mortality, p > 0.05), but cessation had a reduced risk of incident major bleeding events (HRs at 3 and 48 months, 0.16 and 0.63, p < 0.05). Similar findings were seen for all outcomes at 6 and 12 months, except for a lowered risk of all-cause mortality in the cessation group at 12 months.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that deprescribing prophylactic aspirin might be safe in healthy older adults with no known CVD.

Results

Participants

Baseline characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1 showing treatment groups well balanced in terms of established or putative risk factors for cancer. Prior aspirin use was low (11.0%) and balanced across groups (aspirin n = 1053, placebo n = 1041). At the end of the trial, the total number of years during which participants were at risk of cancer mortality was 44 007 person-years in the aspirin group and 44 382 person-years in the placebo group. At trial entry, 3660 (19.1%) had a prior diagnosis of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), 15 375 (80.4%) were not known to have cancer prior to random assignment, and the cancer history status was unknown for 79 (0.4%) (see Table 1). The compliance to study medication, expressed as a proportion of the time in study that an individual spent taking randomized medication, was on average 72.7% for the aspirin group and 74.5% for the placebo group.

Table 1.
Baseline characteristics of the ASPREE population by treatment group

Incidence

Table 2 indicates that 981 individuals in the aspirin group and 952 in the placebo group had a first incident cancer after random assignment, regardless of whether they had a past cancer history at baseline. Corresponding numbers of deaths adjudicated as caused by cancer are also shown. During the in-trial follow-up, 1933 (10.1%) were diagnosed with a new incident cancer. Among these, 1270 (65.7%) presented with localized cancer (ie, nonmetastatic cancer), 363 (18.8%) presented with new metastatic disease (ie, incident metastatic disease), 113 (5.8%) presented with metastatic disease of a cancer type already present before study entry (ie, metastatic recurrence), and 187 (9.7%) with a hematological or lymphatic cancer (subgroup analyses Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, available online). A total of 495 (25.6%) participants died as a result of their malignancy; of these, 52 died from progression of a cancer initially diagnosed prior to trial entry (Table 2; CONSORT diagram, Supplementary Figure 3, available online).

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^cec32be4]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Major adverse cardiovascular events

Participants were followed for a median of 4.3 years (IQR 4.0–4.6) for MACE and major haemorrhage in the post-trial period.

Long-term effects of aspirin were estimated to be close to null (HRs close to 1) for MACE for the entire period including the in-trial and post-trial follow-up (median follow-up of 8.3 years, IQR 7.0–9.5) (Table 2). Adjusting for baseline covariates did not change these results (see Supplementary data online, Table S4). Subgroup analysis also showed no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects for MACE (Figure 2). Consistently, differences in restricted mean time lost between the randomized aspirin and placebo groups were generally estimated to be close to zero days (see Supplementary data online, Table S5).

Effects of aspirin as randomized on first major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause death in the ASPREE trial and post-trial

However, the effect of aspirin on MACE changed over the full period of follow-up. This was evidenced by the proportional hazards assumption not being satisfied, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 3. Specifically, during the post-trial period, there were higher rates of MACE (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02, 1.37) and also myocardial infarction (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01, 1.54) in those randomized to aspirin compared with those randomized to placebo, whereas during the trial, these rates were lower in the aspirin group compared with placebo (Table 2). The increased risk of MACE post-trial in those randomized to aspirin was not limited to the first year of post-trial follow-up (see Supplementary data online, Figure S2).

### The effect of low-dose aspirin on reversing frailty status in older prefrail and frail adults: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomised clinical trial [^cfe4a596]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

These observations raise an important consideration: it remains unclear whether the absence of effect in ASPREE reflects an insufficient dose and exposure duration to meaningfully influence frailty-related biology. Low-dose aspirin exerts its antithrombotic effect primarily through irreversible inhibition of platelet COX-1, leading to reduced thromboxane A2 production and subsequent suppression of platelet aggregation. Its efficacy in this regard is comparable to that of higher doses. However, meaningful COX-2 inhibition, which is required to suppress the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins like PGE2, typically necessitates higher systemic concentrations of aspirin. Since COX-2 is inducible and more transiently expressed during inflammatory states, especially in ageing tissues, low-dose aspirin may fall short in modulating this isoenzyme to a clinically relevant extent.

That said, the assumption that higher dosing ensures greater anti-inflammatory efficacy is not strongly supported by clinical data. A 6-week randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial by Hovens et al. investigated the effects of both 100 and 300 mg aspirin in type 2 diabetic patients without cardiovascular disease. Both 100 and 300 mg doses yielded comparable reductions in inflammatory markers, with no statistically significant difference observed during the intervention. While the short duration of this trial may limit its applicability to chronic inflammatory states such as frailty, these findings suggest that simply increasing aspirin dosage may not be sufficient to overcome its limited systemic anti-inflammatory potential. It is also worth noting that higher doses also bring a higher risk of adverse effect risks such as bleeding in frail individuals, and any therapeutic effect at higher doses may be offset by this. While our study shows neutral effect of aspirin on frailty, it does not preclude the potential for other anti-inflammatory agents to confer protective effects against frailty. Future trials investigating medications with more potent or targeted anti-inflammatory effects, still represent promising opportunities for frailty prevention and treatment.

### Short-and long-term impact of aspirin cessation in older adults: a target trial emulation [^3ff86008]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The significant decrease in major bleeding risk with aspirin cessation throughout the entire follow-up period and a decreased risk in all-cause mortality with aspirin cessation at 12 months in our analysis supports clinical guidelines that recommend against aspirin use in this age group for primary prevention due to its significantly increased risk of major bleeding events and lack of overall benefit. The weakened association between aspirin continuation and bleeding risk at 4-year follow-up may be explained by the participants on open-label aspirin being made aware of the ASPREE trial results at 15 months after T0 and opting to stop open-label aspirin use at that time. When analyses were adjusted for treatment adherence, the evidence of elevated bleeding risk in the continuation group was even more compelling. The cumulative incidence plot suggests that the bleeding risk between the aspirin cessation and continuation groups differentiated soon after the commencement of follow-up. These findings agree with our previous analysis of the ASPREE participants when they entered the trial, approximately 4–5 years earlier. In that post hoc analysis, we restricted to individuals reporting aspirin use prior to randomization (≥ 2 days/week) and investigated the effect of aspirin cessation (randomized placebo) versus continuation (randomized aspirin) at the start of trial. Discontinuing aspirin (through randomization to placebo) had no impact on CVD, MACE, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding events compared with continued aspirin use over a median of 4.7-year follow-up. The robustness of that analysis was limited by the small sample size (n = 1714) and a 4-week placebo run-in phase for the trial that prevented capture of the short-term unmasking effect, although the findings were echoed in meta-analysis with another similar trial. The present study reported here reinforces our conclusions from the previous analysis, and together the findings reassure the benefits of aspirin cessation (reducing bleeding risk) in older adults in the context of primary CVD prevention, an aspect which has often been less emphasized compared with its potential in increasing CVD risk. More studies with high-quality data and larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm our results.

### The effect of low-dose aspirin on reversing frailty status in older prefrail and frail adults: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomised clinical trial [^3e2e52a1]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic low-grade inflammation is hypothesised as a central driver of frailty. This study aims to evaluate whether low-dose aspirin can reverse frailty status among initially prefrail/frail older adults.

Methods

This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE), a randomised, placebo-controlled trial, involving community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years. The median (Interquartile range) follow-up was 4.7 (3.6–5.7) years. We included participants who were prefrail or frail at baseline, with frailty assessed using two validated measures: the Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP) and the Deficit-Accumulation Frailty Index (FI). Frailty reversal was defined as a transition to a less severe state (from frail to prefrail/nonfrail, prefrail to nonfrail). The discrete-time survival model was used for outcome analysis; linear mixed-effects models compared longitudinal frailty trajectories between the treatment arms.

Results

Among 6595 and 8766 participants included in the FFP and FI analyses, respectively, there was no significant difference in frailty status reversal between aspirin and placebo groups (FFP-HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92–1.07; FI-HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.94–1.07). No significant difference was found in the change of FFP counts (β = 0.014, SE = 0.007, P = 0.06) and FI score (β = 0.0004, SE = 0.004, P = 0.37) between the aspirin and placebo groups over time, suggesting that aspirin neither reversed nor worsened frailty severity. Subgroup analyses revealed no effect modification by frailty risk factors such as age, sex, race and medical history.

Conclusion

Low-dose aspirin has no effect in reversing frailty among prefrail and frail individuals. The findings highlight the need to explore alternative anti-inflammatory medications for frailty management.

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of older adults, there was no statistically significant benefit from aspirin in preventing stroke or any conventional stroke etiological subtype. However, aspirin significantly increased the overall risk of intracranial bleeding. These data support the recommendation of the USPSTF that low-dose aspirin should not be prescribed for primary prevention in healthy older adults.

### Non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in colorectal cancer: a review of clinical studies [^7868c4a2]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of aspirin in CRC chemoprevention has been well-studied and widely reported. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses generally conclude that aspirin use is associated with a decreased incidence of colonic adenomas, and CRCs in young- to middle-aged populations. Indeed, there is robust evidence for low- and high-dose aspirin (the latter targeting COX2 compared to targeting COX-1 with low-dose aspirin, in addition to COX-independent pathways) in the prevention of adenomas in hereditary conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome. Both conditions involve specific genetic mutations that pre-dispose individuals to CRC. There is also evidence supporting the association between aspirin use and reduced CRC-related mortality in certain subgroups, such as tumours overexpressing COX2 and proximal CRCs. However, conflicting findings were demonstrated in the recently published Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) Trial. ASPREE demonstrated higher all-cause mortality among healthy older adults who received daily low-dose aspirin as primary prevention, compared to those who received a placebo. The main contributor to this was a greater risk of death attributed to cancer, accompanied by a higher incidence of cancer in the aspirin group for late-stage cancers. In particular, at a median follow-up of 4.7 years, aspirin was associated with an elevated CRC mortality rate, though not CRC incidence. This is in contrast to previously published literature on the association between aspirin and decreased mortality related to CRC, and other cancers, although the bulk of this work has been conducted on young- to middle-aged or high-risk populations. It has been postulated that the concurrent use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (NA-NSAIDs) may need to be explored further to understand these results.

There is an increasing body of literature exploring connections between non-aspirin NSAIDs (NA-NSAIDs) and adenoma and CRC chemoprevention. This review aims to understand the potential roles of NA-NSAIDs, alone or in combination with aspirin, in mitigating the risk of polyposis, CRC incidence and cancer-related outcomes. It will also review the data surrounding the safety of NA-NSAIDs in this specific setting.

### Identifying and reducing inappropriate aspirin use in primary care [^749194ad]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

The ARRIVE study was conducted in seven countries and assessed the efficacy of aspirin 100 mg daily in reducing the risk of major CV events for patients at moderate risk, defined as the presence of three or more cardiovascular risk factors in men aged 55 or older and women aged 60 or older. The authors found no significant difference in a composite endpoint of MI, stroke, CV death, unstable angina or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) but did find significantly more gastrointestinal bleeding events in the aspirin group. The ASCEND study evaluated patients with diabetes and included both high-risk and low-risk patient groups. Findings from the ASCEND study demonstrated a reduction in CV events but more frequent bleeding events. Lastly, the ASPREE study investigated the utility of aspirin in prolonging the lives of healthy community-dwelling older adults with no history of vascular disease. There was no difference in a composite endpoint of death, the onset of dementia and persistent physical disability, and the study was terminated early. Notably, this population had an increased risk of all-cause mortality, primarily cancer-related death. Though many types of cancer were observed, there was a higher rate of death from colorectal cancer.

In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released updated primary prevention guidelines recommending that providers carefully assess atherosclerotic CVD risk and weigh this against bleeding risk before prescribing aspirin for primary prevention. Furthermore, these guidelines explicitly recommend against low-dose aspirin use for adults aged 70 and older. Though not published at this pilot study initiation, the USPSTF published a draft recommendation in October 2021 encouraging providers to avoid initiating low-dose aspirin for primary CV prevention in patients 60 years and older. In April 2022, the USPSTF published its final recommendations. For adults 40–59 with an ASCVD risk of 10% or greater, aspirin use for primary prevention should be made on a case-by-case basis. For adults aged 60 years and older, aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention of CVD. Based on the supporting evidence used to generate these recommendations, the USPSTF also highlights that while the benefit of aspirin use is cumulative with time, the net benefit becomes smaller with age due to the increased risk of bleeding and suggests that it may be reasonable to discontinue aspirin at age 75 years or older. The Task Force does highlight the need for long-term data assessing the effects of low-dose aspirin on bleeding risk and colorectal cancer risk and mortality.

### Low-dose aspirin and progression of age-related hearing loss: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^907eca24]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study ASPREE-Hearing was published by David P Q Clark and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Presbycusis. In the ASPREE-Hearing study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose aspirin in the progression of age-related hearing loss in healthy older adults? In the ASPREE-Hearing study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ASPREE-Hearing study, the population was: 279 patients (125 female, 154 male). The inclusion criteria were healthy community-dwelling individuals aged ≥ 70 years. The key exclusion criteria were history of a cardiovascular event; serious intercurrent illness likely to cause death within 5 years; cognitive impairment or dementia; disability; bilateral extended-wear or internal hearing aids or bilateral cochlear implants. In the ASPREE-Hearing study, the interventions were: n = 138 aspirin (100 mg daily dose of enteric-coated aspirin) n = 141 placebo (matching placebo). In the ASPREE-Hearing study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in mean deterioration in 4-frequency average hearing threshold at year 3 (3.3 dB vs. 3 dB; MD 0.31, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.34). In the ASPREE-Hearing study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean deterioration in speech reception threshold at year 3 (0.9 dB vs. 0.9 dB; MD -0.1, 95% CI -1.2 to 1) No significant difference in mean deterioration in 4 kHz sound frequency at year 3 (4.5 dB vs. 4.4 dB; MD 0.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 1.7). In the ASPREE-Hearing study, the conclusion was: in healthy community-dwelling individuals aged ≥ 70 years, aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to mean deterioration in 4-frequency average hearing threshold at year 3.

### Effect of aspirin on cancer incidence and mortality in older adults [^6bb453f9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the multiple analyses undertaken without statistical control for multiple testing, the possibility that findings have arisen by chance, or from a bias in the ascertainment of relevant outcomes, must also be considered. However, the objective endpoint of all-cause mortality was statistically significantly higher among those randomly assigned to aspirin and is less likely to be a chance finding. The difference in cancer mortality explained virtually all of this difference. The process for allocating cause of death required blinded adjudicators to confirm all cancer diagnoses and determine the underlying reason for the trajectory to death, which reduced the likelihood of biased ascertainment of cancer endpoints. In an older age group, where multimorbidity is common and clinical investigations may be limited, the illness ultimately leading to death frequently requires a review of clinical documentation to determine the most likely pathology. This process was undertaken to review all deaths occurring during ASPREE, in contrast with earlier aspirin trials.

The results might also be explained if there was a bias in the ascertainment of the outcome, most obviously, if aspirin led to a systematic delay in the recognition of cancer, so that among those taking aspirin, cancer was diagnosed at a more advanced stage. However, this is unlikely because we did not observe a time-dependent compensatory decrease in incidence of stages 1–3 cancers that would offset the observed increase in the incidence of stage 4 cancer. As reported previously, the difference also did not appear to be explained by differences in the mode of death, for example, if aspirin increased the likelihood of a patient with cancer dying prematurely from hemorrhage or infection.

During more prolonged follow-up of participants in earlier primary and secondary prevention trials, a delayed protective effect of aspirin on cancer incidence and mortality has been observed, particularly for colorectal cancers. In 2010, Rothwell and colleagues reported a long-term follow-up of participants from 4 large random assignment trials of aspirin (75–300 mg/d), which found that allocation to aspirin reduced the 20-year risk of cancer mortality (HR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.88), and the benefit increased with treatment duration. In the Women's Health Study (alternate-day 100 mg aspirin), aspirin was associated with reduced colorectal cancer incidence that became apparent during subsequent posttrial follow-up 10 years after random assignment. These results are suggestive of a delayed benefit of aspirin and emphasize the importance of ongoing follow-up of the ASPREE cohort.

### Low-dose aspirin and progression of age-related hearing loss: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^fb8e2264]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does daily low-dose aspirin slow the progression of age-related hearing loss in healthy older adults aged 70 years or older?

Findings

In this prespecified secondary analysis comprising 279 participants aged 70 years or older in the randomized ASPREE clinical trial, aspirin use did not affect the age-related decline in hearing threshold or in binaural speech perception threshold compared with placebo over a follow-up period of 3 years.

Meaning

This study suggests that, in healthy older adults, low-dose aspirin does not affect the progression of age-related hearing loss.

### Low-dose aspirin and progression of age-related hearing loss: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^f2d5bc36]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Age-related hearing loss is common in an aging population, affecting communication and contributing to a worsened quality of life. It occurs as a result of cochlear degeneration and may be further exacerbated by inflammation and microvascular changes, as observed in animal models.

Objective

To compare the effect of daily low-dose aspirin vs placebo on the progression of age-related hearing loss in healthy older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prespecified secondary analysis was conducted of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized clinical trial. Participants were 279 healthy community-dwelling individuals living in Australia who were aged 70 years or older and free of overt cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and life-limiting illnesses. Participants were recruited between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, and followed up over 3 years. Statistical analysis was completed from June to December 2023.

Intervention

A 100-mg daily dose of enteric-coated aspirin or matching placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hearing measures were air conduction audiometry and binaural speech perception in noise. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 18 months, and 3 years. The change from baseline hearing measures were analyzed using an intention to treat approach. Aspirin and placebo were compared using mixed linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and smoking.

Results

Of 279 participants, 154 (55%) were male, and the median age at baseline was 73.1 years (IQR, 71.5–76.2 years). A total of 98 of 138 participants (71%) in the aspirin group and 94 of 141 participants (67%) in the placebo group reported experiencing hearing loss at baseline. Compared with placebo, aspirin did not affect the changes in mean (SD) 4-frequency average hearing threshold from baseline to year 3 (aspirin: baseline, 27.8 [13.3] dB; year 3, 30.7 [13.7] dB; difference, 3.3 [3.9] dB; placebo: baseline, 27.5 [12.6] dB; year 3, 30.9 [13.8] dB; difference, 3.0 [4.8] dB; P = 0.55) nor any other tested frequencies. An increase in air conduction threshold indicates a deterioration in hearing. Similarly, for the mean (SD) speech reception threshold, there was no significant difference observed between the aspirin and placebo group at the year 3 follow-up assessment (aspirin: baseline, -9.9 [3.8] dB; year 3, -9.1 [3.8] dB; difference, 0.9 [2.9] dB; placebo: baseline, -10.5 [7.1] dB; year 3, -9.6 [4.1] dB; difference, 0.9 [5.9] dB; P = 0.86). The findings were consistent across sex, age groups, diabetic and smoking status.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial, low-dose aspirin did not affect the progression of age-related hearing loss. More investigation is warranted on whether a longer follow-up or the use of a more powerful anti-inflammatory agent might prove beneficial.

### Association of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and aspirin with colorectal cancer incidence in older adults [^0e6df81f]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) which explored whether daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg), vs placebo, prolonged disability-free survival in 19 114 otherwise healthy Australian and American adults aged 70+ years (65+ years for American minorities). Colorectal cancer (CRC) was the most common cancer diagnosis, excluding the sex-specific cancers (prostate and breast cancer), documented during the ASPREE RCT. No effect of aspirin on CRC incidence was detected (HR Aspirin vs Placebo = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.30).

These findings with respect to CRC incidence are in contrast to previously published studies involving the use of aspirin in cancer prevention, generally conducted in cohorts of middle-aged and/or high-risk individuals, demonstrating reduced cancer incidence and mortality, particularly for CRC, with aspirin use. Systematic reviews generally conclude that aspirin use is associated with a decreased incidence of colonic adenomas, CRCs and CRC-related mortality.

There is mixed evidence for the role of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NA-NSAIDs) in mitigating CRC incidence, with some population-based studies reporting that NA-NSAIDs are associated with a reduction in CRC risk, while other studies only showed benefits in particular high-risk subgroups. Systematic reviews of RCTs have concluded that NA-NSAIDs, such as COX 2-inhibitors, are effective in preventing metachronous neoplasia or adenoma recurrence, in patients with a high baseline risk of CRC. Notably, however, there is limited data in older populations, a group which has higher prevalence of NA-NSAID use.

Previous studies estimate that up to 27% of regular aspirin users simultaneously take NA-NSAIDs. Based on clinical trials pointing to the apparent benefits of aspirin (albeit not seen in the ASPREE RCT) and the potential reduction in CRC associated with the use of NA-NSAIDs alone in prior studies, we hypothesized that combined use of NA-NSAIDs and aspirin may have had a synergistic effect. Limited data exists on the combined use of NA-NSAIDs and aspirin in CRC risk, particularly in older populations. This study sets out to explore the impact of NA-NSAID use alone, and in combination with aspirin, on CRC incidence in older adults, utilizing data from the ASPREE RCT and the extended observational follow-on (ASPREE-XT).

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^ec809811]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that has been used in low doses (75–100 mg/d) for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Despite some recent unfavorable findings, it continues to be widely used for primary and secondary prevention of stroke. Its major adverse effect is an increased bleeding tendency.,

Information about the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of stroke is derived from meta-analyses and results of recent major trials, most of which have been conducted in populations with mean ages younger than 70 years. Despite some inconsistency, these reports suggest a trend toward reduced ischemic stroke counterbalanced by increased intracerebral and other intracranial hemorrhage, with little overall impact on total stroke incidence.

Clinical characteristics of older individuals include an increased inherent susceptibility to hemorrhage, which may be associated with increased fragility of small blood vessels. In addition, older individuals experience an increased susceptibility to major and minor trauma as a result of falls and other accidents. Together, these outcomes may alter the balance of risks and benefits of an antiplatelet drug, especially if given to individuals at low risk in a primary prevention setting. This concern is relevant given the high stroke risk in older individuals, worldwide increases in populations of older individuals, and the importance of evaluating preventive strategies in this age group.

The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial is the largest randomized controlled trial of low-dose aspirin focused on investigating the balance of risks and benefits of this therapy in an older age group. In addition to its large size, the ASPREE study design included independent adjudication of stroke and hemorrhagic events by independent expert panels. It was therefore ideally positioned to evaluate the balance of risks and benefits of low-dose aspirin in a primary prevention setting. In this study, we provide a comprehensive report on the incidence of first stroke and bleeding events occurring during the median 4.7 years of follow-up of the trial.

### Subgroup analysis of the ASPirin in reducing events in the elderly randomized clinical trial suggests aspirin did not improve outcomes in older adults with chronic kidney disease [^db2a6fd6]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of aspirin for primary prevention in older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear. Therefore, post hoc analysis of the randomized controlled trial ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) was undertaken comparing 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin daily against matching placebo. Participants were community dwelling adults aged 70 years and older in Australia, 65 years and older in the United States, all free of a history of dementia or cardiovascular disease and of any disease expected to lead to death within five years. CKD was defined as present at baseline if either eGFR under 60mL/min/1.73m 2 or urine albumin to creatinine ratio 3 mg/mmol or more. In 4758 participants with and 13004 without CKD, the rates of a composite endpoint (dementia, persistent physical disability or death), major adverse cardiovascular events and clinically significant bleeding in the CKD participants were almost double those without CKD. Aspirin's effects as estimated by hazard ratios were generally similar between CKD and non-CKD groups for dementia, persistent physical disability or death, major adverse cardiovascular events and clinically significant bleeding. Thus, in our analysis aspirin did not improve outcomes in older people while increasing the risk of bleeding, with mostly consistent effects in participants with and without CKD.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^2a1d43eb]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — benefits of preventive medication reports 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161 680 participants; most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day, with mean ages ranging from 53 years to 74 years. In pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin, decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.96]) across 11 trials (n = 134 470) and decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–1.00]) across 5 trials (n = 54 947). Low-dose aspirin was not associated with statistically significant effects on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up, and although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.

### Low-dose aspirin and the risk of stroke and intracerebral bleeding in healthy older people: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^2648ccda]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Overall, results are in keeping with meta-analyses reported by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration in 2009, US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2016, and a 2020 meta-analysis by Judge et alsummarizing results of 11 primary prevention trials, including 3 major trials published in 2018. Most patients included in these reports were younger than those in ASPREE. Consistent findings across these studies were a small reduction of ischemic events accompanied by an increase in hemorrhagic events. Unlike in our study, the absolute decrease in ischemic strokes substantially outweighed the increase in hemorrhagic events, and this has probably resulted in a discounting of intracerebral bleeding as an important component of the risk-benefit trade-off in younger populations.

The lack of benefit and potential risks from aspirin in primary stroke prevention provide further evidence in support of the recently published draft recommendation of the USPSTF against the routine prescribing of low-dose aspirin as a primary prevention measure, especially in older persons. Clinicians should be aware that among older individuals prone to falls, risks of intracerebral bleeding with aspirin may be greater than was apparent in this trial. Our results are also cautionary with regard to the inclusion of aspirin in a polypill to prevent cardiovascular disease in healthy older adults. Studies of newer antiplatelet therapies, such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel, have not been undertaken in a primary prevention setting and should not yet be considered as alternatives to aspirin for this indication.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this data derive from its size coupled with virtually complete follow-up and systematic adjudication of stroke events by specialist clinicians. The study also has several limitations, including fewer than expected stroke and bleeding events occurring during follow-up and the lack of detailed investigation of stroke occurring in some older participants. Results are mainly generalizable to a White population (participation by individuals in racial and ethnic minority groups was largely limited to the US, where Black and Hispanic people aged ≥ 65 years were purposively recruited) with routine access to optimal blood pressure and lipid control. The balance of risks and benefits found in this study is not applicable to the use of aspirin for secondary prevention and may not be applicable to certain subgroups at substantially higher risk of ischemic stroke.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the elderly [^fee60f88]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The tension between the benefits and harms of anticoagulation is finely balanced. Prophylactic aspirin in healthy, elderly patients provides no benefit and causes harm; clinicians should not use it for primary prevention in otherwise well patients aged over 70.

As the world's population ages, health in later life has become a public health priority. The prevention of disease is critical to these aims. As a chief cause of morbidity in the elderly, the prevention of cardiovascular disease is of particular focus.

The use of aspirin unequivocally benefits patients who have already suffered a cardiovascular event. However, its role in primary prevention is much more contentious. The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trialset out to address the uncertainty surrounding the prophylactic use of aspirin in healthy, elderly patients.

The ASPREE investigators randomised almost 20 000 people to receive 100 mg aspirin or placebo. Included participants were 70 years or older (or 65 if Hispanic or African–American) and had no history of cardiovascular disease, dementia, terminal illness or increased risk of bleeding. The rate of cardiovascular disease and haemorrhage were assessed over approximately 5 years (median follow-up 4.7).

This trial proved that the use of aspirin is harmful to healthy, community-dwelling elderly people. Participants that took aspirin derived no benefit but suffered more haemorrhagic events than those that took placebo. People in the aspirin group had 8.6 major haemorrhage events per 1000 person-years compared with 6.2 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (HR, 1.38; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.62). The rate of cardiovascular disease for people in the aspirin group was 10.7 events per 1000 person-years, compared with 11.3 in the placebo group (HR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08).

There are a few limitations to consider. Most significantly, only around two-thirds of the participants were still taking their aspirin by the end of the trial. This could have underestimated the effects of aspirin, but this is likely to have affected both the potential benefits and the harms equally. Furthermore, a small proportion of patients were taking aspirin before the trial started.

### Gender-specific population attributable fractions for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality associated with living arrangement in community-dwelling older people [^c7fcff33]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Data Source and Study Population

This study utilised the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE); the ASPREE-eXTension (ASPREE-XT), which is the post-trial observational study of the ASPREE; and the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP). ASPREE was a randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of low-dose aspirin among 19,114 older adults aged 70 + from Australia and the United States (US), including US minorities aged 65 +. ASPREE recruited healthy individuals who were free of major physical disability, CVD events, and dementia. Recruitment was undertaken from 2010 to 2014. After a median follow-up period of 4.7 years (ending on 12 June 2017), the ASPREE trial ended due to findings that aspirin had no impact on health outcomes, including CVD and CVD mortality. Subsequently, notification letters were sent to all participants to inform them of the trial's conclusion. Between June 12, 2017, and January 31, 2018, all participants originally enrolled in ASPREE who had not withdrawn or passed away were invited to continue with an annual observational follow-up in ASPREE-XT. ALSOP is a sub-study of the ASPREE trial, and thus far, it comprises approximately 90% of the Australian participants from the larger ASPREE cohort. This study was limited to ALSOP cohort participants due to the availability of living arrangement data in the ALSOP data collection.

Variables of the Study

Outcomes

CVD and all-cause mortality were the outcome variables. CVD was measured as a composite of fatal coronary heart disease, stroke (fatal or non-fatal), myocardial infarction (non-fatal), and hospitalisation due to heart failure. All-cause mortality includes cancer-related deaths, death due to clinically significant bleeding, cardiovascular (including stroke) death, and other deaths. Both CVD and all-cause mortality were adjudicated by panels of clinical experts. All participants were monitored until they experienced CVD events, death, loss to follow-up, or completed their fourth annual ASPREE-XT visit (between 2021 and 2022), whichever came first.

### AGA clinical practice update on chemoprevention for colorectal neoplasia: expert review [^1ecba543]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin — colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality and survival after diagnosis: In pooled cardiovascular prevention trials (n = 14,033), aspirin 75 to 1200 mg daily reduced 20-year cumulative CRC mortality by 33% (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.86), with benefit observed after 10–20 years (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35–0.74) but not earlier (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.49–1.26); in contrast, ASPREE (n = 19,114; 96% aged ≥ 70 years) found higher CRC mortality with 100 mg aspirin vs placebo at a median 4.7 years (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.02–3.06). After CRC diagnosis, a meta-analysis found no association with CRC-specific survival (HR, 0.77; 0.52–1.14), whereas overall survival improved (HR, 0.84; 0.75–0.94), with benefit appearing restricted to PIK3CA-mutant and COX-2 expressing tumors.

### A randomized trial of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women [^537d5830]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Randomized trials have shown that low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of a first myocardial infarction in men, with little effect on the risk of ischemic stroke. There are few similar data in women.

Methods

We randomly assigned 39,876 initially healthy women 45 years of age or older to receive 100 mg of aspirin on alternate days or placebo and then monitored them for 10 years for a first major cardiovascular event (i.e., nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes).

Results

During follow-up, 477 major cardiovascular events were confirmed in the aspirin group, as compared with 522 in the placebo group, for a nonsignificant reduction in risk with aspirin of 9 percent (relative risk, 0.91; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.03; P = 0.13). With regard to individual end points, there was a 17 percent reduction in the risk of stroke in the aspirin group, as compared with the placebo group (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.99; P = 0.04), owing to a 24 percent reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.93; P = 0.009) and a nonsignificant increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (relative risk, 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.87; P = 0.31). As compared with placebo, aspirin had no significant effect on the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (relative risk, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.25; P = 0.83) or death from cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.22; P = 0.68). Gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion was more frequent in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.40; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.83; P = 0.02). Subgroup analyses showed that aspirin significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction among women 65 years of age or older.

Conclusions

In this large, primary-prevention trial among women, aspirin lowered the risk of stroke without affecting the risk of myocardial infarction or death from cardiovascular causes, leading to a nonsignificant finding with respect to the primary end point.

### Walking for transport and all-cause mortality: a prospective cohort study of Australian community-dwelling older adults [^eb827d90]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Design and population

We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) clinical trial, its substudy the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP)and the ASPREE Extension study (ASPREE-XT). ASPREE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aimed to evaluate the effect of low-dose aspirin to extend disability-free survival in 19 114 adults aged 70 years and older from Australia (n = 16 703) and the USA (n = 2411, including minorities aged 65+ years). At enrolment, ASPREE participants were free of cardiovascular disease, dementia, independence-limiting physical disability and did not have a known illness that would be life-ending in the next 5 years. They were recruited between March 2010 and December 2014, and detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described previously.

Australian participants were sent the baseline ALSOP Medical and Social questionnaires, generally within the first year of the ASPREE study, to collect information on a broad range of additional general health, lifestyle, behavioural, social, economic and environmental factors relevant to ageing. Following cessation of the ASPREE intervention phase (aspirin or matched placebo) which ended in 2017, participants were invited to continue observational follow-up into the ASPREE-XT study.

Of the 16 703 Australian participants enrolled in the ASPREE trial, 12 896 returned the ALSOP Medical and Social baseline questionnaires. Participants who did not answer questions on transport walking and putative confounders were excluded. To ensure that the exposure (transport walking) did not precede the events (death from any cause), participants who died from any cause within the first 12 months were excluded from the analysis. In total, 11 539 were considered in the analysis (figure 1).

### Clonal hematopoiesis and cardiovascular disease and bleeding risk and the effectiveness of aspirin [^a30e8723]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality. However, there are no approved therapies for preventing or treating CHIP.

Objective

To investigate whether low-dose aspirin might benefit older adults with CHIP for the primary prevention of CVD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified substudy of the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) double-blind, randomized clinical trial of daily low-dose aspirin vs placebo evaluating disability-free survival, which took place at primary and community care facilities in the US and Australia. Enrollment was from March 2010 to December 2014, and the randomized trial ended in June 2017. Community-dwelling Australian adults aged 70 years and older without a diagnosed cardiovascular event, atrial fibrillation, a serious intercurrent illness likely to cause death within the next 5 years, anemia, or a current or recurrent condition with a high risk of bleeding were included in the original study. Of 19 114 in the original trial, 11 402 were included in the substudy, and 9434 were included in the analysis. Follow-up for this substudy went through June 2022, with data analysis in February 2025. In-trial median (IQR) follow-up time was 4.6 (3.5–5.6) years, and posttrial observational follow-up was 8.7 (7.5–10.1) years from randomization.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to aspirin, 100 mg, daily or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

CHIP was measured in blood specimens collected at trial entry. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including fatal and nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death, and clinically significant bleeding were adjudicated by independent expert committees blinded to trial-group assignments.

Results

A total of 9434 participants (median [IQR] age, 73.7 [71.6–77.1] years; 5067 [54%] female) provided a sample at baseline for analysis, 2124 of whom (23%) had CHIP at variant allele fraction (VAF) ≥ 2%, with 532 (5.6%) at ≥ 10% VAF. CHIP was not associated with increased risk of MACEs at 2% to 10% VAF (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.84, 95% CI, 0.68–1.03; P = 0.09) or ≥ 10% VAF (aHR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.57–1.12; P = 0.19). However, CHIP was associated with increased risk of clinically significant bleeding (2%-10% VAF: aHR, 1.24; 95% CI 1.02–1.51; P = 0.03; ≥ 10% VAF: aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.85–1.73; P = 0.28). There was no evidence of a differential effect of aspirin according to presence of CHIP on MACEs (without CHIP: HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72–1.16; 2%-10% VAF: HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.77–2.53; ≥ 10% VAF: HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.52–3.37; heterogeneity P = 0.35) or clinically significant bleeding (without CHIP: HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.22–2.30; 2%-10% VAF: HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.82–2.57; ≥ 10% VAF: HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.49–4.07; heterogeneity P = 0.91).

Conclusion and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of daily low-dose aspirin in healthy adults 70 years and older, CHIP was not associated with higher CVD risk. However, participants with CHIP had a greater risk of clinically significant bleeding. There was no evidence that participants with CHIP were more likely than those without CHIP to benefit or experience more harm from aspirin when used for primary prevention of CVD events.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^c4209a0f]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-term effects

In the first group of analyses, effects over the long-term were estimated using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. For each outcome, time to first event was analysed in a Cox proportional hazards model to compare randomized treatment arms, with a participant's time at risk censored at their fourth ASPREE-XT annual visit or loss to follow-up, whichever occurred first. For outcomes other than all-cause death, cause-specific hazards were estimated with death from causes other than those included in the model outcome treated as a censoring event. Cumulative incidence curves with competing risk of death were obtained using the Aalen–Johansen estimator. Rates per 1000 person-years for each year in study were also visualized. Proportional hazards assumptions were checked by visual inspection of Schoenfeld residuals against time. An interaction test was performed by adding a product term in the Cox model to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effects across different subgroups. Adjusted analyses considered characteristics at randomization [age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, cancer history, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) score] added to the Cox proportional hazards model.

Due to the cessation of study drug at the end of the trial, it was possible that the ITT treatment effect would not be constant across the entire in-trial and post-trial follow-up. To account for potential non-proportional hazards, we calculated restricted mean time lost with competing risk of death and a generalized (combined) test of treatment effect comparing restricted mean survival time difference at 10 equally spaced intervals.

### Aspirin and cancer in older people-NCI… [^d34b8b39]. NCI (2020). Medium credibility.

Regular Aspirin Use May Increase Older People's Risk of Dying from Cancer, by Carmen Phillips Numerous studies have suggested that people who regularly take low doses of aspirin may have reduced risks of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. But new findings from a randomized clinical trial, called ASPREE, suggest that the same may not hold true for older adults. The study included approximately 19, 000 generally healthy people who were 70 years of age or older. Those who took 100 mg of aspirin daily were no more likely than those who took a placebo to be diagnosed with cancer. They did, however, have a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer and of dying from cancer, the ASPREE research team reported August 11 in. This widespread use of aspirin allowed for the numerous observational studies that linked aspirin use with decreased chances of being diagnosed with cancer and dying from it.

Those studies eventually led to clinical trials to confirm aspirin's disease prevention potential, including for cancer. Initial results from ASPREE, published 2 years ago, showed that participants who had been randomly assigned to take daily low-dose aspirin had a modestly increased risk of dying from any cause compared with those who took a placebo. The increased risk was due almost entirely to a higher number of cancer-related deaths among those who took aspirin. Approximately 1, 900 ASPREE participants were diagnosed with cancer during the study. Overall, about two-thirds of those were localized cancers — that is, they had not spread, or metastasized, from their original location. About one-quarter of those diagnosed with cancer during the study ultimately died from it. The use of aspirin wasn't associated with the diagnosis of any single type of cancer.

However, participants in the aspirin group had a nearly 20% higher risk of being diagnosed with advanced cancer and about a 30% higher risk of dying from advanced cancer. Chyke Doubeni, M. D., director of the Center for Health Equity and Community Engagement Research at the Mayo Clinic, agreed that the results were unanticipated, particularly given the findings from earlier studies. That participants in the aspirin group had a 77% higher risk of dying from colorectal cancer than those in the placebo group is particularly notable, continued Dr. Doubeni, who is a USPSTF member and was not involved in ASPREE. "I do think that what this is telling us is that we need more studies" on aspirin's impact on colorectal cancer, he said.

### Daily low dose aspirin halves incident type 2 diabetes in elderly subjects with prediabetes: a five-year longitudinal cohort study in a real-word population [^5d7a8103]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that, in 2021, 38% of adults in the United States — amounting to approximately 98 million people — were living with prediabetes, a figure that increased to 49% among those aged 65 and older. Globally, the International Diabetes Federation Atlas (10th Edition) estimated that 541 million adults had prediabetes in 2021, a number comparable to the global prevalence of diabetes. Prediabetes is a serious health concern, closely linked to metabolic syndrome and associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. A 2020 meta-analysis of 129 studies including more than 10 million individuals found that, compared to normoglycemic individuals, those with prediabetes had an elevated relative risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke over a median follow-up of nearly 10 years. Since prediabetes represents the final stage before the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), interventions that prevent or delay its progression offer a critical opportunity to curb the global diabetes epidemic.

The Physicians' Health Study previously reported a 14% reduction in the risk of incident diabetes over five years in a randomized trial of 325 mg aspirin every other day among apparently healthy men; however this finding did not achieve statistical significance. More recently, Zoungas and colleagues demonstrated in a post-hoc analysis that daily low-dose aspirin modestly slowed the rise in fasting plasma glucose and reduced the incidence of T2DM by 15% among community-dwelling older adults, albeit with an increased risk of major bleeding. Notably, the difference in fasting glucose levels between the aspirin and placebo groups became apparent at all follow-up visits, and a separation in diabetes incidence curves emerged after the second year of treatment. These observations support the hypothesis that aspirin's potential protective effect against incident diabetes may be particularly meaningful in individuals with prediabetes — a condition more common in the elderly and marked by elevated glucose levels. However, in the study by Zoungas et al. diabetes diagnosis relied on self-reports, initiation of glucose-lowering therapy, or a single fasting plasma glucose value, without confirmatory testing or inclusion of HbA1c or oral glucose tolerance tests, thereby limiting the identification of prediabetes.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^c775681e]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that in our study, cumulative incidence curves post-trial took 2–3 years to display elevated MACE risk in the randomized aspirin group, which also does not seem to concur with short-term rebound harm. It is also noteworthy that the findings concerning haemorrhage post-trial, when no elevated risk was seen in the randomized aspirin group, are discordant with the observation for MACE. This discrepancy may be attributed to the distinct mechanisms through which aspirin influences these outcomes. Although not supported by our previous analyses, aspirin cessation might lead to the recrudescence of underlying conditions that promote the atherosclerotic CVD process and increase the risk of MACE. In contrast, the increased bleeding risk during the trial period caused by aspirin use might diminish after aspirin cessation due to relatively quick recovery of platelet function, and/or mucoprotective prostaglandins.

The study design and our analyses comparing randomized aspirin with randomized placebo groups in the long term do not enable us to distinguish between any effects of ceasing aspirin and any (legacy) effects of having taken aspirin for several years. Hence, a second explanation for elevated MACE risk post-trial in the randomized aspirin group relates to the potential that aspirin delays events rather than preventing them completely. From the pathophysiological viewpoint, the principal effect of aspirin is on platelets which have a short half-life. Therefore, it is unlikely that it would simply delay MACE. Nonetheless, it is possible that aspirin, by causing intraplaque haemorrhage, might be associated with MACE some time later. An early small-scale randomized trial showed that low-dose aspirin (50 mg daily) provided no benefit in preventing carotid plaque growth and might even accelerate it. If this line of reasoning was true, then individuals at the start of the trial at the highest MACE risk may benefit most from aspirin in delaying events but may also be most prone to experiencing those events in the longer term. However, our subgroup analysis by cardiovascular risk score quartile (defined on either baseline or end-of-trial characteristics) found no evidence of heterogeneity in long-term and post-trial aspirin effects on MACE. The effects in the context of ongoing usage of aspirin were also investigated in our as-treated analysis of ongoing aspirin use over a median of 8.3 years of follow-up. We found no benefit on MACE of aspirin use that was ongoing over the total period, although we acknowledge that this analysis was observational in nature rather than based on randomization.

### Primary care providers should prescribe aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease based on benefit-risk ratio, not age [^30c95fca]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

To conduct our updated meta-analysis, we defined a composite endpoint comparable to that of the ATT meta-analysis of myocardial infarction, stroke and CVD death. Each individual randomised trial was included in a 2×2 contingency table of the subjects on ASA (ASA) or placebo (PCB) with CVD. A weighted analysis of these 2×2 contingency tables was performed using inverse variance meta-analytic methods. From these aggregate data, we calculated HRs and 95% CIs.

ASA produced a statistically significant 13% (0.83 to 0.92) reduction in CVD. This point estimate is virtually identical to that reported in the ATT meta-analysis of 0.88 but has greater precision (figure 1).

For any randomised trial, the ability to detect any benefit depends on the maintenance of high adherence rates. As duration increases, adherence rates decrease during the same time that the majority of events are accruing. Further, the effect of ASA on CVD is acute as the half-life of the platelet is about 8 days. Thus, ASA non-adherence after only 1 week produces risks as high as those assigned PCB. At trial termination, reported overall adherence rates in ARRIVE, ASPREE and TIPS-3 were about 60%, a weighted average over 5 years. For other drugs such as statins, benefits are far more prolonged after cessation. Non-adherence may have contributed to a failure to detect significant benefits in ARRIVE, ASPREE and TIPS-3 that were reported in older adults in previous individual trials as well as the ATT meta-analysis.

In the trials of ASA in primary prevention, the doses ranged from 75 mg to 500 mgwithout significant effect modification. In three trials directly comparing 75–150 mg with 160–325 mg daily, there were no significant differences in efficacy or safety and no modifications by age. A recently published large-scale randomised trial directly compared 81 mg with 325 mg and found no significant differences in efficacy or safety of ASA.

The previous guideline used age 70as the upper age limit and the recent guidance used age 60. Guidelines and guidance based on age are intrinsically contradictory because ASA is recommended, on the one hand, only for higher risk primary prevention subjects, but on the other, not over age 60 or 70 where the absolute risks of CVD are much higher than at younger or middle ages. Our Perspective to primary care providers is a new and novel evidence-based solution to prescribe ASA based on benefit−risk, not age.

### Low-dose aspirin and progression of age-related hearing loss: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^54ad597f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of a daily 100-mg low dose of aspirin over 3 years did not demonstrate any significant effect on the progression of age-related hearing loss. Although our findings add valuable data to the ongoing discussion surrounding aspirin and hearing health, future trials will be necessary to determine whether other anti-inflammatory or antiplatelet agents exert a protective effect on hearing loss. Furthermore, the complex relationship between aspirin, inflammation, and hearing loss warrants continued investigation to elucidate potential mechanisms and clinical implications.

### Effect of low-dose aspirin on the course of age-related macular degeneration: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^bfce12d4]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in old age. There is no proven intervention to prevent AMD and, apart from lifestyle, nutritional, and supplement advice, there is no intervention to delay its progression.

Objective

To determine the impact of long-term low-dose aspirin on the incidence and progression of AMD.

Design, Setting and Participants

The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly-AMD (ASPREE-AMD) study was an Australian-based substudy of the ASPREE trial, a multicenter, international, randomized, double-masked, placebo-clinical trial investigating the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in prolonging disability-free survival among older individuals. Retinal photography was conducted at baseline from March 2010 to January 2015, then 3 and 5 years after randomization. AMD status was determined using color retinal images and treatment records. Australian participants in ASPREE aged 70 years and older without dementia, independence-limiting physical disability, cardiovascular disease, or chronic illness limiting 5-year survival and with gradable retinal images at baseline were included. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to December 2023.

Interventions

Aspirin (100 mg daily, enteric coated) or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence of AMD and progression from early/intermediate to late AMD. Outcomes were analyzed by modified intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

A total of 4993 participants were enrolled in this substudy. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. At the time of sponsor-determined trial termination, retinal follow-up data were available for 3208 participants, 3171 of whom were analyzed for AMD incidence and progression, with a median (IQR) age of 73.5 (71.5–76.4) years and even sex distribution (1619 [51%] female). Median (IQR) follow-up time was 3.1 (3.0–3.5) years. Cumulative AMD incidence was 195 of 1004 (19.4%) in the aspirin group and 187 of 979 (19.1%) in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85–1.22; P = 0.86). Cumulative progression from early/intermediate AMD to late AMD was observed in 14 of 615 (2.3%) participants in the aspirin group and 18 of 573 (3.1%) in the placebo group (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.36–1.44; P = 0.36).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, low-dose aspirin administered for 3 years did not affect the incidence of AMD. The evidence was weaker for progression of AMD due to low number of progressed cases. Overall, these results do not support suggestion that low-dose daily aspirin prevents the development or progression of AMD.

### Variability in aspirin efficacy: all in the genes? [^c6171558]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

This editorial refers to 'Genetic variation at the coronary artery disease locus GUCY1A3 modifies cardiovascular disease prevention effects of aspirin' †, by K.T. Hall et al. on page 3385.

Meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomized trials have shown clearly that, when used for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the benefits of low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily) clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, but the net benefit of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is less clear, and has long been debated. The issue is topical, because last year three new trials assessing low-dose aspirin therapy (100 mg daily) vs. placebo for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) were reported: the ASPREE trialin elderly individuals, the ASCEND trialin patients with diabetes, and the ARRIVE trialin non-diabetic individuals with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. An updated meta-analysis incorporating data from 13 primary prevention trials indicated that, even with the additional evidence provided by these three new trials, the absolute benefits of aspirin appear small, and are of a similar magnitude to the small absolute risks of major bleeding. It is unclear whether it is possible to identify people who might derive above average vascular benefit without also experiencing above average risks of bleeding. Since the relative risk reduction in serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) does not vary according to baseline prognostic factors, the absolute benefits of aspirin are proportional to the baseline risk of ASCVD. Therefore, it might be postulated that aspirin should be targeted at apparently healthy people at elevated ASCVD risk in whom the risks of bleeding are low. However, the risks of ASCVD and of bleeding are strongly correlated (chiefly because the risks of both outcomes are strongly determined by age), so few individuals are at increased risk of ASCVD without also being at higher risk of bleeding. Given the difficulty of selecting healthy individuals for aspirin use using conventional risk markers, it is of interest to consider whether subgroups defined by allelic variation might offer an alternative method of selecting people in whom the benefits of aspirin greatly exceed the bleeding risks.

### Dietary supplement and complementary and alternative medicine use among older adults in Australia and the United States [^c77a0088]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study population

We conducted a secondary analysis of quantitative data collected from community-dwelling older adults participating in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. This study enrolled healthy older adults from Australia and the United States aged 70 years and older (65 years and older for US minorities) between 2010 and 2014 and randomized them to low dose daily aspirin 100 mg/day or placebo. The primary outcome of ASPREE was disability-free survival, a composite of death, incident dementia, or persistent physical disability. As a condition of enrollment, eligible participants had to be free of documented evidence of cardiovascular disease, dementia or significant cognitive impairment, severe physical disability, a high risk of bleeding, anemia, any condition that may cause death within 5 years, uncontrolled high blood pressure, and not currently using aspirin for secondary prevention or other antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication.

Participants attended annual in-person study visits, which included collection of medical diagnoses as well as assessments of cognition, physical function, lifestyle, anthropometric measures, concomitant prescription medications, and other clinical parameters. Supplement/CAM use was included within a one-off questionnaire during the final annual visit ("Milestone" study visit). All Milestone visits were conducted from January 2017 to January 2018, which coincided with the 3rd–7th annual visit for an individual participant, depending on what year they originally enrolled into the study. Trial Registration:and ISRCTN83772183.

Data definitions

Data obtained from the Milestone Visit Questionnaire concerning medication use was linked with demographic and other health-related data collected during the ASPREE trial. New diagnoses were self-reported at annual visits, and any that were primary or secondary endpoints of interest for the trial (e.g. dementia, cardiovascular disease, bleeding) were adjudicated as part of the main trial procedures as previously outlined. For some nonadjudicated conditions (e.g. diabetes, depression, and hypertension) a combination of participant selfreport, medication use, and in-trial objective measures were used to determine the presence of the condition. All conditions analyzed in this paper reflect the participants' status at the Milestone visit.

### Similar mortality risk in incident cognitive impairment and dementia: evidence from the ASPirin in reducing events in the elderly (ASPREE) trial [^1cbb6045]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This study examined the risk of mortality in older adults with newly detected cognitive impairment or dementia.

Methods

Data from the Australian cohort of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial were examined. The ASPREE clinical trial compared daily low-dose aspirin to a placebo and involved 16,703 individuals aged 70years and over, who were without major cognitive impairment, physical disability, or cardiovascular disease at recruitment. During the trial, evidence of cognitive impairment, based on cognitive testing and medical record information, triggered dementia adjudication of participants using DSM-IV criteria. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare mortality rates across the dementia, trigger-only, and no-trigger groups.

Results

Over a median 4.7-year follow-up period, 806 participants triggered dementia adjudication, with 485 (60.2%) judged to have dementia. Following recruitment, mortality risks were 32.9, 33.6, and 10.8 events per 1000 person-years in the dementia, trigger-no-dementia, and no-trigger groups, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, mortality risks remained higher in the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3–2.1) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5–2.6), respectively. There was no discernible difference between the dementia and trigger-no-dementia groups in mortality rates following recruitment, or following a dementia trigger. These two groups were more likely to die from sepsis, respiratory disease, and dementia, but less likely to die from cancer than the no-trigger group, χ 2 = 161.5, p < 0.001.

Conclusion

ASPREE participants who triggered for a dementia evaluation experienced a substantially higher mortality rate than those who remained cognitively intact. The increase was indistinguishable among persons who met DSM-IV criteria for dementia vs. those who triggered for a dementia evaluation but failed to meet DSM-IV criteria. Future work should investigate whether earlier detection of cognitive decline can be used to identify and prevent early mortality.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^980509c1]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using extended follow-up for a further 4.3 years of participants in the ASPREE trial, we examined long-term effects of aspirin on MACE and major haemorrhage (Structured Graphical Abstract). We found an absence of MACE benefit over the total long-term follow-up (median of 8.3 years). However, we also found a notable contrast between the trend towards MACE benefit during the trial (HR.89, 95% CI.77, 1.03) and an elevated risk of MACE post-trial (IPW HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01, 1.36) in individuals originally randomized to aspirin compared with placebo. The lack of benefit over the long-term was reinforced by as-treated analyses that also found no benefit on MACE with continued ongoing use over the long-term.

We also found that randomization to aspirin was associated with increased risk of major haemorrhage over the total long-term follow-up. However, during post-trial follow-up, there was no longer a substantially elevated risk of bleeding in those originally randomized to aspirin. A finding of elevated bleeding risk with aspirin is consistent with most primary prevention trials of aspirin, and bleeding is a widely acknowledged side effect of aspirin use that is of particular concern in older adults who have higher comorbidity burden and underlying risk of haemorrhage than younger adults.

Our finding of elevated risk for MACE post-trial in those randomized to aspirin suggests three theoretical possibilities: that any benefit on MACE accrued while on aspirin is lost when aspirin treatment is removed either because of forgone benefit or, possibly, a rebound effect; that a modest protective effect on MACE from aspirin may delay events but not prevent them completely; or that our observations post-trial are distorted by the impact of selection bias for open-label use of aspirin. We acknowledge that other explanations of the MACE findings may exist and that the play of chance cannot be entirely excluded. To an extent, our observations should be viewed as hypothesis-generating. We discuss the evidence from our total period of follow-up in the context of these possibilities.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^87425df5]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The first possibility is the potential for forgone benefit or rebound effect in ceasing aspirin. For MACE, the HR of.89 (randomized aspirin vs randomized placebo) in-trial was consistent with results in other studies. This potential benefit of taking aspirin could have been lost upon cessation of study drug at the trial end, i.e. a forgone benefit. A rebound effect in the form of a relative short-term prothrombotic tendency following the withdrawal of aspirin has been demonstrated in previous epidemiological studies in populations with known atherosclerotic CVD. This phenomenon is thought to arise from the recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase activity and synthesis of thromboxane after aspirin cessation, resulting in increased platelet aggregation. The delayed divergence in MACE risk post-trial, as evidenced by the cumulative incidence curves in our study, suggests that the thrombotic rebound effect may extend beyond the short term. This result is consistent with a large Swedish cohort study, in which individuals who discontinued low-dose aspirin had a higher risk of MACE than those who continued (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.34, 1.41) over an average 3-year follow-up. This could be explained by the fact that coronary artery stenosis caused by enlarging plaques does not necessarily cause the acute thrombotic complications that generally provoke MACE, but culminates in events some time and possibly years later. Further, aspirin cessation may lead to a pro-inflammatory state which can contribute to the destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, making them more prone to rupture, potentially years later. Nevertheless, our own cohort analyses designed to compare aspirin cessation between groups of individuals who cease aspirin vs continue its use did not demonstrate elevated risk of MACE with cessation and concluded that cessation, which came with significantly reduced risk of haemorrhage, appeared safe.

### Aspirin and cardiovascular risk in individuals with elevated lipoprotein (a): the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^e201a413]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

There were subsequently 3 large randomized controlled trials of aspirin use for primary prevention in different populations, published in 2018. The ASCEND (effects of aspirin for primary prevention in persons with diabetes mellitus) trial demonstrated a benefit in a composite outcome of serious vascular events with a rate ratio of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79–0.97) in diabetic persons assigned aspirin 100 mg daily. However, this was offset by increased major bleeding (relative risk, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.09–1.52). The ASPREE trial, which randomized healthy elderly participants to 100 mg daily aspirin or placebo, failed to show a benefit in a composite outcome of cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.83–1.08), while also demonstrating an increased risk of major hemorrhage (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.18–1.62]). Finally, the ARRIVE (aspirin to reduce risk of initial vascular events) trial of participants at moderate vascular risk failed to show a benefit in its primary end point with aspirin 100 mg daily (HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.81–1.13]) but again demonstrated increasing gastrointestinal bleeding (HR. 2.11 [95% CI, 1.36–3.28]). While the latter 2 trials failed to show a benefit to aspirin, ASCEND demonstrated that there is likely a benefit in a group that is of sufficiently higher risk, analogous to benefit in secondary prevention patients who are also high risk. A 2019 meta‐analysis, including the above studies, again demonstrated a benefit to aspirin use in 13 randomized primary prevention trials (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.84–0.94]) with associated increased bleeding risk (HR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.30–1.56]). While there is some evidence of ischemic benefit in these studies, this tends to be counterbalanced by major bleeding episodes, leading to lack of a net clinical benefit.

### CHIP away at the marrow-clot connection: inflammation, clonal hematopoiesis, and thromboembolic disease [^af8a79f5]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary or secondary prevention of thrombotic complications

Although aspirin is at the cornerstone of secondary ASCVD prevention, it has not been shown to be an effective modality of reducing ASCVD risk in the primary prevention setting, including individuals with CHIP. In a secondary analysis of the ASPREE trial that randomized 19 144 healthy older adults in the United States and Australia (aged ≥ 65 years among African Americans, and aged ≥ 70 years among other racial and ethnic groups) to aspirin 100 mg daily or placebo, McQuilten et al evaluated whether aspirin conferred a protective effect on major adverse cardiovascular events among CHIP carriers. Presented as an abstract, CHIP carriership with VAF of ≥ 10% was associated with increased all-cause mortality. However, aspirin use was not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes among CHIP carriers identified at baseline visit or at year-3 follow-up. Furthermore, aspirin led to a reduction in the disease-free survival of individuals with detectable JAK2 V617F at baseline who did not meet criteria for a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Although results of this analysis await full publication, the role of antithrombotic agents for primary ASCVD prevention among patients with CHIP remains unclear. As discussed previously, the predictive impact of CHIP to inform antithrombotic intensity or duration among CHIP carriers with established ASCVD or VTE remains a crucial evidence gap.

### Associations of change in body size with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among healthy older adults [^e0175543]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The association between weight change and subsequent cause-specific mortality among older adults is not well described. The significance of changes in waist circumference (WC) has also not been compared with weight change for this purpose.

Objective

To examine the associations of changes in body weight and WC with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study is a post hoc analysis of data from the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized clinical trial, which recruited participants between March 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. The study included community-based older adults (16 703 Australian participants aged ≥ 70 years and 2411 US participants aged ≥ 65 years) without evident cardiovascular disease (CVD), dementia, physical disability, or life-limiting chronic illness. Data analysis was performed from April to September 2022.

Exposures

Body weight and WC were measured at baseline and at annual visit 2. Analysis models were adjusted for baseline body mass index because height and weight were measured at baseline, allowing for calculation of body mass index and other variables. Both body weight and WC changes were categorized as change within 5% (stable), decrease by 5% to 10%, decrease by more than 10%, increase by 5% to 10%, and increase by more than 10%.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause, cancer-specific, CVD-specific, and noncancer non-CVD-specific mortality. Mortality events were adjudicated by an expert review panel. Cox proportional hazards regression and competing risk analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.

Results

Among 16 523 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.0 [4.3] years; 9193 women [55.6%]), 1256 deaths were observed over a mean (SD) of 4.4 (1.7) years. Compared with men with stable weight, those with a 5% to 10% weight loss had a 33% higher (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07–1.66) risk of all-cause mortality, and those with more than a 10% decrease in body weight had a 289% higher (HR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.93–5.18) risk. Compared with women with stable weight, those with a 5% to 10% weight loss had a 26% higher (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00–1.60) risk of all-cause mortality, and those with more than a 10% decrease in body weight had a 114% higher (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.58–2.91) risk. Weight loss was associated with a higher cancer-specific mortality (> 10% decrease among men: HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.26–5.40; 5%-10% decrease among women: HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.46–2.04; > 10% decrease among women: HR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.82–4.26), CVD-specific mortality (> 10% decrease among men: HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.63–6.04; > 10% decrease among women: HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.05–3.51), and noncancer non-CVD-specific mortality (> 10% decrease among men: HR, 4.98; 95% CI, 3.14–7.91). A decrease in WC was also associated with mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study of healthy older adults suggests that weight loss was associated with an increase in all-cause and cause-specific mortality, including an increased risk of cancer, CVD, and other life-limiting conditions. Physicians should be aware of the significance of weight loss, especially among older men.

### Effects of aspirin on the long-term management of depression in older people: a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial [^e8ee9d80]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Late-life depression is common and often inadequately managed using existing therapies. Depression is also associated with increased markers of inflammation, suggesting a potential role for anti-inflammatory agents. ASPREE-D is a sub-study of ASPREE, a large multi-centre, population-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin vs placebo in older Australian and American adults (median follow-up: 4.7 years) of whom 1879 were depressed at baseline. Participants were given 100mg daily dose of aspirin or placebo. Depressive symptoms were assessed annually using the validated, self-rated short version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. There was a significant increase in depressive scores (0.6; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9; χ 2 (1) = 10.37; p = 0.001) and a decreased score in the mental health component of a quality of life scale (-0.7; 95% CI -1.4 to -0.1; χ 2 (1) = 4.74; p = 0.029) in the aspirin group compared to the placebo group. These effects were greater in the first year of follow-up and persisted throughout the study, albeit with small to very small effect sizes. This study failed to demonstrate any benefit of aspirin in the long-term course of depression in this community-dwelling sample of older adults over a 5-year period, and identified an adverse effect of aspirin in the course of depression in those with pre-existing depressive symptoms.

Aspirin for primary prevention — formal recommendation: For persons aged 50 years or older without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, we suggest low-dose aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily over no aspirin therapy (Grade 2B).

### Effects of aspirin on risks of vascular events and cancer according to bodyweight and dose: analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials [^106ec223]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The increased risk of sudden cardiac death on higher-dose aspirin was reported in some early trials, but was inconsistent, and there has been no systematic study or stratification by dose or body size. The suggestion of increased risk at lower bodyweight in people receiving 75–100 mg aspirin might be consistent with the increased risk of silent myocardial infarction in participants receiving 75 mg aspirin in the HOT trial, although our analysis was based on a small sample size and should be interpreted with caution. The fact that the hazard was mainly confined to use of higher-dose aspirin at lower body size might again be consistent with systemic COX-2 inhibition by aspirin, or possibly with other effects of salicylate.

Further research is required to validate and extend our findings. Three trials of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention, due to report in 2018, are studying groups in which we found effect modification by weight, including patients with diabetes (ASCEND;), people aged 70 years or older (ASPREE;), and people at increased vascular risk (ARRIVE;). Weight-stratified analyses of cardiovascular events are planned for the ARRIVE trial and also the JPPP trial(Rothwell, unpublished). Trials of twice-daily dosing are also required, and some are ongoing (eg, ANDAMAN;). If lack of systemic bioavailability of daily aspirin undermines clinical effectiveness simply because the lack of inhibition of COX-1 in megakariocytes allows continued production of new uninhibited platelets, then effectiveness should be improved by more frequent dosing to inhibit these new platelets in the portal venous circulation, without the need for much higher doses. Our analysis of the ESPS-2 trial showed that 25 mg aspirin twice a day was highly effective in individuals weighing less than 70 kg (figure 2), and 50–100 mg twice a day might be effective in heavier individuals. Use of a low dose of aspirin twice a day might also reduce any hazards resulting from excess dosing. Trials (eg, ADAPTABLE;) of low versus higher doses of aspirin given once a day might be helpful if stratified by body size, but are otherwise still testing a one-dose-fits-all strategy. Future trials might study weight-dependent dosing. Previous trials of aspirin use in the short term to treat acute vascular events should be analysed to establish any weight dependence of acute effects, which might differ in the acute phase because of a reduced likelihood of missed doses. Trials of other antiplatelet drugs versus aspirin in longer-term prevention should also be assessed, although results might be complicated by weight-related dosing issues with some of these drugs.

### Low-dose aspirin and prevention of colorectal cancer: evidence from a nationwide registry-based cohort in Norway [^3b95f13e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large population-based cohort of individuals aged 50 years or older, we found an association between low-dose aspirin use and lower CRC risk. The association was similar in men and women, in individuals younger than 70 years and those aged 70 years or older, and for cancer in the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum, but it was more profound for metastatic CRC than CRC diagnosed in earlier stages. The CRC risk decreased as the duration of low-dose aspirin use increased. Use of 160 mg tablets was associated with a greater CRC risk reduction than the use of 75 mg tablets. Furthermore, a lower CRC risk was found among individuals who had stopped taking the drug for less than 5 years.

We found a 13% lower CRC risk associated with current low-dose aspirin use vs never use, consistent with the findings of a recent large nested case-control study including 80,000 cases with CRC that reported an 11% lower CRC risk in long-term current low-dose aspirin users vs never-users. Moreover, in 2018, a network meta-analysis of RCT reported a 19% decrease in CRC risk in low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg) users compared with individuals receiving placebo. Long-term follow-up of the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial found a 12% reduced CRC risk among individuals who had used 1 or more aspirin tablets per day during the year before start of trial. In 2020, a large meta-analysis of 15 cohort, 11 nested case-control, and 19 case-control studies reported a 27% reduced CRC risk in regular users of aspirin. Noteworthy, the studies selected in that meta-analysis included individuals using all doses of aspirin and not just low dose. The same meta-analysis reported a 10% CRC risk reduction in 75 mg aspirin users, 11% in 81 mg aspirin users, and 13% in 100 mg aspirin users, quite consistent with our overall results and our dose-stratified results: 12% risk reduction in aspirin 75 mg users and 19% in 160 mg users. Contrary to the aforementioned evidence, in 2021, the ASPREE trial found no association between aspirin use and CRC risk after the median follow-up of 4.7 years. The ASPREE trial recruited adults aged 70 years or older, with only 11% having aspirin use history before joining the trial. It was argued later that the limited follow-up time of participants without history of aspirin use before the trial enrollment could partly explain the negative results in the ASPREE trial. As previously mentioned, the USPSTF withdrew their previous aspirin recommendations for CRC prevention based on the recent evidence including the results of the ASPREE trial.

### Low-dose aspirin and progression of age-related hearing loss: a secondary analysis of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^98fc102b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Age-related hearing loss is estimated to affect over half of adults aged 70 years or older and is associated with social isolation, depression, loss of functional independence, and poor quality of life. It is characterized by impaired speech discrimination and progressive, bilateral, high frequency loss, observed on audiometric assessment. Established risk factors for age-related hearing loss include smoking and diabetes,

The pathophysiology of age-related hearing loss is thought to involve an age-related decline in cochlear function accompanied by degenerative changes in central auditory pathways. Within the cochlea, the predominant pathology includes atrophy of the stria vascularis, together with a loss of hair cells and synaptic connections among spiral ganglion neurons. Animal studies have provided evidence of microvascular changes, including capillary loss, which may contribute to strial atrophy.

Aspirin has been investigated on account of its ability to prevent platelet aggregation and potentially enhance blood flow through small striatal blood vessels. In addition, its anti-inflammatory effect may reduce damage at a cellular level. To date, relevant human data on aspirin have been derived from observational studies and the results have been inconsistent. A review in 2014 summarized 37 of these studies and noted poorer hearing outcome among individuals taking more than 1.95 g/d of aspirin, but no studies focused on low-dose aspirin. We have not identified any randomized clinical trial comparing the effect of low-dose aspirin vs placebo on the progression of age-related hearing loss.

The ASPREE-Hearing (Aspirin in Hearing, Retinal Vessels Imaging and Neurocognition in Older Generations) substudy of the ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) randomized clinical trial offers a unique opportunity to address inconsistencies reported among previous observational studies. Identification of an effective approach to reduce age-related hearing loss progression might reduce the burden of cost and morbidity associated with this prevalent sensory disturbance. We aimed to determine whether daily low-dose aspirin slows age-related hearing loss progression in healthy community-dwelling older adults.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^b2ea0e2a]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^3fe6d976]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In the post-trial period, aspirin exposure was similar between those initially randomized to aspirin and placebo and was higher in US participants compared with participants in Australia. This was consistent with pre-trial aspirin use being higher in US participants. Aspirin use post-trial among all randomized participants mirrored the trends over time seen in those who were not censored for MACE, though with slightly higher rates overall (see Supplementary data online, Figure S1).

Characteristics at the end of the trial for participants who consented to ASPREE-XT were similar between the randomized aspirin and placebo groups, apart from slightly lower haemoglobin and fasting blood glucose levels in those initially randomized to aspirin compared with placebo (Table 1). See Supplementary data online, Table S2 for additional characteristics. The proportion of participants who had major haemorrhage during the trial was higher, and the proportion that had an in-trial MACE was lower, in those randomized to aspirin. Characteristics at the end of the trial were also generally similar between the aspirin and placebo groups when restricted to participants who had not had a MACE during the trial (see Supplementary data online, Table S3). Among these 15 668 participants, the median age at the end of the trial was 79 years (IQR 76–82). Among participants who remained free of MACE during the trial, the post-trial 5-year predicted MACE risk was similar between those randomized to aspirin and those randomized to placebo (see Supplementary data online, Table S3). Including those with in-trial MACE (assigned a 100% predicted risk), among all ASPREE-XT participants, the mean predicted 5-year MACE risk was slightly higher in the placebo group than in the aspirin group because of the slightly higher proportion of participants in the placebo group with in-trial MACE (Table 1).

Strategies and Evidence

Past Randomized Trials

Initial trials of low-dose aspirin therapy for primary CVD prevention — including the Physicians' Health Study, TPT (Thrombosis Prevention Trial), HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study), and Primary Prevention Project (PPP) — suggested that aspirin conferred modest CV protection, particularly against nonfatal myocardial infarction, in individuals without established CVD. – Similarly, while the Women's Health Study did not show a reduction in its primary end point of major CV events with aspirin, it did suggest a modest benefit in women ages 65 years and older. A meta-analysis of these early trials showed a 12 and 14% odds of reduction in CV events associated with aspirin therapy in women and men, respectively. These CV risk reductions accompanied significant increases in major bleeding risk (68% and 72% in women and men, respectively). Given this clinical tradeoff and the assumption that aspirin's benefit increases with a patient's baseline CV risk, newer studies were designed in the mid to late 2000s to study primary preventive aspirin therapy in high-risk groups. ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE enrolled subjects with diabetes, subjects with multiple CVD risk factors and without diabetes, and the elderly, respectively. – Their results cast further doubt on aspirin's role in primary CV prevention, as ARRIVE and ASPREE did not show significant CV benefit with aspirin, and ASCEND demonstrated CV benefit that was counterbalanced by a substantial increase in the risk of major bleeding. However, it is important to note that despite the intention of recent trials to study higher-risk primary prevention populations, the event rates in ASCEND, ARRIVE, and ASPREE were ≈1% per year, consistent with lower-risk populations. Thus, the power of these studies was lower than expected, and the translatability of these findings to higher-risk primary prevention populations is uncertain.

### Effects of aspirin on risks of vascular events and cancer according to bodyweight and dose: analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials [^001695b9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Although our findings of dose–weight interactions in the effects of aspirin were consistent across trials and for vascular events and cancer, this study has some limitations. First, we included some older trials, and temporal changes in risk factors or medication could alter findings. However, low-dose, enteric-coated aspirin is widely used in clinical practice and was used in the three forthcoming primary prevention trials (ASPREE, ARRIVE, and ASCEND), so our main findings are likely to be relevant. Second, only one primary prevention trialused standard-release, low-dose aspirin, and no data were available from similar trials in secondary prevention;, thus, investigation of the weight dependence of the effect of standard-release, low-dose aspirin was inexact (appendix p 9). However, the aspirin component of the twice-daily tablet used in the ESPS-2 trial was standard release (figure 2). Third, some trials were only in men and some only in women, but we did analyses in both sexes separately when possible. Fourth, we validated findings in trials in secondary prevention of stroke and cannot be certain of the generalisability of the results to other secondary prevention settings. We also had no data on the different subtypes of ischaemic stroke. Atrial fibrillation is associated with greater height but was an exclusion criterion in the primary prevention trials, and onset of atrial fibrillation during follow-up would only account for a small proportion of strokes. Fifth, bodyweight might have changed during trial follow-up, although height is more stable than weight. Sixth, although we excluded confounding by withdrawal from randomised treatment (appendix p 6), we had no additional data on levels of compliance. It is possible that missed doses might particularly undermine effectiveness at larger body size. Seventh, optimal weight or height clearly differed for low-dose versus higher-dose aspirin, but differences between 300–325 mg and 500 mg or more could not be reliably ascertained, and no trials were available of doses between 100 mg and 300 mg. Eighth, body-fat distribution might modify the effect of aspirin to a greater extent than does BMI but is unlikely to confound the effect modification found for height and lean body mass. Finally, we did not aim to estimate the current overall balance of risk and benefit from aspirin given that several of the trials were done more than 20 years ago.

### Identifying and reducing inappropriate aspirin use in primary care [^eacb2d97]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

In 2002, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended the consideration of aspirin chemoprevention for patients at high risk for CVD, specifically men aged 40 years and older, postmenopausal women and younger patients with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use. The American Heart Association (AHA) supported this recommendation but specifically recommended aspirin 75–160 mg daily in patients with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of at least 10%. Similarly, the 2003 update to the Standards of Medical Care for Patients with Diabetes Mellitus recommended aspirin therapy for all adult patients with diabetes and macrovascular disease, with consideration for patients aged 40 years and older with diabetes and one other cardiovascular risk factor.

Results from the Women's Health Study in 2005 led to an update to the AHA guideline 2007 that recommended aspirin therapy for high-risk women aged 65 and older. In 2009, the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATT) completed a meta-analysis of six primary prevention studies evaluating aspirin in patients without diabetes with no history of occlusive disease who had been taking aspirin for at least 2 years. This meta-analysis demonstrated a 12% proportional reduction in major cardiovascular events, particularly non-fatal MI. These findings fueled further updates to USPSTF and AHA recommendations and the development of guideline recommendations from the American College of Chest Physicians. The 2016 USPSTF update took a more detailed approach, outlining recommendations for specific age groups based on the calculated 10-year CVD risk. Low-dose aspirin was recommended for adults aged 50–59 with a CVD risk of at least 10%. For adults aged 60–69 with a CVD risk of at least 10%, clinicians were encouraged to assess risk factors to make an informed decision about aspirin use. These guidelines were widely followed in clinical practice until 2018, following the publication of the Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events (ARRIVE), A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) and Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) studies.

### Primary care providers should prescribe aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease based on benefit-risk ratio, not age [^839e1c47]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

The point estimate for each of the four was in the direction of a benefit of ASA on CVD (figure 1).

ASCENDrandomised 15 480 subjects with diabetes mellitus without prior CVD aged 40 to 85 years who were treated at entry and followed for 7.2 years. ASA produced a significant 12% benefit on CVD (HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.97, p = 0.010) and a significant increased risk of major bleeding (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.52, p = 0.003). Older patients had the same apparent benefit from ASA than those at younger and middle ages. ARRIVErandomised 12 546 subjects, > 55 years of age for men and 60 years for women, with a 10-year risk of a first event of 10% to 20%. There was no significant reduction in CVD (HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.13). ASPREErandomised 19 104 subjects > 70 years and showed no significant reduction in the primary combined endpoint (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.08). In those above age 70 years, there was a possible but not significant 11% reduction in their prespecified tertiary endpoint of CVD, which closely resembled that used in other trials and meta-analyses. TIPS-3randomised 5713 subjects to a polypill and/or ASA and reported HRs on CVD of 0.79 (0.63 to 1.00) and 0.86 (0.67 to 1.10), respectively. For the combined treatment, the HR was 0.69 (0.50 to 0.97). Older patients had the same apparent benefit from ASA as those at younger and middle ages.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^297e6e90]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes in CVD primary prevention populations — mixed findings with limited long-term evidence: "Four studies conducted in primary CVD prevention populations found no association between aspirin use and CRC incidence at up to approximately 10 years of follow-up." Only one trial extended beyond 10 years, the WHS "(n = 39 876)," which reported lower CRC incidence at "17.5 years of follow-up (Peto OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69–0.98])," but this "did not persist from 17.5 to 26 years of follow-up." For CRC mortality, ASPREE showed higher mortality at "4.7 years of follow-up (Peto OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.02–2.95])," while the Thrombosis Prevention Trial "(n = 5085)" found lower CRC mortality at "18.3 years of follow-up (Peto OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.41–0.94])." In WHS, lower CRC mortality at "17.5 years" was "not statistically significant (Peto OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.64–1.16])" and was attenuated through "26 years of follow-up."

Covariates

Both social determinants of health (SDoH) and traditional factors were considered as covariates.

SDoH variables were grouped based on the Healthy People 2030 frameworkand outlined as follows:
Economic stability: Includes employment, household income, and homeownership.
Education access and quality: Encompassing education status and first language.
Social and community context: Includes social network, social participation, volunteering, optimism, stressful life events, hobby engagement, and depression
Health care access and quality: Considered health insurance
The neighbourhood and built environment: Includes remoteness, socioeconomic indexes for areas (SEIFA), and satisfaction with transportation.

The traditional covariates in this study were age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and renal function measures (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)). The details about the measurement and categorisation of the variables are elaborated in Supplementary table S1 and our published article. Building on prior research from the ASPREE cohort, which revealed an increased risk of all-cause mortality among individuals taking aspirin compared to placebo, treatment assignment (aspirin vs. placebo) was also included as a covariate in the analysis of the relationship between exposure variables and all-cause mortality. However, because aspirin showed no effect on CVD in this cohort, it was excluded as a covariate when assessing the relationship between the exposure variables and CVD risk.

### In healthy older adults, low-dose aspirin increases all-… [^1d109a06]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does low-dose aspirin reduce all-cause mortality in generally healthy older adults. Bottom Line The findings are completely unexpected. Although recent studies by this group and other groups of researchers have failed to find a cardiovascular benefit, likely because of better control of other cardiovascular risk factors, this study found increased all-cause mortality, primarily due to increased cancer-related mortality. Other studies, such as the individual patient meta-analysis by Rothwell and colleagues: 31–41), found the opposite. A Bayesian thinker would urge caution in interpreting these results, considering the existing body of research concluding the opposite regarding cancer-specific mortality. Synopsis This is one of three reports of the same study in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine; this one focuses on all-cause mortality.

The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly trial randomized 19, 114 community-dwelling adults to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. The study was conducted in the United States and Australia, with patients recruited between 2010 and 2014. Participants were 70 years or older, had no serious comorbidity that would be expected to limit their life expectancy to less than five years, and no known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, dementia, high bleeding risk, or contraindication to aspirin. All-cause mortality was higher in the aspirin group.

### Aspirin with or without statin in Individuals without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across risk Categories [^73e59db8]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains controversial. In 2019, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommended considering prophylactic low-dose aspirin only among asymptomatic individuals at high risk of ASCVD events, low bleeding risk, and age < 70 years (IIb). In 2021, the European Society of Cardiology primary prevention guidelines endorsed a similar recommendation. More recently, the updated United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2022 guidelines recommended individualizing low-dose aspirin only among adults aged 40 to 59 years, if their 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 10% and they have low bleeding risk (Class C). In contrast, the guidelines recommend against the use of aspirin among adults ≥ 60 years (Class D). These recommendations stem from a USPSTF meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials demonstrating a significant reduction in major ASCVD events with aspirin at the cost of higher rates of major bleeding.

Statin is used as first-line therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD due to cardiovascular benefits. Most randomized evidence favoring aspirin in primary prevention was conducted in the pre-statin era, whereas statin therapy use was more frequent at baseline in recent trials. For instance, the proportion of participants on a statin in ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly), ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events), and ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes)trials were 65%, 43%, and 75%, respectively. Since statin therapy would mitigate baseline ASCVD risk, lower cardiovascular effects of aspirin in post-statin era trials might be attributable to the higher use of statin therapy. Furthermore, given a much more favorable risk-benefit profile, most patients considered for ASCVD risk reduction in current clinical practice would be expected to be on baseline statin therapy before entertaining a decision on possible aspirin initiation.

Prior studies, did not explore the potential impact of statin therapy on the net risk/benefit ratio of aspirin therapy. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the relative and absolute effects of aspirin in adults without ASCVD, stratified by statin use across different ASCVD risks.

Aspirin for primary prevention in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Large trials assessing aspirin versus placebo for primary prevention in high‑risk populations found that any harm from major bleeding counterbalanced any benefit on cardiovascular risk, with ASPREE and ARRIVE finding no significant effect on cardiovascular events; a dedicated large primary prevention aspirin trial in CKD is underway. Certainty of evidence is described as low, with a low certainty of evidence (Level C). For resource use, low‑dose aspirin is available at low cost and does not require monitoring. Proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) are generally effective, safe, and low cost, and the Work Group considered it prudent to consider bleeding risk when prescribing antiplatelet or antithrombotic therapy, particularly when such therapies are combined.

### Use of preventive aspirin among older US adults with and without diabetes [^0b3fde3a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

In 2018, data from 3 randomized clinical trials found a significantly increased risk of adverse bleeding events with variable benefits associated with aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD among older adults with and without diabetes. The ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events) trial found no difference in cardiovascular events when comparing aspirin use to placebo in an average-risk population 55 years (men) or 60 years (women) or older without diabetes. The ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial found that aspirin use for primary prevention in the general population of adults 70 years or older or in Black and Hispanic individuals 65 years or older (11% with diabetes) showed no benefit in CVD prevention compared with placebo for adults without CVD, dementia, or disabilitybut significantly increased the risk of hemorrhage and all-cause mortality. Importantly, the ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes) trial found that aspirin use for primary prevention among individuals with diabetes 40 years or older significantly lowered the risk of serious vascular events; however, the incidence of major bleeding was higher as well, although subgroup analysis did not suggest significant differences by age. Given these findings, use of aspirin for primary prevention demands a patient-centered approach to evaluate risks and benefits.

In response, several professional societies have updated their guidelines on preventive aspirin use and called for careful consideration in older adults. With these recent paradigm shifts, it is important to understand the current landscape of aspirin use for CVD prevention in order to appropriately inform clinical management of populations most at risk for adverse events. The extent to which older populations with vs without diabetes currently use aspirin for CVD prevention, as well as the demographic and clinical factors associated with preventive aspirin use, have, to our knowledge, not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we aimed to characterize the prevalence of preventive aspirin use by CVD status in a nationally representative sample of US adults with and without diabetes who were 60 years or older from 2011 to 2018 and to investigate the presence of potential overuse of preventive aspirin therapy in older adults.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^2b33e247]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Purpose

To update a systematic review about the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 40 years or older and to evaluate effect modification in subpopulations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2008 to January 2015), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently reviewed 3396 abstracts and 65 articles according to prespecified criteria. All included trials evaluated aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction

Two investigators assessed study quality; data were abstracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.

Data Synthesis

Two good-quality and 9 fair-quality randomized, controlled trials were identified. In analyses of all doses, aspirin reduced the risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87]) but not nonfatal stroke; aspirin showed little or no benefit for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Benefits began within the first 5 years. Older adults achieved greater relative MI reduction, but no other effect modifications were found in analyzed subpopulations. In trials with aspirin doses of 100 mg or less per day, the reduction in nonfatal MI benefit persisted (absolute risk reduction, 0.15 to 1.43 events per 1000 person-years) and a 14% reduction in nonfatal stroke benefit was noted, but no benefit was found for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]) or cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.97 [CI, 0.85 to 1.10]).

Limitation

Evidence for aspirin in primary prevention is heterogeneous and limited by rare events and few credible subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

The beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is modest and occurs at doses of 100 mg or less per day. Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative MI benefit.

Table 2
Effect of low-dose aspirin versus control on risk of cardiovascular events according to weight and smoking status

The weight dependence of the effect of low-dose aspirin on cardiovascular events was observed for all tablet formulations (appendix pp 8,9), but loss of effect in participants weighing 70 kg or more was more evident for enteric-coated or delayed-release aspirin and alternate-day, standard-release aspirin than for daily, standard-release aspirin.

In participants weighing 70 kg or more, low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) was associated with an increase in case fatality of first cardiovascular events (OR 1·33 [95% CI 1·08–1·64], p = 0·0082; appendix p 10), particularly for myocardial infarction (1·73 [1·20–2·49], p = 0·0035), with an overall increase in fatal first cardiovascular events in participants aged 70 years or older (HR 1·45 [95% CI 1·01–2·10], p = 0·04).

### Short-and long-term impact of aspirin cessation in older adults: a target trial emulation [^40f3b922]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

For outcome analysis, Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each outcome at 3, 6, and 12 months and over the full time period of follow-up (approximately 4 years) after T0, with adjustment made for the PS. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed with Schoenfeld residuals, and no violations were found.

Three sensitivity analyses were performed with different eligibility criteria: (1) inclusion of participants who had a possible aspirin indication, to assess the impact of aspirin cessation in all participants without confirmed usage for secondary prevention (2) excluding participants who reported the use of other antithrombotic medications for primary prevention which might increase the risk of bleeding associated with aspirin; and (3) including more covariates in the propensity score that are associated with CVD and death risk in older people, including high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), fasting plasma glucose, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), grip strength, and gait speed.

We additionally performed a per-protocol analysis using an inverse-probability-of-censoring weights (IPCW) approach. Endpoint-specific analyses were conducted in which participants remaining alive in primary prevention were right-censored at the first occurrence of continuation/cessation nonadherence. We applied IPCW to upweight remaining participants for imparted informative censoring at selected time points. Non-adherence was defined in the cessation group as the initiation of open-label aspirin; in the continuation group, it was the cessation of open-label aspirin. Weights were calculated separately for the two treatment groups using the same set of covariates used for the propensity score and additionally time-varying covariates for CVD events (in mortality and major hemorrhage analyses) and major hemorrhage events (in CVD, MACE, and mortality analyses). The product of time-varying IPCW and time-fixed PS weights were used in weighted Cox proportional hazards models.

All statistical tests were 2-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.2 (R Core Team, 2020).

Role of the funding source

The funding sources and drug provider played no role in the design, conduct, and reporting of the ASPREE trial, ASPREE-XT, and this analysis.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^fbef1c49]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention — ARRIVE and ASPREE show no cardiovascular benefit and higher bleeding. ARRIVE reported no benefit on the primary efficacy end point with HR 0.96 [95% CI 0.81–1.13]; P = 0.60, while gastrointestinal bleeding was higher at 0.97% vs. 0.46% (HR 2.11 [95% CI 1.36–3.28]; P = 0.0007). In ASPREE, cardiovascular disease rates were 10.7 vs. 11.3 per 1,000 person-years (HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.83–1.08]) and major hemorrhage rates were 8.6 vs. 6.2 per 1,000 person-years (HR 1.38 [95% CI 1.18–1.62]; P < 0.001).

### Effects of aspirin on risks of vascular events and cancer according to bodyweight and dose: analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials [^3451bc80]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

In the pooled analysis of trials of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention, the ability of 75–100 mg aspirin to reduce cardiovascular events decreased with increasing weight (p interaction = 0·0072; table 1, figure 1). Low-dose aspirin had the greatest effect on cardiovascular events in participants weighing 50–69 kg (383 events in 15 155 participants treated with aspirin vs 504 events in 15 145 participants treated with control; HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·65–0·85]; p < 0·0001), particularly with daily use (172 of 4432 treated with aspirin vs 245 of 4400 treated with control; 0·68 [0·56–0·83], p = 0·0001; figure 1). In the one trialof alternate-day dosing, 100 mg aspirin was effective in participants weighing 50–59 kg (72 of 4325 vs 102 of 4408; 0·72 [0·52–0·96], p = 0·025; figure 1) and in those weighing 60–69 kg who were not allocated to vitamin E (appendix p 4). However, the reduction in cardiovascular events with 75–100 mg aspirin in people weighing 50–59 kg was not seen in people weighing less than 50 kg (1·25 [0·74–2·09], p = 0·40; figure 1), who also had an increased risk of all-cause death (1·52 [1·04–2·21], p = 0·031). No hazard was evident in people weighing less than 50 kg after exclusion of people with a BMI of less than 18·5 kg/m 2 (19 of 724 vs 22 of 696; 0·80 [0·43–1·47], p = 0·47; figure 1).
