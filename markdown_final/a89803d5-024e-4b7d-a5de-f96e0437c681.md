## Question

Do we treat fungal UTI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether we should treat fungal urinary tract infections and, if so, how to decide when and how to treat them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing colonization from true infection. Then, I should categorize the clinical syndromes and risk groups that warrant therapy. Next, I will review first-line antifungal choices and dosing by syndrome, followed by alternatives for resistant organisms. After that, I need to consider source control and procedural management. Finally, I should address special populations, monitoring, and antifungal stewardship to avoid overtreatment.

> Let me first confirm the distinction between colonization and infection, because most candiduria represents colonization and does not require treatment. Asymptomatic candiduria is common in hospitalized patients with indwelling catheters, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, or critical illness, and routine antifungal therapy is not recommended unless the patient is high risk for dissemination, such as neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants, or those undergoing urologic procedures, so I should not jump to treat a positive culture without compatible symptoms or high-risk context [^112jum88] [^1166d7zE] [^114agNSG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the diagnostic approach before labeling a fungal UTI. I need to check for symptoms of cystitis, pyelonephritis, or prostatitis, repeat the urinalysis and culture to confirm true funguria, and look for pyuria, although pyuria alone is nonspecific and colony counts are not reliably diagnostic; in symptomatic or high-risk patients, renal ultrasound is appropriate to assess for obstruction or fungus balls, with CT if needed to define abscesses or perinephric collections [^notfound].

> Next, I should review who warrants treatment, and I need to ensure I categorize correctly. Symptomatic patients with compatible urinary symptoms should be treated, as should high-risk hosts such as neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants, and patients about to undergo urologic instrumentation, because these groups have a meaningful risk of dissemination; conversely, asymptomatic, non-high-risk patients should not receive antifungals, and management should focus on removing predisposing factors like catheters [^112jum88] [^113VSWGa] [^114agNSG].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for symptomatic Candida cystitis due to fluconazole-susceptible organisms. Fluconazole is preferred because it achieves urine concentrations roughly 10–20 times serum levels and has excellent oral bioavailability; the recommended regimen is 200 mg orally daily for 14 days, and I should remember to remove or replace indwelling catheters whenever feasible to improve clearance and reduce recurrence risk [^117K5MpB] [^117FYG8d] [^117KuACh].

> Wait, let me verify the approach for fluconazole-resistant Candida, especially C. glabrata and C. krusei. For C. glabrata cystitis, amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg IV daily for 1–7 days or oral flucytosine 25 mg/kg four times daily for 7–10 days are options, with flucytosine monotherapy less favored due to resistance risk. For C. krusei, amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days is recommended, and bladder irrigation with amphotericin B may be considered selectively for fluconazole-resistant cystitis, though evidence is limited and recurrence is common, so I should reserve it for special cases [^117K5MpB] [^1113ZHtZ] [^113w7FMT].

> Let me consider ascending infection and pyelonephritis, because I need to ensure duration and source control are addressed. For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, fluconazole 200–400 mg daily for 2 weeks is recommended, with longer courses if clinical response is slow; for fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata or C. krusei, amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days, with or without flucytosine, is advised, and critically, I must eliminate urinary tract obstruction and consider removal or replacement of nephrostomy tubes or stents to achieve source control and prevent treatment failure [^113pFARK] [^111vsaac].

> I should double-check the management of fungus balls, because systemic therapy alone is often insufficient. Surgical or endoscopic removal of obstructing mycelial masses is strongly recommended in adults, combined with systemic antifungal therapy as above. If a nephrostomy tube is present, local irrigation with amphotericin B deoxycholate 25–50 mg in 200–500 mL sterile water can be used as an adjunct, recognizing that this addresses luminal disease rather than parenchymal infection [^113A8wzT] [^114o6cmf] [^113we8Sw].

> But wait, what if the pathogen is not Candida? I need to ensure I consider molds such as Aspergillus in the right context. For renal aspergillosis, a combined medical–urologic approach is suggested, with voriconazole for parenchymal disease and decompression plus local amphotericin B instillation for obstructing lesions, noting that most systemic agents achieve poor urinary concentrations; case reports suggest posaconazole may help in select scenarios, but evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^1142ujiR] [^113RJsNz] [^111TzZWD].

> Next, I should review special populations, and I need to be careful with neonates and very low-birth-weight infants. In these patients, candiduria often reflects disseminated disease and warrants systemic therapy per candidemia protocols, typically amphotericin B deoxycholate 1 mg/kg daily or fluconazole 12 mg/kg daily if not previously on fluconazole prophylaxis; obstructive fungal bezoars in neonates may require nephrostomy and local irrigation in addition to systemic therapy given poor drug penetration into fungal masses [^116Ce87R] [^112eewKH].

> I should confirm the approach to asymptomatic candiduria in patients undergoing urologic procedures, because prophylaxis is indicated in this narrow circumstance. Peri-procedural antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole 400 mg daily or amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for several days before and after the procedure reduces the risk of dissemination and is recommended in this high-risk group [^114jrE2Z] [^112jum88].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of bladder irrigation outside of these narrow contexts. Routine amphotericin B bladder irrigation for asymptomatic or uncomplicated candiduria is not recommended due to limited durable benefit and frequent recurrence; it may be considered only for select cases of fluconazole-resistant cystitis when other options are unsuitable, and even then, catheter management remains paramount [^116P5w1o] [^112SRuT6].

> Let me reconsider drug selection nuances, because I need to ensure pharmacokinetics align with site of infection. Fluconazole remains the preferred agent for most Candida UTIs given its high urinary concentrations, whereas echinocandins have poor urinary penetration and are generally not recommended for isolated lower tract candidiasis; however, in candidemia of urinary source, early echinocandin therapy was not associated with worse outcomes compared with fluconazole, underscoring that systemic candidiasis management differs from isolated UTI therapy [^117KuACh] [^116G6rGz] [^112oD4Jj].

> I need to ensure I address source control and device management, because failure to remove predisposing factors undermines pharmacologic therapy. Removing or replacing indwelling urinary catheters when feasible, correcting urinary tract obstruction, and coordinating urologic interventions for stones, strictures, or leaks are essential steps that reduce persistence and recurrence of fungal UTI [^113VSWGa] [^112BeWJp] [^1117cEAA].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up, and I should confirm that cultures guide duration decisions. Repeat urinalysis and culture after completing therapy help verify eradication, and in complicated cases or poor response, imaging with ultrasound or CT should be repeated to reassess for obstruction or abscess; in high-risk hosts, I must maintain vigilance for dissemination and consider blood cultures if clinically indicated [^1158o9tP].

> Finally, I need to emphasize antifungal stewardship, because overtreatment of colonization drives resistance and unnecessary toxicity. Many hospitalized patients with candiduria improve after catheter removal alone, and routine antifungal therapy for asymptomatic, non-high-risk patients should be avoided; when therapy is indicated, use the narrowest effective agent for the shortest effective duration aligned with guideline-based regimens and local susceptibility patterns [^113VSWGa] [^112jum88] [^113Ekap2].

> In summary, yes — we do treat fungal UTIs, but only when there is true infection or a high-risk context for dissemination. For symptomatic cystitis due to fluconazole-susceptible Candida, treat with fluconazole 200 mg daily for 14 days plus catheter management, for pyelonephritis extend to 2 weeks and ensure obstruction is relieved, for fluconazole-resistant organisms use amphotericin B or flucytosine-based regimens, and for fungus balls pursue surgical or endoscopic removal with adjunctive systemic therapy and local irrigation as indicated, all while avoiding treatment of asymptomatic colonization outside defined high-risk scenarios [^117K5MpB] [^113pFARK] [^113A8wzT] [^112jum88].

---

Treat fungal UTIs when patients are **symptomatic** or at **high risk** (neutropenia, very low birth weight, or undergoing urologic procedures) [^112jum88]. For Candida UTIs, **fluconazole is first-line** [^117K5MpB]; use amphotericin B or flucytosine for resistant species [^1113ZHtZ]. Remove or replace indwelling catheters when possible [^113VSWGa] [^112BeWJp]. Do not treat asymptomatic candiduria except in high-risk patients [^112jum88] [^114agNSG]. For Aspergillus UTIs, combine medical and urologic management, including decompression and local amphotericin B, plus systemic voriconazole for parenchymal disease [^1142ujiR] [^113RJsNz].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Patients with symptomatic candiduria (e.g. dysuria, frequency, urgency, fever, flank pain) should be treated [^117K5MpB].

- **High-risk patients**: Asymptomatic patients at high risk for dissemination, including neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants (< 1,500 g), and patients undergoing urologic procedures, should receive antifungal therapy [^112jum88] [^114jrE2Z].

- **Complicated infections**: Patients with complicated UTIs, such as those with indwelling catheters, diabetes mellitus, or immunocompromised states, may require treatment even if asymptomatic, depending on clinical judgment and risk assessment [^notfound].

## Antifungal agents and treatment regimens

### Candida species

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antifungal therapy** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic cystitis (fluconazole-susceptible) | Fluconazole 200 mg orally daily | 14 days [^117K5MpB] [^115unPRC] |
| Symptomatic cystitis (fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata) | Amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg IV daily or flucytosine 25 mg/kg orally four times daily | 7–10 days [^117K5MpB] [^1113ZHtZ] |
| Symptomatic cystitis (C. krusei) | Amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg IV daily | 7–10 days [^notfound] |
| Pyelonephritis (fluconazole-susceptible) | Fluconazole 200–400 mg orally daily | 14 days [^113pFARK] [^111vsaac] |
| Pyelonephritis (fluconazole-resistant) | Amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg IV daily ± flucytosine 25 mg/kg orally four times daily | 14 days [^notfound] |
| Fungus balls | Surgical or endoscopic removal + antifungal therapy | Individualized [^113A8wzT] [^114o6cmf] |

---

Catheter management is essential: **remove or replace** indwelling catheters whenever feasible [^113VSWGa] [^112BeWJp].

---

### Aspergillus species

For Aspergillus UTIs, **combined medical and urologic management** is recommended, including surgical or endoscopic intervention for obstruction, local amphotericin B deoxycholate irrigation (25–50 mg in 200–500 mL sterile water) [^114o6cmf], and systemic voriconazole for parenchymal disease [^113RJsNz].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates vary by patient population, antifungal agent, and **underlying risk factors**. Fluconazole is effective for susceptible Candida species, achieving high urinary concentrations and favorable clinical responses [^117KuACh]. Amphotericin B and flucytosine are effective for resistant species but carry higher toxicity risks [^113pFARK] [^113w7FMT]. Recurrence is common, particularly in patients with persistent risk factors such as indwelling catheters or immunosuppression [^113w7FMT] [^116UgUSN].

---

## Potential complications of untreated fungal UTIs

Untreated fungal UTIs can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Ascending infection**: Pyelonephritis, renal abscesses, and fungus balls (mycetomas) causing obstruction and renal damage [^114o6cmf].

- **Disseminated infection**: Candidemia, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with indwelling devices [^112jum88].

- **Renal impairment**: Chronic renal scarring and impaired renal function, especially in neonates and immunocompromised patients [^112eewKH].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Neonates and very low-birth-weight infants are at high risk for disseminated candidiasis and require aggressive antifungal therapy and careful monitoring [^112jum88].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: These patients have higher risks of complicated infections and recurrence, necessitating individualized treatment plans and close follow-up [^112xCmtx].

- **Antifungal resistance**: Emerging resistance, particularly in Candida auris, requires careful selection of antifungal agents and consideration of susceptibility testing [^114LFFo8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Fungal UTIs should be treated in symptomatic patients or those at **high risk for dissemination** [^112jum88]. Fluconazole is **first-line** for susceptible Candida species, with amphotericin B or flucytosine reserved for resistant organisms [^117K5MpB] [^1113ZHtZ]. Catheter management and source control are critical components of therapy [^113VSWGa] [^112BeWJp]. Asymptomatic candiduria should not be treated except in high-risk patients [^114agNSG].

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of:

Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole was also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see CLINICAL STUDIES section. Studies comparing fluconazole to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Prophylaxis - Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Epidemiology of intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infections [^1112sTeU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The development of urinary tract infections in critically ill adult patients is associated with considerable morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and greater healthcare expenditures. We review the occurrence, microbiology, risk factors for acquisition, and outcomes associated with intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infections.

Recent Findings

Reports from several countries indicate that nosocomial urinary tract infections frequently complicate the course of patients admitted to intensive care units. Virtually all patients who develop an intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infection have indwelling urinary catheters; other factors associated with the development of these infections include increased duration of urinary catheterization, female sex, intensive care unit length of stay, and preceding systemic antimicrobial therapy. The most frequent pathogens include Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Candida albicans; both the species distribution and rates of resistance vary considerably among institutions and regions. Secondary bloodstream infections are uncommon. Although acquisition of an intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infection has been associated with a prolongation of intensive care unit length of stay, higher cost, and a higher crude case fatality rate, they do not appear to independently increase the risk for death.

Summary

Urinary tract infection is a common complication of critical illness that is associated with increased patient morbidity but not mortality. There is a relative paucity of research on nosocomial urinary tract infection specifically acquired in the intensive care unit and further studies are needed to better define the epidemiology and management of these infections.

Symptomatic Candida cystitis — antifungal therapy and catheter management are specified: For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, oral fluconazole, 200 mg (3 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days OR oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7–10 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for 1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Removal of an indwelling bladder catheter, if feasible, is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). AmB deoxycholate bladder irrigation, 50 mg/L sterile water daily for 5 days, may be useful for treatment of cystitis due to fluconazole-resistant species, such as C. glabrata and C. krusei (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^114geuHD]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The individualization of treatment duration for candidemia and/or IC remains challenging.

The prolonged use of antibiotics can disrupt the host's microbiota and induce resistance in pathogens, leading to suggestions from guidelines such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's sepsis and septic shock guidelines to use shorter courses of treatment whenever possible. However, these suggestions are limited to bacterial causes of pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, excluding candidemia and/or IC. Currently, treatment continues for two weeks after two negative blood cultures, following infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) and European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines, to prevent recurrence. However, this "one-size-fits-all" approach may not suit all patients and could unnecessarily prolong hospital stays, increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and antibiotic resistance, and escalate healthcare costs.

Over the past year, research about urinary tract infections in childhood has yielded new data about methods to detect, treat, and evaluate children who develop urinary tract infection. New imaging modalities have been studied. Long term studies following children with urinary tract infection have also been published over the last year. However, major questions remain to be answered, including the underlying basis of host-pathogen interactions in the urinary tract, as well as the most effective methods for clinical diagnosis and management.

### Urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes [^115DcRAt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Results of various epidemiologic studies suggest that bacteriuria and urinary tract infection (UTI) occur more commonly in women with diabetes than in women without this disease. Similar findings have been demonstrated for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), with ASB being a risk factor for pyelonephritis and subsequent decline in renal function. Although ASB is not associated with serious health outcomes in healthy patients, further research needs to be undertaken regarding the impact of ASB in patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetes often have increased complications of UTI, including such rare complications as emphysematous cystitis and pyelonephritis, fungal infections (particularly Candida species), and increased severity and unusual manifestations (e.g., gram-negative pathogens other than Escherichia coli). Anatomic and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract are also associated with diabetes. Such abnormalities result in greater instrumentation of the urinary tract, thereby increasing the risk of secondary UTI. In addition, these abnormalities complicate UTI and require specialized treatment strategies. There is a greater likelihood of UTI affected by antimicrobial resistance or atypical uropathogens, and the risk of upper tract involvement is increased. Pre- and posttherapy urine cultures are therefore indicated. The initial choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy should be based on Gram stain and urine culture. Choice of antibiotic therapy should integrate local sensitivity patterns of the infecting organism. Fluoroquinolones are a reasonable empiric choice for many patients with diabetes. For seriously ill patients, including patients infected with Pseudomonas spp., such agents as imipenem, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam may also be considered. Treatment of ASB in patients with diabetes is often recommended to prevent the risk of symptomatic UTI. However, the management of ASB in patients with diabetes is complex, with no single preferred approach.

### Candida urinary tract infections – epidemiology [^115mjtK9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Candiduria is rarely present in healthy individuals. In contrast, it is a common finding in hospitalized patients, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs) who often have multiple predisposing factors, including diabetes mellitus, indwelling urinary catheters, and exposure to antimicrobials. Candiduria occurs much less commonly in the community setting. In a majority of episodes in adult patients in critical care facilities candiduria represents colonization, and antifungal therapy is not required. However, the presence of yeast in the urine can be a sign of a disseminated infection. In the critically ill newborn, candiduria often reflects disseminated candidiasis and is accompanied by obstructing fungus ball formation in the urinary tract. In ICU patients, although candiduria is a marker for increased mortality, it is only rarely attributable to Candida urinary tract infection.

### Antifungal stewardship in practice: insights from a prospective audit and feedback program [^113Ekap2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study yielded several important findings. First, 21% of antifungal audits at our hospital were associated with a recommendation, highlighting a significant opportunity to improve antifungal prescribing in hospitalized children, particularly those in the CVICU or those receiving antifungals for sepsis or respiratory tract infections. Second, the overall rate of antifungal PAF recommendation acceptance was high and was not significantly different from the rate of antibiotic recommendation acceptance, indicating that prescribers were receptive to this ASP intervention. Third, our analysis revealed several differences in the recommendation and acceptance rates of antifungal and antibiotic PAF for specific infections (eg, UTI and SSTI) and types of recommendations (eg, discontinuation or duration modification). Finally, units with fewer antifungal audits but high recommendation rates (eg, CVICU) may represent significant opportunities for antifungal optimization. Taken together, these findings suggest that antifungal PAF has the potential to identify important patterns of antifungal utilization and may be an effective tool for optimizing antifungal prescribing in the pediatric setting.

Our data are consistent with previously published epidemiologic surveys reporting that the most audited antifungal was fluconazole, most common indication for audited antifungals was prophylaxis, and most antifungal audits occurred among Heme/Onc/SCT patients. However, the most audited antifungal agents and indications did not necessarily reflect the areas with the highest rate of recommendations and potential for optimizing antifungal prescribing. For example, liposomal amphotericin B, not fluconazole, had the highest rate of recommendation during antifungal PAF. Children's hospitals with ASPs included in an antifungal stewardship survey reported that the majority performed PAF on liposomal amphotericin B; however, only 40% restricted liposomal amphotericin B to require ID approval or consultation prior to use. Although PAF may be more effective at decreasing antibiotic use compared to restriction, studies comparing antifungal PAF and restriction are lacking. Future investigations are warranted to evaluate the impact of restricting specific antifungal agents on appropriate prescribing, PAF, and patient outcomes.

### Treatment of funguria… [^116UgUSN]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

We evaluated the use of antifungal agents in the treatment of uncomplicated funguria by reviewing all case reports and studies regarding the treatment of funguria published in the English language from 1960 to 1991. Adult patients treated for uncomplicated funguria were included. Patients with fungal pyelonephritis and/or other systemic fungal manifestations were excluded from our analysis. All investigations were assessed for study design, sample size, definition of significant funguria, treatment regimen, inclusion of predisposing risk factors in outcome analysis, end points of therapy, and patient follow-up. Direct comparison of the studies on the use of antifungals in the treatment of uncomplicated funguria was not possible given the differing definitions of significant funguria, inconsistent reporting of risk factors, varying treatment regimens, end points of therapy, and duration of follow-up.

Case reports and studies involving antifungals such as amphotericin B bladder irrigation, miconazole nitrate bladder irrigation, ketoconazole, and flucytosine were reviewed. Amphotericin B bladder irrigation appeared to be most effective and ketoconazole the least effective treatment of uncomplicated funguria. Predisposing risk factors, such as the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, appear to play an important role in the persistence of positive cultures and failure of pharmacologic interventions. Until prospective, well-controlled studies are performed, no recommendation can be made for the treatment of uncomplicated funguria. In symptomatic patients therapy is indicated; however, the best regimen is unknown. Wong-Beringer A, Jacobs RA, Guglielmo BJ. Treatment of Funguria. JAMA. 1992; 267: 2780–2785.

### The paradox of the evidence about invasive fungal infection prevention [^1174sbiS]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are characterized by high morbidity and mortality in non-neutropenic critically ill patients. Attributable mortality due to Candida spp. infections ranges from about 42 to 63%. Data from large observational and retrospective studies show an association between early antifungal treatment and improved survival. Updated clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis have been recently published.

In 2006, Playford et al. published a Cochrane systematic review investigating the use of antifungal agents for prevention of IFIs in non-neutropenic critically ill patients. In that review, the outcome of proven IFI was defined as a clinical illness consistent with the diagnosis and either histopathological evidence of IFI or a positive fungal culture from one or more sterile site specimens (including blood). Notably, funguria (as indicated by a positive urine fungal culture), in the absence of a complicated urinary tract infection, and fungal esophagitis were classified not as IFIs but as superficial fungal infections. The review included 12 studies and 1606 patients, and the use of antifungal agents was associated with a mortality reduction of about 25% and with an IFI reduction of about 50%. Recently, we updated the original review by Playford et al. including 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2761 patients. We modified the definition of the outcome-proven IFI excluding positive culture of Candida spp. from the respiratory tract, even in the presence of systemic or respiratory signs of infection, and classifying it as colonization instead of IFI. Untargeted antifungal treatment, encompassing prophylactic, pre-emptive, and empiric regimens, was not associated with a significant mortality reduction (moderate-quality evidence). However, antifungal agents reduced IFIs by about 45% with low-grade-quality evidence. From these data, three clinical questions may arise.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2016 guideline — symptomatic Candida cystitis treatment and catheter management is as follows: For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, oral fluconazole, 200 mg (3 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days OR oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7–10 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for 1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Removal of an indwelling bladder catheter, if feasible, is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). AmB deoxycholate bladder irrigation, 50 mg/L sterile water daily for 5 days, may be useful for treatment of cystitis due to fluconazole-resistant species, such as C. glabrata and C. krusei (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Candida urinary tract infections – treatment [^115W9e23]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In many instances a report from the clinical laboratory indicating candiduria represents colonization or procurement contamination of the specimen and not invasive candidiasis. Even if infection of the urinary tract by Candida species can be confirmed, antifungal therapy is not always warranted. Further investigation may reveal predisposing factors, which if corrected or treated, result in the resolution of the infection. For those with symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), the choice of antifungal agent will depend upon the clinical status of the patient, the site of infection, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the agent. Because of its safety, achievement of high concentrations in the urine, and availability in both an oral and intravenous formulation, fluconazole is preferred for the treatment of Candida UTIs. Flucytosine is concentrated in urine and has broad activity against Candida spp, but its use requires caution because of toxicity. Low-dose amphotericin B may be useful for Candida UTIs in selected patients. The role of echinocandins and azoles that do not achieve measurable concentrations in the urine is not clear. Small case series note some success, but failures have also occurred. Irrigation of the bladder with antifungal agents has limited utility. However, with fungus balls, irrigation of the renal pelvis through a nephrostomy tube can be useful in combination with systemic antifungal agents.

### Echinocandins compared to fluconazole for candidemia of a urinary tract source: a propensity score analysis [^112oD4Jj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Whether echinocandins could be used to treat candidemia of a urinary tract source (CUTS) is unknown. We aimed to provide current epidemiological information of CUTS and to compare echinocandin to fluconazole treatment on CUTS outcomes.

Methods

A multicenter study of adult patients with candidemia was conducted in 9 hospitals. CUTS was defined as a candidemia with concomitant candiduria by the same organism associated with significant urological comorbidity. The primary outcome assessed was clinical failure (defined by 7-day mortality or persistent candidemia) in patients treated with either an echinocandin or fluconazole. A propensity score was calculated and then entered into a regression model.

Results

Of 2176 episodes of candidemia, 128 were CUTS (5.88%). Most CUTS cases were caused by Candida albicans (52.7%), followed by Candida glabrata (25.6%) and Candida tropicalis (16.3%). Clinical failure occurred in 7 patients (20%) treated with an echinocandin and in 15 (17.1%) treated with fluconazole (P = 0.730). Acute renal failure (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–8.91; p = 0.047) was the only independent factor associated with clinical failure, whereas early urinary tract drainage procedures (surgical, percutaneous, or endoscopic) were identified as protective (AOR, 0.08; 95% CI, .02-.31; P < .001). Neither univariate nor multivariate analysis showed that echinocandin therapy altered the risk of clinical failure.

Conclusions

Initial echinocandin therapy was not associated with clinical failure in patients with CUTS. Notably, acute renal failure predicted worse outcomes and performing an early urologic procedure was a protective measure.

### Nosocomial candiduria: a review [^114BpgeW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Fungal infections of the urinary tract, especially those caused by Candida species, are becoming increasingly common. Often the line between Candida colonization and infection is blurred. Diagnosis typically depends on the discovery of pyuria with high colony Candida counts in the urine. To date, there have been few studies to have addressed treatment regimens for patients with candiduria. Fluconazole has become a mainstay of therapy; however, questions regarding when to treat, whom to treat, and how long to treat are still largely unanswered. Asymptomatic nosocomial candiduria does not frequently require treatment intervention, because morbidity is low and ascending infection and candidemia are rare complications. Treatment decisions are driven by an understanding of the anatomic site of infection. For Candida cystitis, the first-line treatment is fluconazole, given orally. Ascending pyelonephritis usually requires the administration of a systemic antifungal agent and often requires correction of the obstruction or surgical drainage. More research is needed to define diagnostic criteria and therapeutic pathways. This review will attempt to summarize the state of the art of diagnosis and management of candiduria.

### Flucytosine (Ancobon) [^116GaGDN]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ANCOBON is indicated only in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida and/or Cryptococcus.

Candida: Septicemia, endocarditis and urinary system infections have been effectively treated with flucytosine. Limited trials in pulmonary infections justify the use of flucytosine.

Cryptococcus: Meningitis and pulmonary infections have been treated effectively. Studies in septicemias and urinary tract infections are limited, but good responses have been reported.

ANCOBON should be used in combination with amphotericin B for the treatment of systemic candidiasis and cryptococcosis because of the emergence of resistance to ANCOBON (see MICROBIOLOGY).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116G6rGz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis antifungal selection — echinocandins have emerged as preferred agents for most episodes of candidemia and invasive candidiasis except central nervous system (CNS), eye, and urinary tract infections. This preference is based on a strong safety profile, convenience, early fungicidal activity, a trend toward better outcomes, and the emergence of azole-resistant Candida species, but the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species further complicates therapy and there are no good prospective data to guide therapy. Additionally, voriconazole is as effective as sequential AmB and fluconazole for candidemia, but few would choose voriconazole because there is little advantage and potentially greater toxicity compared to other therapies.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^112CWgxU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113w7FMT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candida urinary tract infection (UTI) — first-line antifungal therapy and the role of bladder irrigation are described as follows: Fluconazole is the drug of choice for treating Candida UTI. Flucytosine demonstrates good activity against many Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei, but treatment with flucytosine is limited by its toxicity and the development of resistance when it is used as a single agent. Amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate is active against most Candida species, although some C. krusei isolates are resistant; lipid formulations of AmB appear to not achieve urine concentrations that are adequate to treat UTI and should not be used. Irrigation of the bladder with AmB deoxycholate resolves candiduria in 80%–90% of patients, but recurrent candiduria within several weeks was very common; this approach is useful only for bladder infections and generally is discouraged, especially in patients who would not require an indwelling catheter for any other reason.

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^1163dVd4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

There was a good overall consistency in the results, without significant heterogeneity. The use of prophylactic fluconazole was associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with candidaemia (RR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.06–0.72, P = 0.01; I² = 0%) and fungal infections other than lower urinary tract infection (RR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.24–0.65, P = 0.0003; I² = 0%), but was associated with no significant difference in hospital mortality (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.62–1.08, P = 0.15; I² = 7%) (Figures 2, 3, 4). The proportion of patients requiring systemic amphotericin B as a rescue therapy for systemic fungal infection was lower after prophylactic use of fluconazole (RR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.17–0.72, P = 0.004; I² = 0%). The proportion of patients colonised with or infected with fluconazole-resistant fungi (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.22–1.96, P = 0.46; I² = 0%) (Figure 5) and the proportion of patients with adverse events leading to cessation of the study drug (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.22–2.58, P = 0.65; I² = 0%) were not different between the fluconazole group and the placebo group. The total length of hospital stay was no different between the fluconazole group and the placebo group (weight mean difference = -0.4 days, 95% CI = -10.35 to 9.54, P = 0.94; I² = 52.4%).

Excluding one study with unclear allocation concealment and one study that recruited some medical patients did not affect the magnitude and significance of the results. None of the studies included a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Five studies received financial grant or drug support from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – of which three studies stated explicitly that the funding agency was not involved in the collection and analyses of the data.

### Urinary tract aspergillosis in a patient with chronic kidney disease [^113BQGZn]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Management of urinary tract aspergillosis remains a therapeutic challenge in clinical settings. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend a combined therapy of medical and urological management for renal aspergillosis, and voriconazole has been recommended for parenchymal disease. However, it is uncertain whether voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B (AmB) formulations and the echinocandins could be used in the treatment of urinary tract aspergillosis as all exhibit poor urinary concentrations.

Nevertheless, these antifungal regimens have been used successfully in the treatment of urinary tract fungal infection in a few case reports. In our patient, AmB formulations and voriconazole were limited due to its nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, and itraconazole and caspofungin did not show favourable efficacy. Though cystoscopy was performed to remove the fungal ball, the patient still complained of flocculi in the urine, and the obstruction of ureter was revealed by ultrasonography. Posaconazole was then commenced. The patient recovered gradually with no relapse at 13-month follow-up. There are two possible reasons for our successful antifungal treatment. First, recent studies revealed that posaconazole provides a high concentration in renal tissue, and the levels of which could be 40-fold higher than serum levels. Though it is generally assumed that posaconazole penetration in the urine is low, since the elimination occurs primarily through faecal excretion (77%) and to a lesser extent through urinary excretion (14%), only 0.28% of active drug is eliminated in the urine. However, owing to the several surgeries our patient underwent, including cystoscopy, bilateral pelviostomy and drainage, which may lead to the physiological barrier of renal parenchyma and renal pelvis broken, the patient might achieve high concentration of posaconazole in urine. The second possible reason was that the source of infection of our patient was both in renal tissue and bladder, since the flocculi were still found in urine after the fungal ball removed. According to a recent study, while fungal balls are found in the ureters, the disease originates in or involves the renal parenchyma, and our successful treatment of posaconazole support it.

### Critical appraisal beyond clinical guidelines for intraabdominal candidiasis [^117BHrUw]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Analysis of potential alternatives

Two important facts should make us move forward in response to the challenge that represents with a growing trend, invasive fungal infections: first, the unacceptable high mortality rate despite the compounds available as treatment; and second, the need to preserve the antifungal armamentarium, especially limited compared to the antibacterial one. Lessons learned from the emergence of bacterial resistance due to the incorrect use of antibiotics should guide us to optimise using antifungal compounds. It is a reality that the use of antifungals has increased in recent decades and with it the number of resistant strains. Likewise, there is a trend towards greater isolation of species that are resistant to older antifungals, indicating that non- albicans species find a growing niche. Although far from being common, multidrug-resistant C. auris isolates are increasingly detected worldwide. To avoid worrisome scenarios and to preserve current antifungals until new compounds are available, three actions could be considered.

### Candiduria [^116X2mNA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Candiduria is a common finding. Yeasts can be detected in urine that is contaminated during collection, in patients who have bladder colonization, and in patients who have upper urinary tract infection that developed either from retrograde spread from the bladder or hematogenous spread from a distant source. Most patients with candiduria are asymptomatic. The rate of development of complications is not known but appears to be low; candidemia rarely results from asymptomatic candiduria unless obstruction is present or instrumentation of the urinary tract is done. Unfortunately, there are no established diagnostic tests that reliably distinguish infection from colonization. Guidelines for the treatment of candiduria, based almost entirely on anecdotal reports and expert opinions, rather than controlled clinical trials, have been suggested by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Until reliable methods to distinguish infection from colonization are developed, further treatment trials are unlikely to provide information to guide the clinician in the treatment of candiduria.

Genital Mycotic Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, the incidence of genital mycotic infections (e.g., vaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection fungal, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvitis) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo, occurring in 0.9%, 4.1%, and 3.7% of patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either JARDIANCE 10 mg or 25 mg.

Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients (see Table 2).

Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).
Urinary Tract Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo (see Table 2). Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.

Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively.

### Candida urinary tract infections – diagnosis [^1158o9tP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The finding of candiduria in a patient with or without symptoms should be neither dismissed nor hastily treated, but requires a careful evaluation, which should proceed in a logical fashion. Symptoms of Candida pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, or epididymo-orchitis are little different from those of the same infections produced by other pathogens. Candiduria occurring in critically ill patients should initially be regarded as a marker for the possibility of invasive candidiasis. The first step in evaluation is to verify funguria by repeating the urinalysis and urine culture. Pyuria is a nonspecific finding; the morphology of the offending yeast may allow separation of Candida glabrata from other species. Candida casts in the urine are indicative of renal candidiasis but are rarely seen. With respect to culture, colony counts have not proved to be diagnostically useful. In symptomatic or critically ill patients with candiduria, ultrasonography of the kidneys and collecting systems is the preferred initial study. However, computed tomography (CT) is better able to discern pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess. The role of magnetic resonance imaging and renal scintigraphy is ill defined, and prudent physicians should consult with colleagues in the departments of radiology and urology to determine the optimal studies in candiduric patients who require in-depth evaluation.

When the terms funguria or fungal urinary tract infection are used, most physicians are referring to candiduria and urinary tract infections due to Candida species. Other fungi, including yeasts and molds can involve the kidney during the course of disseminated infection, but rarely cause symptoms referable to the urinary tract. Candida species appear to be unique in their ability to both colonize and cause invasive disease in the urinary tract. This overview focuses only on candiduria and Candida urinary tract infection because they are common and many times present perplexing management issues.

Section 2: Background on definitions of CAUTI

The clinical diagnosis of CAUTI is often a diagnosis of exclusion, making it difficult to have a standardized definition. At present, all of the available definitions have substantial limitations. We discuss the criteria, advantages, and limitations of different definitions used for CAUTI in Table 4.

The optimal definition for CAUTI used for surveillance and quality improvement is one that only captures true instances of symptomatic infection that would benefit from antimicrobial treatment. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been adopted nationally, but other definitions are also used for clinical care and administrative purposes. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been updated in 2015 with exclusion of yeast as a pathogen and increase in the urine-culture bacterial threshold to ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) to align with a clinical definition for symptomatic CAUTI.

### Is it time to abandon the use of amphotericin B bladder irrigation? [^116P5w1o]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In this article, we review the issues surrounding funguria and its management. With this background, the value of bladder irrigation with amphotericin B for the management of funguria is directly examined. Amphotericin B bladder irrigation is used frequently in clinical practice. Although its use is not standardized, there are multiple studies that attempt to show the impact on funguria management. These bladder irrigations have been used either for treatment of funguria or (less commonly) as a diagnostic test in attempts to identify upper urinary tract disease. Despite their widespread therapeutic use and relative safety, it is not clear from our experience and a review of the literature that amphotericin B bladder irrigations have any diagnostic or therapeutic value. The patient may be best served by removal of the urinary catheter, if possible, rather than by instillation of bladder irrigation with amphotericin B.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Urinary tract infections: microbial pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and new treatment strategies [^116tjdf4]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, recurrent infections that can be mild to life-threatening. The continued emergence of antibiotic resistance, together with our increasing understanding of the detrimental effects conferred by broad-spectrum antibiotic use on the health of the beneficial microbiota of the host, has underscored the weaknesses in our current treatment paradigm for UTIs. In this Review, we discuss how recent microbiological, structural, genetic and immunological studies have expanded our understanding of host-pathogen interactions during UTI pathogenesis. These basic scientific findings have the potential to shift the strategy for UTI treatment away from broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting conserved aspects of bacterial replication towards pathogen-specific antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that target core determinants of bacterial virulence at the host-pathogen interface.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114o6cmf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract Candida fungus balls — management recommendations state that surgical intervention is strongly recommended in adults (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Antifungal treatment as noted above for cystitis or pyelonephritis is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Irrigation through nephrostomy tubes, if present, with amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate, 25–50 mg in 200–500 mL sterile water, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). The evidence summary notes that in adults, surgical or endoscopic removal of the obstructing mycelial mass is central to successful treatment, while in neonates some series document resolution with antifungal treatment alone but others found that endoscopic removal was necessary; fungus balls in the bladder and lower ureter usually can be removed endoscopically.

### Obstructive bilateral renal fungal bezoars in an extremely premature neonate treated with antifungals and urokinase irrigation: a case report and review of the literature [^112eewKH]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Extremely preterm neonates are at particular risk of candidemiadue to multiple factors including reduced innate and adaptive immunity, receipt of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, impaired skin integrity and the requirement for central venous access devices and corticosteroids. Despite a much higher incidence of candidemia in neonates than in other age groups and an associated mortality rate of 22%, consensus guidelines regarding the treatment of neonatal candidiasis and associated complications are lacking.

Candida infections commonly affect the kidney and may be secondary to ascending candiduria or candidemia. Candiduria is found in neonatal intensive care unit patients with rates of between 0.5% and 0.6%. Ascending infection and renal candidiasis occur in 3%-58% of children with candiduria and may result in permanent renal scarring, and neonates with abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary tract are at particular risk of renal fungal infection. Renal candidiasis secondary to candidemia is reported in 5%-33% of infantsand as many as 61%-70% of premature neonates. Renal fungal bezoars, which may lead to obstruction, develop in 11%-35% of neonates with Candida infections of the urinary tract.

There are no consensus guidelines regarding the management of obstructive renal candidiasis in neonates. Given poor drug penetration into the fungal mass with systemic antifungals alone, guidelines for children and adults recommend direct local bladder or renal pelvis irrigation with antifungals or surgery for removal of fungal bezoars, especially when conservative treatment has failed. The use of fibrinolytics in infants with renal fungal bezoars has been described in case reports. We report a case of neonatal candidiasis complicated by obstructive renal fungal bezoars treated with systemic and local antifungals, insertion of nephrostomies and local fibrinolytic irrigation.

### Fluconazole [^116oZWnd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fluconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of:

Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida).
Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole tablets were also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing fluconazole tablets for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see CLINICAL STUDIES section. Studies comparing fluconazole tablets to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Prophylaxis: Fluconazole tablets are also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^114Kdwzx]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

Regarding specific circumstances for asymptomatic bacteriuria, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic candiduria, IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to do not initiate antifungal treatment unless the patient is at high risk for dissemination, such as neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants (< 1,500 g), and patients planned to undergo urologic manipulation.

### Rationale and design of the renal lifecycle trial assessing the effect of dapagliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes in severe chronic kidney disease [^114Nm4mw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, limited data are available on the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in KTRs. It is important to investigate this issue in this specific population to obtain a solid evidence-based rationale for treating (or not) these patients with SGLT2 inhibitors. Data obtained in CKD patients cannot automatically be extrapolated to KTRs, as mechanisms leading to disease progression may be different between these groups. However, preliminary data on SGLT2 inhibitors suggest efficacy in the KTR population. Lim et al. showed in a retrospective study that KTRs with T2DM who had been treated with SGLT2 inhibitors had a better prognosis with respect to all-cause mortality, death-censored graft failure and doubling of serum creatinine compared with KTRs with T2DM not treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, no safety issues emerged in this study. Initially there was a concern that these drugs would cause an increased risk for urinary tract infections, which could pose a particular risk for KTRs, given the unphysiological anatomy of their urinary tract and the use of immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, the exclusion criterion of two or more urinary tract/genital infections in the last 6 months was implemented in our study protocol. However, the study by Lim et al. found no increased risk for urinary tract infections and only a mildly increased risk for genital mycotic infections. This is in line with a meta-analysis that included safety data for most large-scale RCTs with SGLT2 inhibition in cardiovascular as well as kidney disease. This meta-analysis only showed an increased risk for genital infections, with a number needed to harm of 41, but not for urinary tract infections. In general, genital infections usually can be easily treated by antimycotic agents and therefore safety does not seem to be compromised. Yet these safety data should also be interpreted with caution, being derived from non-KTR populations.

### Treatment of fungal urinary tract infection [^1166d7zE]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Funguria, and particularly candiduria, is an increasingly common problem encountered by the practicing urologist and is associated with high-acuity care, indwelling catheters, diabetes mellitus, antibiotic and steroid use, and urinary tract disease. In most cases, candiduria is asymptomatic and follows a benign clinical course with antifungal therapy only required in symptomatic or high-risk cases, because spontaneous resolution is common in patients with asymptomatic colonization. Rarely, invasive infections can occur (such as fungus balls or renal abscesses) and may require percutaneous and endoscopic interventions. This article highlights the workup and treatment of funguria and its related urologic manifestations.

### Fluconazole [^115TdUDV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Single Dose Vaginal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

Multiple Dose SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse. Esophageal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms. Systemic Candida infections: For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used. Urinary tract infections and peritonitis: For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients. Cryptococcal meningitis: The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of fluconazole for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.

### Flucytosine [^112nRnxY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Flucytosine Capsules USP is indicated only in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida and/or Cryptococcus.

Candida: Septicemia, endocarditis and urinary system infections have been effectively treated with flucytosine. Limited trials in pulmonary infections justify the use of flucytosine.

Cryptococcus: Meningitis and pulmonary infections have been treated effectively. Studies in septicemias and urinary tract infections are limited, but good responses have been reported.

Flucytosine Capsules USP should be used in combination with amphotericin B for the treatment of systemic candidiasis and cryptococcosis because of the emergence of resistance to Flucytosine Capsules USP (See MICROBIOLOGY).

### Incidence of infections after therapy completion in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia: a systematic review of the literature [^113Fa3PE]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Infections are a common complication of treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Less is known about infections occurring after treatment. We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess the incidence of infections after therapy completion in children and young adults with ALL or AML. Twenty-eight studies, with 4138 patients, were included. Four studies reported infections in patients who did not undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections affected 9.9–72.5% and 2.9–19.8% of patients, respectively. Twelve studies reported infections in patients treated with HSCT. Late bacterial, viral and fungal infections affected 3.9–38.5%, 16.1–66.7%, and 0.2–41.7% of patients, respectively. Viral hepatitis affected 0.8–75.4% of patients from 12 studies. Our review suggests that infections are a frequent complication after treatment for leukemia in children, especially after HSCT and identifies several knowledge gaps in the current literature.

### Urinary tract aspergillosis in a patient with chronic kidney disease [^111TzZWD]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive aspergillosis, a severe fungal infection, usually affects patients with immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes mellitus, haematological malignancy and neutropenia. Aspergillosis limited to the urinary tract is an uncommon type of invasive aspergillosis, which has been reported to more frequently involve the lung. A combined approach of medical and urological management for renal aspergillosis is recommended. However, no antifungal drug has been advised for urinary tract aspergillosis due to the low urine concentration.

Posaconazole, an extended-spectrum triazole antifungal agent, has great activity against the Aspergillus and Mucorales. Guidelines recommend posaconazole as salvage therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but whether it could be used in invasive urinary tract aspergillosis remains uncertain. Here, we report a case of invasive urinary tract aspergillosis with chronic kidney disease that was successfully treated with posaconazole, which suggests that it may be a suitable alternative antifungal agent for urinary tract infections.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1142ujiR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Renal aspergillosis — management should combine medical and urologic care: we suggest a combined approach of medical and urologic management for renal aspergillosis; obstruction of one or both ureters should be managed with decompression if possible and local instillation of AmB deoxycholate, and parenchymal disease is best treated with voriconazole (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Nephrectomy should be performed only as a last option, and voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, AmB formulations, and the echinocandins all exhibit poor urinary concentrations. Irrigation via a nephrostomy tube with AmB deoxycholate allows high local concentrations and when given by this route is not absorbed and is not nephrotoxic; it thus may be useful in aspergillosis of the renal pelvis, but has no role in the treatment of parenchymal disease.

### SGLT2i: beyond the glucose-lowering effect [^112DjZiz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

It should be emphasized that SGLT2i can significantly delay the progression of renal failure but cannot treat diabetic nephropathy. Some studies have found that SGLT2i can also cause a transient decline in renal function and return to normal within a few weeks. Clinical attention should be paid to this issue.

Safety evaluation of SGLT2i

SGLT2i have a unique glucose-lowering effect, which plays a protective role in many organs, but adverse reactions also need to be highlighted. The more common complications include adverse reactions related to glucose-lowering therapy and urinary glucose (such as genitourinary infection and ketoacidosis) and off-target adverse reactions (including fracture, lower limb amputation risk and tumor).

Statistically, the incidence of reproductive tract infection, generally mild-to-moderate infection, after treatment with SGLT2i is 4.8%. Due to differences in anatomical structure, the incidence rate of females is higher than that of males. The mechanism through which SGLT2i increase the incidence of reproductive tract infection may be by promoting glucose excretion through urine, increasing the concentration of glucose in the genitourinary tract, and increasing the risk of bacterial and fungal infection. Therefore, attention should be paid to genitourinary tract hygiene when using SGLT2i. For genitourinary tract infection or recurrent infection within half a year, SGLT2i should be used cautiously or not recommended. However, some major outcome trials suggest that SGLT2i are not associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Wilding et al. suggested that it might be the disease that increases the chances of infection, not the drug, and that the benefits of the SGLT2i seem to outweigh these risks of infection.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113AFvAL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common infections seen by obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care providers. Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to treat and decrease quality of life. This article addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Most notably, increased interest in the urinary microbiome is leading to improved understanding of virulent and commensal bacteria in the genitourinary tract. Understanding the causative factors of recurrent urinary tract infections will lead to improved detection, treatment, and prevention.

### Towards individualised treatment of urinary tract infections [^111qKW3u]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Supporting individualised dosing by quantifying host-bacteria-drug interactions

Adjusting antimicrobial dosing to improve PK-PD target attainment, using indices such as C max to MIC ratio, results in improved treatment outcomes for patients with UTI. Current PK-PD targets are based on population PK in serum and in-vitro MIC values. They do not consider variations in host factors such as immune response, site of infection, or local changes in pH, which affect both the infectious organism and the drug. For example, nitrofurantoin, a common first line treatment for UTI, demonstrates significantly increased bactericidal activity against common urinary pathogens at lower pH levels. In-vivo PD estimation in urine has limited evidence of applicability to traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing that is commonly used to guide antimicrobial selection.

TDM has been used to optimise dosing in UTI by measuring drug concentrations in blood, even though drug levels of antimicrobials in urine are typically considerably higher than in serum. For example, amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, has been demonstrated to achieve significantly greater peak urinary concentrations following standard dosing compared to serum. Local urinary concentration will often exceed traditional MIC breakpoints used for antimicrobial susceptibility reporting and may explain observed treatment success in the face of isolates that are reported as resistant

The idea of connecting infection-specific biomarkers to antimicrobial PK to evaluate drug PD is well described. Galactomannan levels have been used to describe voriconazole PD in invasive aspergillosis in children. Urinary biomarkers are frequently used to diagnose UTI, and the quantitative time-course of biomarkers, for example urinary leukocytes, has been shown to predict treatment outcome.

We propose that the origin of well-described UTI biomarkers currently reported is either bacteria- or host-response-specific. Bacteria- and host-response biomarkers measured in urine could facilitate PD estimates for UTI if linked to observed drug exposure during treatment. This renders urine a promising area for the development of simple, non-invasive, longitudinal methods of monitoring and optimising antimicrobial PK-PD in real-time.

### Fluconazole (Diflucan) [^1171YjcE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Single Dose

Vaginal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF DIFLUCAN (FLUCONAZOLE) IS THE SAME FOR ORAL (TABLETS AND SUSPENSION) AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of DIFLUCAN for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

Systemic Candida infections:

For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used.

Urinary tract infections and peritonitis:

For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients.

Asymptomatic candiduria — management emphasizes risk stratification and periprocedural prophylaxis: Elimination of predisposing factors, such as indwelling bladder catheters, is recommended whenever feasible (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Treatment with antifungal agents is NOT recommended unless the patient belongs to a group at high risk for dissemination; high-risk patients include neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants (< 1500 g), and patients who will undergo urologic manipulation (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Neutropenic patients and very low–birth-weight infants should be treated as recommended for candidemia (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Patients undergoing urologic procedures should be treated with oral fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, OR AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for several days before and after the procedure (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^114beWoz]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

The hospital mortality and the proportion of patients with candidaemia were chosen as the main outcomes of this meta-analysis because they are the most specific clinically relevant outcomes of invasive fungal infections. There were no missing data for these two main outcomes in the included studies. The other outcomes assessed in this study included the proportion of patients colonised with or infected with fluconazole-resistant fungi, the proportion of patients requiring rescue therapy by systemic amphotericin B treatment, the proportion of patients with an adverse effect requiring cessation of the study drug, the proportion of patients with fungal infections other than urinary tract infection, and the total length of hospital stay. Urinary fungal infection is difficult to distinguish from colonisation, and for this reason these infections were excluded from further analyses in the present study. The definition of prophylaxis failure requiring amphotericin B treatment varied between different studies, but the common definition involved clinical deterioration with positive fungal culture from blood, deep tissue, or sputum.

Statistical analyses

The differences in categorical outcomes between the treatment group and the placebo group were reported as the relative risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI), using a random effect model. The difference in the total length of hospital stay between the fluconazole group and the placebo group was reported as weight mean difference in days, using a random effect model. The presence of heterogeneity between trials was assessed by chi-square statistics and the extent of inconsistency was assessed by I² statistics. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after excluding one study with unclear allocation concealment and one study that recruited some medical patients in the trial. The publication bias was assessed by funnel plot using hospital mortality as an endpoint.

### Top ten myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of urinary Tract infections [^112qavMU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common type of infection in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in March 2014 regarding antibiotic use in hospitals reported "UTI" treatment was avoidable at least 39% of the time. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of UTI plays an important role in cost-effective medical care and appropriate antimicrobial utilization.

Objective

We summarize the most common misperceptions of UTI that result in extraneous testing and excessive antimicrobial treatment. We present 10 myths associated with the diagnosis and treatment of UTI and succinctly review the literature pertaining to each myth. We explore the myths associated with pyuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria, candiduria, and the elderly and catheterized patients. We attempt to give guidance for clinicians facing these clinical scenarios.

Discussion

From our ambulatory, emergency department, and hospital experiences, patients often have urine cultures ordered without an appropriate indication, or receive unnecessary antibiotic therapy due to over-interpretation of the urinalysis.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in all age groups and is frequently over-treated. A UTI diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms with supportive laboratory information. This review will assist providers in navigating common pitfalls in the diagnosis of UTI.

### Delivering on antimicrobial resistance agenda not possible without improving fungal diagnostic capabilities [^112hZFEA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Other Clinical Scenarios

We have not addressed multiple other clinical situations in which a precise fungal diagnosis could reduce the inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobial drugs (i.e. overtreatment or incorrect treatment). Among those situations are cases of cryptococcal meningitis (Figure 4); Candida infection or colonization of the respiratory or urinary tract; febrile neutropenia in leukemia; Aspergillus bronchitis in bronchiectasis; and allergic, chronic, and invasive fungal sinusitis and PCP in HIV-negative patients. In all these clinical situations, inappropriate antibacterial or antifungal prescribing is common because of the lack of adequate fungal diagnostic testing. We also have not addressed rapid detection of antifungal drug–resistant fungi (i.e. A. terreus, C. krusei) or the use of diagnostics to prevent superinfection with fungi that are commonly resistant to antifungal drugs, such as C. glabrata or Rhizopus oryzae. Antifungal drug resistance is problematic in some settings and demands informed prescribing, therapeutic drug monitoring, and development of new antifungal agents.

Empagliflozin and Linagliptin

Table 2 summarizes the reports of hypoglycemia with empagliflozin and linagliptin over a treatment period of 52 weeks.

Empagliflozin

Genital Mycotic Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of genital mycotic infections (e.g., vaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection fungal, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo, occurring in 0.9%, 4.1%, and 3.7% of patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg.

Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients.

Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).
Urinary Tract Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

### Fluconazole (Diflucan) [^111aqmY3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) is indicated for the treatment of:

Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida).
Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, DIFLUCAN was also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see CLINICAL STUDIES section. Studies comparing DIFLUCAN to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Prophylaxis:

DIFLUCAN is also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Materials-based incidence of urinary catheter associated urinary tract infections and the causative micro-organisms: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116TmgkZ]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

The presence of E. coli as the micro-organism most frequently found across the studies correlates with the consensus that this bacterium is most often responsible for UTIs. Furthermore Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus have been previously identified as UTI causative, as found by the articles in this review. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, a species not wholly identified in any of the 16 micro-organism identifying articles has also been identified in previous work. Identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (identified in 6 studies), which includes the identified S. epidermidis could indeed include Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which as a member of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Given Staphylococcus saprophyticus prevalence in causing UTI, as reported in other literature, this could be an ideal target along with the micro-organisms identified with both genus and species name. Candida spp. identification also correlates with the literature with Candida spp. being the most common fungal nosocomial causative agent for UTI, more specifically the greatest prevalence of Candida albicans, in agreement with the findings of this research. Candiduria is most often seen in patients as asymptomatic UTIs, which would only be identified by bacterial counting if the patient presented no symptoms. From the literature it is suggested that asymptomatic candiduria does not require administration of antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole, as there are no benefits to patients clinically.

### Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of amphotericin B for Candida urinary tract infections: further favorable experience [^113LjTVS]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Studies in experimental animals and humans have shown that Amphotericin B (AmB) persists in urine for days to weeks after a single IV dose in levels that should inhibit candidal organisms and thereby obviate the need for frequent dosing. Including data from four previously described patients, we have now treated a total of 11 patients (12 episodes) with Candida urinary tract infections with single-dose AmB (six, Candida albicans; two, C. tropicalis; four, other nonalbicans Candida). The duration of candiduria prior to entry ranged from 18 to 180 days. Predisposing conditions included renal transplantation (1), diabetes mellitus (8), genitourinary stones (1) or anomalies (4), catheterization (2), and antibacterial therapy (11). A single patient was intolerant of AmB. Out of 11 evaluable candiduric episodes, eight resolved. Failure occurred in one patient with a chronic indwelling bladder catheter and in the allograft recipient. The data suggest that the sustained urinary excretion of AmB may permit successful single- or paucidose therapy of Candida urinary tract infections in some patients with a minimum of toxicity.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Clinical outcomes of patients treated for Candida auris infections in a multisite health system, Illinois, USA [^114LFFo8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Candida auris is an emerging, multidrug-resistant, healthcare-associated fungal pathogen that was first reported in Japan in 2009 and has now been isolated on 6 continents. C. auris has been identified as the causative pathogen in various invasive fungal infections, including bloodstream infections, and is associated with outbreaks across healthcare settings. Risk factors for C. auris infection are similar to other Candida infections including prolonged hospitalization, abdominal surgery, diabetes mellitus, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of central venous and urinary catheters, immunocompromising conditions, chronic kidney disease, and exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal agents. Investigations in the Chicago, Illinois, USA, area have found a high prevalence of C. auris colonization at ventilator-capable skilled nursing facilities and have shown higher rates of C. auris colonization among patients who are mechanically ventilated, have a gastrostomy tube, or have a urinary catheter. Reported mortality rates attributable to invasive C. auris infection range from 30% to 59% globally and from 22% to 57% in the United States.

C. auris isolates are often resistant to fluconazole and have variable susceptibility to other antifungal agents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends echinocandins as empiric therapy for suspected or confirmed C. auris infections. However, recent reports have indicated reduced susceptibilities to echinocandins and suggest that resistance might be inducible under antifungal pressure.

Previous reports of C. auris infections and outbreaks have largely focused on epidemiologic information, and data on treatment strategies and clinical outcomes are limited (,–). We report microbiologic data for C. auris isolates from a multisite health system in Illinois and an assessment of clinical outcomes for patients treated for C. auris infections.

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^113bG6UE]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Insights into the use of a short-course strategy for the treatment of candidemia.

In recent years, the incidence of candidemia originating from the urinary system has been increasing annually, primarily occurring in patients with urinary stones following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This procedure can lead to the disruption of the ureteral or renal mucosal barriers, allowing Candida to enter the bloodstream and cause systemic dissemination. These patients are at risk of developing septic shock due to candidemia and often require treatment in the ICU. Once their hemodynamics stabilize and shock is alleviated, they are typically transferred back to the urinary surgery department for further treatment. In our recent observations, none of the 63 patients in this category completed the "full-course" treatment for candidemia, with an average treatment duration of only 9 days. Furthermore, only 31.7% of these patients received de-escalation therapy. However, none of them experienced recurrence of candidemia or mortality (Table 1). All patients included in our study underwent ureteroscopic procedures to relieve urinary tract obstructions and had no immunosuppressive conditions, thus benefiting from the shorter treatment course. In the future, we aim to further identify patient groups that can benefit from shorter treatment courses and strive for individualized adjustments to antifungal therapy.

### Risk factors and microbial distribution of urinary tract infections following radical cystectomy [^112xCJdV]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate clinicopathologic features associated with the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) after radical cystectomy (RC), and determine the underlying organisms responsible for these events.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed 1248 patients treated with RC for bladder cancer from 2000 to 2010 at Mayo Clinic. UTIs diagnosed within 90 days of surgery were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of clinicopathologic features with postoperative UTI.

Results

UTI was diagnosed in 129 (10.3%) patients within 90 days of RC. Median time to UTI was 22.5 days (interquartile range 14,42). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with a significantly increased UTI risk were diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.27; P < .001), receipt of a perioperative blood transfusion (OR 1.58; p = 0.03), continent urinary diversion (OR 2.17; P < .001), and development of a urine leak (OR 3.42; P < .001). Culture-specific infection data were available for 88 of the patients, with a total of 113 UTIs diagnosed among this cohort. Of these, 36.8% of UTIs were polymicrobial. Drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus were isolated in 45.0% and 12.8% of infections, respectively. Fungal elements were present in 27 (23.9%) cultures, and were the sole organism in 15 (13.3%). No significant differences in microbial distribution or timing of infections were detected between patients who underwent conduit vs continent diversion.

Conclusion

We found that diabetes, perioperative blood transfusion, continent diversion, and urine leak were associated with UTI risk following RC. Multiple organisms, drug resistance, and fungal elements were commonly identified, supporting the use of initial broad-spectrum coverage, including consideration of antifungal therapy, upon diagnosis of UTI after RC.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116uTTsD]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Fluconazole dose recommendation in urinary tract infection [^115b1hPY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate dose of fluconazole for the treatment of symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Sources

Primary literature identified through MEDLINE (1990-June 2000). Key search terms included fluconazole and urinary tract infection.

Data Synthesis

Fluconazole is approved for the treatment of candidal UTIs, but dosage recommendations are not consistent. An evaluation of clinical studies of fluconazole for the treatment of candidal UTI was performed.

Conclusions

Questions remain about the optimal dosing of fluconazole, including the most appropriate dose in non-albicans species of candida as well as the optimal duration of therapy. Until further studies are performed, a fluconazole 200-mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/d for at least four days appears to be the most appropriate dose for the treatment of symptomatic candidal UTI in patients without systemic fungal infection or severe renal failure.

### Tocilizumab (tocilizumab-anoh) [^116YGgia]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Serious Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab products. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were reported with tocilizumab products. Other serious infections, not reported in clinical studies, may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, listeriosis). Patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids which in addition to rheumatoid arthritis may predispose them to infections.

Do not administer Tocilizumab-anoh in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating Tocilizumab-anoh in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection;
who have been exposed to tuberculosis;
with a history of serious or an opportunistic infection;
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Hold Tocilizumab-anoh if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh should undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient.

COVID-19

In patients with COVID-19, monitor for signs and symptoms of new infections during and after treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh. There is limited information regarding the use of tocilizumab products in patients with COVID-19 and concomitant active serious infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh in COVID-19 patients with other concurrent infections should be considered.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^116j5Mhf]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Rezafungin (Rezzayo) [^116TBLxW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of REZZAYO in the treatment of patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (IC) were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study (Trial 1; NCT03667690). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive REZZAYO or caspofungin. Randomization was stratified based on diagnosis (candidemia only; IC) and by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at screening. Patients with septic arthritis in a prosthetic joint, osteomyelitis, endocarditis or myocarditis, meningitis, endophthalmitis, chorioretinitis, or any central nervous system infection, chronic disseminated candidiasis, or urinary tract candidiasis due to ascending Candida infection secondary to obstruction or surgical instrumentation of the urinary tract were excluded.

Patients in the REZZAYO arm were to receive a single 400 mg loading dose on Day 1 of Week 1, followed by 200 mg once weekly, for a total of two to four doses. Patients in the caspofungin arm were to receive a single 70 mg IV loading dose, followed by caspofungin 50 mg IV once daily treatment for a total of 2 to 4 weeks. After ≥ 3 days of IV therapy, patients in the caspofungin group could be switched to oral step-down therapy (fluconazole), if the patient met the criteria for cure and was preparing to be discharged.

Other Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials with Empagliflozin in Adults

Genital Mycotic Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of genital mycotic infections (e.g., vaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection fungal, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo, occurring in 0.9%, 4.1%, and 3.7% of patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg.

Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients (see Table 2).

Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).
Urinary Tract Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo (see Table 2). Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

### Treatment of candidiasis… [^1157SL71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.
