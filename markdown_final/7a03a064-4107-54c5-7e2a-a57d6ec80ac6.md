## Question

A 28-year-old woman in her first trimester of pregnancy presents to the emergency department with severe nausea and vomiting for the past two weeks. She has lost 4 kg since the onset of symptoms and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She is diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum. Her vital signs are stable, and laboratory investigations reveal mild ketonuria but no other significant abnormalities. The resident asks whether she should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection as part of her workup.

Based on current guidelines, should Helicobacter pylori testing be routinely performed in patients presenting with hyperemesis gravidarum? Justify your answer according to the guideline recommendation.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Helicobacter pylori testing should be routinely performed in a patient with hyperemesis gravidarum, and how to justify that answer with current guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and whether it is truly hyperemesis gravidarum. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about H. pylori testing in HG. Next, I will examine the strength and quality of evidence linking H. pylori to HG. After that, I need to consider practical issues like test selection, timing, and treatment safety in pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline exceptions where testing might be reasonable despite routine guidance against it.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and context. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion characterized by persistent vomiting, weight loss, dehydration, and often ketonuria, typically peaking around 9 weeks and resolving by 20 weeks. Importantly, ketonuria correlates poorly with severity and should not be used to define or stage HG, so I should not overinterpret mild ketonuria here [^113tNLUo] [^111WNut7] [^1158Qs4h].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check exactly what ACG and ACOG say. ACG's 2017 H. pylori guideline explicitly states there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing and treatment for H. pylori in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum, which is a direct answer to the question [^111zj3rr]. ACOG's Practice Bulletin on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy advises that gastric ulcer should be considered only in patients unresponsive to standard therapy, and only then should H. pylori testing be considered, which is not routine testing in typical HG presentations [^111WNut7].

> I will now examine the evidence base linking H. pylori to HG. A 2007 systematic review of 14 case-control studies suggested an association between H. pylori and HG, but with substantial heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals, so causality remains uncertain and the clinical applicability is limited [^115yyeD8]. A 2014 meta-analysis reported an odds ratio around 3.2 for H. pylori seropositivity versus controls, but again, this reflects association rather than proven causation and does not establish that testing changes outcomes in HG, which is key for routine adoption [^1158Qs4h]. But wait, what if endoscopic data change the picture? Small endoscopic series show high H. pylori prevalence in severe HG, yet these are uncontrolled and confounded by selection bias, so they cannot support routine testing in all-comers with HG [^112fZGbV].

> Let me consider practical and safety issues. If I were to test, I should confirm the best noninvasive modality. Urea breath testing is generally avoided in the first trimester due to radiation concerns, and stool antigen testing is preferred when noninvasive testing is pursued, though even then, serology has poor specificity in pregnancy and cannot distinguish active from past infection, so false positives are common and treatment decisions should be cautious [^notfound]. I should double-check that any positive noninvasive result is confirmed with a second test before committing to antibiotics in pregnancy, given resistance patterns and the need to avoid unnecessary treatment [^notfound].

> Now, I need to weigh benefits versus harms. Routine testing in HG lacks proven benefit in improving maternal symptoms or pregnancy outcomes, and exposes patients to potential downstream risks of antibiotics, including resistance, adverse effects, and the possibility of overtreatment for colonization rather than true infection. Given that most HG improves with supportive care and standard antiemetics, adding H. pylori testing without a clear indication is low yield and may cause harm [^111zj3rr] [^114BZGJi]. Hold on, I should verify that current management pathways emphasize supportive therapy, thiamine, hydration, and escalation to enteral nutrition when needed, which they do, reinforcing that H. pylori testing is not part of first-line care in HG [^114BZGJi] [^111xmwP9].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or refractory? I should confirm the exceptions. If the patient fails standard therapy, develops alarm features such as hematemesis, severe epigastric pain, or persistent symptoms beyond 20 weeks, or has a history of peptic ulcer disease, then considering H. pylori testing becomes reasonable as part of a broader evaluation for alternative pathology, aligning with ACOG's "consider if unresponsive" stance rather than routine testing in typical HG [^111WNut7]. In those select scenarios, a monoclonal stool antigen test is reasonable, with confirmatory testing if positive and shared decision-making about risks and benefits of eradication in pregnancy [^1175pAKJ].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. No, H. pylori testing should not be performed routinely in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum. Current guidelines conclude there is insufficient evidence to support routine testing, the association remains unproven for causality, and standard HG management is supportive without a role for H. pylori eradication in typical cases [^111zj3rr] [^111WNut7]. Reserve testing for refractory cases with alarm features or suspected peptic ulcer disease after failure of appropriate therapy, and if pursued, use a monoclonal stool antigen test with confirmatory strategies and careful counseling about uncertain benefit and antibiotic risks in pregnancy [^111WNut7] [^1175pAKJ].

---

Routine H. pylori testing is **not recommended** for patients with hyperemesis gravidarum [^111zj3rr]. Current guidelines state there is **insufficient evidence** to support routine H. pylori testing or treatment in HG [^111zj3rr]. Testing may be considered only in refractory cases with upper GI symptoms (e.g. epigastric pain, dyspepsia) or when standard therapy fails [^111WNut7]. If testing is pursued, noninvasive options (stool antigen or urea breath test) are preferred; serology is not reliable in pregnancy [^1175pAKJ]. Management of HG remains supportive, with fluids, antiemetics, and thiamine; H. pylori treatment is reserved for confirmed infection with compatible symptoms [^114BZGJi].

---

## Evidence linking H. pylori infection to hyperemesis gravidarum

Several studies have explored the association between H. pylori infection and HG:

- **Systematic review**: A 2007 systematic review of 14 case-control studies (1,732 participants) found a significant association between H. pylori infection and HG, with odds ratios ranging from 0.55 to 109.33. However, substantial heterogeneity and methodological limitations were noted [^115yyeD8].

- **Meta-analysis**: A 2014 meta-analysis reported an odds ratio of 3.2 (95% CI 2.0–5.1) for H. pylori infection in HG compared to asymptomatic controls, suggesting a possible association but not establishing causality [^1158Qs4h].

- **Endoscopic studies**: Small endoscopic studies have reported high prevalence of H. pylori gastritis in patients with severe HG, but these findings are limited by small sample sizes and selection bias [^112fZGbV].

Despite these associations, **causality remains unproven**, and the clinical relevance of H. pylori testing in HG is uncertain [^115yyeD8].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major professional organizations have addressed the role of H. pylori testing in HG:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation regarding h. pylori testing in hg** |
|-|-|
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) | Insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing or treatment for H. pylori in HG [^111zj3rr] |
| American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) | Consider testing for H. pylori only in refractory cases with upper GI symptoms (e.g. epigastric pain, dyspepsia) or when standard therapy fails [^111WNut7] |
| Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) | No specific recommendation for routine H. pylori testing in HG |

---

These guidelines consistently emphasize that **routine H. pylori testing is not recommended** in patients with HG [^111zj3rr]. Testing may be considered only in select refractory cases with upper GI symptoms or when standard therapy fails [^111WNut7].

---

## Diagnostic methods for H. pylori infection in pregnancy

If H. pylori testing is deemed necessary, **noninvasive methods are preferred** in pregnancy:

- **Urea breath test (UBT)**: Noninvasive and highly accurate, but should be performed after the first trimester if possible due to radiation exposure concerns.

- **Stool antigen test**: Noninvasive and safe throughout pregnancy, with monoclonal assays preferred for accuracy [^1175pAKJ].

- **Serology**: Not recommended due to poor specificity and inability to distinguish active from past infection [^1175pAKJ].

---

## Clinical management of hyperemesis gravidarum

The cornerstone of HG management is **supportive care**, including:

- **Intravenous fluids**: For dehydration and electrolyte correction [^114BZGJi].

- **Antiemetics**: First-line agents include dopamine antagonists (e.g. metoclopramide), antihistamines (e.g. doxylamine), and serotonin antagonists (e.g. ondansetron) [^11467eNA].

- **Thiamine supplementation**: To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy [^114BZGJi].

- **Nutritional support**: Enteral or parenteral nutrition if oral intake is inadequate [^111xmwP9].

H. pylori eradication therapy is **not routinely recommended** unless there is confirmed infection with compatible upper GI symptoms or refractory HG despite standard therapy [^111WNut7].

## Potential risks and benefits of H. pylori testing and treatment in pregnancy

### Benefits

Potential benefits include symptom improvement if H. pylori is causally related to HG, though this remains unproven [^115yyeD8], and reduced risk of peptic ulcer disease and its complications if H. pylori is present and treated [^1162qAAE].

---

### Risks

Risks include false positives with serology, leading to unnecessary treatment; antibiotic exposure during pregnancy, with potential fetal risks; and limited evidence that H. pylori eradication improves HG outcomes [^1175pAKJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine H. pylori testing is **not recommended** for patients with hyperemesis gravidarum [^111zj3rr]. Current evidence suggests a possible association but does not establish causality or clinical benefit from routine testing and treatment [^115yyeD8]. Testing may be considered only in refractory cases with upper GI symptoms or when standard therapy fails [^111WNut7]. If testing is pursued, noninvasive methods (stool antigen or urea breath test) are preferred, and management should remain supportive with fluids, antiemetics, and thiamine supplementation [^114BZGJi].

### Effectiveness of treatment options for hyperemesis gravidarum… [^111wHdKn]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, may cause maternal electrolyte disturbances; weight loss; dehydration; and, sometimes, the need for iatrogenic premature birth. The disorder commonly persists throughout pregnancy, possibly leading to prolonged or repeated hospitalizations. In addition to the patient avoiding trigger foods and eating small meals, treatment may involve antiemetic medications, intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, and, possibly, supplemental nutrition. Peripherally inserted central catheters are sometimes used to facilitate prolonged parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluid replacement. Dobbhof feeding tubes have also been shown to be beneficial in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum. Holmgren and colleagues compared maternal and neonatal outcomes after treatment with antiemetic medications alone or with the medications plus a nasogastric/nasoduodenal feeding tube or PICC.

The Study: In this retrospective cohort study, the authors reviewed the medical records of 129 patients admitted and treated for hyperemesis gravidarum at two urban tertiary care centers in Utah during a five-year period. Of these patients, 35 were excluded from analysis because of incomplete information, maternal gastrointestinal illness, or use of feeding tubes and PICCs. Of the remaining 94 patients, 33 received a PICC, 19 received a nasogastric/nasoduodenal feeding tube, and 42 received only intravenous antiemetic medications. The groups were similar in respect to maternal demographics and health status, neonatal weight, gestational age at delivery, and Apgar scores. Outcomes were expressed in odds ratios and were controlled for maternal age, parity, and smoking status; gestational age; and fetal weight.

Results: Neonatal complications, such as small size for gestational age and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, were increased in the PICC group, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Maternal complications were uncommon in the medication-only and feeding tube groups. However, maternal complications were significantly more common in the PICC group and included thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, localized cellulitis, and bacteremia or sepsis. Conclusion: More than one half of patients who received a PICC experienced a serious or potentially life-threatening complication directly related to the treatment.

Because there were no differences in neonatal outcomes, the authors conclude that PICCs should be avoided in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum; enteral feeding through a nasogastric/nasoduodenal feeding tube likely is a safer method when medical management alone is insufficient.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum and Helicobacter pylori infection: a systematic review [^115yyeD8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review studies examining the relationship between hyperemesis gravidarum and Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection.

Data Sources

A 1966 to January 2007 search using MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science included MeSH terms: "Helicobacter pylori", "Helicobacter infections", "hyperemesis gravidarum", and the text words "nausea", "vomit", "pregnancy", and "Helicobacter". References of selected papers were examined for additional relevant studies.

Methods Of Study Selection

We evaluated studies investigating a relationship between hyperemesis gravidarum and H pylori infection. Studies were included in which the diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum was made at or before entry into the study, and H pylori diagnosis was made by serum antibody sample, gastric biopsy, saliva test, or stool sample. The search produced 169 titles; 22 were reviewed in further detail.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Fourteen case-control studies met established criteria, involving 1,732 participants and controls tested for H pylori infection. Studies were evaluated according to patient demographics and study methodology (case definition, exclusion criteria, H pylori testing). An estimate of the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals was calculated by using a random effects model for dichotomous variables with review article software. Ten studies showed a significant association between hyperemesis gravidarum and H pylori infection. Odds ratios varied from 0.55 to 109.33; three results were less than 1.0. Tests for heterogeneity applied to several subgroups were considerable with values above 75% for all groups.

Conclusion

An association between hyperemesis gravidarum and H pylori infection is suggested by this systematic review. However, the considerable heterogeneity among studies highlights study limitations.

### Diagnostic markers for hyperemesis gravidarum: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^1158Qs4h]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, there is no consensus on the definition of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG; protracted vomiting in pregnancy) and no single widely used set of diagnostic criteria for HG. The various definitions rely on symptoms, sometimes in combination with laboratory tests. Through a systematic review, we aimed to summarize available evidence on the diagnostic value of biomarkers for HG. This could assist diagnosis and may shed light on the, as yet, not understood cause of the disorder.

Study Design

We searched Medline and Embase for articles about diagnostic biomarkers for either the presence or severity of HG or nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. We defined HG as any combination of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, or hospitalization for nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy, in the absence of any other obvious cause for these complaints.

Results

We found 81 articles on 9 biomarkers. Although 65% of all studies included only HG cases with ketonuria, we did not find an association between ketonuria and presence or severity of HG in 5 studies reporting on this association. Metaanalysis, with the use of the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics model, yielded an odds ratio of 3.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.0–5.1) of Heliobacter pylori for HG, as compared with asymptomatic control subjects (sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 55%). Studies on human chorionic gonadotropin and thyroid hormones, leptin, estradiol, progesterone, and white blood count showed inconsistent associations with HG; lymphocytes tended to be higher in women with HG.

Conclusion

We did not find support for the use of ketonuria in the diagnosis of HG. H pylori serology might be useful in specific patients.

### Endoscopy in hyperemesis gravidarum and Helicobacter pylori infection [^112fZGbV]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To establish a relationship between hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) infection by histologic testing.

Methods

Twenty patients with severe HG (Group I) and 10 volunteer pregnant women without gastric complaints (Group II) were included in the study. Endoscopic evaluations were done in both groups and biopsies were obtained from the antrum and corpus for the histopathologic diagnosis of H. pylori. The groups were compared with the χ²-test and Fisher's exact test where appropriate.

Results

H. pylori was diagnosed in 19 (95%) of 20 patients in Group I and 5 (50%) of 10 patients in group II. H. pylori densities in the antrum and corpus were higher in Group I and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant. The biopsy specimens revealed significant inflammation and H. pylori activation processes in patients with HG, and in 18 of 19 patients inflammation scores were greater than +2 on the scale. Pangastritis was demonstrated by endoscopic examination in 17 of 20 patients with HG. Enterogastric reflux was also diagnosed in 10 patients. In the control group, three patients had antral gastritis.

Conclusions

We suggest that in patients with intractable nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, pangastritis and enterogastric reflux are the main endoscopic findings and that these findings are closely associated with H. pylori infection, which can be diagnosed histologically. The degree of gastric complaints may be associated with the density of H. pylori infection.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111WNut7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — laboratory and radiologic assessment: An ultrasound examination may be useful in cases of severe persistent nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and may identify a predisposing factor such as multiple gestation or molar gestation. Most patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy do not require laboratory evaluation, but in severe or persistent cases laboratory assessment may help establish the differential diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum and assess the severity of the condition. Common laboratory abnormalities include increased liver enzymes (usually less than 300 units/L), serum bilirubin (less than 4 mg/dL), and serum amylase or lipase concentrations (up to five times greater than normal levels). Acute pancreatitis may cause vomiting and elevated amylase, with serum amylase concentrations usually 5–10 times greater than elevations associated with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Urinalysis may show elevated specific gravity, or ketonuria, or both; however, a systematic review and meta-analysis found no association between ketonuria and the presence or severity of hyperemesis gravidarum. Gastric ulcer should be considered in patients unresponsive to standard therapy and consideration should be given to test for Helicobacter pylori infection; treatment with antibiotics and H2-receptor antagonists is safe in pregnancy and has been reported to be beneficial in case reports. Hyperthyroidism itself rarely presents with significant vomiting, and thyroid tests are not routinely needed in patients without goiter unless clinical signs or symptoms are present; between 5% and 66% of patients with hyperemesis gravidarum will have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels or elevated free thyroxine concentrations, and in those with no prior hyperthyroidism and no goiter, this hyperthyroidism can be expected to resolve by 20 weeks of gestation without specific antithyroid therapy.

### Helicobacter pylori seropositivity in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum [^111ToD8r]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with hyperemesis gravidarum.

Methods

From November 1999 to February 2001, we enrolled 54 pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum and 53 asymptomatic pregnant women in a prospective study. Specific serum immunoglobulin G for Helicobacter pylori was assayed in the sera of the study group and compared with the asymptomatic group. Chi-square and Student's t-test were used accordingly for statistical analysis of the data.

Results

Serologically positive Helicobacter pylori infection was detected in 44 out of 54 patients with hyperemesis gravidarum (81.5%) whereas 29 out of 53 asymptomatic gravidas (54.7%) had positive antibody titers for Helicobacter pylori. The ratio of Helicobacter pylori seropositivity in pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum was significantly higher than asymptomatic pregnant women (P < 0.01). The mean (± S.D.) of the IgG titer was 69.7 (± 77.5) in the hyperemesis gravidarum group and 34.5 (± 47.8) in the control group (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

There is a significant association between Helicobacter pylori infection and hyperemesis gravidarum in our hyperemetic pregnant patients.

### The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in the hispanic population affected by hyperemesis gravidarum [^112EswPF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori seropositivity in pregnant Hispanics affected by hyperemesis gravidarum.

Study Design

This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted over a 22-month period. Serum from pregnant Hispanics affected by hyperemesis gravidarum and unaffected Hispanics matched for age, gravidity, parity, and country of origin were tested for H pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgG levels specific for H pylori were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Assuming the background prevalence of H pylori serum positivity in the Hispanic population is approximately 60%, 38 patients in each group were needed to detect a 30% difference in affected patients versus controls with a power of 80% and P = 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using Yate's chi-square, Student t test, Mann-Whitney U, and binary logistic regression.

Results

A total of 82 patients between the ages of 18 to 39 years were enrolled. Of 40 patients diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum, 26 (65%) were seropositive for H pylori compared with 28 of 42 (67%) unaffected controls (P = 1.0). There were no statistical differences in maternal age or countries of origin between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

The overall prevalence of H pylori seropositivity in this patient population is 66%. In pregnant Hispanics affected by hyperemesis gravidarum, H pylori seropositivity is not increased compared with unaffected controls.

### Detection of Helicobacter pylori seropositivity in hyperemesis gravidarum and correlation with symptoms [^112toyfB]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a relationship between H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori) infection positivity and characteristics (time and duration) of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) symptoms. Forty-seven pregnant women with HG and 39 pregnant controls at the same gestational weeks without any gastrointestinal symptoms were included in this prospective study. H. pylori serum Immunoglobulin (Ig) G concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) in patients with HG and controls. Positive serology for H. pylori was correlated with the duration of symptoms in patients with HG. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 85.1% (40 of 47) and 64.1% (25 of 39) in patients with HG and controls, respectively (p < 0.05, χ² test). Mean values of H. pylori IgG (± standard deviation) were significantly higher in patients with HG than in controls (22.66 aIU/mL ± 22.34 vs. 11.54 aIU/mL ± 13.89, p < 0.01, Student's t-test). In HG group, time (gestational weeks) and the duration (weeks) of HG symptoms for patients serologically positive and negative for H. pylori were 6.95 ± 1.55 versus 6.58 ± 1.78 weeks, (p > 0.05, Student's t-test) and 8.35 ± 5.28 versus 11.40 ± 7.17 weeks (p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test), respectively. There was no correlation between duration of HG symptoms and serum H. pylori IgG concentrations. Although a majority of pregnant women with HG were serologically positive for H. pylori infection, there was no correlation between positive serology and duration of symptoms, which is not suggestive of a direct causal relationship between H. pylori infection and HG.

Helicobacter pylori infection

Chronic infection with helicobacter pylori may also cause HG. The histological examination of the gastric mucosa in a total of 30 women (20 HG patients and 10 pregnant volunteers) showed that the bacterium was present in almost 95% of patients with hyperemesis but in only 50% of controls. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P = 0.009). In a metaanalysis of 14 case-control studies, which included a total of 1732 patients and controls, an association between the presence of helicobacter pylori and HG was suggested, although not all of the analysed studies reached statistical significance [odds ratio from 0.55 to 109.33, confidence interval (CI) 95%]. Nevertheless, in one study examining both saliva (61.8% detection of helicobacter pylori in patients with HG versus 27.6% in symptom-free pregnant women) and serum (52.9% versus 20.7%) for the bacterium results were significant (P < 0.0001, CI 95%), as were cytotoxin-associated gene A and serum findings in a Chinese study. Two observational studies of five patients with HG reported no improvement in symptoms in response to standard drug treatment. However, a marked response was seen following antibiotic treatment (erythromycin) for helicobacter pylori. Therefore, although a helicobacter pylori infection might not be the only cause of HG, it should be taken into consideration as a contributing factor in intractable cases of this condition.

Hormonal factors

Several hormones may cause hyperemesis. These are oestrogen, progesterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, growth hormone and prolactin. Evidence for the involvement of serotonin in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting was found some years ago implying that this hormone might also play an important role in HG but findings have been inconsistent: In a prospective study on a total of 33 women (13 patients suffering from hyperemesis, 10 healthy pregnant women and 10 nongravid women) serotonin levels were evaluated. The results showed no differences between the three groups.

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: current and future perspectives [^115qYryn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In order to better answer the research priorities for HG, steps have been taken to standardize research in this field. First, the Windsor definition for HG was published in order to assist in clinical diagnosis and homogenize the definition of HG in study populations to enable the possibility for meta‐analysis. Next, an international consensus was achieved on a core outcome set for trials on HG. This core outcome set contains a list of 24 outcomes in 10 domains that will help to standardize outcome reporting in HG research, furthering the opportunity for meta‐analyses and therefore providing more robust evidence on the effectiveness of treatment options for HG. A core measurement set, a list of instruments recommended to measure core outcomes, is also in development. Improving outcome reporting in the field of HG will provide more robust evidence to answer the questions still facing the field today.

There is a lack of international guidelines for the treatment of HG. Some countries lack a national guideline. By standardizing care for persons with HG and exchanging information between countries on optimal care through an international guideline, we can increase the quality of care. The most appropriate combination of medical treatment should be further investigated with consideration for efficacy and adverse effects. Individuals with HG should be offered medical treatment based on robust evidence in the future. Furthermore, how to best organize care for people with HG is an important factor to consider. Evaluation of the feasibility and patient satisfaction with home or community‐based care should be further investigated. Medical care for individuals with HG often ends once symptoms subside or once delivery has taken place. With the potential for long‐term effects, there should be some follow‐up available to people with HG. This follow‐up should include help with family planning in case this is desired, and psychological follow‐up given that 20% of HG patients are left with PTSD postpartum. Lastly, due to the high recurrence rate of HG preconception, counseling should be offered to those wanting to get pregnant after a previous HG pregnancy.

### The role of serum ADAMTS-1 levels in hyperemesis gravidarum [^114oKoTQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the Gumushane University Ethics Committee(Project number:2022/E-95674917) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants included in the study gave written and verbal informed consent prior to being enrolled in the study.

Patients

In this cross-sectional study, the HEG group consisted of 45 patients aged between 21 and 34 who were admitted for nause and vomiting during pregnancy to the Ordu University Education and Research Hospital Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic between January 2018 and January 2022. The control group consisted of 44 pregnant women who applied to the same clinic for routine antenatal follow up and were matched in terms of chronological age, gestational age, and body mass index (BMI). Patients with diabetes or obesity, peptic ulcer or gastritis, liver and/or gallbladder disease (cholangitis or gallstones), thyroid dysfunction, urinary tract infection, coeliac disease, cardiovascular or renal diseases were excluded from our study. We also excluded any patients who has nausea and vomiting and any patients who has threatened miscarriage, as vaginal bleeding during pregnancy may affect ADAMTS levels. Multiple pregnancies and/or pregnancies obtained by assisted reproductive techniques, gestational trophoblastic disease, and autoimmune disease conditions were also not included in the study.

HEG was diagnosed if there was a persistent vomiting resulting in ketonuria and/or ketonemia leading to weight loss and volume reduction exceeding 5% of pre-pregnancy weight.

Women who vomited more than 3 times a day due to HEG and/or who had a positive urine ketone test result and/or were hospitalized for HEG 2 or more times. BMI was measured by dividing the weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared (kg/m²). Doctors performed the first transabdominal pregnancy ultrasonography using a 3.5 MHz transabdominal transducer (General Electric Logiq A5 ultrasound machine, Milwaukee, USA), and the gestational age was estimated according to the first trimester ultrasonographic value of fetal crown-rump length.

Laboratory studies

All laboratory analyses for each patient were performed in the early morning after an overnight fast of 8–12 h. We first hydrated the patients with 1000 cc RL solution and collected serum samples after sufficient urine output. We did not dilute the serum samples.

We evaluated complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, T4, fasting plasma glucose, BMI, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.

### Helicobacter pylori infection and platelet counts during pregnancy [^111WNWxo]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether there is any correlation between Helicobacter pylori infection and platelet counts during pregnancy.

Methods

One hundred and twenty pregnant women without any complications were evaluated. Platelet counts were determined during pregnancy and postpartum. H. pylori infection was assessed by the detection of serum antibodies at the 3rd day postpartum. Statistically significant differences of platelet count between H. pylori-positive and -negative patients were determined.

Results

H. pylori infection was found in 29 of 120 (24.2%). Platelet counts in the 3rd trimester were 22.7 ± 4.7 × 10³/microl in H. pylori-positive group and 22.8 ± 5.6 × 10³/microl in negative group (p = 0.98). Platelet count in the 3rd trimester in positive and negative patients were 93 ± 17% and 94 ± 20%, respectively, of that of the 1st trimester (p = 0.92). The incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum in both groups was not significant (p = 0.28).

Conclusion

A correlation between H. pylori infection and thrombocytopenia during pregnancy was not found in this study.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum and placental dysfunction disorders [^115FtpMC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common and usually benign symptoms of primarily the first trimester of pregnancy. The onset of nausea correlates with the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which typically rises within 4 weeks after the last menstrual period, peaking at approximately 9 weeks of gestation. Sixty percent of nausea cases resolve by the end of the first trimester and 91% by 20 weeks of gestation. Hyperemesis gravidarum is at the severe end of the nausea spectrum and according to The International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems (ICD-9), is defined as 'persistent and excessive vomiting starting before the end of the 22nd week of gestation'. Hyperemesis gravidarum is clinically classified as mild or severe, depending on associated metabolic disturbances such as carbohydrate depletion, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Its incidence is estimated at 0.3 to 1.5% of all live births but is unevenly distributed on a global level. Asian women, for instance are more likely to suffer from hyperemesis than Caucasian women. Hyperemesis greatly affects maternal well-being and quality of life and is among the most common reasons for pregnancy-associated hospitalization.

Relatively little is known about the etiology of hyperemesis. Causal roles of sex hormones, thyroid hormones, H. pylori infections and paternal genes have been suggested, although consensus has not been reached. Levels of hCG are positively associated with occurrence and severity of hyperemesis complaints, as seen in multiple- or molar pregnancies. While benign nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy are closely related to temporarily increased hCG levels, it has been argued that in women with hyperemesis, the persistently high hCG level dysregulates normal stimulation of trophoblast migration, which consequently alters placentation. Ultimately abnormal placentation could lead to placental dysfunction that clinically manifests as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, as well as miscarriage, stillbirth and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). In particular, elevated hCG plasma levels in the second trimester are associated with development of these conditions. Thus, hyperemesis gravidarum, occurring in first and early second trimester, could be an early pregnancy indicator of a process that results in symptomatic placental dysfunction later.

### Optimisation of hyperemesis gravidarum management through an emergency department setting [^115DEyyn]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common, affecting women in up to 80% of pregnancies. Hyperemesis gravidarum represents the severe end of the spectrum and is associated with dehydration, weight loss of > 5% and electrolyte imbalance. Diagnosis is dependent on exclusion of other causes like gastritis and urinary tract infections and inclusion of those with ketones of four or more on urinalysis. It occurs in 0.3%–3.6% of pregnancies with variable recurrence rates between 15.2% and 81%.

Hyperemesis gravidarum has several aetiological theories but is primarily associated with increased beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone levels. It affects women in the first trimester of pregnancy, with symptoms peaking at approximately 9 weeks and mostly resolving by 20 weeks in 90% of women.

Treatment is supportive focusing on fluid, vitamin and electrolyte replacement as well as antiemetic therapy.

One should not dismiss the increasing evidence which highlights the psychological burden of hyperemesis gravidarum, not to mention the financial cost to both the patient and the healthcare system.

4.4 Psychological support

The care for HG should include offering professional psychological care. Healthcare professionals should assess people's mental health during pregnancy and refer to psychological support if necessary. Clinical assessment should be performed if there is suspicion of depression, anxiety, postnatal depression, and/or PTSD. Information from patient support groups, such as Pregnancy Sickness Support in the UK or the HER foundation in the USA, should be provided to individuals and their partners. As many as 25.5% of individuals with HG suffer from occasional suicidal ideation, thus suicidal ideation should specifically be assessed by healthcare providers when assessing mental health status of individuals with HG. As HG poses an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and PTSD as long as 4.5 years after pregnancy with HG, consideration should be given to follow‐up psychological care of individuals with HG beyond pregnancy. Pregnancy sickness‐specific counseling may be appropriate in people with HG. As many as 10% of people with HG will terminate a wanted pregnancy due to their condition. The full range of therapeutic options should be offered to an HG patient before deciding that termination of pregnancy is the only option. Few data are available on the best way to organize psychological care for people with HG.

4.5 Multidisciplinary care

Care for individuals with HG ideally is based on a holistic approach with a multidisciplinary team. A study has shown that involvement of a mental health professional in the care team of a person with HG resulted in an improvement in quality of life and coping with the impact of pregnancy. Emotional support and psychological and psychiatric care should be available to persons with HG if requested or required. Dieticians should be consulted to monitor their intake and give nutritional advice, including supplementations via various routes if indicated. If complications arise, designated subspecialties should be consulted.

"Alarm features should not automatically precipitate endoscopy in younger patients but this should be considered on a case-by-case basis". For younger patients, "We recommend patients < 60 years of age have a non-invasive test for Helicobacter pylori and treatment if positive". If negative or unresponsive, "Those that are negative or do not respond to this approach should be given a trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy", and "If these are ineffective tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or prokinetic therapies can be tried". After normal endoscopy, "Patients that have an endoscopy where no pathology is found are defined as having functional dyspepsia (FD)" and "H. pylori eradication should be offered in these patients if they are infected". For persistent symptoms or H. pylori–negative patients, "We recommend PPI, TCA and prokinetic therapy (in that order) in those that fail therapy or are H. pylori negative". Testing is selective: "We do not recommend routine upper gastrointestinal (GI) motility testing but it may be useful in selected patients".

### Effect of maternal Helicobacter pylori infection on birth weight in an urban community in Uganda [^114sgU9T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori, a widespread infection particularly in developing countries has been associated with many adverse effects during pregnancy including hyperemesis gravidarum, neural tube defects in newborns, intrauterine fetal growth restriction and miscarriage. We sought to document the effects of H. pylori infection on birth weight in a low-income setting in Kampala, Uganda.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study conducted in Kampala between May 2012 and May 2013. The participants were H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative HIV negative primigravidae and secundigravidae. Recruitment was at ≤ 18 gestation weeks and follow up assessments were carried out at 26 and 36 gestation weeks and soon after delivery. H. pylori infection was determined using H. pylori stool antigen test. Maternal weight and height were measured, and body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain were calculated. Only term and live babies were considered. Low birth weight (LBW) was defined as a birth weight of < 2500 gram.

Results

A total of 221 participants were enrolled with mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 20.9 ± 2.7 years. The mean ± SD gestation age at delivery was 39.4 ± 1.0 weeks. Primigravidae were 61.5% (n = 188) and 52.9% (n = 117) of the participants were positive for H. pylori infection. Low pre-pregnancy BMI (< 18.5 kg/m²) was recorded in 14.6% (n = 28) while 38% (n = 73) had a height < 156 cm at recruitment. Of the infants born to the participants, 13.6% (n = 26) had low birth weight (< 2500 gram).

Independent predictors for LBW were the mother being positive for H. pylori infection (odds ratio, OR, 3.6, 95% CI 1.1–11.5; P = 0.031) maternal height at recruitment < 156 cm (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.4–8.2; P = 0.008) and maternal weight gain rates < 0.3 kg/week during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.0–14.1; P = 0.044).

Conclusion

H. pylori infection is associated with LBW among primigravidae and secundigravidae in Kampala, Uganda.

Many disorders of the gastrointestinal tract are common in pregnancy. Elevated levels of progesterone may lead to alterations in gastrointestinal motility which could contribute to nausea, vomiting, and/or GERD. Pregnancy-induced diarrhea may be due to elevated levels prostaglandins. This article reviews the normal physiologic and structural changes associated with pregnancy that could contribute to many of the common gastrointestinal complaints in pregnant patients. Additionally, the appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluations, other pathologic conditions that should be included in the differential, as well as the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies for each of these conditions is discussed.

4.3 Hospital admission and discharge

Hyperemesis gravidarum is the most common cause of hospital admission in early pregnancy. Per country, the care for individuals with HG may be organized in different ways. In general, mild cases of NVP can be cared for with single‐agent transient antiemetic treatment, oral hydration, sick days from work, and dietary counseling. More extensive care is appropriate when primary care measures have failed or if symptoms include dehydration and inability to tolerate food or fluids. Secondary care should be considered in the following cases of nausea and vomiting with:
Clinical dehydration or weight loss (greater than 5% of body weight), despite single agent or combination first line antiemetics.
Electrolyte imbalances.
Confirmed or suspected comorbidity in which HG symptoms hamper intake of medications (e.g. urinary tract infection and inability to tolerate oral antibiotics).
Comorbidities such as epilepsy, HIV, type 1 diabetes, or psychiatric disease in which HG symptoms hamper timely intake and uptake of necessary medications

Hospital admission consists of rehydration therapy and review of antiemetic treatment, and can often be completed as a day‐admission or in an outpatient setting. If individuals are admitted to the hospital with prolonged vomiting and/or reduced intake and/or weight loss, high single‐dose parenteral thiamine supplementation should be administered in order to prevent WE and refeeding syndrome. Ketones have unjustly been considered a measure of dehydration and thus been used to inform necessity for hospital admission. However, ketonuria is not associated with HG disease severity and should not be used to diagnose HG, or determine admission indication or length of hospitalization.

Among those admitted for HG, the chance of readmission is high, between 28% and 60%, which should be discussed with patients and accommodated for in care pathways. Antiemetic treatment will need to be continued after discharge. People with symptoms persisting in the second and third trimesters should be offered serial scans to monitor fetal growth, as babies born to mothers with persistent HG and/or low weight gain have an increased risk low birth weight.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^117F491a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG)

HG is a severe form of nausea and vomiting associated with weight loss of more than 5% of pre-pregnant weight, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. HG usually starts before the 22 nd week of gestation, affects 0.3–2.0% of pregnancies and sometimes requires hospital admission. In a Canadian population-based cohort study, Fell et al reported an increased risk of HG associated with hyperthyroid disorders, psychiatric illness, previous molar pregnancy, pre-existing diabetes and asthma.

Currently, three major etiologies have been described in the literature. Firstly, high levels of HCG can have a stimulating effect on the secretory process in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The production of thyroid-binding globulin also increases under estrogen stimulation, leading to a decrease in free thyroxine (T4). The transient decrease in the free T4 level causes stimulation of the thyroid and the patient can develop gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, leading to vomiting. Secondly, HCG is similar to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and possibly causes hyperemesis by stimulating the TSH receptor. Thirdly, there is a negative relation between the levels of prolactin and nausea/vomiting, whereas estrogens have a positive relation. Therefore, the higher levels of estrogens during pregnancy can raise the risk of HG.

HG is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is usually accompanied by hyponatremia, hypokalemia, low serum urea, raised hematocrit, metabolic hypochloremia alkalosis and ketonuria. Liver enzymes may be elevated in 50% of cases. Patients are dehydrated with fluid/food intolerance and weight loss due to the prolonged vomiting. Ultrasound assessment of pregnancy is mandatory, because HG may be associated with multiple and molar pregnancies.

No single therapy has emerged as significantly beneficial and the medical approach is based on electrolyte correction and prevention of dehydration. When hospitalized, these women usually need intravenous fluid therapy to correct electrolyte disturbances. Normal saline solution is recommended to correct possible hyponatremia. As in non-severe nausea and vomiting, thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may be appropriate to prevent severe symptoms. Thiamine also prevents Wernicke's encephalopathy in patients with prolonged vomiting. If patients fall to respond to conservative therapy, anti-emetics are indicated, including histamine receptor blockers, phenothiazines and dopamine antagonists. Malnutrition may necessitate nasojejunal enteral feeding, effective in symptom control and weight gain in severe HG. Total parenteral nutrition may be used in life-threatening cases.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^112TkMDE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — hospitalization criteria and outpatient management indicates that when a woman cannot tolerate liquids without vomiting and has not responded to outpatient management, hospitalization for evaluation and treatment of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance is recommended. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 98 pregnant women found that outpatient treatment resulted in fewer overnight hospital stays, whereas a subsequent RCT of 53 pregnant women reported no differences in symptoms over 7 days between outpatient rehydration and antiemetic therapy versus inpatient care. The option of hospitalization for observation and further assessment should be preserved for patients who experience a change in vital signs or a change in mental status, continue to lose weight, and are refractory to treatment.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^113cpDwm]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

About 50% - 90% of all pregnancies are accompanied by nausea and vomiting. According to a study of more than 360 pregnant women, only 2% experienced only nausea in the morning whereas, in 80%, complaints persisted throughout the day. The condition is usually self-limiting and peaks at around 9 weeks gestation. At 20 weeks symptoms typically cease. However, in up to 20% of cases, nausea and vomiting may continue until delivery.

This condition is known as nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) or emesis gravidarum and is of no pathological significance as long as the affected women do not feel unwell or restricted in their daily life. There are, however, different grades in the scope of NVP, which range from occasional morning-sickness to excessive vomiting that persists throughout the day. The most severe grade of NVP often leads to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG; see below), but it can be difficult to differentiate between the two conditions.

A prospective study of more than 9000 pregnant women showed that NVP occurred significantly more often in primigravidas and in women who were less educated, younger, non-smokers and overweight or obese. The incidence of NVP was also higher in women with a history of nausea and vomiting in a previous pregnancy.

In order to exclude differential diagnoses the following crucial parameters should be investigated: Onset of nausea and vomiting (nearly all of the cases begin before 9 weeks of gestation), attendant symptoms, underlying chronic disorders or, in rare cases, hereditary diseases (see Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting.

Figure 2
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting in respect to abdominal symptoms.

A small percentage of pregnant women experience a severe form of nausea and vomiting that is termed HG (synonym: excessive vomiting during pregnancy). This disorder has an estimated incidence of 0.5% - 2% of all live births. A standard definition of HG is the occurrence of more than three episodes of vomiting per day with ketonuria and more than 3 kg or 5% weight loss. However, the diagnosis is usually made clinically following the exclusion of other causes.

Methods/Design

Participants/ eligibility criteria

Patients ≥ 18 years of age are eligible if they have been admitted to hospital because of HG (first admission or readmission) at a gestational age between 5 + 0 and 19 + 6 weeks. Patients with singleton or multiple pregnancies are eligible. A diagnosis of HG is made if excessive nausea or vomiting necessitates hospital admission, in the absence of any other obvious cause such as drug induced vomiting or infection.

Exclusion criteria are mola hydatidosa pregnancy, non-vital pregnancy, acute infection causing vomiting (e.g. appendicitis, pyelonephritis), contraindication for enteral tube feeding (e.g. oesophageal varices, allergies to enteral tube mix compounds) or HIV infection.

Procedures, recruitment and randomisation

This study is a nationwide multicentre open label RCT conducted within the Dutch Consortium for Studies in Obstetrics, Fertility and Gynaecology, a nationwide collaboration of hospitals in the Netherlands. The staff and/or local research coordinator of the participating hospitals identifies eligible women. After counselling and reading the patient information form, patients are asked for written informed consent. Patient information is provided in Dutch and English. See Fig. 1.

### The outpatient management and special considerations of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^115X18nF]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

With 50–90% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), the burden of illness can become quite significant if symptoms are under-treated and/or under-diagnosed, thus allowing for progression of the disease. The majority of these women will necessitate at least one visit with a provider to specifically address NVP, and up to 10% or greater will require pharmacotherapy after failure of conservative measures to adequately control symptoms. As a result, initiation of prompt and effective treatment in the outpatient setting is ideal. Once NVP is diagnosed and treatment is started, it is crucial to track symptoms in order to assess for a decrease in or resolution of symptoms as well as an escalation in symptoms requiring additional therapy. Of note, co-existing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori infection, and psychosocial factors may have a negative impact on the management of NVP. Ultimately, every woman has her own perception of disease severity and desire for treatment. It is critical that both the provider and patient be proactive in the diagnosis and management of NVP.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — fetal effects — are influenced by severity; with mild or moderate vomiting there is little apparent effect on pregnancy outcome, studies have documented a lower rate of miscarriage compared with controls, no significant association with congenital anomalies has been demonstrated, and findings for low birth weight (LBW) are mixed with some studies showing no increase and a systematic review and meta-analysis showing higher incidence of LBW, small-for-gestational-age, and premature infants; no association with perinatal or neonatal mortality has been demonstrated in large retrospective cohorts, and it is appropriate to reassure patients that these conditions most often portend well for pregnancy outcome.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^117A6kNA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Resistance of H. pylori to antibiotics has reached alarming levels worldwide. Local surveillance networks are required to select appropriate eradication regimens for each region. Tailored treatment of H. pylori infection according to systematic antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be useful to limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance worldwide. However, whether patients should systematically undergo an upper endoscopy for bacterial culture (or PCR) before administering H. pylori eradication treatment in clinical practice remains a debatable matter. In the present article we have reviewed the advantages and limitations of the susceptibility-guided and the empirical strategies to treat H. pylori infection, which are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1.
Main advantages and limitations of susceptibility-guided and empirical treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.

It would be recommendable that susceptibility tests (culture or PCR) are routinely performed, even before prescribing first-line treatment, in specialized centers with interest in H. pylori management, with the intention to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the treatment of naïve patients and the influence of such resistances on the efficacy of up-to-date first-line eradication treatments. Furthermore, it would also seem recommendable that susceptibility tests are routinely performed in some specialized centers after H. pylori eradication failures, to evaluate the development of resistances in this setting and to assess how they may reduce the effectiveness of rescue regimens.

However, the evidence is too limited to support the generalized use of susceptibility-guided therapy for H. pylori treatment in routine clinical practice, either as first-line or as rescue treatment. In particular, it seems that despite the use of susceptibility-guided combinations of drugs, rescue treatments are frequently unsuccessful, indicating that other factors different from in vitro antibiotic susceptibility influence eradication rates. Practical, economical, and logistical issues should be evaluated and addressed according to the target population and the clinical situation prior to the application of susceptibility-guided H. pylori therapy. In the future, stool sample-based molecular approach for detecting H. pylori antimicrobial resistance might enable more convenient, less invasive methods that facilitate the applicability of susceptibility-guided treatment.

What is undoubted is that we always must prescribe the most effective first-line H. pylori eradication treatments (that is those regimens that have demonstrated to achieve cure rates ⩾90% in our setting) and that the rescue treatment should be carefully chosen depending on which treatment was used initially. The results (H. pylori cure rates) of our clinical practice should be continuously audited to confirm that we always maintain a high success rate.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^114BZGJi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) — management includes supportive care and defined vitamin and steroid protocols. Elevated levels of liver enzymes can be seen in 40%–50% of patients with HG. Thiamine therapy should be started at a dose of 100 mg daily for a minimum of 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg daily until adequate oral intake is established. For refractory severe HG, methylprednisolone can be given as a last resort, using 16 mg intravenous (IV) every 8 hours for up to 3 days, followed by tapering over 2 weeks and limiting the maximum duration to 6 weeks; because its administration in the first trimester has been reported to slightly increase the risk of cleft palate when given before 10 weeks of gestation, it should be administered with caution in the first trimester. Patients with severe symptoms may need hospitalization for IV hydration and replacement of electrolytes, vitamins, and nutrients; if weight loss and symptoms persist, enteral or parenteral nutrition may be required.

Case presentation

Presentation of the 1st pregnancy

A 23-year-old Caucasian gravida 2 para 0 (spontaneous abortion at 6 weeks of gestation one year before) with type 1 diabetes (first diagnosis 8 years ago, HbA1c 6% before pregnancy) on an intensified insulin regimen (basal NPH insulin: 16 IE- 0–8 IE and prandial injections using insulin lispro on an insulin-to-carb ratio of 1:1) presented with symptoms of nausea and vomiting in her first trimester. She underwent standard hyperemesis therapy with administration of intravenous fluids, vitamin B complex and antiemetics several times in different hospitals and antiemetic suppositories during outpatient treatment. At 23 weeks of gestation, she presented again with persistent severe vomiting and abdominal pain, severe ketonuria and glucosuria in a euglycaemic situation (blood glucose 8–9 mmol/l). Because of haematemesis, gastroscopy was performed, and reflux oesophagitis with an axial sliding hernia not requiring intervention was diagnosed. Gastroenterologists recommended high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPI) only. In addition to adaptation of the insulin regimen, hyperemesis treatment was accelerated, and therapy with PPI was started with 40 mg pantoprazole twice a day, resulting in the improvement of nausea and the elimination of ketonuria. At discharge, she had recovered and was in good condition. Nevertheless, one week later, further hospitalization became necessary because of another episode of impressive haematemesis (but without relevant impact on Hb levels), abdominal pain, ketonuria and glucosuria. Antiemetic and infusion therapy were extended with only moderate effects. Ketonuria persisted, while blood sugar values remained within the target range. During the hospital stay, a third-trimester scan was performed and revealed a eutrophic foetus with normal sonoanatomy and echocardiography. Four days later, when abdominal pain and vomiting calmed, the patient discharged herself against medical advice, although ketonuria still persisted.

### Gastroenterology consultations in pregnancy [^112ADzQn]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Training in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in pregnancy is required for all gastroenterology fellows. Nevertheless, the actual role of the gastroenterologist in the management of pregnant patients is unknown. Establishing the characteristics of GI consultations in pregnancy can help focus trainee education and prepare gastroenterologists for future practice. The purpose of this study was to determine the indications for consultations in pregnancy and the gastroenterologist's role in the evaluation and management of the pregnant patient.

Methods

A chart review was performed of all consecutive outpatient GI consultations for pregnant women at a high-volume obstetrics hospital over a 3-year period. Referring source, patient characteristics, indication(s) for consultation, diagnosis(es), change in management after consultation, and need for follow-up were recorded.

Results

We reviewed 370 charts. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) at referral was 28.7 years ± 6.5, and mean weeks of gestation (± SD) was 21.3 ± 8.8. Obstetrician/gynecologists requested most consultations (70.1%). New GI symptoms arising in pregnancy comprised 35.4% of consultations, and worsening of a preexisting GI disorder comprised 24.4%. The most common indications for consultation were viral hepatitis (20.2%), nausea and vomiting (18.9%), and nonspecific abdominal pain (13.5%). The most common diagnoses were acute or chronic viral hepatitis (17.8%), hyperemesis gravidarum (15.1%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (14.3%), and constipation (13.0%). Consultation changed the diagnosis in 25.1% of patients and changed management in 78.6%. Follow-up was required in 77.3% of cases during pregnancy and 37.8% postpartum.

Conclusions

GI consultation in pregnancy is sought more frequently for the evaluation and management of GI disorders not unique to pregnancy than for pregnancy-unique disorders. Although GI consultation changed the diagnosis in a minority of cases, it changed management in the majority. Gastroenterologists should be familiar with the most common indications for consultation in pregnancy and be prepared to evaluate and manage pregnant women with GI disorders.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^114daMVg]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Progesterone

Lower and elevated progesterone levels have been reported in patients with hyperemesis. These alterations are caused by pregnancy-associated changes in the mother's immune system: In a prospective study on 44 pregnant women (22 patients with hyperemesis and 22 matching healthy pregnant women) a significant increase in plasma progesterone levels was shown in women with hyperemesis compared to women without the condition (P < 0.05). A potentially emetogenic elevation of HCG due to these modifications is proposed. Lower progesterone levels were found in a prospectively controlled study with 62 NVP subjects versus 40 nonaffected pregnant women (P < 0.02). However, several other studies found no association between serum progesterone concentration and hyperemesis. Progesterone may cause reduced gastrointestinal motility during pregnancy. Gastric dysrhythmias (tachygastria, bradygastria) may also occur, thus contributing to hyperemesis.

Oestrogens

Increased levels of oestrogen and oestradiol are known to cause nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Hence, the presence of a female foetus is associated with severe nausea and vomiting usually explained by a raised concentration of oestrogen in utero. This is consistent with the observation that oestrogen treatment can cause nausea. It has been suggested that patients with hyperemesis are probably more sensitive to oestrogen effects than asymptomatic pregnant women. Cigarette smokers usually show lower levels of both oestrogens and HCG. Consistently, HG occurs less often in women who smoke. However, some studies have reported negative results regarding the association between elevated oestrogen levels and the development of hyperemesis.

Hyperthyroidism

Thyroid function is physiologically altered during pregnancy, including stimulation by HCG. Hyperthyroidism with normal fT3 and fT4 levels, but decreased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), may also be implicated in HG. A self-limiting, transient hyperthyroidism of hyperemesis gravidarum (THHG) has been proposed according to the findings of a screening series in 1900 pregnant women who showed markedly increased HCG and fT4 levels. THHG may persist until 18 weeks gestation and does not require treatment. This condition may be partly caused by the high levels of HCG that are often seen in patients with HG since HCG and TSH have a very similar protein structure, thus enabling HCG to act like TRH and hyper-stimulate the thyroid, which recently has been shown conclusively.

Assignment of a diagnosis of THHG requires the following:

- pathological serology results during hyperemesis

- a negative history of hyperthyroidism before the pregnancy

- the absence of thyroid antibodies

By this term is usually meant that aggravated uncontrollable form of vomiting of pregnancy which resists local as well as constitutional treatment, and which so reduces the patient's vitality that it very seriously endangers her life. Occasionally, deaths directly due to this cause have been reported, so that a very serious and difficult problem confronts the physician who has charge of such a case. A large number of these patients abort as the result of the irritation of the uterus caused by the violent fits of retching and vomiting; this relieves by removing the source of the irritation. The lives of a number of these patients may be maintained for a time by rectal alimentation, but, unfortunately, by many this mode of feeding is not borne very well, especially if it must be kept up for a long time.

### Unusual case of hyperemesis in a pregnant patient with prior antireflux surgery [^114d6DT8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 33-year-old, 8 weeks pregnant, presented with severe upper abdominal pain with vomiting on a background of a previous laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for reflux disease. An urgent MRI had shown herniation of the fundoplication wrap through the diaphragmatic hiatus. The cause of her symptoms was attributed to hyperemesis gravidarum. The plan was to manage this patient conservatively until the conclusion of her pregnancy. This plan was revised when she presented for the second time and developed worsening pain and haematemesis. An emergency gastroscopy showed ischaemic changes in most of the stomach requiring the patient to undergo an emergency laparotomy. In pregnant patients, presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting as well as haematemesis, having had previous antireflux surgery, incarceration of the stomach must be considered as a differential. Prompt assessment and early senior decision-making is extremely important in avoiding a potentially catastrophic outcome for such patients.

### Physician perspectives of Helicobacter pylori diagnostic and treatment practices in Canada: results of a Canadian survey [^113BkKf8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The most recent guidelines on H. pylori management recommend testing for H. pylori in all patients with PUD, previous history of PUD, low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, or endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer. Additionally, they recommend testing for uninvestigated dyspepsia. The recommendations state that patients with typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with no history of PUD do not need to undergo H. pylori testing. The results of our survey showed that participants did not always choose to test for H. pylori in their patients with upper gastrointestinal complaints with 37% of participants only testing less than half of the time (Table 2). The guidelines also recommend follow up testing for eradication four weeks after finishing treatment with either a urea breath test, stool antigen test, or biopsy-based testing. Only one quarter of participants always performed follow-up testing for eradication (Table 2). Current guidelines do not make a recommendation about the optimal diagnostic test for H. pylori infection. Additionally, current guidelines recommend using patients' previous antibiotic exposure as a factor in choosing an antibiotic regimen as well as considering local resistance patterns. Subsequently, there are differing recommended first line regimens based on antibiotic resistance patterns. Yet, in Canada availability of information on local antibiotic resistance to H. pylori is not routine, and if present, are rarely made easily available to treating physicians. Antimicrobial resistance patterns can be determined utilizing culture methods or molecular testing; however, this is often not available in clinical settings. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of cultured isolates is not regularly performed due to challenges associated with the fastidious nature of H. pylori whereas interpretive criteria for molecular methods are generally limited to only clarithromycin resistance. Future directions of research should focus on developing a culture-independent genomics-based approach to predict local antimicrobial resistance patterns and guide empiric treatment of H. pylori infection as well as providing antimicrobial susceptibility reference testing to personalize treatment when required.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) — diagnostic features and evaluation include three descriptive criteria and targeted exclusion of mimics. Clinical features are "stereotypical episodic vomiting resembling CVS in terms of onset, with frequency 3 or more times annually"; cannabis use patterns specify "duration of cannabis use more than 1 year before symptom onset; frequency more than 4 times per week, on average"; and cannabis cessation requires "resolution of symptoms after a period of abstinence from cannabis use for at least 6 months, or at least equal to the total duration of 3 typical vomiting cycles in that patient". In the absence of a confirmatory test, "limited individualized evaluation in the outpatient setting is advised to exclude disorders that can mimic CHS", and "There is no consensus about minimum testing in patients with suspicion of CHS; however, the approach to the diagnosis for chronic nausea and vomiting requires a good clinical history… may include anatomic evaluations… and other tests, as indicated". Emergency department (ED) assessment "requires immediate evaluation for life-threatening disorders", and differential exclusion of structural and functional mimics "includes rumination syndrome, gastroparesis, CVS, pregnancy, migraine, and functional chronic nausea and vomiting syndrome".

ITP in children — diagnosis, Helicobacter pylori testing, and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine management are addressed with graded directives. We recommend that bone marrow examination is unnecessary in children and adolescents with the typical features of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and is not necessary in children who fail IVIG therapy (both grade 1B). We suggest that bone marrow examination is also not necessary in similar patients prior to initiation of treatment with corticosteroids or before splenectomy (grade 2C) and that testing for antinuclear antibodies is not necessary in the evaluation of children and adolescents with suspected ITP (grade 2C). For H pylori, we recommend against routine testing for H pylori in children with chronic ITP (grade 1B). For MMR-associated ITP, we recommend that children with a history of ITP who are unimmunized receive their scheduled first MMR vaccine (grade 1B), and in those who have already received a first dose, vaccine titers can be checked; if full immunity is present (90% to 95% of children), no further MMR should be given, whereas if immunity is inadequate, reimmunization with MMR at the recommended age is advised (grade 1B).

Patients

In this single-center study, patients with dyspepsia, iron-deficient anemia, need for chronic therapy with PPI and/or first-degree relatives with gastric carcinoma were prospectively considered for inclusion. Each had a recent positive 13 C-urea breath test (UBT) and indication for upper endoscopy. Exclusion criteria were: age < 18 years; pregnancy; lactating and/or fertile women who were not using safe contraceptive methods; history of allergy/hypersensitivity to any antibiotic or PPI; previous gastric malignancy and/or gastric surgery; current use of anticoagulants; marked thrombocytopenia; systemic severe disease (hepatic, cardio-respiratory or renal disease; uncontrolled diabetes; active malignant diseases, coagulopathies); use of antibiotics in the last 4 weeks; use of PPI in the last 2 weeks; intolerance/refusal to undergo upper endoscopy; previous H. pylori eradication treatments including fluoroquinolones or known use of this antibiotic for other infections.

They were divided in two groups: Group A — patients who had never received eradication treatments (n = 103; 73 female; mean age: 41.6 ± 12.9 years); Group B — patients who failed ≥ 1 eradication attempts that did not include LVX (n = 51; 39 female; mean age: 45.2 ± 13.9 years) and had no documented history of treatment with fluoroquinolones.

Covariates

General characteristics

Maternal age was assessed at enrolment. Prepregnancy body mass index (kilograms per square meter) was calculated with the use of self-reported prepregnancy weight and height measured at enrolment. All sociodemographic characteristics were self-reported. Ethnicity was determined according to the definition of Statistics Netherlandsby country of birth of the pregnant woman and her parents. Based on the urban population of Rotterdam, the following ethnic groups were identified: Dutch, "other Western" (women who originated from Europe, North America, Oceania, Japan, or Indonesia), Surinamese, Turkish, Cape Verdean/Dutch Antilles, Moroccan and "other non-Western" (women who originated from Africa, Asia, or South or Central America). Dutch and "other Western" ethnic groups were classified as Western, all other ethnic groups that were described were classified as non-Western. Educational level served as a proxy for socioeconomic status and was based on the highest completed education (none or primary school, secondary school, higher education). Smoking during pregnancy was also self-reported.

Gastritis — Helicobacter pylori testing and specimen handling — Helicobacter pylori is associated with atrophic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer, and diagnosis of H. pylori infection is critical as treatment can decrease morbidity. Testing is recommended for all patients with peptic ulcer disease, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and early gastric cancer, and in some patients with dyspepsia, noninvasive testing is an option; both invasive and noninvasive tests are available to aid in the diagnosis. For invasive testing, biopsy samples should be obtained during endoscopy from patients who have not received antimicrobial agents or proton pump inhibitors in the 2 weeks prior to collection; culture, although not routinely performed, allows for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, but the organism is fastidious and growth in culture routinely requires at least 7 days of incubation. For histopathology, Two biopsies from antrum and 2 biopsies from posterior corpus are recommended, rapid urease tests can be performed on a single biopsy from antrum and a single biopsy from the posterior corpus, and performance of both histopathological examination and rapid urease testing improves the sensitivity of invasive testing. If susceptibility testing is not required, culture is not necessary, eliminating the need for collection of additional specimens. Noninvasive assays such as the urea breath test and stool antigen or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) determinations allow patients to avoid endoscopy and gastric biopsy; the urea breath test is performed in the clinic and this assay has a sensitivity of ~95%, comparable to the invasive.

### Early nasogastric tube feeding in optimising treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum: the MOTHER randomised controlled trial (maternal and offspring outcomes after treatment of hyperEmesis by refeeding) [^11535q4t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is common, affecting 50–80% of pregnancies. Often these symptoms are mild and self-limiting and resolve without intervention in the second trimester. In other cases however, severe intractable vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte disturbances and significant weight loss necessitating hospital admission. The condition of intractable vomiting during pregnancy is called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). HG has repeatedly been associated with poor pregnancy outcome including low birth weight (LBW, < 2500 g: OR 1.42), small for gestational age (OR 1.28) and prematurity (OR 1.32). Furthermore, HG has a major impact on maternal wellbeing and quality of life and remains the largest single cause of hospital admission in early pregnancy. However, the aetiology of HG is poorly understood.

Approximately 0.8–2% of all pregnancies are complicated by HG. Currently, there are no treatments with proven efficacy available according to the latest Cochrane review on interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Hospitalisation can be required for intravenous treatment of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Currently, women who suffer from HG do not receive any particular nutritional attention, although enteral tube feeding is sometimes used as a treatment of last resort. Enteral tube feeding effectively treats both dehydration and malnutrition in non-pregnant patients with poor intake and has been shown to be safer than parenteral nutrition in pregnancy. Moreover, in several small studies in women with HG, which did not employ a control group, it alleviated symptoms and was well tolerated if continued in a home setting. There have been no controlled trials to investigate the extent to which enteral tube feeding can positively affect pregnancy outcome and maternal quality of life, nausea and vomiting symptoms or time in hospital.

At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness and efficiency of rehydration and dietary interventions for HG. We hypothesise that enteral tube feeding in addition to standard care is a more effective treatment for HG symptoms than standard care with intravenous rehydration alone, and improves pregnancy outcome.

This multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare early enteral tube feeding in addition to standard care, with standard care alone. Outcomes of interest are birth weight and maternal nausea and vomiting symptoms, maternal quality of life, duration of hospitalisation, weight gain and neonatal morbidity. The study is conducted within the Dutch Consortium for Studies in Obstetrics, Fertility and Gynaecology.

### Cost-effectiveness of routine endoscopic biopsies for Helicobacter pylori detection in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia [^112GhT6Q]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The role of endoscopic biopsies in the detection of Helicobacter pylori in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia is poorly defined. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of performing routine biopsies for the detection of H pylori at upper endoscopy in these patients.

Methods

Clinical decision-making was modeled based on outcomes data from published articles and expert opinion. The target group was adults, less than 45 years of age, with nonulcer dyspepsia as defined by a normal endoscopy. Costs, expressed in Canadian dollars, were tabulated over a 1-year time horizon. The main outcome was relief of symptoms, defined as the absence of symptom persistence or recurrence over the 12 months. A strategy of performing a biopsy for the detection of H pylori with a rapid urease test during gastroscopy was compared with that of not performing a biopsy. In addition, as a secondary analysis, the cost-effectiveness of obtaining a biopsy specimen for histopathologic evaluation in patients after a negative rapid urease test was evaluated.

Results

A strategy of endoscopy with biopsy and rapid urease testing costs 3940 dollars per additional symptom-free patient as compared with endoscopy without biopsy. This result was sensitive to the difference in symptomatic recurrence rate at 1 year between patients in whom H pylori was successfully and unsuccessfully eradicated, which in this analysis, was set at 9.9%. Only when the difference in symptomatic recurrence in patients with successful versus unsuccessful eradication fell to less than 4% was endoscopy with biopsy over 10,000 dollars per cured patient greater than endoscopy without biopsy. The conclusions were otherwise robust when varying the values of other variables across clinically relevant ranges. There was little additional benefit associated with histopathologic assessment of biopsy specimens in patients with a negative rapid urease test and the cost per additional cure was 25,529 dollars.

Conclusions

In adults with nonulcer dyspepsia under age 45 years undergoing endoscopy, routine procurement of a biopsy specimen for detection of H pylori was more costly yet more effective compared with not obtaining a specimen. The cost-effectiveness of a biopsy is dependent on the benefits of H pylori eradication in this patient population. The less likely a patient with nonulcer dyspepsia is to become asymptomatic after successful H pylori eradication, the more costly a strategy of routinely obtaining a specimen at endoscopy. The additional cost of sending a specimen for histopathologic analysis if the rapid urease test is negative does not appear warranted based on cost-effectiveness considerations.

### Treating hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting in pregnancy… [^11467eNA]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance Nausea and vomiting affects approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant adverse physical and psychological sequelae. Objective To summarize current evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. Evidence Review Databases were searched to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; planned meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings. Findings. Seventy-eight studies were included: 67 randomized clinical trials and 11 nonrandomized studies.

Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide, pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron were associated with improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT reported greater improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy. For moderate-severe symptoms, 1 RCT suggested that pyridoxine-doxylamine combination taken preemptively reduced risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms compared with treatment once symptoms begin. One RCT found that ondansetron was associated with lower nausea scores on day 4 than metoclopramide but not episodes of emesis. Although there was no difference in trend in nausea scores over the 14-day study period, trend in vomiting scores was better in the ondansetron group. One RCT found no difference between metoclopramide and promethazine after 24 hours. Three RCTs compared corticosteroids with placebo or promethazine or metoclopramide in women with severe symptoms. Improvements were seen in all corticosteroid groups, but only a significant difference between corticosteroids vs metoclopramide was reported. For other interventions, evidence was limited.

Conclusions and Relevance For mild symptoms of nausea and emesis of pregnancy, ginger, pyridoxine, antihistamines, and metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit than placebo. For moderate symptoms, pyridoxine-doxylamine, promethazine, and metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit than placebo. Ondansetron was associated with improvement for a range of symptom severity. Corticosteroids may be associated with benefit in severe cases. Overall the quality of evidence was low.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnostic testing — For patients with otherwise unremarkable history and examination, skin or in vitro testing for IgE to inhalants or foods and/or extensive laboratory testing are not recommended. Targeted laboratory testing based on clinical suspicion is appropriate, and limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes. Limited laboratory testing includes a CBC with differential, sedimentation rate, and/or C-reactive protein, liver enzyme, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement, and in such patients limited laboratory testing might be appropriate to identify infrequent or rare causes or provide "reassurance value". Serology to diagnose underlying autoimmune diseases is not warranted in the initial evaluation without additional suggestive features, and routine testing for thyroid autoantibodies is not recommended. Evidence does not support testing for Helicobacter pylori infection or celiac disease in otherwise unremarkable patients, and there are no convincing data that treatment based on such abnormal test results leads to improvement or change in the course of CU. Routine laboratory testing in typical CU rarely yields clinically significant findings, screening for thyroid disease is of low yield without symptoms or history, and increased anti-thyroglobulin or antithyroid antibodies in euthyroid subjects are commonly detected although the clinical implications are unclear.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum induced refeeding syndrome causes blood cell destruction: a case report and literature review [^113krsd1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year old woman, gravida 3, para 2, presented in the 14 4/7 weeks of pregnancy. The current pregnancy was natural conception. She had a history of HG in the first pregnancy. During the current pregnancy, she had been complaining of severe nausea and vomiting for more than a month. In the past 2 weeks, the symptoms became even worse, and she had been unable to eat and drink normally.

Since Jan.7th 2019, the patient was sent to several hospitals successively for treatments. Laboratory tests drawn at the local hospitals (Fig. 1; Table 1) were notable for electrolyte abnormalities, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, as well as the progressive descent of platelet (PLT) count and hemoglobin (HGB) level. The patient accepted fluid replacement therapy, anti-vomiting therapy and nutritional supplement therapy in the local hospitals. However, the treatments did not work, and the disease continued on its course. Apart from nausea and vomiting, new symptoms occurred suddenly, such as decreased mobility, loss of interest, sleeping too much, apathy, dysarthria, blurred vision, and visual hallucination. Two days later, the patient's mental state changed from apathy to excitation and appeared psychological changes. On Jan. 8th, the fetal death was diagnosed by obstetric ultrasound.

### Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [^115mhRdR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extensive and the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose. Treatment of nausea and vomiting also can be unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment approaches are addressed.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111xmwP9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C): Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be beneficial to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. Intravenous hydration should be used for the patient who cannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or if clinical signs of dehydration are present. Correction of ketosis and vitamin deficiency should be strongly considered. Dextrose and vitamins should be included in the therapy when prolonged vomiting is present, and thiamine should be administered before dextrose infusion to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy. Enteral tube feeding (nasogastric or nasoduodenal) should be initiated as the first-line treatment to provide nutritional support to the woman with hyperemesis gravidarum who is not responsive to medical therapy and cannot maintain her weight. Peripherally inserted central catheters should not be used routinely in women with hyperemesis gravidarum given the significant complications associated with this intervention. Peripherally inserted central catheters should be utilized only as a last resort in the management of a woman with hyperemesis gravidarum because of the potential of severe maternal morbidity.

### Recurrence of hyperemesis gravidarum across generations: population based cohort study [^113P7F4N]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hyperemesis gravidarum (hyperemesis) is defined as excessive nausea and vomiting in pregnancy starting before the 22nd week of gestation, which might lead to nutritional deficiencies and weight loss. Hyperemesis occurs in 0.5–2.0% of pregnancies and is the most common cause of admission to hospital in early pregnancy. It is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight and preterm birth. The aetiology is unknown. A study using the medical birth registry of Norway found that the risk of hyperemesis in a woman's second pregnancy was 15.2% if hyperemesis had occurred in the first, compared with only 0.7% if it had not occurred. For women with hyperemesis in the first pregnancy, the risk of hyperemesis in the second pregnancy was 10.9% after a change of partner, while it was 16.0% if the partner remained the same. These findings suggest that there might be a genetic aspect to hyperemesis, possibly involving both maternal and fetal genes, although environmental factors cannot be ruled out.

To extend our understanding of the aetiology of this condition we examined the risk of hyperemesis according to whether or not the women and men under study were born after pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis. In addition, we estimated the risk of hyperemesis in women born after pregnancies not complicated by hyperemesis but where their mothers had hyperemesis in a previous or later pregnancy.

### Up-front endoscopy maximizes cost-effectiveness and cost-satisfaction in uninvestigated dyspepsia [^117T94Zf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Practice guidelines promote a routine noninvasive, non-endoscopic initial approach to investigating dyspepsia without alarm features in young patients, yet many patients undergo prompt upper endoscopy. We aimed to assess tradeoffs among costs, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes to inform discrepancy between guidelines and practice.

Methods

We constructed a decision-analytic model and performed cost-effectiveness/cost-satisfaction analysis over a 1-year time horizon on patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia without alarm features referred to gastroenterology. A RAND/UCLA expert panel informed model design. Four competing diagnostic/management strategies were evaluated: prompt endoscopy, testing for Helicobacter pylori and eradicating if present (test-and-treat), testing for H pylori and performing endoscopy if present (test-and-scope), and empiric acid suppression. Outcomes were derived from systematic reviews of clinical trials. Costs were informed by prospective observational cohort studies and national commercial/federal cost databases. Health gains were represented using quality-adjusted life years.

Results

From the patient perspective, costs and outcomes were similar for all strategies (maximum out-of-pocket difference of $30 and < 0.01 quality-adjusted life years gained/year regardless of strategy). Prompt endoscopy maximized cost-satisfaction and health system reimbursement. Test-and-scope maximized cost-effectiveness from insurer and patient perspectives. Results remained robust on multiple one-way sensitivity analyses on model inputs and across most willingness-to-pay thresholds.

Conclusions

Noninvasive management strategies appear to result in inferior cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction outcomes compared with strategies promoting up-front endoscopy. Therefore, additional studies are needed to evaluate the drivers of patient satisfaction to facilitate inclusion in value-based healthcare transformation efforts.

Severity has been categorized by daily duration and frequency, assessing "the duration of nausea and vomiting each day (from less than 1 hour in mild cases to more than 6 hours in severe cases)" and "the amount of vomiting and retching per day (up to two times for mild and moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and more than five times in severe cases)". A validated "pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea (PUQE) assesses the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy during the first trimester", and "scores from the PUQE index are associated with quality of life measurements", supporting clinical utility. Regarding timing of care, "Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be beneficial to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum". For hyperemesis gravidarum, "No single accepted definition of hyperemesis gravidarum exists", it "is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion", and commonly cited criteria include "persistent vomiting", "usually large ketonuria", and weight loss "most often at least 5% of prepregnancy weight"; epidemiologically, it "appears to represent the extreme end of the spectrum of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy".

### Helicobacter pylori infection and the occurrence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy [^1173EwC5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the possible role of Helicobacter pylori infection in the occurrence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy in a large group of mothers after delivery.

Study Design

Between November 2000 and November 2001, mothers were recruited after delivery at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the University of Ulm. Present H pylori infection was determined by (13)C-urea breath test. Associations between gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy (sickness, vomiting, increased saliva production, heartburn) and H pylori infection were quantified by crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% CI.

Results

Twenty-three percent of the 898 mothers had a current H pylori infection. Eighty-four percent of the mothers reported at least one of the evaluated gastrointestinal symptoms, and 30% of the mothers reported at least one physician visit because of the severity of these symptoms. None of the analyzed gastrointestinal symptoms showed an association to a current H pylori infection after an adjustment for the covariates, even after a virulence marker of H pylori infection was taken into account.

Conclusion

This study does not support an involvement of H pylori infection in the generation of gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy.

### Differential diagnosis and… [^113KED1U]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy begins between the fourth and seventh week after the last menstrual period in 80 percent of pregnant women and resolves by the 20th week of gestation in all but 10 percent of these women. 1 The condition has been shown to be more common in urban women than in rural women. 2 One study 3 identified increased risk in housewives and decreased risk in "white collar" or professional white women who consumed alcohol before conception, and in women over 35 years of age with a history of infertility. Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting, affects one in 200 pregnant women. 4 Although the definition of this condition has not been standardized, accepted clinical features include persistent vomiting, dehydration, ketosis, electrolyte disturbances, and weight loss.

Multiple gestation, gestational trophoblastic disease, triploidy, trisomy 21 syndrome, and hydrops fetalis have been associated with an increased incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum.
5. Etiology and Pathophysiology The etiology of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy remains unknown, but a number of possible causes have been investigated. Although many physicians were taught that psychologic factors are responsible for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum, few data support this theory. In one well-known study. Gastrointestinal tract dysfunction also has been suggested as a cause of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In one study 6 in which progesterone was prescribed to nonpregnant women, resultant nausea and vomiting suggested that delayed gastric motility caused by progesterone may be responsible for the condition.

Another study 7 reviewed many potential gastrointestinal causes of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, including abnormalities of gastric electrical rhythm. Many reports have suggested that hormones may cause nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. In one comparative study. 8 women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were found to have elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin; however, another study 9 did not support this finding. Some studies have shown elevated estrogen levels in women with this condition; others have not. 7 Hence, the roles of hCG and estrogen remain controversial. Many pregnant women with hyperemesis have suppressed thyrotropin-stimulating hormone levels. Work is ongoing to elucidate the interaction of hCG and TSH in pregnant women with hyperemesis.
5. A recent study 10 suggested that chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori may play a role in hyperemesis gravidarum. In this study, 61.

8 percent of pregnant women with hyper-emesis were found to be positive for the H. pylori genome, compared with 27. 6 percent of pregnant women without hyperemesis. Differential Diagnosis and Evaluation A thorough history and a complete physical examination are important in the evaluation of pregnant women who present with persistent vomiting. Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy is usually a self-limited condition. When the condition is more severe, potentially serious causes need to be ruled out. 5 If nausea and vomiting begin after nine weeks of gestation, other causes should be investigated. If the findings of the history and physical examination suggest a specific cause, testing is directed toward confirming that cause. For example, the findings may suggest pyelonephritis, a common condition in pregnancy. Ultrasonography may be helpful in ruling out gallbladder, liver, and kidney disorders.

Differential diagnosis and thyroid evaluation in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — symptoms of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy manifest before 9 weeks of gestation in virtually all affected women, and when a patient experiences nausea and vomiting for the first time after 9 weeks of gestation, other conditions should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis. Findings not typical of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy include that abdominal pain or tenderness other than mild epigastric discomfort after retching is not a prominent characteristic of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, Fever and headache are not present in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, and an abnormal neurologic examination suggests a primary neurologic disorder as the cause of the nausea and vomiting. Thyroid-related clues include that a palpable goiter is not due to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and if a goiter is present, primary thyroid disease should be suspected; in a self-limited emesis disorder with no prior history of thyroid disease and no evidence of Graves disease (such as goiter), gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is favored and routine thyroid tests are not needed. In patients with hyperemesis gravidarum in whom thyroid function tests are obtained, results may demonstrate a hyperthyroxinemia or gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, this is generally limited to the first half of pregnancy and may be characterized by elevated free T4 and suppressed serum thyroid stimulating hormone, and the appropriate management of abnormal maternal thyroid tests attributable to gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, or hyperemesis gravidarum, or both, includes supportive therapy, and antithyroid drugs are not recommended. The etiology note states that the etiology of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is unknown.

### The association of Helicobacter pylori with adverse pregnancy outcomes in three European birth cohorts [^1151WWKX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori antigen-specific antibody responses and adverse pregnancy outcomes

No significant associations were revealed between antigen-specific seropositivity and single outcomes (additional file 8). When we distinguished seropositives according to the magnitude of antibody response, we identified higher odds of developing preeclampsia in those with higher antibody levels (above the median) to GroEL (OR: 3.12 95%CI:1.10–8.82, p-value: 0.03, p-value for trend: 0.04) and NapA (OR:4.09 95%CI: 1.40–11.93, p-value: 0.01, p-value for trend: 0.03) compared to seronegative women to the corresponding antigens (additional file 9). Regarding presentation of multiple complications, seropositivity to OMP was associated with higher odds of developing two or more complications including preeclampsia (OR: 2.12 95%CI:1.62–2.76, p-value: < 0.001), whereas inverse association was observed for seropositivity to HpaA (OR: 0.84 95%CI: 1.38–2.43) (additional file 10). Women with low levels of NapA were more likely to present multiple complications including preeclampsia (OR:1.14 95%IC: 1.01–1.96, p-value:0.04), and both high and low levels of GroEL were associated with the development of ≥ 2 complications (OR:2.34 95%CI: 1.71–3.19, p-value < 0.001 and OR: 1.85 (1.38–2.49), < 0.001 respectively) (additional file 11).

### Offspring of women with hyperemesis gravidarum are more likely to have cardiovascular abnormalities [^114Fi9w9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

This study included pregnant women who were hospitalized for HG in early pregnancy at our hospital and eventually delivered at our hospital and pregnant women without HG in early pregnancy who delivered at our hospital from January 2019-January 2020, and this study included 510 pregnant women who were hospitalized for HG of pregnancy at 6–10 weeks of gestation as well as 510 pregnant women without HG of pregnancy at 6–10 weeks of gestation as a control, and tracked the outcomes of the pregnancy, the obstetrical outcomes, and the follow up of all the enrolled women. In this retrospective study, we first selected women with HG according to the inclusion criteria, and then matched them according to age, BMI, and parity to select women without HG as a control group. Our cases of HG were characterized as "intractable nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with dehydration and starvation, clinically judged to require hospitalization for intravenous rehydration and antiemetic medication". All pregnant women were excluded if they had twin pregnancies, thyroid disorders, pre-eclampsia, renal disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, or gastrointestinal disorders during pregnancy. Basic clinical information, gestational conditions, and neonatal births were collected from all pregnant women, and all fetuses born were followed up by telephone 3 years later to inquire about the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. The pregnancy status included: early miscarriage rate: fetal arrest detected before 14 weeks of gestation, mid-term miscarriage rate: fetal arrest detected between 14 and 27 weeks of gestation, collection of ultrasound examination between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation to measure fetal head circumference, abdominal circumference, whether the four chambers of the heart were visible or not, and the rate of preterm and full-term labor. The birth of newborns, including newborns' birth weight, length, head circumference, abdominal circumference, appearance of deformities, and cardiac auscultation, and the follow up of all the births after 3 years: cardiovascular diseases occurrence. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, and all patients signed an informed consent form.

Figure 1
Flowchart of family-based Helicobacter pylori infection control and management. In clinical settings, visiting patients are questioned for symptoms and signs, and Helicobacter pylori infection status is screened by urease breath tests, serological tests or stool antigen tests. If the patient is H. pylori- positive, their family members are recommended to test for H. pylori using one or more of these methods. Family members usually include parents, spouses, children and others living in the same household. The infected patients and family members are advised to treat the infection based on individual condition and follow-up in 4 weeks. If patients or their family members are H. pylori -negative, routine follow-up and no treatment are required. For patients with endoscopy-confirmed gastric precancerous lesions such as atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia, H. pylori infection status should be tested, and if it is positive, eradication therapy should be offered and regular endoscopy surveillance should be performed regardless of H. pylori infection status.

Pediatric Helicobacter pylori — confirmation of eradication: We recommend that one of the following tests be used to determine whether H. pylori treatment was successful: (a) 13C-UBT and (b) a two-step monoclonal SAT. (Unchanged from 2017). This is a GRADE: strong recommendation with Quality of evidence: high and Agreement: 100%. Practice points state that the relief of symptoms is not an indicator for successful treatment and therefore all children treated for H. pylori should be assessed for treatment success with a reliable test; 13C-UBT and/or monoclonal SAT are the most reliable tests to be used to assess H. pylori eradication treatment; in case of complicated PUD, endoscopy-, and biopsy-based tests to confirm eradication are recommended in pediatric patients; the 13C-UBT may give false-positive results in children younger than 6 years of age; a two-step monoclonal SAT has better performance than the polyclonal SAT test or one-step immune-chromatographic stool test for H. pylori detection; rapid office-based stool tests should not be used due to lower performance than laboratory-based tests; and use of the 14C-UBT or breath ammonia test is not recommended in children.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^1175pAKJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 2: the urea breath test is the recommended noninvasive test for Helicobacter pylori. If the urea breath test is unavailable, the monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative noninvasive test if locally validated

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high.

For the UBT, the patient ingests a solution containing 13 C-labelled (or less commonly 14 C-labelled) urea. The urease enzyme produced by H. pylori in infected patients converts the labelled urea to ammonia and labelled carbon dioxide, which is detected in a breath sample. Bacterial antigens are present in the stool of individuals with active H. pylori infection. The stool antigen test is an immunoassay that detects these antigens in stool samples. Serological testing can detect IgG antibodies to H. pylori in the blood.

As the UBT is considered the most accurate noninvasive test for H. pylori with high sensitivity and specificity values, it is the recommended noninvasive test in the Irish Healthcare setting. Current European guidelines recommend citric acid as the test meal because it slows gastric emptying and increases the distribution of the substrate and the contact time with H. pylori urease. It is recommended that patients should fast in advance of the UBT.

For stool antigen testing, potential options include laboratory-based enzyme immunoassays and more recently rapid immunochromatography-based tests for point-of-care diagnosis. In relation to laboratory-based tests, mAb-based assays are superior to polyclonal-based tests. While studies evaluating rapid near-patient immunochromatography-based stool antigen tests are emerging, inferior performance compared to laboratory-based tests has been reported for primary H. pylori diagnosis. Therefore, the monoclonal stool antigen test is recommended over both polyclonal laboratory-based tests and rapid immunochromatography-based assays. The monoclonal stool antigen test is considered an acceptable alternative to the UBT and is an option in centres where the UBT is unavailable if the assay has been locally validated and is accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Board. Sample storage and transport procedures should be carefully considered when validating the monoclonal stool antigen test.

Serology is more commonly used for H. pylori screening. There are a number of serology kits available commercially with varying performances. Thus, any serological assay should be locally validated before use. When serology is used as a test-and-treat strategy, a positive test should be confirmed by either the UBT or monoclonal stool antigen test before initiating H. pylori eradication therapy.

Results and discussion

Majority of the patients with H. pylori infection were in the age range of 18–39 years, while H. felis and H. heilmannii positive patients did not show this distribution. (Table 1). There was no difference in the gender, ethnicity of patients, crowding index (CI) and source of water distribution among the patients with H. pylori and non- H. pylori infections (Table 1). All patients had abdominal pain with endoscopic gastritis as the predominant finding. The false positive and false negative results obtained with RUT were 15(36%) and 6(12%), respectively while with histology the false positive and false negative results obtained were 20(30%) and 10(11%), respectively (Table 1–2).

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^115bkLAv]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing PA: the commonest non-nutritional cause of vitamin B deficiency

Given how NICE guidelines are used in practice, we find that the guidelines lack specific advice on the clinical scenarios in which practitioners should suspect AIG and PA. While they recommend considering an anti-intrinsic factor autoantibody test if AIG is suspected, the guidelines do not adequately explain why general practitioners should suspect an autoimmune basis beyond typical gastrointestinal symptoms. The presentation of AIG is highly variable, and looking only for gastrointestinal symptoms is insufficient as these present only in the later stages or not at all in most patients. Intrinsic factor auto-antibodies (IF-Ab) perform poorly as a stand-alone diagnostic marker for PA. Although they are highly specific, they have low sensitivity and present in less than 50% of PA patients. The guidelines acknowledge that a negative IF-Ab test does not rule out AIG or PA, and they suggest additional investigations when clinical suspicion remains. They further state that these should include anti-gastric parietal cell antibody (PC-Ab) tests, gastrin level measurements, CobaSorb tests, or gastroscopy with gastric body biopsy. However, despite their high sensitivity, PC-Ab has poor specificity and is present in other autoimmune conditions (e.g. autoimmune thyroid diseases) and, more generally, in approximately 10% of the general population. However, the uncertainty with this is whether it presents a pre-vitamin B12 deficiency or PA, where individuals are not yet symptomatic or are symptomatic but have a serum B12 value within the normal reference ranges. Therefore, a positiveresult will not definitively indicate PA or AIG. Additionally, PC-Ab might test positive in cases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-related chronic superficial gastritis, further complicating its diagnostic utility.
