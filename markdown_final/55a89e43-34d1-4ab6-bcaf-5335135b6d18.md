## Question

Meningeoma with 1 cm increase in the size over 5 years, anything concerning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 1-cm increase in a meningioma over 5 years is "concerning". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how growth is best measured (linear versus volumetric) and what a 1-cm linear change actually means volumetrically. Then, I should compare that growth to the expected natural history of incidental WHO grade 1 meningiomas. Next, I will need to check risk modifiers such as absolute size, location, edema, T2 signal, calcification, and patient age. After that, I should consider thresholds used in research and practice (for example, what constitutes "progression") and whether the growth is accelerating. Finally, I will translate this into practical management: when continued surveillance is reasonable and when to consider intervention like stereotactic radiosurgery or surgery, along with imaging follow-up strategy and measurement reliability.

> Let me first confirm the measurement issue: linear diameter changes can be misleading because meningiomas are 3D, and volumetric assessment captures growth more accurately than planimetric (linear) measures, which tend to underestimate change; this has been shown in serial MRI studies where volumetric relative growth outpaces linear estimates, underscoring the importance of volumetrics for decision-making [^113KWaan] [^114Xd6fx].

> Wait, let me verify the volumetric implication of "1 cm over 5 years". Because volume scales with the cube of the radius, a 1-cm increase in maximum diameter can represent very different percentage volume changes depending on the starting size; for example, going from 2 to 3 cm increases volume by about 3.4-fold, whereas 3 to 4 cm is about 2.4-fold, meaning that the same linear delta can exceed common volumetric progression thresholds used in research, such as the RANO 40% volume increase benchmark for progression in residual meningioma, even though RANO was defined in the postoperative setting rather than for untreated incidental tumors [^114kV66Q].

> I should now compare this to the expected natural history. Many incidental WHO grade 1 meningiomas grow slowly, with typical absolute volumetric growth under 1 cm³/year and relative rates around 5–15% per year, and they often can be safely monitored; pooled analyses suggest that only a minority develop symptoms during active monitoring over several years, supporting watchful waiting in carefully selected patients [^114Xd6fx] [^111Eo91o] [^114HNhwj].

> Hold on, I should review risk modifiers that make the same "1 cm in 5 years" more or less worrisome. Faster growth and earlier progression have been associated with younger age (≤ 60), absence of calcification, T2 hyperintensity, and peri-tumoral edema; larger initial diameter also shortens time to progression, and an absolute size threshold around 3 cm correlates with a higher chance of becoming symptomatic during follow-up [^113oYNBX] [^111Eo91o] [^114Xd6fx].

> Let me consider location because it matters for both symptom risk and growth expectations. Cavernous sinus meningiomas can remain radiographically stable for long periods in many patients, though other series using volumetrics show meaningful growth rates, and petroclival tumors demonstrate variable growth patterns where acceleration can precede functional decline; thus, the same linear increase carries different clinical implications in eloquent skull base sites compared with convexity locations [^117LDUYA] [^114sHttV] [^115G85Qd].

> Next, I should review growth kinetics patterns. Many benign meningiomas follow sigmoid (logistic/Gompertzian) curves with slowing over time, and calcification is associated with linear or minimal growth; by contrast, atypical tumors tend to grow quasi-exponentially, so detecting acceleration versus deceleration helps contextualize whether a given interval change is part of a plateauing course or an inflection toward more aggressive behavior [^112HVNJf] [^115KwBQM].

> I need to ensure the observed 1-cm change is real and not measurement noise. Visual reads can miss subtle changes, whereas semi-automated volumetric methods improve sensitivity and reproducibility; additionally, surveillance using noncontrast T2-weighted sequences may reliably detect growth while avoiding gadolinium exposure in many cases, although institutional protocols differ and complex skull base tumors may still benefit from contrast-enhanced assessment [^116SVqjX] [^113KWaan] [^111f5h5T].

> But wait, what if the relative growth rate is the real clinical signal? Systematic data suggest that tumors growing faster than about 10% per year are more likely to become symptomatic than those growing ≤ 10% per year, whereas slow linear increases (on the order of ~2 mm/year implied by 1 cm over 5 years) often fall within the expected range for indolent grade 1 biology, provided there are no concerning radiographic features or symptoms; I should double-check whether that 1-cm increase also pushed the tumor past size thresholds (for example, beyond 3 cm), introduced edema, or encroached on critical neurovascular structures before deciding how "concerning" it is [^115fBX9c] [^115BsT5m] [^111Eo91o].

> I will now examine management implications. If the tumor remains small to moderate in size, lacks edema, is calcified or T2 hypointense, shows no acceleration in growth, and the patient is asymptomatic, continued active monitoring with standardized volumetric measurements is reasonable; conversely, if the tumor is large, accelerating, symptomatic, or at a high-risk location, stereotactic radiosurgery offers high local control with low morbidity for putative grade 1 lesions, and surgery is favored when there is mass effect, edema, or a need for tissue diagnosis to rule out higher grade biology [^113dM9gw] [^112yNj6G] [^117TANFa] [^111Bsy8L].

> Let me verify follow-up cadence. Most incidental meningioma progression that prompts action occurs within the first 3–5 years, so initial surveillance at 6–12 months and then annually for several years is typical, with spacing out thereafter if stability is confirmed; postoperative contexts differ, where conditional recurrence-free survival curves guide longer-term imaging, but for untreated incidental tumors, individualized intervals should reflect risk features and any changes in growth rate or symptoms [^114HNhwj] [^112Jajtk] [^111wiQpf].

> Bottom line, after reconsidering all the above: a 1-cm increase over 5 years is not inherently alarming if volumetrics, absolute size, imaging features, location, and clinical status point to indolent behavior, but it becomes concerning when accompanied by risk features (for example, size ≥ 3 cm, edema, T2 hyperintensity, lack of calcification, skull base eloquence), demonstrable acceleration, or new symptoms; careful confirmation with consistent volumetric methods and context-aware follow-up or timely intervention is the safest, evidence-aligned approach [^113oYNBX] [^111Eo91o] [^113KWaan] [^113dM9gw].

A 1 cm increase in meningioma size over 5 years is **not inherently concerning** if the tumor remains asymptomatic [^114HNhwj] and lacks high-risk imaging features. This growth rate is within the typical range for WHO grade I meningiomas [^113KWaan], and most can be managed with continued observation unless new symptoms, peritumoral edema, or mass effect develop [^111Eo91o]. Intervention is indicated if the tumor becomes **symptomatic** [^111Bsy8L], shows **rapid growth (> 2 mm/year)**, or exhibits **concerning imaging features** such as edema, bone invasion, or proximity to critical structures.

---

## Typical growth rates and patterns

- **Growth rates**: Most meningiomas grow slowly, with mean linear growth rates of 1–2 mm/year and volumetric rates of 5–10%/year.
- **Growth patterns**: Benign meningiomas often show linear or plateauing growth [^112HVNJf], while atypical/anaplastic tumors may grow exponentially [^115KwBQM].
- **Stability**: Many meningiomas remain stable or grow minimally over years [^114HNhwj] [^117LDUYA].

---

## Clinical significance of a 1 cm increase over 5 years

- **Annual growth**: A 1 cm increase over 5 years equals ~2 mm/year [^113KWaan], within the typical range for benign meningiomas [^115fBX9c].
- **Risk factors**: Younger age, absence of calcification, T2 hyperintensity, and edema are associated with faster growth [^113oYNBX] and shorter time to progression [^116p7XQF].
- **Symptom risk**: Larger initial size (> 25 mm) [^113oYNBX] and absence of calcification increase the risk of symptom development.

---

## Imaging features and clinical symptoms of concern

| **Imaging features** | **Clinical symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Peritumoral edema [^111Eo91o] | New-onset seizures [^115BsT5m] |
| Bone invasion [^111G9gWK] | Focal neurological deficits [^115BsT5m] |
| Rapid growth (> 2 mm/year) | Cognitive decline |
| Proximity to critical structures (optic nerve, brainstem) [^115BsT5m] | Headaches [^114Xd6fx] |
| High T2 signal intensity [^116p7XQF] | Visual disturbances [^117LDUYA] |

---

## Recommended management strategies

- **Observation**: Appropriate for asymptomatic tumors with slow growth and no concerning features [^114HNhwj] [^112Jajtk].
- **Surgery**: Indicated for symptomatic tumors, rapid growth, or critical location [^111Bsy8L] [^115BsT5m].
- **Radiotherapy**: Consider for residual/recurrent tumors or when surgery is high risk [^114ewiou] [^113dM9gw].

---

## Prognostic implications

Slow growth in benign meningiomas generally indicates a **favorable prognosis** [^113KWaan] [^111wiQpf]. In contrast, atypical or anaplastic tumors often grow faster and carry **higher recurrence rates and poorer outcomes** [^114kF3fg] [^112RHUSX]. Prognosis and management also depend on patient factors — such as age, comorbidities, and tumor location [^113oYNBX] [^113VCMAr].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring recommendations

Regular **MRI** [^111f5h5T] is recommended every **6–12 months** initially, then annually if stable. Clinical assessment should include periodic neurological examinations to detect new symptoms [^115BsT5m]. Follow-up should be individualized based on tumor characteristics and patient factors [^111wiQpf].

---

A 1 cm increase in meningioma size over 5 years is **generally not concerning** [^114HNhwj] if asymptomatic and without high-risk features. Continued observation is appropriate unless symptoms, rapid growth, or concerning imaging features develop [^113oYNBX].

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^111Eo91o]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Incidental discovery accounts for 30% of newly diagnosed intracranial meningiomas, yet there is no consensus on their optimal management. This review aimed to evaluate the outcomes of different management strategies for these tumors.

- **Methods**: Using established systematic review methods, six databases were scanned up to September 2017. Pooled event proportions were estimated using a random effects model. Meta-regression of prognostic factors was performed using individual patient data.

- **Results**: Twenty studies (2130 patients) were included. Initial management strategies at diagnosis were: surgery (27.3%), stereotactic radiosurgery (22.0%), and active monitoring (50.7%) with a weighted mean follow-up of 49.5 months (SD = 29.3). The definition of meningioma growth and monitoring regimens varied widely, impeding relevant meta-analysis. The pooled risk of symptom development in patients actively monitored was 8.1% (95% CI 2.7–16.1). Associated factors were peritumoral edema (OR 8.72 [95% CI 0.35–14.90]) and meningioma diameter ≥ 3 cm (OR 34.90 [95% CI 5.17–160.40]). The pooled proportion of intervention following a duration of active monitoring was 24.8% (95% CI 7.5–48.0). Weighted mean time-to-intervention was 24.8 months (SD = 18.2). The pooled risks of morbidity following surgery and radiosurgery, accounting for cross-over, were 11.8% (95% CI 3.7–23.5) and 32.0% (95% CI 10.6–70.5) respectively. The pooled proportion of operated meningioma being WHO grade I was 94.0% (95% CI 88.2–97.9).

- **Conclusion**: The management of incidental meningioma varies widely. Most patients who are clinically monitored do not require immediate intervention.

### Growth rate of non-operated meningiomas [^113KWaan]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are dural-based brain tumors that are typically histologically benign. Some meningiomas grow slowly or seemingly not at all with planimetric measurement. Volumetric measurement may be more accurate because tumors may grow in different directions than the planimetric axes.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one patients (with 22 tumors) had serial MRI brain scans available for review. We reviewed the charts and measured tumor dimensions on the MRI scans. Relative growth rates were calculated for volume and maximum initial diameter using published formulas. Patient demographics, tumor location, and special radiologic characteristics (calcification, T2 hypointensity, dural tail, mass effect, and midline shift) were compared to the volumetric growth rate.

- **Results**: Patients included 17 females and 4 males; age at diagnosis ranged from 36 to 74 years, with a mean of 61 years. Follow-up lasted from 2.08 to 10.83 years, averaging 3.64 years. Most tumors were located in the convexity (27.27%), sphenoid wing (27.27%), or cerebellopontine angle (13.04%). Two meningiomas (9.09%) demonstrated no growth. The mean relative volumetric growth rate was 5.82% per year, and planimetric growth rate was 2.00% per year (difference of 3.82% per year, p-value < 0.0001). Convexity location had a near significant association with slower relative volumetric growth. There were no significant associations between other tumor locations, age, gender, or radiologic characteristics and volumetric growth.

- **Conclusions**: The mean volumetric growth rate was significantly greater than the planimetric growth rate, suggesting that volumetric measurement conveys more information.

### The natural history of intracranial meningiomas [^113oYNBX]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the increased detection of incidental or small meningiomas, the lesion's natural history is largely unknown.

- **Object**: Despite the increased detection of incidental or small meningiomas, the lesion's natural history is largely unknown.

- **Methods**: One year or longer of follow-up was conducted in 244 patients with 273 meningiomas managed conservatively by a single surgeon between 2003 and 2008. Data were stratified according to age, sex, tumor location, symptoms, initial tumor diameter, calcification, MR imaging intensity, and edema. Linear tumor growth was defined as a 2-mm or larger increase in the maximum diameter in any direction of the tumor. Volumetric analysis (ImageJ version 1.43) was also conducted in 154 of 273 meningiomas for which complete radiological data were available in the form of DICOM files throughout the follow-up period. A volume increase greater than 8.2% was regarded as significant because the preliminary volumetry based on 20 randomly selected meningiomas showed that the average SD was 4.1%.

- **Results**: Linear growth was observed in 120 tumors (44.0%) with a mean follow-up of 3.8 years. Factors related to tumor growth were age of 60 or younger (p = 0.0004), absence of calcification (p = 0.027), MR imaging T2 signal hyperintensity (p = 0.021), and edema (p = 0.018). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that age 60 or younger (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.05–2.30, p = 0.026), initial tumor diameter greater than 25 mm (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.44–3.38, p = 0.0004), and the absence of calcification (HR 4.57, 95% CI 2.69–8.20, p < 0.0001) were factors associated with a short time to progression. Volumetric growth was seen in 74.

### Growth curve analysis of asymptomatic and symptomatic meningiomas [^112HVNJf]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Meningiomas sometimes stop growing after attaining a large size. Commonly used exponential growth models do not reflect this phenomenon. We attempted to find the best curve to simulate their growth. Fifty-two patients with meningioma were followed up for 3.1 to 21.7 years (mean of 7.5 years) with four or more imaging studies each. Thirty-one patients had asymptomatic tumors, while the remaining 21 with residual or recurrent tumors were followed up after surgery.

- **Time-volume curve analysis**: Time-volume curves for each tumor were plotted. Nonlinear regression analyses were performed against power, exponential, logistic, and Gompertzian curves. Time-volume curves corresponded to the Gompertzian and logistic growth curves better than to power or exponential curves. When simulating time-volume curves with Gompertzian curves, the majority of benign meningiomas began to slow their growth before the patient age of 80 years.

- **Inflection points**: Twenty-three of 31 asymptomatic meningiomas had already passed the inflection point before diagnosis, whereas this occurred less frequently in symptomatic tumors. All six atypical meningiomas continued to grow quasi-exponentially. Sigmoid curves that approach a plateau were better descriptors of the growth of benign meningiomas than curves of unlimited growth. However, atypical meningiomas were unlikely to slow their growth.

### Noncontrast imaging for the surveillance of treated and untreated meningiomas [^111f5h5T]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with meningiomas require serial MRI for surveillance of tumor size and growth rate. The cost and resource requirements for contrast-enhanced MRI include intravenous cannulation, the contrast agent, risk of adverse reaction, and the time needed to acquire, review, and report the additional sequences. With repeated doses, gadolinium is known to accumulate in neural tissues. The authors compared the correlation and accuracy of axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) sequences alone for assessing tumor growth, dimensions, and dural venous sinus invasion compared with the clinical practice of assessing both contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) and T2WI sequences.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively identified 136 adult patients (65 patients with treated and 71 patients with untreated meningiomas) with two MRI scans obtained at least six months apart. For each patient, the two CE-T1WI sequences separated by time were paired, as were the two T2WI sequences, and assessed independently. The paired scans were assessed by a neuroradiologist and advanced radiology trainee blinded to clinical data. Tumor location, dimensions, growth, and venous invasion were evaluated. Peritumoral edema was assessed on T2WI only. Agreement between assessments on both CE-T1WI and T2WI sequences compared with T2WI alone was evaluated using Cohen's kappa (κ), the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots.

- **Results**: Growth was detected in 36 tumors on T2WI compared with 39 when both CE-T1WI and T2WI were assessed.

### Gamma knife surgery for the treatment of patients with asymptomatic meningiomas [^113rzNrV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Increasingly, meningiomas are detected incidentally, prior to symptom development. While these lesions are traditionally managed conservatively until symptoms develop or lesion growth occurs, it is conceivable that patients at high risk for symptom development may benefit from earlier intervention prior to the appearance of symptoms. However, little research has been performed to determine whether Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) can alter the rate of symptom development in such patients.

- **Methods**: A retrospective case study was performed by screening the University of Virginia GKS database for patients treated for asymptomatic meningiomas. From the patients' medical records, pertinent demographic and treatment information was obtained. Yearly follow-up MRI had been performed to assess tumor control and detect signs of radiation-induced injury. Clinical follow-up via neurological examination had been performed to assess symptom development.

- **Results**: Forty-two patients, 33 females (78.6%) and 9 males (21.4%), with 42 asymptomatic meningiomas were included in the analysis. The median age at GKS was 53 years. The most common lesion location was the cerebral convexities (10 lesions [23.8%]), and the median lesion size was 4.0 ml. The median duration of imaging and clinical follow-ups was 59 and 76 months, respectively. During the follow-up period, 1 tumor (2.4%) increased in size, 2 patients (4.8%) demonstrated symptoms, and 1 patient (2.4%) exhibited possible signs of radiation-induced injury. Thus, actuarial tumor control rates were 100%, 95.7%, and 95.7% for 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

### Resected who grade I meningioma and predictors of local control [^112AqjM1]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite optimal surgical resection, meningiomas may recur, with increasing grade and the degree of resection being predictive of risk. We hypothesize that an increasing Ki67 correlates with a higher risk of recurrence in resected WHO grade I meningiomas.

- **Methods**: The study population consisted of patients with resected WHO grade 1 meningiomas in locations outside of the base of skull. Digitally scanned slides stained for Ki67 were analyzed using automatic image analysis software in a standardized fashion.

- **Results**: Recurrence was observed in 53 (17.7%) of cases with a median follow-up time of 25.8 months. Ki67 ranged from 0 to 30%. Median Ki67 was 5.1% for patients with recurrence and 3.5% for patients without recurrence. In unadjusted analyses, high Ki-67 (≥ 5% vs. < 5%) was associated with over a twofold increased risk of recurrence (13.1% vs. 27% respectively; HR 2.1731; 95% CI [1.2534, 3.764]; p = 0.006). After adjusting for patient or tumor characteristics, elevated Ki-67 remained significantly correlated with recurrence. Grade 4 Simpson resection was noted in 71 (23.7%) of patients and was associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrence (HR 2.56; 95% CI [1.41, 4.6364]; p = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: WHO grade 1 meningiomas exhibit a significant rate of recurrence following resection. While Ki-67 is not part of the WHO grading criteria of meningiomas, a value greater than 5% is an independent predictor for increased risk of local recurrence following surgical resection.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^116p7XQF]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Comparisons to published systematic reviews

One review assessed the risk factors for development of new or worsened symptoms during follow-up of untreated meningiomas, concluding that patients with bigger meningiomas are more likely to become symptomatic; a finding which we replicated. Slow meningioma growth was associated with low T2 signal and non-calcification in previous reviews, which attempted a meta-analysis of the presence or absence of meningioma growth during follow-up. Our analysis demonstrated that high T2 signal and non-calcification were associated with symptom development and intervention respectively, which may have been due to meningioma growth.

- **Limitations**: Studies included were retrospective of poor quality, evident in the highly heterogeneous meta-analyses and the overall very low level of evidence contributing to each primary outcome. These studies also spanned a 27-year period during which major advances in neurosurgical technology and management guidelines occurred, introducing confounding variables into our analysis. Duration of follow-up for patients subject to active monitoring was not available in all studies, and the weighted duration of ~5 years indicates that the long-term prognosis of incidental meningioma remains unclear. Morbidity could not be stratified based on intervention time — immediate and delayed — preventing a detailed analysis of post-treatment outcomes. Moreover, severity could not be graded, thus complications were grouped together, preventing appropriate estimation of the risk of serious morbidity.

### Natural history of petroclival meningiomas [^115G85Qd]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the natural history of petroclival meningiomas through a cooperative retrospective study of 21 conservatively treated patients.

- **Methods**: All patients had petroclival meningiomas that were observed for at least 4 years with regular clinical and radiological control examinations. The follow-up periods ranged from 48 to 120 months (mean, 82 months; median, 85 months). Functional evaluations were performed using the Karnofsky index, and individual growth curves and rates were defined.

- **Results**: Age, sex distributions, and presenting symptoms were comparable to those of other studies. During follow-up monitoring, radiological tumor growth was observed in 76% of the cases. Among the growing tumors, 63% were associated with functional deterioration. We performed statistical analyses of demographic features, radiological findings, and functional deterioration. Severe functional deterioration was significantly associated with infratentorial growth and increased growth rates. A change in growth pattern often preceded functional deterioration.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides a better understanding of the natural course of petroclival meningiomas. The growth patterns of these tumors are unpredictable and variable. The exact factors influencing growth remain unclear. This study can contribute to the optimization of individual management of these tumors.

### Indications for surgery in patients with asymptomatic meningiomas based on an extensive experience [^111Bsy8L]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the indications for surgery in patients harboring asymptomatic meningiomas, the authors retrospectively analyzed the natural course and surgical outcome of asymptomatic meningiomas and compared these to the natural course and surgical outcome of symptomatic meningiomas.

- **Methods**: Between 1989 and 2003, 1,434 patients harboring meningiomas, who were treated in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, were enrolled in this study. Six hundred and three patients had asymptomatic lesions, and eight hundred and thirty-one had symptomatic ones. The authors analyzed the sizes of the lesions at detection, their growth over time, and any appearances of symptoms associated with previously asymptomatic meningiomas. The surgery-related morbidity rates associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic meningiomas arising at different locations were then compared. Of the 603 asymptomatic meningiomas, 351 (58.2%) were treated conservatively. Tumor growth was observed in 25 (37.3%) of 67 patients who participated in follow-up for longer than five years, and symptoms developed in 11 (16.4%) of the 67 patients over a mean follow-up period of 3.9 years. Among the 213 patients with surgically treated asymptomatic meningiomas, the morbidity rate was 4.4% in patients younger than 70 years of age and 9.4% in those 70 years of age or older. Although the total morbidity rate was lower in patients with asymptomatic lesions than in those with symptomatic ones, it exceeded 6% in patients whose asymptomatic tumors were located at the convexity or falx.

### Volumetric growth and growth curve analysis of residual intracranial meningioma [^114kV66Q]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

After meningioma surgery, approximately 1 in 3 patients will have residual tumors that require ongoing imaging surveillance. The precise volumetric growth rates of these tumors are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the volumetric growth rates of residual meningioma, their growth trajectory, and the factors associated with progression.

Patients with residual meningioma identified at a tertiary neurosurgery center between 2004 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor volume was measured using manual segmentation, after surgery and at every follow-up MRI scan. Growth rates were ascertained using a linear mixed-effects model and nonlinear regression analysis of growth trajectories. Progression was defined according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (40% volume increase).

There were 236 patients with residual meningioma. One hundred and thirty-two patients (56.0%) progressed according to the RANO criteria, with 86 patients being conservatively managed (65.2%) after progression. Thirteen patients (5.5%) developed clinical progression. Over a median follow-up of 5.3 years (interquartile range 3.5–8.6 years), the absolute growth rate was 0.11 cm³ per year and the relative growth rate was 4.3% per year. Factors associated with residual meningioma progression in multivariable Cox regression analysis were skull base location (hazard ratio [HR] 1.60, 95% CI 1.02–2.50) and increasing Ki-67 index (HR 3.43, 95% CI 1.19–9.90). Most meningiomas exhibited exponential and logistic growth patterns (median R² value 0.84, 95% CI 0.60–0.90).

### Adjuvant radiation therapy versus surveillance after surgical resection of atypical meningiomas [^111G9gWK]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2021). Low credibility.

The optimal timing of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in the management of atypical meningiomas remains controversial. We compared the outcomes of atypical meningiomas managed with upfront adjuvant RT versus postoperative surveillance.

- **Methods and materials**: Patients with intracranial atypical meningiomas who underwent resection between 2000 and 2015 at a single institution were identified. Patients receiving adjuvant RT (n = 51), defined as RT within the first year of surgery before tumor progression/recurrence (P/R), were compared with those undergoing initial surveillance (n = 179). The primary endpoints were radiographic evidence of P/R and time to P/R from surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 230 patients were identified. Fifty-one (22%) patients received upfront adjuvant RT, and 179 (78%) underwent surveillance. Compared with the surveillance group, patients who received adjuvant RT had larger tumors (5.2 cm vs. 4.6 cm; p = 0.04), were more likely to have undergone subtotal resection (65% vs. 26%; P < .01), and more often had bone invasion (18% vs. 7%; p = 0.02). On multivariable analysis, receipt of adjuvant RT was associated with a lower risk of P/R compared with surveillance (hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.41; P < .01). Patients who initially underwent surveillance and then received salvage RT at time of P/R had a shorter median time to local progression after RT compared with patients who developed local P/R after upfront adjuvant RT (19 vs. 64 months, respectively; P < .01).

Upfront adjuvant RT was associated with improved local control.

### Prognostic characterization of higher-grade meningiomas: A histopathological score to predict progression and outcome [^114kF3fg]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the CNS, with an incidence of 8.14 per 100,000 population according to the latest Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria, a tumor grade between I and III is assigned based upon the assessment of specific morphological features. The diagnosis of atypical grade II meningioma is defined by an increased mitotic count (≥ 4/10 high-power fields [HPF]) or histological evidence of brain invasion, or the presence of 3 out of 5 characteristics: prominent nucleoli, sheeting, hypercellularity, small cells with a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, and foci of spontaneous necrosis. Grade III anaplastic meningiomas are defined by elevated mitotic activity (≥ 20/HPF) or overtly malignant cytology. Additionally, some histotypes harbor an independent grading implication. Overall, higher-grade meningiomas (II and III) represent a significant subgroup of patients, amounting to 25% and 5% of all meningiomas, respectively.

Surgical resection is considered the first-line option for patients needing treatment, and gross total resection should be achieved whenever possible. Patient observation should be limited to selected cases, such as small asymptomatic meningiomas. Although most grade I meningiomas are cured by resection alone, grade II and grade III tumors show high recurrence rates and may thus require adjuvant treatments. Adjuvant radiotherapy is usually advised for incompletely resected grade II and for all grade III meningiomas; however, this approach is not universally accepted.

### Incidence trends and survival analysis of atypical meningiomas: A population-based study from 2004 to 2018 [^112RHUSX]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Atypical meningiomas exhibit histologic and clinical features that are intermediate between benign and malignant meningiomas. The incidence of atypical meningiomas has not been thoroughly studied in light of changes in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme over time.

The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was utilized to obtain data from 2004 to 2018 for patients with all types of meningiomas, including atypical ones. Age-adjusted incidence rates were generated, and annual percent change (APC) in the incidence rates was calculated using joinpoint regression. Survival was analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.

A total of 4,476 patients diagnosed with meningioma were identified from the SEER 18 registries. The incidence of atypical meningioma increased at an APC of 5.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.4–7.8], significantly faster than the overall meningioma incidence, which rose at an APC of 2.5% (95% CI 1.8–3.1; p = 0.008). For atypical meningiomas, the 1, 3, 5, and 10-year survival rates were 91.9%, 81.3%, 68.8%, and 34.3%, respectively. Male sex, older age (≥ 60 years), and large tumor size (> 5 cm) were identified as independent risk factors for an unfavorable prognosis.

The incidence of atypical meningioma was observed to be increasing relative to all meningiomas. It is crucial to diligently monitor atypical meningioma incidence and mortality rates over time to determine if the observed upward trends persist. Continued efforts toward improving outcomes in patients with atypical meningiomas are warranted.

### The applicability of established clinical and histopathological risk factors for tumor recurrence during long-term postoperative care in meningioma patients [^111gH3XE]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Low credibility.

Beyond an event-free follow-up of at least 10 years, less than 1% of the included patients suffered tumor relapse, and none of the previously identified risk factors for prognosis remained correlated with recurrence. This might be explained by the low number of tumor relapses (N = 10) in this subcohort (N = 147); however, the lack of any correlation even in univariate analyses is remarkable. During visual inspection of the characteristics of patients suffering from late-onset recurrence, no variable is obvious. All recurrences were identified based on regular follow-up imaging, not due to new or progressive symptoms. Therefore, while high-grade histology and skull base tumor location should both be considered when attempting further characterization of follow-up intervals and duration beyond an event-free interval of 5 years, determination of the risk of long-term tumor relapse is hardly possible.

Although providing integrative analyses in a large series, the authors are aware of some limitations of the study. The retrospective nature and the single-center character of the study restrict general transferability. Due to the long inclusion period, details about adjuvant irradiation, especially indications, modality, and timing, were hardly available and could not be considered satisfactory for statistical analyses. However, considering the low number of patients receiving adjuvant irradiation (6%), the potential bias is supposed to be minor. Moreover, due to the large volume of the series, molecular characteristics were not detailed.

### Sporadic multiple intracranial meningioma does not infer worse patient outcomes: Results from a case control study [^115hWumK]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Sporadic multiple meningioma are uncommon. Population-based data suggest that these patients have reduced overall survival when compared to patients with solitary meningioma. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes in multiple and solitary meningioma.

- **Methods**: A single-center matched cohort study (2008–2018) was performed. Patients with synchronous multiple meningioma at presentation, with no history of prior intracranial radiation, hormone replacement therapy, or features of NF2-schwannomatosis, were included. Eligible patients were matched 1:1 to patients with solitary meningioma. Outcomes of interest were the occurrence of an intervention, recurrence, new meningioma development, and mortality.

- **Results**: Thirty-four patients harboring 76 meningioma at presentation were included. The mean age was 59.3 years (SD = 13.5). Thirty-one (91.2%) were female. The median number of meningioma per patient was 2 (range 2–6). Eighteen patients (52.9%) were symptomatic at presentation. The median overall follow-up was 80.6 months (IQR 44.1–99.6). Compared to patients with a sporadic meningioma, there was no difference in intervention rates (67.6% vs. 70.6%, P = 0.792). Eight patients (34.8%) with multiple meningioma had a WHO grade 2 meningioma compared to 7 (29.2%) with a solitary meningioma (P = 0.679). Median recurrence-free survival was 89 months (95% CI 76–104) with no difference between the two groups (P = 0.209). The mean overall survival was 132 months (95% CI 127–138) with no difference between the two groups (P = 0.860).

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^115DGpS1]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Radiation-induced meningioma (RIM) incidence is increasing alongside improved childhood cancer survival. No optimal management strategy consensus exists. This study aimed to delineate meningioma growth rates from tumor discovery and correlate these with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: Retrospective study of patients with a RIM, managed at a specialist tertiary neuroscience center (2007–2019). Tumor volume was measured from diagnosis and at subsequent interval scans. Meningioma growth rate was determined using a linear mixed-effects model. Clinical outcomes were correlated with growth rates, accounting for imaging and clinical prognostic factors.

- **Results**: Fifty-four patients (110 meningiomas) were included. The median duration of follow-up was 74 months (interquartile range [IQR], 41–102 months). Mean radiation dose was 41 Gy (standard deviation [SD] = 14.9) with a latency period of 34.4 years (SD = 13.7). The median absolute growth rate was 0.62 cm³/year, and the median relative growth rate was 72%/year. Forty meningiomas (between 27 patients) underwent surgical intervention following a median follow-up duration of 4 months (IQR 2–35). Operated RIMs were clinically aggressive, likely to be WHO grade 2 at first resection (43.6%) and to progress after surgery (41%). The median time to progression was 28 months (IQR 13–60.5). A larger meningioma at discovery was associated with growth (HR 1.2 [95% CI 1.0–1.5], P = 0.039) but not progression after surgery (HR 2.2 [95% CI 0.7–6.6], P = 0.181). Twenty-seven (50%) patients had multiple meningiomas by the end of the study.

- **Conclusion**: RIMs are growing at an alarming rate and require timely intervention for better management.

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^1142WFie]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Of the tumors with Simpson grade available (n = 38), the rate of complete surgical resection was 97.4% (Simpson grade 1, n = 23; Simpson grade 2, n = 13; and Simpson grade 3, n = 1). One patient had a Simpson grade 4 resection. Meningiomas were classified as WHO grade 1 (56.4%) and WHO grade 2 (43.6%) at the time of the first operation, with no correlation observed with radiation dose (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = 0.700). Eleven patients progressed (42.3%); seven were diagnosed on scheduled MRI follow-up, and four patients had new headache symptoms, which prompted an earlier MRI scan. The median time to progression was 28 months (IQR 13–60.5 months).

Five patients underwent a second operation for tumor progression. In all re-operated patients, complete surgical resection was achieved, and the pathology revealed WHO grade 2 (n = 3), WHO grade 1 (n = 1), and WHO grade 3 (n = 1) meningiomas. Radiation treatment (SRS and fRT) was administered following a period of active monitoring (n = 3), and following progression after surgery (n = 2). One patient who underwent SRS continued to demonstrate evidence of meningioma growth, required two operations, and showed malignant transformation from WHO grade 2 to WHO grade 3 at the last operation.

### Intermediate-risk meningioma: Initial outcomes from NRG Oncology RTOG 0539 [^114ewiou]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). High credibility.

This report presents the first clinical outcomes of NRG Oncology RTOG 0539, focusing on the primary endpoint, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), compared against a predefined historical control for intermediate-risk meningioma. The report also evaluates secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS), local failure, and prospectively scored adverse events (AEs).

NRG Oncology RTOG 0539 was a Phase II clinical trial that categorized meningioma patients into three prognostic groups with specific management strategies based on WHO grade, recurrence status, and resection extent. For the intermediate-risk group (Group 2), eligible patients had either newly diagnosed WHO Grade II meningioma treated with gross-total resection (GTR; Simpson Grades I-III) or reWHO Grade I meningioma with any extent of resection. Pathology and imaging underwent central review. All patients in this group received radiation therapy (RT), either intensity-modulated (IMRT) or 3D conformal (3DCRT), with a total dose of 54 Gy in 30 fractions.

The RT target volume encompassed the tumor bed and any areas with nodular enhancement (e.g. in patients with reWHO Grade I tumors), with a margin ranging from 8-mm to 15-mm, depending on tumor location and the setup reproducibility of the RT method. The primary endpoint was 3-year PFS. Results were compared with historical controls, which indicated a 3-year PFS of 70% following GTR alone and 90% with GTR plus RT. AEs were evaluated using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.

A total of fifty-six patients were enrolled in the intermediate-risk group. Of these, three were deemed ineligible, and one did not undergo RT. Overall, 52 patients received protocol therapy.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^1169HuQH]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Our analysis shows that there is a wide variety of measurements of meningioma growth. A uniform definition is therefore required for ongoing clinical management and future research. Furthermore, the heterogeneity in the frequency of radiological surveillance requires a unified strategy in order to better identify radiological progression and reduce the costs to healthcare. All studies in this review were retrospective in nature and single-institution. There is a clear need to define a validated core outcome set for data standardization and its subsequent use in prospective multi-center studies investigating the management and outcomes of incidental meningiomas.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery compared with active surveillance for asymptomatic, parafalcine, and parasagittal meningiomas: A matched cohort analysis from the IMPASSE study [^117TANFa]. Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

The optimal management of asymptomatic, presumed WHO grade I meningiomas remains controversial. This study aims to define the safety and efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with active surveillance for the management of patients with asymptomatic parafalcine/parasagittal (PFPS) meningiomas.

- **Methods**: Data from SRS-treated patients from 14 centers and patients managed conservatively for an asymptomatic, PFPS meningioma were compared. Local tumor control rate and new neurological deficits development were evaluated in both the active surveillance and the SRS-treated cohorts.

- **Results**: There were 173 SRS-treated patients and 98 patients managed conservatively in the unmatched cohorts. After matching for patient age and tumor volume, there were 98 patients in each cohort. The median radiological follow-up period was 43 months for the SRS cohort and 36 months for the active surveillance cohort (P = .04). The median clinical follow-up for the SRS and active surveillance cohorts were 44 and 36 months, respectively. Meningioma control was noted in all SRS-treated patients and in 61.2% of patients managed with active surveillance (P < .001). SRS-related neurological deficits occurred in 3.1% of the patients (n = 3), which were all transient. In the active surveillance cohort, 2% of patients (n = 2) developed neurological symptoms because of tumor progression (P = 1.0), resulting in death of 1 patient (1%).

- **Conclusion**: Up-front SRS affords superior radiological PFPS meningioma control as compared with active surveillance and may lower the risk of meningioma-related complications.

### Pan-cancer copy number analysis identifies optimized size thresholds and co-occurrence models for individualized risk stratification [^115hoE6f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Meningiomas encode size-dependent prognostic CNAs. A summary of the study design and experimental workflow for meningioma investigations, which were subsequently applied to TCGA datasets in this project, is provided in Fig. 1. To study CNA size-dependence and co-occurrence patterns in meningiomas, CNAs were defined in a previously described integrated cohort of 565 meningiomas with available DNA methylation profiling, RNA sequencing, and long-term clinical outcomes data. This study used iterative size thresholds ranging from 1–99% of each chromosome arm in 1% increments to analyze the prognostic significance of focal versus broad CNAs, both of which are common in meningiomas (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The prognostic significance of each CNA using each iterative size threshold was assessed using univariate Cox proportional hazards models for postoperative local freedom from recurrence (LFFR) or overall survival (OS). The optimal size thresholds for predicting either LFFR or OS were heterogeneous across individual chromosomes. These were measured using the area under the curve (AUC) of a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to predict 5-year LFFR or OS. These analyses identified loss of chromosomes 1p, 3q, 4p, 4q, 6p, 6q, 9p, 10q, 12q, 14q, 18q, and 22q, and gain of chromosome 1q as "size-dependent" CNAs (Fig. 2a). These "size-dependent" CNAs were defined as having (1) an AUC of at least 0.60 at any CNA threshold, (2) an AUC standard deviation of at least 0.01 across CNA size thresholds, and (3) a prevalence in at least 2.5% of samples when defined using the optimal size threshold.

### Natural history of cavernous sinus meningiomas [^117LDUYA]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Low credibility.

Meningiomas confined to the cavernous sinus (MCSs) are benign tumors. Due to the high risk of severe complications, the intracavernous surgical procedure was abandoned in favor of radiotherapy. However, the choice of treatment remains complicated because the natural history of this lesion has not yet been described.

- **Methods**: The authors studied the natural history of this lesion using a prospective series of 53 consecutive patients suffering from MCSs. The median follow-up duration was 10.2 years (range 2–25 years), from 1990 to 2016.

- **Results**: Patients ranged in age from 30 to 72 years (mean 53 years). The meningiomas were diagnosed by major symptoms (mainly oculomotor palsy and neuralgia experienced in 28 patients), minor symptoms (headache and intermittent diplopia in 15 patients), or incidental findings (10 patients). Simple symptomatic treatment (short courses of corticosteroids and carbamazepine) allowed patients to become asymptomatic in 19 (67.9%) of 28 cases experiencing major symptoms, and for 12 (80%) of 15 patients with initial minor symptoms (p < 0.0001). All patients with incidental findings remained asymptomatic. Forty-four (83%) of 53 MCSs did not show any significant growth and 42 (80%) of 53 patients were not symptomatic at the end of follow-up (p < 0.001). The radiographic progression-free survival rates (± SD) at 5, 10, and 20 years were 90% ± 4.2%, 82% ± 5.7%, and 70% ± 10.2%, respectively. Five patients (9.4%) with no evidence of any effect from the initial medical treatment desired additional conventional radiation therapy.

### Distribution of copy number alterations and impact of chromosome arm call thresholds for meningioma [^115tMAvR]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The arm-dependent differences in CNA sizes and arm call thresholds affected the ability of arm calls to predict meningioma recurrence, with hazard ratios varying across arm call thresholds. Despite this, the IG meningioma classification scheme remained relatively stable in predicting meningioma recurrence, especially amongst IG-1 and IG-3 meningiomas, highlighting the strengths of this grading system. These groups reflect tumors with rarer, small CNA changes or larger, more frequent CNA events, respectively, and therefore are less affected by varying CNA arm call thresholds. Absolute size-based thresholds (Mb) showed a similar effect, with no difference in time to recurrence for meningiomas classified as IG-1 or IG-3.

By contrast, performance across arm call thresholds for IG-2 meningiomas varied. These meningiomas represent a more heterogeneous group, which has proven challenging to categorize across histopathologic and molecular classification schemes. Some demonstrate aggressive, high-grade behavior while others remain more indolent, despite apparent similarities in pathological appearance or molecular composition. When a higher arm call threshold was applied (95%), this subset of meningiomas showed a shorter time to recurrence than IG-2 meningiomas identified at a lower arm call threshold (5%). This likely highlights the presence of a subset of IG-2 meningiomas with large CNA changes that behave more aggressively than IG-2 meningiomas with smaller CNA changes.

Assessing the predictive stability of the IG classifier across grades and timepoints showed a deterioration.

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^115vhxjX]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. First, the study was retrospective in design and not all tumor volumes were available to be comprehensively measured during the study period. The regression analyses were limited to tumors that underwent more than one follow-up MRI scan. Second, volumetric analysis was commenced upon tumor discovery, and therefore it is not possible to delineate for how long the tumor was present before being discovered, in addition to its growth rate before discovery. There was therefore no standardized diagnostic start point for the study. Third, the use of intervention as a study endpoint was limited by clinician and patient biases and might have impacted the results of the study. The tumor board in our center considers the clinical and radiological status of the meningioma, patient comorbidities, and performance status before discussion of the recommended and alternate management strategies with the patient to reach a shared-care decision. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, we were unable to assess the reasons behind continued monitoring in cases of symptomatic progression. It is reasonable that this was due to patient preference, personal and social circumstances, loss of driving license for at least six months in the UK, and risks of unemployment, post-surgical epilepsy, new neurological deficit, and death. Fourth, due to the lack of screening for late effects of cranial irradiation in our center, patients with more indolent radiation-induced meningiomas may have not been detected clinically, and thus our cohort may consist of more aggressive cases.

### Radiation therapy for atypical and anaplastic meningiomas: An overview of current results and controversial issues [^114gSBXP]. Neurosurgical review (2022). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors and account for more than one-third of all brain tumors. Based on local invasiveness and cellular features of atypia, meningiomas are histologically characterized as benign (grade 1), atypical (grade 2), or anaplastic (grade 3) tumors by the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme; accordingly, the proportion of meningiomas that have been classified as atypical and anaplastic is around 20–25% and 1–3%, respectively. For both classifications, surgical resection is the first choice of treatment; however, a significant proportion of tumors display more aggressive behavior associated with an approximately 6–8-fold increased risk of recurrence and a significantly higher risk of mortality due to tumor progression compared to benign meningiomas.

Beyond surgery, external beam radiation therapy (RT) is usually recommended to increase local control after resection of grade 2 and 3 tumors. The evidence supporting this treatment recommendation largely comes from systematic reviews, including retrospective series and two recent nonrandomized observational prospective trials conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG 0539) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 22042); however, several issues remain a matter of debate, including the timing of the treatment (early versus delayed postoperative RT), the optimal radiation technique, and types of radiation dose and fractionation. One of the most controversial topics is the superiority of early adjuvant approaches.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery versus active surveillance for asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas: An international, multicenter matched cohort study [^112yNj6G]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

The optimal management of asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas is not well defined. This study aims to compare the imaging and clinical outcomes of patients with asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas managed either with upfront stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or active surveillance.

This retrospective, multicenter study involved patients with asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas. The study endpoints included local tumor control and the development of new neurological deficits attributable to the tumor. Factors associated with tumor progression and neurological morbidity were also analyzed.

The combined unmatched cohort included 417 patients. Following propensity score matching for age, tumor volume, and follow-up, 110 patients remained in each cohort. Tumor control was achieved in 98.2% and 61.8% of the SRS and active surveillance cohorts, respectively. SRS was associated with superior local tumor control (p < 0.001, HR = 0.01, 95% CI = 0.002–0.13) compared to active surveillance. Three patients (2.7%) in the SRS cohort and six (5.5%) in the active surveillance cohort exhibited neurological deterioration. One (0.9%) patient in the SRS-treated and 11 (10%) patients in the active surveillance cohort required surgical management of their meningioma during follow-up.

SRS is associated with superior local control of asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas compared to active surveillance and does so with low morbidity rates. SRS should be offered as an alternative to active surveillance as the initial management of asymptomatic skull-based meningiomas.

### Serial volumetric assessment of the natural history and growth pattern of incidentally discovered meningiomas [^1175K3Qb]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Due to advances in neuroimaging and the increasing use of imaging to screen for brain disease ("brain checkups"), meningiomas are now often detected as an incidental finding. The natural history of these asymptomatic meningiomas remains unclear, however. In this study, the authors investigated the natural history and growth pattern of incidentally detected meningiomas using serial volumetric assessment and regression analysis.

- **Methods**: In 70 patients with incidentally discovered meningiomas who underwent follow-up for longer than 1 year, tumor volumes were calculated volumetrically at each follow-up visit, and tumor growth was determined. In patients with tumor growth, regression analysis was performed to determine the pattern of growth.

- **Results**: Forty-four tumors exhibited growth and 26 did not. In a regression analysis, 16 of the tumors that grew followed an exponential growth pattern, and 15 exhibited linear growth patterns. The presence of calcification was the only imaging characteristic that significantly distinguished the group with tumor growth from that without, although no radiological characteristics significantly distinguished the exponential growth group from the linear growth group. Two patients with obvious tumor growth underwent surgical removal, and the pathological specimens extracted showed a high proliferative potential.

- **Conclusions**: The authors found that incidentally discovered meningiomas did not always follow an exponential growth pattern but often exhibited more complex patterns of growth. Serial monitoring of tumor volumes and regression analysis are important for understanding these growth dynamics.

### A new metric for detecting change in slowly evolving brain tumors: Validation in meningioma patients [^116SVqjX]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Change detection is a critical component in the diagnosis and monitoring of many slowly evolving pathologies. This article describes a semiautomatic monitoring approach using longitudinal medical images. We test the method on brain scans of patients with meningioma, which experts have found difficult to monitor because the tumor evolution is very slow and may be obscured by artifacts related to image acquisition.

- **Methods**: We describe a semiautomatic procedure targeted toward identifying difficult-to-detect changes in brain tumor imaging. The tool combines input from a medical expert with state-of-the-art technology. The software is easy to calibrate and, in less than 5 minutes, returns the total volume of tumor change in mm. We test the method on post-gadolinium, T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 10 patients with meningioma and compare our results with experts' findings. We also perform benchmark testing with synthetic data.

- **Results**: Our experiments indicated that experts' visual inspections are not sensitive enough to detect subtle growth. Measurements based on experts' manual segmentations were highly accurate but also labor-intensive. The accuracy of our approach was comparable to the experts' results. However, our approach required far less user input and generated more consistent measurements.

- **Conclusion**: The sensitivity of experts' visual inspection is often too low to detect subtle growth of meningiomas from longitudinal scans. Measurements based on experts' segmentation are highly accurate but generally too labor-intensive for standard practice.

### Incidence, management, and outcome of incidental meningioma: What has happened in 10 years [^112Jajtk]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). High credibility.

- **Materials and methods**:
	- Sahlgrenska University Hospital is the sole provider of brain tumor surgery in the region of Western Sweden, serving a population of approximately 1.7 million. Records of performed CT (computer tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain were retrospectively reviewed at the radiological departments of each affiliated hospital site between 2008 to 2009 and 2018 to 2019. These time periods were chosen to allow a three-year follow-up in both groups. Additionally, records of performed CT and MRI in community hospitals within the region, as well as in the private sector, were obtained.

- **Patients**:
	- From these records, the number of individual patients undergoing CT or MRI examinations was extracted. Using the keyword "meningioma", with various imaginable spellings, a list of patients with possible meningiomas was screened. Some of the extracted data formed part of the ongoing multicenter study IMPACT and was further expanded for this study. The radiological reports and electronic health journals of these patients were reviewed to identify cases of first-time diagnosed incidental meningiomas at the time of examination. An incidental meningioma was defined as a tumor suspected of originating from the meninges, with no symptoms at diagnosis or symptoms that could not be attributed to the tumor. Patients with previously known incidental meningiomas or those where the meningioma was deemed symptomatic were excluded from further analysis.

### Association of shorter time to surgery with improved overall survival for atypical intracranial meningiomas: An analysis using the National Cancer Database [^111RSpB2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Low credibility.

Atypical intracranial meningiomas are characterized by brain invasion and faster growth than lower-grade counterparts. Surgery improves survival for patients with atypical meningiomas, and this study assesses the association between the timing of surgery and survival.

- **Methods**: Patients over 18 years of age with intracranial atypical meningiomas resected between 2004 and 2019 and cataloged in the National Cancer Database were included. Descriptive statistics of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were generated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each variable were developed. Cox proportional hazards models were created to assess the association of time between diagnosis and surgery with overall survival, controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, facility type, tumor size, comorbidity, resection type, adjuvant radiotherapy, and systemic therapy.

- **Results**: A total of 5,452 patients were included. Of these, 17.81% were between 18 and 50 years old, 66.89% were between 51 and 75 years old, and 15.30% were over 75 years old. Among the cohort, 55.98% were female. The average time between diagnosis and surgery was 0.8 months; 63.33% of the patients underwent gross-total resection, 28.28% received adjuvant radiotherapy, and 0.92% received systemic therapy. Overall, 21.39% of the patients died during the study period, and the average follow-up time after surgery was 50.9 months. Bivariate analysis showed that the risk of patient mortality over the entire study period increased significantly for every additional month between diagnosis and surgery.

### Volumetric growth and growth curve analysis of residual intracranial meningioma [^117YSKjY]. Neurosurgery (2023). Low credibility.

Of a total of 728 patients with meningioma who underwent surgery, 236 patients met the inclusion criteria — a residual meningioma incidence of 32.4% (Figure 1). One hundred eighty patients (76.3%) had STR/Simpson grade IV or V identified by the operating surgeon, while 56 (23.7%) had residual identified later on postoperative imaging despite an initial impression of complete resection at the time of surgery. One hundred forty-four patients (61.0%) had a postoperative MRI at 3 months after surgery.

- **Figure 1**: Patient selection process.

- **Clinical characteristics**: In 24 patients (86.4%), the indication for initial surgery was to reduce symptom burden; in 17 (7.2%), it was due to patient preference on discovery of an incidental tumor; and in 15 patients (6.4%), it was due to radiological progression of a previously monitored incidental meningioma. There were 195 WHO grade 1 (82.6%), 40 WHO grade 2 (16.9%), and 1 WHO grade 3 meningioma. The Ki-67 index was available in 20 patients (8.5%), with a median value of 7.0 (IQR 4.3–11.3).

- **Radiological characteristics**: The median preoperative tumor volume was 34.0 cm³ (IQR 16.0–63.0, range 0.2–276.0).

- **Surgical, adjuvant treatment, and follow-up**: The median percentage tumor resection was 90%.

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^117R5NTh]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Overall patient outcomes reflect that the majority of patients were alive at the end of the study period (96.3%, n = 52/54). One patient died due to a myocardial infarction during follow-up, while another had a pre-existing diagnosis of re-hemangioblastoma managed palliatively at the time of radiation-induced meningioma (RIM) discovery. Half of the study cohort had multiple meningiomas by the end of the study period or at five years after diagnosis (50%, n = 27/54). Additionally, two patients developed eight new RIMs during the study period.

### Volumetric growth and growth curve analysis of residual intracranial meningioma [^112NWTDy]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Volumetric growth and progression

- **Summary of growth rates**: The median annual relative growth rate and absolute growth rate were 4.3% (IQR 1.4%–14.7%) and 0.11 cm³/year, respectively. Growth plots of all residual meningiomas are demonstrated in Figure 2. According to the RANO criteria, 132 tumors (56.0%) progressed, and 83 (35.2%) exhibited radiological progression as defined by the tumor board. Of these, 13 (5.5%) showed clinical progression. The most common symptoms of progression included a reduction in visual fields (n = 6) and new-onset headache caused by meningioma (n = 4).

### Volumetric growth and growth curve analysis of residual intracranial meningioma [^1134ALXz]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Meningioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor. The reported incidence has increased with the widespread availability of MRI scanning. Meningiomas that are symptomatic, increasing in size, or threatening neurovascular structures often require surgery. Residual tumor remains in up to 33% of meningiomas undergoing surgery, identified by the operating surgeon as a Simpson grade IV or V resection or on postoperative imaging. The rate of residual meningioma is even higher in some selected series, such as those describing skull base meningioma, and is increasingly identified with the use of sophisticated postoperative imaging, such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). The optimal management of the residual meningioma is an important clinical problem.

A better understanding of growth kinetics could be helpful to influence meningioma management. Volumetrics can be used to identify the rate of meningioma growth, but there exists a paucity of studies, with none using established progression definitions. Identifying the volumetric growth rate of residual meningioma, along with prognostic factors for growth, could be helpful in clinical management to stratify patients to receive adjuvant radiotherapy, active surveillance, reoperation, or no treatment.

The primary aim of our study was to identify the volumetric growth rate of residual meningioma and correlate this with factors associated with progression. The secondary objective was to evaluate the residual growth trajectory.

### Incidence, management, and outcome of incidental meningioma: What has happened in 10 years [^1145F6yg]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Numerically, more patients were diagnosed with an incidental asymptomatic meningioma between 2018 and 2019 compared to 2008–2009, although this was not statistically significant, even though the number of scans performed each year remained constant. This could perhaps be attributed to improved image quality, more frequent use of contrast-enhanced scans, as well as a demographic shift, as more patients were older and more often had non-metastatic cancer. In the latter period, the search for brain metastases was more common.

There was no significant difference in the rate of surgical management decisions at diagnosis, but within 3 years of follow-up, significantly more patients in the 2018–2019 cohort had been followed with active monitoring. After 3 years of follow-up, a substantial number of patients from both time periods were deceased due to causes unrelated to their meningioma. This should be taken into account when considering regimes for treatment or follow-up of incidental meningiomas.

### Meningioma grading via diagnostic imaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Sph4Y]. Neuroradiology (2024). High credibility.

Meningioma is the most common type of intracranial tumor and arises from the arachnoid cap cells in the meninges, primarily due to the natural aging process. These tumors have been classified into Grades 1, 2, and 3 by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on their histopathological features. While the majority of these tumors are benign (Grade 1), they can occasionally be either atypical (Grade 2) or malignant (Grade 3). Higher grade (HG) meningiomas (Grades 2/3) correlate with a worse prognosis and require a different management plan than lower grade (LG) meningiomas (Grade 1). LG meningiomas may be cured with surgical resection or may be clinically observed if asymptomatic. However, HG tumors may require adjunctive radiotherapy alongside surgical resection. Even with adequate treatment, the recurrence rate of meningioma Grade 2 is 41% and Grade 3 is 75%. Hence, a timely diagnostic distinction between LG and HG meningioma is essential for appropriate treatment planning and improving patient outcomes.

The gold standard test for grading meningioma is pathological analysis, which requires a tumor sample via biopsy. The tumor sample is then processed by neuropathology and graded based on WHO criteria. However, meningiomas are often located in regions with poor surgical access for biopsy or resection, making tumor grading a challenge. Therefore, there is a need for a non-invasive diagnostic test in these scenarios to effectively plan treatments for meningioma patients.

Many studies have been performed on correlating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with histopathological findings to aid in non-invasive meningioma grading.

### Conditional recurrence-free survival after surgical resection of meningioma [^111wiQpf]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Recurrence after meningioma resection warrants serial surveillance imaging, but little evidence guides the optimal time interval between imaging studies and surveillance duration.

- **Objective**: To describe recurrence-free survival (RFS) after meningioma resection, conditioned to short-term RFS.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study for adults presenting for meningioma resection from 2000 to 2018 was conducted. The primary outcome was postoperative follow-up RFS. Conditional RFS Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, conditioned to 6-month and 12-month RFS. RFS probabilities conditioned to 6-month RFS were estimated in subgroups stratified by World Health Organization grade, extent of resection, and need for postoperative radiation.

- **Results**: In total, 723 patients were included. The median age at surgery was 57.4 years (IQR = 47.2–67.2). Median follow-up was 23.5 months (IQR = 12.3–47.8). Recurrence was observed in 90 patients (12%), with a median time to recurrence of 14.4 months (IQR = 10.3–37.1). Conditioned to 6-month postoperative RFS, patients had a 90.3% probability of remaining recurrence-free at 2 years and 69.4% at 10 years. Subgroup analysis conditioned to 6-month RFS demonstrated that grade 1 meningiomas undergoing gross total resection (GTR) had a 96.0% probability of RFS at 1 year and 82.8% at 5 years, whereas those undergoing non-GTR had 94.5% and 79.9% probability, respectively. RFS probability was 78.8% at 5 years for non-grade 1 meningiomas undergoing GTR, compared with 69.7% for non-grade 1 meningiomas undergoing non-GTR.

### Incidence, management, and outcome of incidental meningioma: What has happened in 10 years [^112nhjsW]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the use of brain scanning and the subsequent findings of presumed incidental meningioma across two time periods. Additionally, it aimed to examine differences in follow-up, treatment, and outcome.

- **Methods**: Records of all performed CT and MRI of the brain during the two time periods were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with presumed incidental meningioma. These patients were further analyzed using medical health records to study clinical handling and outcomes over a 3-year follow-up period.

- **Results**: An identical number of unique patients underwent brain imaging during the two periods (n = 22,259 vs. 22,013). In 2018–2019, there was a 25% increase in diagnosed incidental meningiomas compared to 2008–2009 (n = 161 vs. 129, p = 0.052). MRI usage increased significantly in 2018–2019 (26.1 vs. 12.4%, p = 0.004), and the use of contrast enhancement, irrespective of modality, also rose (26.8 vs. 12.2%, p < 0.001). Patients in the recent cohort were older (median age 79 years vs. 73 years, p = 0.03). There was a notable increase in cases where cancer was present without known metastases among scanned patients. In both cohorts, 29.5% and 35.4% of patients, respectively, were deceased 3 years after diagnosis due to causes unrelated to their meningioma.

- **Conclusions**: Despite the same number of unique patients undergoing brain scans in both periods, there was a trend towards more patients being diagnosed with incidental asymptomatic meningioma in the more recent years. This difference may be attributed to more frequent use of contrast-enhanced scans and increased scanning among the elderly, but it requires further study.

### Radiation-induced atypical meningioma with rapid growth in a 13-year-old girl. Case report [^1143ZyXR]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

This case illustrates the potential growth rate of an atypical meningioma in a pediatric patient and emphasizes one of the potential risks after therapeutic radiation. It underscores the importance of clinical evaluation and follow-up of the symptomatic patient after tumor resection and radiation therapy. The authors report a case of a radiation-induced atypical meningioma of the olfactory groove in a 13-year-old girl who received 36 Gy of radiation to the craniospinal axis and 72 Gy to the primary site of a primitive neuroectodermal epithelial tumor of the left parietooccipital lobe when she was 4 years of age. This tumor was not present on routine magnetic resonance imaging performed 13 months prior to its discovery or on computerized tomography scanning obtained 6 months prior to the discovery of the tumor. At the time of its discovery, the tumor measured 5 x 5 x 4 cm. After resection of the tumor, the patient's symptoms improved. This case illustrates the importance of continued close follow-up after cranial irradiation in the pediatric population.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^116vV7sD]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

To evaluate the outcomes of management strategies of incidental intracranial meningiomas, particular emphasis was placed on active monitoring and the timing of meningioma progression during follow-up.

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^115BsT5m]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Initial treatment strategies for meningiomas include observation, surgical resection, and/or radiotherapy. Among these, radiation is widely accepted as a stand-alone treatment for a presumed meningioma or as an adjunct after surgery, but it is not within the scope of this review. Surgery is certainly not indicated for all meningiomas. A range of factors impacts the decision for surgical management and the timing of intervention, including presenting symptoms, patient age, medical comorbidities, and tumor characteristics, such as size and the presence of edema and/or mass effect in the surrounding brain.

Intracranial meningiomas are often incidentally found, increasingly so with rising incidence. This is most likely due to an aging population and more frequent utilization of sensitive brain imaging. Studies report the presence of one or more meningiomas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in nearly 1% of the general population. While there is no class I or II evidence to support a standard protocol, incidental, asymptomatic, small to moderate-sized meningiomas without concerning radiographic features — discussed below — are generally monitored with serial imaging. The reported growth rates of untreated, incidental meningiomas vary greatly. Growth has been reported in 11% to 74% of patients, of which 0% to 56% become symptomatic. The majority of tumors grow less than 1 cm³/year, but growth can range anywhere from 0.03 to 2.62 cm³/year. These wide ranges underscore the relative biologic heterogeneity of meningiomas.

### Growth pattern changes of meningiomas: Long-term analysis [^115KwBQM]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Although tumors are generally expected to grow exponentially, it is not known whether meningiomas retain a constant growth rate or not due to the lack of long-term follow-up. We analyzed the long-term growth pattern of meningiomas.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with a total of 31 meningiomas were radiologically followed for 4.1 to 18.3 years (median, 10.1 years). Seven patients, including two neurofibromatosis cases, had incidental tumors. Another 13 patients with symptomatic tumors were followed after surgery. Their volumes were measured, and their time-volume curves were plotted.

- **Results**: The growth curves of four atypical meningiomas fit better to an exponential curve (R > 0.95). Two calcified tumors did not grow. Although other benign tumors grew exponentially or linearly, their tumor volume doubling times in the initial phase were shorter than those in the later phase in most cases. Meningiomas without calcification tended to grow exponentially, whereas those with calcification were likely to reveal a linear growth pattern (P = 0.002, chi-square test). This was supported by the observation that in two patients, the tumor growth pattern changed from exponential to linear and from linear to no growth with progression of calcification.

Three growth patterns of meningiomas were demonstrated. Atypical meningiomas grew exponentially. Conversely, benign meningiomas revealed exponential, linear, or no growth. The growth pattern of the latter may change with the appearance of calcification.

### Treatment decision making based on the published natural history and growth rate of small meningiomas [^115fBX9c]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Definitive data allowing clinicians to predict which meningioma patients will fail to respond to conservative management are lacking. The authors systematically reviewed the published literature regarding the natural history of small, untreated meningiomas to address this need.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a systematic review of the existing literature on untreated meningiomas that were followed with serial MR imaging. They summarized the published linear rates of tumor growth and the risk factors for the development of new or worsened symptoms during follow-up using a stratified chi-square test.

- **Results**: The search methods identified 22 published studies reporting on 675 patients with untreated meningiomas followed by serial MR imaging. Linear growth rates varied significantly; no growth was the most common rate, although reports of more aggressive tumors noted growth rates of up to a 93% linear increase in size per year. The authors found that few patients with initial tumor diameters greater than 2.5 and 3 cm in initial size went on to develop new or worsened symptoms 17% of the time. Tumors with growth rates > 10% per year developed new or worsened symptoms at a rate of 42%, compared with 0% for those growing ≤ 10% per year.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review of the literature regarding the clinical behavior of untreated meningiomas suggests that understanding tumor growth rates and initial size is essential for predicting symptom development.

### Management of multiple meningiomas [^116a6eMe]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple meningiomas account for 1%-10% of all meningiomas. This study describes the epidemiological aspects and management of the disease, which is more challenging than managing single tumors. A consecutive series of adult patients with two or more spatially separated meningiomas was reviewed. Patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2 were excluded. Clinical, imaging, histological, and treatment data were collected to provide information on the epidemiology, management options, and outcomes of active treatment and surveillance.

A total of 133 consecutive patients were included over 25 years, with 395 synchronous and 53 metachronous meningiomas, and a median of two tumors per patient. Among these, 106 patients had sporadic disease, 26 had radiation-induced disease, and 1 had familial meningiomatosis. At presentation, half of the patients were asymptomatic. Regarding maximum cross-sectional diameter, the tumors were small (≤ 2 cm) in 67% and large (> 4 cm) in 11% of the cases. Fifty-four patients received upfront treatment, while 31 had delayed treatment following a mean observation period of four years. One in four patients had two or more meningiomas treated. Overall, 64% of patients underwent treatment for 142 tumors, with 67 undergoing surgery and 18 receiving radiotherapy alone. The mean follow-up was seven years, with 13% of treated patients receiving salvage therapy.

Approximately one in four patients who underwent surgery had one or more WHO Grade II or III meningiomas. Meningiomas of different histological subtypes and grades in the same patient were not uncommon.

### The applicability of established clinical and histopathological risk factors for tumor recurrence during long-term postoperative care in meningioma patients [^1171wRoZ]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Low credibility.

Risk factors to predict late-onset tumor recurrence in meningioma patients are urgently needed to schedule control intervals during long-term follow-up. We therefore analyzed the value of established risk factors for postoperative meningioma recurrence for the prediction of long-term prognosis. Correlations of clinical and histopathological variables with tumor relapse after 3, 5, and 10 years following microsurgery were analyzed in uni- and multivariate analyses, and compared to findings in the entire cohort.

In the entire cohort (N = 1218), skull base location (HR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.05–2.16; p = .026) and Simpson ≥ IV resections (HR: 2.41, 95% CI 1.52–3.84; p = .05) were significant factors. In 147 patients with a follow-up of ≥ 10 years, ten recurrences occurred and were not correlated with any of the analyzed variables. Skull base tumor location and high-grade histology, but not the extent of resection, should be considered when scheduling control intervals.

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^113VCMAr]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). High credibility.

Intracranial meningioma (IM) is the most common primary intracranial tumor, accounting for over one-third of all intracranial tumors. Since the growth rate of IMs is usually slow and the majority of tumors are benign (World Health Organization (WHO) grades I–II), IMs may grow remarkably large before causing neurological or neuropsychological symptoms. As life expectancy has rapidly increased in high-income countries, even octogenarians (80–90 years old) are often in relatively good condition, live independently at home, and have close to 10 years of life ahead of them. Along with female sex, elderly age is among the most important risk factors for an increased chance of developing meningiomas. As such, neurosurgical meningioma operations are likely to become more common even among very old patients (80 years old or older).

Increasing age is known to increase the risks of operative mortality and morbidity in cranial neurosurgery. Indeed, three large register-based studies have suggested that the operative risks for very old (i.e. ≥ 80 years) IM patients may increase as much as 15 times higher compared with IM patients under 80 years old. On the other hand, two previous systematic reviews of elderly (≥ 65 years old) IM patients have shown that a proper patient selection process may decrease the operative risks, even in old IM patients. However, there is no overview available for very old IM patients thus far.

We conducted a systematic review of studies including very old (≥ 80 years) IM patients who underwent a surgical procedure and were evaluated using one or more standardized outcome measures.

### Volumetric growth rates of untreated cavernous sinus meningiomas [^114sHttV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Meningiomas that arise primarily within the cavernous sinus are often believed to be more indolent in their growth pattern. Despite this perceived growth pattern, disabling symptoms can arise even with small tumors. While research has been done on cavernous sinus meningiomas (CSMs) and their treatment, very little is known about their natural growth rates. With a better understanding of the growth rate of CSM, patient treatment and guidance can be optimized and individualized. The goal of this study was to determine volumetric growth rates of untreated CSMs.

- **Methods**: Thirty-seven patients with 166 MR images obtained between May 2004 and September 2019 were reviewed, with a range of 2–13 MR images per patient (average of 4.5 MR images per patient). These scans were obtained over an average follow-up period of 45.9 months (median 33.8, range 2.8–136.9 months). All imaging prior to any intervention was included in this analysis. Volumetric measurements were performed and assessed over time.

- **Results**: The estimated volumetric growth rate was 23.3% per year (95% CI 10.2%–38.0%, p < 0.001), which is equivalent to an estimated volume doubling time (VDT) of 3.3 years (95% CI 2.1–7.1 years). There was no significant relationship between growth rate and patient age (p = 0.09) or between growth rate and patient sex (p = 0.78). The median absolute growth rate was 41% with a range of -1% to 1793%. With a definition of "growth" as an increase of greater than 20% during the observed period, 65% of tumors demonstrated growth within their observation interval.

### Radiosurgery as definitive management of intracranial meningiomas [^113dM9gw]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Stereotactic radiosurgery has emerged as a vital primary or adjuvant minimally invasive management strategy for patients with intracranial meningiomas, aiming for long-term tumor growth prevention and maintenance of neurological function. This study evaluated clinical and imaging outcomes of meningiomas stratified by histological tumor grade.

The patient cohort comprised 972 patients with 1,045 intracranial meningiomas treated over an 18-year period. The series included 70% women, of whom 49% had undergone a previous resection and 5% had received previous fractionated radiation therapy. Tumor locations included the middle fossa (n = 351), posterior fossa (n = 307), convexity (n = 126), anterior fossa (n = 88), parasagittal region (n = 113), and other locations (n = 115).

The overall control rate for patients with benign meningiomas (World Health Organization Grade I) was 93%. In those without previous histological confirmation (n = 482), tumor control was 97%. However, for patients with World Health Organization Grade II and III tumors, tumor control was 50% and 17%, respectively. Delayed resection after radiosurgery was necessary in 51 patients (5%) at a mean of 35 months. After 10 years, Grade I tumors were controlled in 91% (n = 53); in patients without histology, 95% (n = 22) were controlled. No patients developed a radiation-induced tumor. The overall morbidity rate was 7.7%. Symptomatic peritumoral imaging changes developed in 4% of patients at a mean of 8 months.

Stereotactic radiosurgery demonstrated high rates of effectiveness in the control of intracranial meningiomas.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^114HNhwj]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Incidental, asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas are common, with no clear consensus on the optimal management strategy. This review demonstrates a wide variation in clinical practice. Considering that most incidental meningiomas are WHO grade I and reported treatment-related morbidity, the decision to intervene at initial presentation should not be made lightly. Active monitoring might constitute a better strategy, and this study shows that the majority of patients who develop clinical or radiological progression will do so within the first 5 years of diagnosis. Regular monitoring may, therefore, be less frequently required beyond this time point.

However, the data used to reach this conclusion have methodological shortcomings. Large prospective multi-center studies are required to develop management algorithms that minimize unnecessary treatment and optimize patient outcomes and quality of life.

### The natural history of incidental meningiomas [^114Xd6fx]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Little information about the natural history of incidental meningiomas exists in the literature. The aim of this study was to determine the natural history of asymptomatic meningiomas by comparing different methods of growth rate calculation to establish a strategy for dealing with these tumors.

- **Methods**: In 47 asymptomatic patients, hospital charts, follow-up records, and imaging studies were reviewed. Of these patients, 6 underwent surgery. Tumor growth rates were determined by calculating the absolute and relative growth rates and the tumor volume doubling times.

- **Results**: In 41 patients with conservative management, the average tumor size was 9 cm³, and the majority (66%) of growth rates were less than 1 cm³/yr. The absolute growth rate ranged from 0.03 to 2.62 cm³/yr (mean, 0.796 cm³/yr). Relative annual growth rates ranged from 0.48 to 72.8% (mean, 14.6%). The tumor doubling time ranged from 1.27 to 143.5 years (mean, 21.6 yr). A moderate correlation between the age and growth rates was found. In young patients, annual growth rates tended to be higher and tumor doubling times shorter. There was no clear correlation between the initial tumor size and tumor doubling time. The mean annual growth rate of meningiomas with calcification was lower than in tumors without calcification. Also, tumors with hypointense or isointense T2 signals on magnetic resonance imaging had a lower growth rate. In the group of six patients with surgical excision, tumor growth rates were higher and tumor doubling times shorter than in the nonsurgical group.

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^1127U879]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The incidence of radiation-induced meningioma (RIM) is increasing in line with improved childhood cancer survival, yet no consensus exists on the optimal management strategy. This study aimed to delineate meningioma growth rates from tumor discovery and correlate them with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included patients with RIM, managed at a specialist tertiary neuroscience center from 2007 to 2019. Tumor volume was measured from diagnosis and at subsequent interval scans. Meningioma growth rate was determined using a linear mixed-effects model, and clinical outcomes were correlated with growth rates, accounting for imaging and clinical prognostic factors.

- **Results**: Fifty-four patients with 110 meningiomas were included in the study. The median duration of follow-up was 74 months, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 41 to 102 months. The mean radiation dose was 41 Gy, with a standard deviation (SD) of 14.9, and the latency period was 34.4 years (SD = 13.7). The median absolute growth rate was 0.62 cm³/year, and the median relative growth rate was 72%/year. Forty meningiomas, affecting 27 patients, underwent surgical intervention following a median follow-up of 4 months (IQR 2–35). Operated RIMs were clinically aggressive and likely to be WHO grade 2 at first resection (43.6%), with a progression rate of 41% after surgery. The median time to progression was 28 months (IQR 13–60.5). A larger meningioma at discovery was associated with growth (HR 1.2 [95% CI 1.0–1.5], P = 0.039) but not with progression after surgery (HR 2.2 [95% CI 0.7–6.6], P = 0.181). By the end of the study, 27 (50%) patients had multiple meningiomas.

- **Conclusion**: Radiation-induced meningiomas present with varied clinical outcomes, with larger tumors at discovery tending to grow more rapidly.
