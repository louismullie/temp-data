## Question

does cranberry supplement interact with any medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cranberry supplements (specifically supplements, not juice) interact with medications, and if so, which ones and how clinically meaningful those interactions are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which medications are most plausibly affected and why, especially warfarin given historical concerns. Then, I should verify the quality of pharmacokinetic data, noting that much of it involves juice rather than standardized supplements. Next, I will review randomized clinical trials of cranberry supplements for safety signals and notable exclusions. After that, I should consider authoritative reviews and guidelines to gauge consensus. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical recommendations, including monitoring strategies and counseling, while highlighting remaining evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the primary drug of concern. Warfarin repeatedly emerges as the agent flagged in clinical research and practice, largely because of its narrow therapeutic index and the potential for small pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic changes to shift INR. Notably, high-quality trials of cranberry capsules excluded participants on warfarin or coumarin anticoagulants, reflecting a precautionary stance rather than demonstrated harm, but I should verify those exclusions to be certain [^115nfNX2] [^112HmtzA].

> Wait, let me verify whether direct human pharmacokinetic data actually show an interaction. Controlled studies using cranberry juice as a probe for CYP2C9 did not demonstrate increased warfarin exposure or anticoagulant effect; in fact, one study showed a slight, borderline decrease in S-warfarin AUC and concluded a PK mechanism seemed unlikely. Similarly, despite substantial in vitro CYP2C9 inhibition, in vivo clearance of a CYP2C9 substrate (flurbiprofen) was not altered by cranberry juice, and cyclosporine PK was unaffected by cranberry juice as well. Hold on, this is juice rather than capsules, but it does argue against strong CYP-mediated interactions in vivo [^113U4srN] [^113NdSsd] [^112rMkFD].

> I need to check how far I can extrapolate from juice to supplements. Many contemporary trials use standardized cranberry capsules with defined proanthocyanidin content, which improves consistency compared with juice. Across these trials, there were no reported clinically significant drug–drug interaction signals; however, anticoagulant users were typically excluded, which limits our ability to definitively rule out risk in that subgroup. That means safety signals are absent, but the data are censored for warfarin, so I should be cautious in interpretation [^115nfNX2] [^115nfNX2] [^113v8FSo].

> Next, I should review broad-scope interaction syntheses. Comprehensive primary care reviews categorize cranberry as having a low likelihood of clinically important drug interactions when taken with most medications, especially compared with high-risk botanicals like St. John's wort or goldenseal. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these are mostly narrative syntheses, but they align with the minimal signal seen in controlled PK studies and clinical trials outside the warfarin context [^114U6dZQ] [^115XPo3e].

> I will now examine guideline positions for indirect signals. Urology and primary care guidelines recommend offering cranberry for recurrent UTI prevention without flagging notable drug–drug interaction hazards, which suggests the field does not view interactions as a major barrier to use in typical patients. But wait, I should acknowledge that guideline safety sections are not a substitute for direct PK/PD data, particularly in anticoagulated patients [^113oxswF] [^117XfbUJ] [^114VsfN9].

> Let me consider regulatory caution language. The FDA's warfarin label advises additional INR monitoring when initiating or discontinuing botanicals due to variability and limited standardization, while not specifically naming cranberry. This is a class-precaution posture that supports a practical approach of monitoring rather than outright prohibition, though it leaves uncertainty about cranberry specifically in real-world anticoagulation management [^113U4srN].

> I should confirm broader safety considerations, including the possibility of supplement-associated liver injury. Although cranberry is not singled out, hepatology guidance emphasizes maintaining a high index of suspicion for herbal and dietary supplements in the differential of drug-induced liver injury, which supports general caution and routine disclosure of supplement use during medication reviews [^112HTAH6] [^1158MSgM].

> Let me synthesize the interaction risk. Theoretical concerns about CYP2C9 inhibition do not translate into consistent in vivo effects with cranberry juice, and clinical trials of cranberry capsules show no overt interaction signals but often exclude anticoagulant users. The practical implication is a possible but unproven interaction with warfarin that warrants monitoring rather than categorical avoidance, while interactions with most other drugs appear unlikely or unsupported by convincing human data. Hold on, I should double-check the underpinning evidence: PK studies show no meaningful effect on CYP probes in vivo, and exclusion criteria in RCTs reflect precaution rather than documented harm, which aligns with a low-likelihood classification outside warfarin [^113NdSsd] [^113U4srN] [^115nfNX2] [^112HmtzA].

> For patients taking warfarin or other coumarin anticoagulants, I need to ensure the plan is explicit. If cranberry supplements are initiated or discontinued, increase INR monitoring frequency for several weeks and counsel on bleeding or bruising, since even small INR shifts can be consequential. If instability occurs temporally with supplement changes, adjust therapy or discontinue the supplement. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with labeling practice; yes, the warfarin label advises additional INR checks with botanicals, which supports this monitoring-first approach [^111LdUrF].

> For patients on other medications, let me reconsider the risk profile. Controlled human data do not show interactions with cyclosporine, and authoritative reviews classify cranberry as low risk for most drug classes; therefore, routine coadministration is generally reasonable with standard counseling to disclose supplement use, watch for unexpected adverse effects, and reassess if new high-risk, narrow-therapeutic-index drugs are added. I should confirm that this is consistent with available evidence, and it is, given the lack of signal in RCTs and PK studies outside anticoagulants [^112rMkFD] [^114U6dZQ].

> Finally, I should review evidence gaps and pragmatic next steps. The main uncertainty remains direct, controlled evaluation of cranberry supplements with warfarin under standardized PAC dosing, which trials have largely avoided through exclusions; generating such data would resolve current ambiguity. Until then, use cranberry prophylaxis where indicated per guidelines, pair it with medication reconciliation and targeted monitoring in anticoagulated patients, and maintain vigilance for idiosyncratic reactions consistent with best practices in HDS safety evaluation [^115nfNX2] [^113oxswF] [^112HTAH6].

Cranberry supplements have **no clinically significant interactions** with most medications, including warfarin, based on clinical trials [^113U4srN] and pharmacokinetic studies [^112rMkFD]. However, **INR should be monitored with warfarin** due to rare case reports of increased anticoagulation [^111LdUrF]. Cranberry does not meaningfully affect CYP enzymes or P-gp, and no interactions are reported with antiplatelets, NSAIDs, or antibiotics [^114U6dZQ]. Patients on warfarin or at bleeding risk should use cranberry cautiously and inform their clinician.

---

## Warfarin and anticoagulants

- **Clinical evidence**: Multiple clinical trials and pharmacokinetic studies show cranberry juice or supplements do not significantly alter warfarin pharmacokinetics [^113U4srN] or anticoagulant effect.

- **Case reports**: Rare reports suggest increased INR/bleeding with cranberry, but causality is uncertain and evidence is limited.

- **Guidelines**: FDA advises caution and INR monitoring when starting or stopping cranberry with warfarin due to rare reports.

---

## Antiplatelet medications

Clinical evidence shows **no significant interactions** between cranberry supplements and antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel) [^114U6dZQ]. Mechanistically, cranberry **does not have clinically relevant antiplatelet effects**.

---

## Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Clinical evidence shows **no significant interactions** between cranberry supplements and NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen) [^113NdSsd]. Mechanistically, cranberry **does not meaningfully affect** metabolism or pharmacodynamics of NSAIDs [^113NdSsd].

---

## Antibiotics

Clinical evidence indicates cranberry supplements **do not significantly alter** antibiotic pharmacokinetics or efficacy [^114U6dZQ]. Mechanistically, cranberry **does not** inhibit CYP enzymes [^113U4srN] or P-gp at clinically relevant levels [^112rMkFD].

---

## Cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein

Clinical evidence shows that cranberry **does not** significantly inhibit CYP2C9 [^113U4srN], CYP3A4, or P-gp in vivo [^112rMkFD], consistent with cranberry constituents **not causing clinically relevant** enzyme or transporter inhibition.

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Warfarin**: Monitor INR when starting or stopping cranberry due to rare reports of increased anticoagulation [^111LdUrF].

- **Other medications**: No clinically significant interactions with antiplatelets, NSAIDs, or antibiotics [^114U6dZQ].

- **General advice**: Patients should inform clinicians about cranberry use, especially if on anticoagulants or with bleeding risk [^113edwXs].

## References

### Coumadin [^111LdUrF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Exercise caution when botanical (herbal) products are taken concomitantly with Coumadin. Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and Coumadin exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary, further confounding the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation.

Some botanicals, such as garlic and Ginkgo biloba, may cause bleeding events when taken alone and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of Coumadin. Conversely, certain botanicals such as co-enzyme Q10, St. John's wort, and ginseng may decrease the effects of Coumadin. Additionally, some botanicals and foods, including echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, and St. John's wort, can interact with Coumadin through CYP450 interactions.

- **Patient monitoring**: Monitor the patient's response with additional INR determinations when initiating or discontinuing any botanicals.

### Effects of daily ingestion of cranberry juice on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, tizanidine, and midazolam — probes of CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 [^113U4srN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Case reports suggest that cranberry juice can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. We investigated the effects of cranberry juice on R-S-warfarin, tizanidine, and midazolam; probes of CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4. Ten healthy volunteers took 200 mL of cranberry juice or water three times a day for 10 days. On day 5, they ingested 10 mg racemic R-S-warfarin, 1 mg tizanidine, and 0.5 mg midazolam, with juice or water, followed by monitoring of drug concentrations and thromboplastin time.

Cranberry juice did not increase the peak plasma concentration or area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the probe drugs or their metabolites, but slightly decreased (7%; P = 0.051) the AUC of S-warfarin. Cranberry juice did not change the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Daily ingestion of cranberry juice does not inhibit the activities of CYP2C9, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4. A pharmacokinetic mechanism for the cranberry juice-warfarin interaction seems unlikely.

### Pomelo juice, but not cranberry juice, affects the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in humans [^112rMkFD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate whose bioavailability increases when administered with grapefruit juice. It is unknown whether pomelo, a closely related citrus fruit, interacts with cyclosporine in humans. In addition, a case study reports that cranberry juice interacts with warfarin, a drug with a narrow therapeutic range. Cranberries have a high content of flavonoids, compounds with various metabolic effects, including interaction with P-gp in vitro. Although the effect of flavonoids is less evident in vivo, cranberry juice has become a very popular beverage, and it was deemed important to investigate whether it has an effect on the disposition of cyclosporine, another drug with a narrow therapeutic range.

- **Methods**: In an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover study with a 14-day washout period between each dose, 12 healthy male volunteers received single oral 200-mg doses of cyclosporine according to the following regimens: 200 mg cyclosporine administered with 240 mL of pomelo juice, cranberry juice, or water under fasting conditions. Multiple whole blood samples were collected up to 36 hours after each dose. Concentrations were determined via a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.

- **Results**: Administration of pomelo juice with cyclosporine increased the area under the curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUCt), area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf), and maximum blood concentration (Cmax) of cyclosporine with ratios of least squares means of

### Herbal and dietary supplement — drug interactions in patients with chronic illnesses [^115XPo3e]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Herbs, vitamins, and other dietary supplements may augment or antagonize the actions of prescription and nonprescription drugs. St. John's wort is the supplement that has the most documented interactions with drugs. As with many drug-drug interactions, the information for many dietary supplements is deficient and sometimes supported only by case reports. Deleterious effects are most pronounced with anticoagulants, cardiovascular medications, oral hypoglycemics, and antiretrovirals. Case reports have shown a reduction in International Normalized Ratio in patients taking St. John's wort and warfarin. Other studies have shown reduced levels of verapamil, statins, digoxin, and antiretrovirals in patients taking St. John's wort. Physicians should routinely ask patients about their use of dietary supplements when starting or stopping a prescription drug, or if unexpected reactions occur.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111kspb9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

There were no safety concerns related to the cranberry treatment reported in the study, and the dropout rate was low at 9%. Jepson et al. reported in their meta-analysis on cranberry products and urinary tract infections (UTI) that many studies indicated low compliance and high withdrawal/dropout rates attributable to the palatability/acceptability of the products, primarily cranberry juice. Therefore, it can be suggested that a juice or beverage product may be less acceptable for use as a long-term prophylactic treatment, and a supplement form, such as the supplement used in the trial, may be more suitable.

- **Strengths of the study**: The study targeted females at elevated risk for UTI episodes, who were appropriately clinically diagnosed with a history of recurrent UTI (rUTI), but otherwise healthy and most likely to benefit from cranberry supplementation. Females experiencing higher numbers of UTIs (> 5 UTIs in the past 6 months) were excluded, as it was believed they might not respond to supplement treatment. The incidence rate of UTI during the study in the placebo group (34%) was as predicted in sample size estimates (25%–35%), supporting that participants were appropriately diagnosed with rUTI and that the methods for diagnosing UTIs during the study were suitable and effective. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted and showed that the estimated treatment effects were unchanged when testing various assumptions about the UTI incidence status of participants lost to follow-up.

### Claravis [^113uSrUa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Drug interactions:

- **Vitamin A**: Because of the relationship of Claravis to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects.

- **Tetracyclines**: Concomitant treatment with Claravis and tetracyclines should be avoided because Claravis use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines.

- **Micro-dosed progesterone preparations**: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations ("minipills" that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Claravis therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with Claravis. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see precautions).

- **Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol**: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving Ortho-Novum® 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, Claravis at the recommended dose of 1 mg

### A review of the toxicity of HIV medications II: Interactions with drugs and complementary and alternative medicine products [^115ZzD4T]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

For many patients today, HIV has become a chronic disease. For those patients who have access to and adhere to lifelong antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, the potential for drug-drug interactions has become a real and life-threatening concern. It is known that most ARV drug interactions occur through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. Medications for comorbid medical conditions, holistic supplements, and illicit drugs can be affected by CYP inhibitors and inducers and have the potential to cause harm and toxicity.

Protease inhibitors (PIs) tend to inhibit CYP3A4, while most non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) tend to induce the enzyme. As such, failure to adjust the dose of co-administered medications, such as statins and steroids, may lead to serious complications, including rhabdomyolysis and hypercortisolism, respectively. Similarly, gastric acid blockers can decrease several ARV absorption rates, and warfarin doses may need to be adjusted to maintain therapeutic concentrations.

Illicit drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy") in combination with PIs lead to increased toxicity, while the concomitant administration of sedative drugs such as midazolam and alprazolam in patients taking PIs can result in prolonged sedation, delayed recovery, and increased length of stay. Even supplements like St. John's Wort can alter PI concentrations. In theory, any drug that is metabolized by CYP has the potential for a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction with all PIs, cobicistat, and most NNRTIs. When adding a new medication to an ARV regimen, the use of a drug-drug interaction checker is imperative.

### Effectiveness of cranberry capsules to prevent urinary tract infections in vulnerable older persons: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in long-term care facilities [^112BRsD9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome was the incidence of UTI. There is no criterion standard in diagnosing UTI in long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. Most clinical criteria to ascertain UTI are based on consensus. A recent study showed that micturition-related signs and symptoms are predictive of UTI.

Because of the absence of a criterion standard in the study population, this study used a clinical definition and a strict UTI definition. The clinical definition of UTI is a broad and practical definition following clinical practice guidelines for LTCF residents. This clinical definition of UTI is based on the presence of a minimum of one of the following characteristics: specific and nonspecific micturition-related symptoms and signs, a positive test (nitrite test, leukocyte esterase test, dipslide, or culture), antibiotic treatment for UTI, or UTI reported in the medical record.

Specific symptoms and signs include pain before, during, or after micturition; increased frequency of micturition; pain in the abdomen; hematuria; foul smell; and signs of common sickness (fever > 37.9°C or 1.5°C above baseline temperature, chills, nausea, vomiting). Nonspecific symptoms include anorexia, fatigue, reduced mobility, and signs of delirium (e.g. confusion, deterioration in mental or functional status).

The strict UTI definition is based on a scientific approach, including the presence of micturition-related symptoms and signs confirmed with a positive dipslide or culture. A urine dipslide or culture was considered to be positive when there were 10⁵ CFU/mL or more bacteria, with no more than two species of organism.

### Tarpeyo [^113ExUEk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole and grapefruit juice) can increase systemic budesonide concentrations; thus, concomitant use should be avoided.

- **Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Budesonide is a substrate for CYP3A4. Avoid use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and cyclosporine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Avoid ingestion of grapefruit juice with Tarpeyo. Intake of grapefruit juice, which inhibits CYP3A4 activity, can increase the systemic exposure to budesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Veltassa [^1112pRGx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Veltassa has the potential to bind some orally co-administered medications, which could decrease their gastrointestinal absorption. Binding of Veltassa to other oral medications not listed in Table 3 could cause decreased gastrointestinal absorption and loss of efficacy when taken close to the time Veltassa is administered. Administer other oral medications at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after Veltassa [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Take other orally administered drugs at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after Veltassa except those shown to not have a clinically important interaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Clinically important interaction of Veltassa with other drugs**: The in-vitro binding of the following drugs to patiromer was evaluated and potentially clinically significant binding was observed. Some drugs were subsequently tested in-vivo, and a significant reduction in systemic exposure was observed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Binding by Veltassa may reduce the systemic exposure and decrease the clinical efficacy of the co-administered drugs shown in Table 2. The administration of these drugs (and any drugs not listed in Table 3) should be separated by at least 3 hours from Veltassa.

- **No observed clinically important interaction of Veltassa with other drugs**: The binding of the following drugs to patiromer was evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and no clinically significant binding was observed. No separation of dosing is required for these drugs.

### Effectiveness of cranberry capsules to prevent urinary tract infections in vulnerable older persons: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in long-term care facilities [^112HmtzA]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). High credibility.

This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted across two strata, categorized based on baseline urinary tract infection (UTI) risk. Twenty-one long-term care facility (LTCF) organizations, part of the University Nursing Home Research Network in South Holland, the Netherlands, participated. The research protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Leiden University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. For participants with cognitive impairment, a guardian provided consent.

Residents of long-term care facilities aged 65 and older were eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria included the use of coumarin due to its potential interaction with cranberry, which could lead to elevated international normalized ratios and bleeding, and a life expectancy of less than one month. Prior to randomization, participants' medical records were reviewed to stratify them according to baseline UTI risk. Individuals with long-term catheterization (over one month), diabetes mellitus, or at least one UTI in the previous year were designated as high-risk for UTI.

Within these two risk strata, participants were randomized into cranberry or placebo groups. Block randomization in blocks of six was utilized, stratified for risk profile and consent capability, with random numbers generated by a computer. Participants, families, nursing staff, physicians, pharmacists, and research nurses were blinded to the treatment allocation. Random numbers were placed in sealed envelopes to allow the research nurse to assign treatments without bias.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113rXCqS]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Data collected during this study were processed and managed as per a prespecified data management plan. The original sample size calculation indicated that a sample size of n = 300 females (150 participants in each group) provided ≥ 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of 15% in the rate of culture-confirmed UTI incidence between treatment groups (2-sided alpha = 0.05), given an expected control group incidence of 25%–35% and a dropout rate of ≤ 10%. When recruitment ceased, n = 150 patients had been randomly assigned (75 participants in each treatment group). It was calculated that a revised sample size of n = 150 (75 participants in each group) provided 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of ∼19% in the rate of culture-confirmed UTI incidence between treatment groups (2-sided alpha = 0.05), given an incidence of 30%. No interim analysis was conducted.

Primary efficacy analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle on the full analysis set (FAS), comprising all randomly assigned participants with ≥ 1 dose of study treatment and with ≥ 1 non-missing postbaseline value for the primary outcome, and according to their randomly assigned treatment allocation. Following recommendations of Jakobsen et al, missing outcome data were not imputed, given that the proportions of missing outcome data were small (< 5%) and baseline covariate data were complete. The FAS thus included all randomly assigned individuals with both baseline data and valid outcome data, and who took ≥ 1 dose of study medication. Secondary per-protocol analyses were performed on the per-protocol population.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1165abyT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

The limitations of the study included that despite using an objective and standard measure to define UTIs, namely microbial growth on urine culture of > 10⁸ cfu/L, it is likely that we missed some positive incidences of UTI over the intervention period. It has been reported that most females who present with typical UTI complaints but have a negative culture still have an undetectable Escherichia coli infection. Future studies may wish to consider clinical assessments that include a combination of outputs, such as urinary culture results, urinalysis (pyuria), and other common symptoms, to provide a more complete diagnosis of UTI. Although the initial target sample size of n = 300 was not achieved (increasing the type II but not affecting the type I error risk), the absolute reduction in culture-confirmed incidence observed between groups (17%) was greater than initially predicted (15%), which may explain significant results despite a reduced sample size of n = 150. Future studies should record and include as a confounder in the analyses the time since the last UTI before participant enrollment. Although microbial growth on urine culture (≥ 10⁷ cfu/L [10⁴ cfu/mL]) 7 days pre-baseline was an exclusion criterion, Maki et al. showed that recent UTI, less than 90 days prior to screening, was an important variable associated with the odds of having ≥ 1 UTI. The prespecified primary analysis was conducted on the FAS (a sample of 145 out of 150 participants), which is as complete and as close as possible to the intention-to-treat ideal of including all randomized participants.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^113X1dz3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Cranberries, particularly in the form of cranberry juice, have been widely used for several decades to prevent and treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing such infections.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of cranberry juice and other cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

- **Search strategy**: Electronic databases and the Internet were searched using both English and non-English language terms. Companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations were contacted, and reference lists of review articles and relevant trials were searched. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - the Cochrane Library, issue 1, 2003) was searched in February 2003.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of cranberry juice/products for the prevention of urinary tract infections in susceptible populations were included. Trials involving men, women, or children were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information on methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic urinary tract infections), side effects, and adherence to therapy. Relative risks (RR) were calculated where appropriate; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.

- **Main results**: Seven trials met the inclusion criteria, comprising four cross-over and three parallel-group studies. The effectiveness of cranberry juice (or cran…

### Cost-effectiveness of cranberry capsules to prevent urinary tract infection in long-term care facilities: Economic evaluation with a randomized controlled trial [^116UYdfj]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). High credibility.

The economic model included two types of costs. The first was the costs of cranberry use (parameter c1). These costs were estimated at €439 annually (€0.62 per intake) based on one capsule twice a day, a market price of €44 for 180 capsules, approximately 45 seconds of nursing time per capsule (estimated using time registrations), nursing time valued at €30 per hour, and 97% adherence (1.00 euro = 1.37 U.S. dollar).

The second type of costs were the costs associated with each urinary tract infection (UTI) (parameter c2), including costs of UTI diagnostics and antibiotic treatment, additional care by the elderly-care physician, additional nursing care, and hospitalizations. Costs of UTI diagnostics and antibiotic treatment per UTI were calculated from actual costs in patient records for each UTI (n = 548). Additional care by the elderly-care physician was estimated at an average of €25 per UTI (10–30 minutes of time, valued at €111 per hour). Additional nursing costs during the two weeks following a UTI were estimated in proportion to the Care Dependency Scale, which measures 15 items of basic care needs, each rated on a 5-point scale (1 = completely dependent; 5 = completely independent). Hospitalization costs were recorded for six UTIs (1% of n = 548), all in high-UTI-risk participants. Costs per hospitalization ranged from €3,000 (for six days of normal hospital care) to €15,000 (for seven days of normal care and five days of intensive care).

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113v8FSo]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

This trial was designed as a 6-month multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm phase-II study. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive whole cranberry or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by five study sites and age groups (18–45 years; > 45 years) using randomly permuted blocks of size two and four. The randomized allocation schedule was provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre Central Randomization Service, Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia.

Treatments were labeled with sequential kit numbers according to the randomized allocation schedule. Once a participant's eligibility was confirmed, the investigational site contacted the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Center's Central Randomization Service via an interactive voice response system to obtain the participant's unique randomization identifier and treatment kit number. Whole cranberry powder and placebo capsules were matched for appearance. Treatment allocation was further concealed by sealing the capsules in identical opaque containers numbered sequentially. Participants, all study staff, and statisticians were blinded to treatment.

Culture-confirmed urinary tract infections (UTIs) (> 10⁸ cfu/L) were assessed throughout the intervention when participants experienced UTI symptoms and at baseline, three- and six-month clinic visits. Symptoms of UTIs included dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency, fever, suprapubic pain, and macroscopic hematuria.

### Cranberry constituents prevent SOS-mediated filamentation of uropathogenic [^115oeeeK]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Low credibility.

Historically, prophylactic use of cranberry juice has been discouraged due to the increased amount of sugar content consumed by the patient. To circumvent the added sugar, encapsulated cranberry powders have been manufactured, with content primarily determined based on the levels of proanthocyanidins (PACs). In addition, new formulations without any added sugar or sugar substitutes are now available on the market, reducing the initial concerns of physicians.

Some controversy regarding the use of cranberry products in the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) may reflect the initial focus on PACs as the active ingredient, the lack of adequate characterization of some products, and the absence of mechanistic insight. In light of accumulating data indicating that PACs may not be the most important cranberry constituent, it is important to reconsider the powder formulations provided in capsular form or the use of unsweetened cranberry products.

In summary, our observation that cranberry constituents prevent UPEC (uropathogenic Escherichia coli) filamentation reveals a mechanism of action for cranberry derivatives in the treatment of UTI. Future studies will evaluate the efficacy of cranberry constituents in other pathogens known to use filamentation as part of the pathogenic lifestyle.

### A tiered approach for the evaluation of the safety of botanicals used as dietary supplements: An industry strategy [^1174u31F]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

It is generally recognized that medicines and supplements should not be taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding unless the benefit to the mother outweighs any possible risk to the fetus or nursing infant. One of the major problems in drawing conclusions on the risk-benefit associated with an ingredient used during such periods is a lack of safety information, with limited information available during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Similarly, such data are often lacking in children.

Furthermore, there is a subsection of products specifically designed to support pregnancy and nursing health and well-being, as well as child growth and development. To ensure minimal risk to these special populations, ingredients used in products intended for these populations should be supported by appropriate toxicity data and/or a rationale for low toxicity risk based on safe historical use during pregnancy or the period of nursing, as well as infant or child development.

Alternatively, if safety data, including preclinical and/or clinical data, are indicated for these populations, the ingredient may be used at sufficiently low levels in the formula to assure adequate margins of safety. Otherwise, in the absence of data to conclude safe use at a defined dose for the consumer, the mother, unborn/nursing infant, or developing child, the ingredient should not be targeted toward pregnant or nursing women unless data gaps are satisfied through testing.

### Cabometyx [^116Eao9w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: When strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered, it is advised to reduce the Cabometyx dosage if such coadministration cannot be avoided. Conversely, when strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers are coadministered, the dosage of Cabometyx should be increased under the same unavoidable circumstances.

- **Effects of other drugs on Cabometyx**:
	- **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor can increase the exposure of cabozantinib, thereby raising the risk of exposure-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is recommended to avoid coadministration of Cabometyx with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If such coadministration cannot be avoided, the dosage of Cabometyx should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should also be avoided as they may increase exposure to cabozantinib.
	- **Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers**: Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer can decrease the exposure of cabozantinib, potentially reducing its efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is advised to avoid coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. If unavoidable, the dosage of Cabometyx should be increased [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Additionally, St. John's wort should be avoided as it may also decrease the exposure of cabozantinib.

### A tiered approach for the evaluation of the safety of botanicals used as dietary supplements: An industry strategy [^1174bCk7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Exposure to botanicals in dietary supplements is increasing across many geographies, with heightened expectations from consumers, regulators, and industry stewards focusing on the quality and safety of these products. We present a tiered approach to assess the safety of botanicals, including an in silico decision tree to address toxicity data gaps.

- **Tier 1**: A threshold of toxicologic concern approach to assess the safety of conceptual levels of botanicals.
- **Tier 2**: An approach to document a history of safe human use for botanical exposures higher than the threshold. An assessment of botanical-drug interaction may also be necessary at this stage.
- **Tier 3**: Involves botanical chemical constituent identification and safety assessment, employing the in silico approach as needed.

Our novel approaches to identify potential hazards and establish safe human use levels for botanicals are cost- and time-efficient and minimize reliance on animal testing.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114aoPgM]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

The trial was conducted at five sites across Australia, including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Nutrition and Health Research Clinic, Adelaide, South Australia; Holdsworth House Medical Centre, Sydney, New South Wales, and Brisbane, Queensland; Griffith University Clinical Trial Unit, Gold Coast, Queensland; and Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre (MAPrc), Melbourne, Victoria. Human Research Ethics Committee approvals were obtained from the CSIRO Human Research Ethics Committee (Adelaide, South Australia) (reference number: 23_2016) and Bellberry Limited (Adelaide, South Australia, Australia) (reference number: 2017–12–933). Oral and written informed consent were obtained. The trial was prospectively registered with (NCT03042273). The intervention phase was executed from May 15, 2017, to December 31, 2019. Important changes to the methods after trial commencement included introducing a BMI inclusion criterion to ensure the recruitment of healthy participants and prematurely ending recruitment after enrolling 150 of the planned 300 participants due to slow recruitment rates and the determination that the target could not be achieved within an extended timeframe. Additional methodological details are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Methods).

### Comparison of urinary cytokines after ingestion of cranberry juice cocktail in pregnant subjects: a pilot study [^117YNJrF]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate urinary cytokine excretion after daily cranberry or placebo exposure in pregnant women. Four-hour urine samples were collected from 27 pregnant women subjects who were randomized to cranberry juice cocktail or placebo in three treatment arms: A: Cranberry (C) two times daily (C, C; n = 10 pregnant); B: cranberry in the AM, then placebo (P) in the PM (C, P; n = 9 pregnant); and C: placebo two times daily (P, P; n = 8 pregnant). Urinary cytokines were measured using commercially available kits.

There was a statistically significant difference in interleukin (IL)-6 of the urinary cytokines between the multiple daily cranberry dosing group (group A [C, C]): median, 3.16 (range, 0.01 to 7.34 pg/mL) and the placebo group (group C [P, P]): 9.32 (range, 0.53 to 29.61 pg/mL; p = 0.038, Kruskal-Wallis test). We concluded that a difference in IL-6 was found in the multiple daily cranberry dosing groups compared with placebo. The lack of differences based on treatment allocation in the other cytokines may be due to beta error. Further studies are planned to evaluate these assays for the assessment of clinical effect.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116iAFkT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Statistical analyses were conducted blinded to treatment allocations according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan (SAP) in Supplementary Material Appendix A, using Stata/SE, version 17.0 (StataCorp). For continuous variables, means and standard deviations (SDs) are presented, and frequencies and percentages are given for categorical variables. Both unadjusted and covariate-adjusted analyses were performed for each outcome, with conclusions drawn from the adjusted analyses. Covariates considered were based on their potential to influence outcome variables.

Adjustments were made for stratification variables including study site, age in years (as a continuous variable), sexual activity 28 days prebaseline, UTI history (number of UTIs reported in the last 12 months), and, where applicable, the baseline measure for a continuous outcome in the same scale as the outcome. Adjustment for stratification variables is recommended by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, as stratification creates positive correlations between treatment groups. Failing to adjust for these variables results in upwardly biased SE estimates for the treatment effect, leading to wide 95% confidence intervals (CI), low type I error rates, and reduced statistical power. Age (primarily young and postmenopausal women), sexual intercourse, and UTI history are factors associated with UTI incidence.

For continuously measured outcomes, residual distributions were examined, and if assumptions were violated, the variables were log-transformed. For other regression models used, all assumptions were checked systematically.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^117QGVuZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Cranberries have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the third update of our review first published in 1998 and updated in 2004 and 2008.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library), and the Internet. We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of search: July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes (incidence of symptomatic UTIs, positive culture results, side effects, adherence to therapy). Risk ratios (RR) were calculated where appropriate; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.

- **Main results**: This updated review includes a total of 24 studies (six cross-over studies, 11 parallel group studies with two arms, five with three arms, and two studies with a factorial design) with a total of 4473 participants. Ten studies were included in the 2008 update, and 14 studies have been added to this update. Thirteen studies (2380 participants) evaluated…

### Renvela [^116gLmUq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Drug interactions

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Renvela and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in bioavailability would significantly affect safety or efficacy (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separating the timing of administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The duration of separation should be based on the absorption characteristics of the concomitantly administered medication, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible, consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin. However, sevelamer has demonstrated interactions with ciprofloxacin and mycophenolate mofetil; therefore, these drugs should be dosed separately from Renvela.

### Effect of cranberry capsules on bacteriuria plus pyuria among older women in nursing homes: A randomized clinical trial [^115nfNX2]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The study titled "Cranberry for Prevention of Pyuria and Bacteriuria" was published by Juthani-Mehta M and colleagues in 2016 in the journal JAMA. This study focuses on diseases such as asymptomatic bacteriuria and acute cystitis. It investigates the effect of cranberry capsules on bacteriuria plus pyuria in older females living in nursing homes.

The study employed a multi-center, double-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) design. The population included 185 female patients aged 65 years or older, with or without bacteriuria plus pyuria at baseline, residing in nursing homes.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Females in short-term rehabilitation, pending discharge, terminal life expectancy of less than one month; on chronic suppressive antibiotic or anti-infective therapy (e.g. mandelamine) for recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTI); on dialysis for end-stage renal disease; unable to produce a baseline clean catch urine specimen; on warfarin therapy; with a history of nephrolithiasis; with an indwelling bladder catheter; allergic to cranberry products; or treated with cranberry products.

- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups:
	- n = 92 received cranberry capsules (two oral capsules once daily, containing 72 mg total of the active ingredient proanthocyanidin, equivalent to 600 mL cranberry juice).
	- n = 93 received a placebo (two matching capsules once daily).

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^114VsfN9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACs), which inhibit the adherence of p-fimbriated Escherichia coli to the urothelial cells lining the bladder. Cranberry products have been used widely for several decades to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the fifth update of a review first published in 1998 and updated in 2003, 2004, 2008, and 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 13 March 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products compared with placebo, no specific treatment, or other interventions (antibiotics, probiotics) for the prevention of UTIs were included.

### Cranberry juice and urinary tract infection [^113fcrBK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Cranberries have long been of interest for their potential benefits in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs). They contain two compounds with antiadherence properties that prevent fimbriated Escherichia coli from adhering to uroepithelial cells in the urinary tract. Approximately a dozen clinical trials have been conducted to test the effects of cranberries on the urinary tract. However, these trials suffer from several limitations. Most notably, the trials have used a variety of cranberry products, including cranberry juice concentrate, cranberry juice cocktail, and cranberry capsules, and have employed different dosing regimens. Further research is required to clarify unresolved questions regarding the role of cranberries in protecting against UTIs in general, and in women with anatomical abnormalities, in particular.

### The incidence of potential interactions between dietary supplements and prescription medications in cancer patients at a Veterans Administration hospital [^114ChuwC]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Use of dietary supplements and prescription medications is common among patients with cancer. This study examines potential interactions between dietary supplements and prescription medications in a Veteran Hospital cancer population.

- **Methods**: Eligible patients seen at the Hematology/Oncology clinic at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Cincinnati, OH, were administered a survey to determine their use of dietary supplements. Medication profiles were compiled from patients' medical charts and pharmacy records. It was also noted whether supplementation was previously documented. Potential interactions between dietary supplements and prescription medications were identified from a literature search of documented interactions. Several demographic factors, including age, race, marital status, education, and income, were assessed for differences between patients found to be at risk for interactions and those for whom no risks were identified.

- **Results**: Dietary supplements were used by 61% of patients. Multivitamins were the most common supplement (80.3%), followed by minerals (40.6%) and herbal preparations (24.8%). Of the 121 patients taking supplements, 65 patients (54%) reported taking more than one. A potential risk for interaction between dietary supplements and prescription medications was identified in 12% of patients taking supplements. Three patients were at risk for multiple interactions. Veterans who were not currently married were more likely to be at risk for interactions (P = 0.024). Only 28% of patients taking dietary supplements were noted.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: A 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113HPU9f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Globally, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in clinical practice, resulting in substantial clinical and economic burdens. Females are more susceptible, with nearly 1 in 3 females having at least one episode of UTI requiring antimicrobial therapy by the age of 24 years, approximately 50 to 70% experiencing a UTI during their lifetime, and approximately 20 to 40% of those who have had a UTI will have recurrent UTIs (rUTIs). UTIs are associated with pain and discomfort, which can cause stress and affect a patient's quality of life. The most common form of UTI is cystitis, an acute uncomplicated infection confined to the bladder. Cystitis remains one of the most common conditions requiring antimicrobial treatment, which is also highly effective as a prophylactic measure. However, continued use is often associated with antimicrobial resistance, which presents a major concern for healthcare systems.

- **Antimicrobial resistance concern**: The impact on antimicrobial resistance rates and subsequent health care and economic burden is of major concern. Establishing alternative safe and effective nonantibiotic therapies for the prevention of rUTIs in otherwise healthy females should be prioritized.

- **Cranberry as an alternative therapy**: Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) products have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic strategy. Components in the cranberry fruit, including proanthocyanidins and flavonoids, have been shown in both in vitro and ex vivo experiments to induce antiadhesive activity against uropathogenic Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cells. This results in impaired colonization and reduced subsequent infection.

### Management of grapefruit-drug interactions [^113jdMzX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Grapefruit is a healthy addition to a well-balanced diet. However, the fruit has been shown to affect the metabolism of many medications, increasing the risk of toxicity and adverse effects. Characteristics of oral medications that may interact with grapefruit include extensive metabolism through the intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 system, low bioavailability, and a narrow therapeutic index. Prominent medications known to interact with grapefruit include statins, antiarrhythmic agents, immunosuppressive agents, and calcium channel blockers. There are equally effective alternatives to these drug classes that do not have the potential to interact with grapefruit. These alternative drugs may be substituted if a patient experiences or is at risk of a grapefruit-drug interaction. Patients may also choose to exclude grapefruit from their diets and consume other fruits, including other types of citrus, to avoid an interaction.

### Black cohosh interactions with prescription medications associated with serotonin toxicity and rhabdomyolysis: A case report [^113n4MhV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Serotonin toxicity is a well-described phenomenon commonly attributed to various drug-drug combinations. Some unregulated herbal supplements have been implicated in the onset of serotonin toxicity. However, there is currently minimal literature available on the potential for black cohosh to contribute to rhabdomyolysis and serotonin toxicity, despite its known serotonergic properties.

A middle-aged woman presented to the emergency department with serotonin toxicity and rhabdomyolysis shortly after taking black cohosh supplements in the setting of long-term dual antidepressant use. The serotonin toxicity and rhabdomyolysis resolved with IV fluids, benzodiazepines, and discontinuation of the offending drugs.

- **Implications for emergency medicine**: Patients are sometimes not aware of how over-the-counter supplements might interact with their prescription medications. Female patients taking black cohosh to manage hot flashes and menopausal symptoms could be at risk for developing rhabdomyolysis and serotonin toxicity if they are also taking other serotonergic agents.

Participants: Females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) were recruited from various sources, including clinic site databases, shopping center washrooms, local hospitals, pharmacies, medical practices, urologist clinics, radio advertisements, newspaper articles, and social media. Inclusion criteria included females aged 18–65 years with a history of rUTI, defined as three or more UTIs in the last year, or two or fewer UTIs in the last six months. Participants needed to have a BMI greater than 17.5. Females with five UTIs within the last six months were excluded, as they may not respond to dietary supplementation. Exclusion criteria also included the use of antibiotics, such as prophylactic antibiotics, or any antibacterial products within 28 days prior to baseline, as these could interfere with study outcomes, as well as the regular use of Vaccinium containing products (e.g. all forms of blueberries, cranberries, bilberries, lingonberries, etc)

### Interactions of antiretroviral drugs with food, beverages, dietary supplements, and alcohol: A systematic review and meta-analyses [^115zQRgv]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). Low credibility.

Ingredients of grapefruit and Seville orange juices act as inhibitors of intestinal CYP enzymes, especially CYP3A4. Among antiretroviral drugs, protease inhibitors present the highest potential to interact with juices due to being extensively metabolized by CYP enzymes.

Amprenavir acts both as a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Juice ingredients can reduce amprenavir's first-pass metabolism by inhibiting intestinal CYP enzymes. Nevertheless, co-administration with 200 mL of grapefruit juice only slightly decreased amprenavir C max by 22% and delayed t max by 0.4 hours, without significantly affecting the AUC. These results indicate that the gut metabolism of amprenavir is low.

For indinavir, the mean AUC and C max values remained unchanged after co-intake with grapefruit juice. However, in one study, individual changes in indinavir AUC ranged from a 25% decrease to a 25% increase. Such high variability may negatively impact the treatment by either causing ineffectiveness or increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions.

After indinavir administration with Seville orange juice, no significant changes in AUC and C max occurred. However, t max was slightly longer by 0.6 hours, since the high amount of carbohydrates, especially pectins in juice, may delay gastric emptying.

In a study of saquinavir, AUC and C max significantly increased by 50% and 93%, respectively, after co-intake with grapefruit juice. By inhibiting intestinal CYP enzymes, juice ingredients reduced the extensive first-pass metabolism of saquinavir.

### Standardised high dose versus low dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extracts for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women [PACCANN]: a double blind randomised controlled trial protocol [^115fTjPa]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

This clinical trial aims to enroll sexually active, non-pregnant, non-lactating women aged 18 years and over, presenting with culture-confirmed recurrent urinary tract infections (r-UTI), defined as two or more UTIs in the past six months or three or more UTIs in the past 12 months. Participants will be recruited within the Laval University community in Quebec City, Canada, through listservs, local clinician referrals, posters in medical clinics, social media, paid advertising, and word of mouth. Women wishing to participate will contact the study coordinator, who will explain the research project and verify eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risks and benefits of the study will be thoroughly discussed, and the consent form will be signed at the first of three visits at the Institute on Nutrition and Functional Foods (INAF).

Potential participants must avoid exposure to systemic antimicrobial agents or cranberry derivatives in the two weeks preceding enrollment. Women with anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, history of renal disease (such as renal failure or nephrolithiasis), intestinal disease causing malabsorption (including Crohn's disease or Celiac disease), or those on anticoagulant therapy will be excluded. Additionally, women with a known allergy or intolerance to cranberries will not be eligible.

Concealed randomization will be generated using computer assistance.

### Lyrica [^114depSc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Since Lyrica is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism in humans (less than 2% of a dose is recovered in urine as metabolites), and does not bind to plasma proteins, its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other agents through metabolic interactions or protein binding displacement. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Lyrica is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Specifically, there are no pharmacokinetic interactions between pregabalin and the following antiepileptic drugs: carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and topiramate. Important pharmacokinetic interactions would also not be expected to occur between Lyrica and commonly used antiepileptic drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Multiple oral doses of Lyrica were co-administered with oxycodone, lorazepam, or ethanol. Although no pharmacokinetic interactions were seen, additive effects on cognitive and gross motor functioning were observed when Lyrica was co-administered with these drugs. No clinically important effects on respiration were noted.

### Fexinidazole [^114Ceg5S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid the use of herbal medicines and supplements during treatment with Fexinidazole Tablets. See full prescribing information for a complete list of clinically significant drug interactions.

- **Pharmacodynamic interactions**:
	- **Herbal medicines and supplements**: There is a potential for pharmacodynamic interactions and/or toxicities between fexinidazole and herbal medicines and supplements. Avoid concomitant use.
	- **Drugs that may prolong the QT interval and/or induce bradycardia**: Coadministration of Fexinidazole Tablets with drugs known to block potassium channels, such as antiarrhythmics, neuroleptics, fluoroquinolones, imidazole and triazole antifungals, and pentamidine, should be avoided. Additionally, drugs that prolong the QT interval, including antimalarials, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, terfenadine, astemizole, IV erythromycin, quinolone antibacterial drugs, and drugs that induce bradycardia, such as β-blockers, should also be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Common herbal dietary supplement-drug interactions [^114U6dZQ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Nearly 25% of U.S. adults report concurrently taking a prescription medication with a dietary supplement. Some supplements, such as St. John's wort and goldenseal, are known to cause clinically important drug interactions and should be avoided by most patients receiving any pharmacologic therapy. However, many other supplements are predicted to cause interactions based only on in vitro studies that have not been confirmed or have been refuted in human clinical trials.

Some supplements may cause interactions with a few medications but are likely to be safe with other medications (e.g. curcumin, echinacea, garlic, Asian ginseng, green tea extract, kava). Some supplements have a low likelihood of drug interactions and, with certain caveats, can safely be taken with most medications (e.g. black cohosh, cranberry, ginkgo, milk thistle, American ginseng, saw palmetto, valerian). Clinicians should consult reliable dietary supplement resources, or clinical pharmacists or pharmacologists, to help assess the safety of specific herbal supplement-drug combinations.

Because most patients do not disclose supplement use to clinicians, the most important strategy for detecting herb-drug interactions is to develop a trusting relationship that encourages patients to discuss their dietary supplement use.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^111bJ1UB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Cranberries, particularly in the form of cranberry juice, have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing such infections.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice and other cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

- **Search strategy**: Electronic databases and the Internet were searched using English and non-English language terms. Companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations were contacted. Reference lists of review articles and relevant trials were searched. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - the Cochrane Library, issue 1, 2003) was searched in February 2003.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of cranberry juice/products for the prevention of urinary tract infections in susceptible populations were included. Trials involving men, women, or children were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes, including urinary tract infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), side effects, and adherence to therapy. Relative risks (RR) were calculated where appropriate; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.

- **Main results**: Seven trials met the inclusion criteria (four cross-over, three parallel group). The effectiveness of cranberry juice (or cranberry products) in preventing UTIs was evaluated through these trials.

### Possible interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin [^115cnF5L]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Pomegranate juice is growing in popularity in the UK. We report a potential interaction between pomegranate juice and warfarin. Laboratory studies have shown that pomegranate juice inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in warfarin metabolism. As with previous reports of interactions between food and warfarin, this case does not definitively prove the association between pomegranate juice consumption and increased warfarin bioactivity but highlights the importance of taking a complete drug, food, and juice history when assessing patients with unstable anticoagulation.

### Lyrica [^111peX2W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Since Lyrica is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism in humans (less than 2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), and does not bind to plasma proteins, its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other agents through metabolic interactions or protein binding displacement. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Lyrica is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Specifically, there are no pharmacokinetic interactions between pregabalin and the following antiepileptic drugs: carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and topiramate. Important pharmacokinetic interactions would also not be expected to occur between Lyrica and commonly used antiepileptic drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Multiple oral doses of Lyrica were co-administered with oxycodone, lorazepam, or ethanol. Although no pharmacokinetic interactions were seen, additive effects on cognitive and gross motor functioning were seen when Lyrica was co-administered with these drugs. No clinically important effects on respiration were observed.

### Auryxia [^1116wE3i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Oral medications not listed in Table 2

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Auryxia and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separating the timing of the administration of the two drugs. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of concomitant medications that have a narrow therapeutic range.

When clinically significant drug interactions are expected, consider separating the timing of administration. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.

### Cranberry products and prevention of urinary tract infections [^115GDtHA]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Are cranberry products (juice, tablets, capsules, and syrup) associated with the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) compared with placebo or other treatments?

Cranberry products are not associated with the prevention of UTIs. However, the lack of association may be due to factors such as participant adherence, insufficient active ingredients in the cranberry products, or inadequate statistical power of the clinical trials.

### Natural health product-drug interactions: Evolving responsibilities to take complementary and alternative medicine into account [^113265zQ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Natural health products (NHPs), known as dietary supplements in the United States, are a popular form of self-care. However, many patients do not disclose their use to clinicians. NHP-drug interactions can occur, potentially harming patients and affecting the efficacy of conventional treatment. Using the example of an HIV-positive adolescent who had been responding well to antiretroviral therapy but then experienced a sudden, unexplained deterioration in her condition, this review examines several key areas:

- **Clinicians' obligation**: Inquire about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use when assessing, treating, and monitoring patients.
- **Duty to warn**: How clinicians' responsibility to inform about treatment risks has evolved and expanded.
- **Patients' and parents' responsibility**: The need to disclose CAM use.

The text also addresses the responsibility of hospitals and health facilities to ensure that the reality of widespread CAM/NHP use is considered in patient care to effectively protect patients from harm.

### Tasigna [^115FVDs9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Tasigna and for 14 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Drug interactions**: Advise patients that Tasigna and certain other medicines, including over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements (such as St. John's Wort), can interact with each other [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Taking Tasigna**: Advise patients to take Tasigna doses twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water.

	- Advise patients to take Tasigna on an empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours before the dose is taken and for at least 1 hour after the dose is taken. Patients should not consume grapefruit products and other foods that are known to inhibit CYP3A4 at any time during Tasigna treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

	- If the patient misses a dose of Tasigna, the patient should take the next scheduled dose at its regular time. The patient should not take two doses at the same time. If patients are unable to swallow capsules, the contents of each capsule may be dispersed in one teaspoon of applesauce and the mixture swallowed immediately (within 15 minutes).

- **Compliance**: Advise patients of the following:

	- Continue taking Tasigna every day for as long as their doctor tells them. This is a long-term treatment.
	- Do not change the dose or stop taking Tasigna without first consulting their doctor.
	- If a dose is missed, take the next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up for the missed capsule.

### Cranberry for prevention of urinary tract infections [^113yGYNG]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Traditionally, cranberry has been used for the treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections. Research suggests that its mechanism of action is preventing bacterial adherence to host cell surface membranes. Systematic reviews have concluded that no reliable evidence supports the use of cranberry in the treatment or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections; however, more recent randomized controlled trials demonstrate evidence of cranberry's utility in urinary tract infection prophylaxis. Supporting studies in humans are lacking for other clinical uses of cranberry. Cranberry is a safe, well-tolerated herbal supplement that does not have significant drug interactions.

### Myrbetriq [^111wW8z3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the magnitude of these interactions on the pharmacokinetic parameters and the recommendations for dose adjustment, if any:

- **Dose adjustment with solifenacin succinate or tamsulosin**: Although no dose adjustment is recommended based on the lack of pharmacokinetic interaction, Myrbetriq should be administered with caution to patients taking muscarinic antagonist medications for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) and in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) because of the risk of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **CYP2D6 inhibition by mirabegron**: Since mirabegron is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure to CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol and desipramine is increased when coadministered with mirabegron. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary, especially with narrow therapeutic index CYP2D6 substrates, such as thioridazine, flecainide, and propafenone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Combination therapy with digoxin**: For patients initiating a combination of mirabegron and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should initially be prescribed. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to achieve the desired clinical effect [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. The same approach for the dose of digoxin should be followed when digoxin is coadministered with mirabegron and solifenacin succinate.

- **Warfarin interaction study**: Warfarin was administered as a single 25 mg dose of the racemate (a mixture of R-warfarin and S-warfarin). Based on this single-dose study, mirabegron had no effect on the warfarin pharmacodynamics.

### Effects of cranberry juice consumption on vascular function in patients with coronary artery disease [^1179B4cz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cranberry juice contains polyphenolic compounds that could improve endothelial function and reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

- **Objective**: The objective was to examine the effects of cranberry juice on vascular function in subjects with coronary artery disease.

- **Design**: We completed an acute pilot study with no placebo (n = 15) and a chronic placebo-controlled crossover study (n = 44) that examined the effects of cranberry juice on vascular function in subjects with coronary artery disease.

- **Results**: In the chronic crossover study, subjects with coronary heart disease consumed a research preparation of double-strength cranberry juice (54% juice, 835 mg total polyphenols, and 94 mg anthocyanins) or a matched placebo beverage (480 mL/d) for 4 weeks each, with a 2-week rest period between beverages. Beverage order was randomly assigned, and participants refrained from consuming other flavonoid-containing beverages during the study. Vascular function was measured before and after each beverage, with follow-up testing ≥ 12 hours after consumption of the last beverage. Mean (± SD) carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, a measure of central aortic stiffness, decreased after cranberry juice (8.3 ± 2.3 to 7.8 ± 2.2 m/s) in contrast with an increase after placebo (8.0 ± 2.0 to 8.4 ± 2.8 m/s) (P = 0.003). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, digital pulse amplitude tonometry, blood pressure, and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity did not change. In the uncontrolled pilot study, we observed improved brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (7.7 ± 2.9% to 8.7 ± 3.1%, P = 0.01).

### The role of metabolism (and the microbiome) in defining the clinical efficacy of dietary flavonoids [^113ujdub]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The potential impact of prescribed medication use on flavonoid metabolism is significant. Because flavonoids and many prescribed medications share phase I and II metabolic processes, the effects of dietary flavonoid (and other bioactive) intake on drug ADME and dosing amounts have been of research and clinical interest for several decades. The impact of grapefruit consumption on cytochrome-3A4 activity and the metabolism of a large number of drug groups, such as calcium channel antagonists, β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl–CoA reductase inhibitors, and antihistamines, represents a widely cited example.

Although unknown, it is likely that drug use affects flavonoid metabolism and, ultimately, tissue total and metabolite flavonoid exposure and dose-response relations. The multiplicity of transferases with overlapping substrate specificity and likely considerable redundancy in phase I and II metabolic capacities may mean that there is little impact of single drug use on flavonoid metabolism in the majority of the population. However, in select subgroups, such as older adults who commonly consume a drug cocktail and may experience age-related declines in metabolic capacity, or in individuals with gene variants associated with reduced expression or compromised function of key enzymes, habitual drug use may be important.

### Juluca [^11327GkU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions**: The concomitant use of Juluca and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Juluca and possible development of resistance. Additionally, there could be possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.4)].

In healthy subjects, 75 mg once daily of rilpivirine (3 times the dose in Juluca) and 300 mg once daily (12 times the dose in Juluca) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Consider alternatives to Juluca when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.

See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with Juluca; review concomitant medications during therapy with Juluca; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.

### Use of prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements among older adults in the United States [^113edwXs]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Despite concerns about drug safety, information on older adults' use of prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements is limited.

- **Objective**: To estimate the prevalence and patterns of medication use among older adults (including conUse), and potential major drug-drug interactions.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Three thousand five community-residing individuals, aged 57 through 85 years, were drawn from a cross-sectional, nationally representative probability sample of the United States. In-home interviews, including medication logs, were administered between June 2005 and March 2006. Medication use was defined as prescription, over-the-counter, and dietary supplements used "on a regular schedule, like every day or every week". ConUse was defined as the regular use of at least 2 medications.

- **Main outcome measure**: Population estimates of the prevalence of medication use, conUse, and potential major drug-drug interactions, stratified by age group and gender.

- **Results**: The unweighted survey response rate was 74.8% (weighted response rate, 75.5%). Eighty-one percent (95% confidence interval, 79.4%-83.5%) used at least 1 prescription medication; 42% (95% CI, 39.7%-44.8%) used at least 1 over-the-counter medication; and 49% (95% CI, 46.2%-52.7%) used a dietary supplement. Twenty-nine percent (95% CI, 26.6%-30.6%) used at least 5 prescription medications concurrently; this was highest among men (37.1%; 95% CI, 31.7%-42.4%) and women (36.0%; 95% CI, 30.2%-41.9%) aged 75 to 85 years.

### Paxlovid [^1162CXnM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Co-administration of Paxlovid can alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs, and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of Paxlovid. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during Paxlovid therapy, and review concomitant medications during Paxlovid therapy.

- **Potential for Paxlovid to affect other drugs**: Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir co-packaged with ritonavir) is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp, and OATP1B1. Co-administration of Paxlovid with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6, or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1, may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Co-administration of Paxlovid with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2]. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 2.

- **Potential for other drugs to affect Paxlovid**: Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce Paxlovid's therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2].

- **Established and other potentially significant drug interactions**: Table 2 provides a listing of clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated interactions.

### Are emergency department patients at risk for herb-drug interactions [^112Ma6SW]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To determine the prevalence of herbal and/or dietary supplement use and identify patients at risk for herb-drug interactions.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of 944 patients was surveyed to determine the prevalence and types of supplements used. Patients with heart disease, diabetes, psychiatric disorders, and/or hypertension were assessed for potential interactions.

- **Results**: One hundred thirty-five (14.3%) patients reported regular use. Of these, 79.3% were taking supplements concurrently with prescription medications, and 80.0% were administered medication(s) in the emergency department.
	- **Cardiac**: 19.8% (n = 33) reported regular use, with four potential interactions.
	- **Hypertension**: 20.3% (n = 54) reported regular use, with two potential interactions.
	- **Diabetes**: 15.9% (n = 20) reported regular use, with no known interactions.
	- **Psychiatric**: 15.9% (n = 10) reported regular use, with one potential interaction.

- **Conclusions**: Six patients were identified at risk for seven known herb-drug interactions. The prevalence of undisclosed herbal supplement use and lack of research on these supplements suggest that more patients may be at risk.

### Interaction of flurbiprofen with cranberry juice, grape juice, tea, and fluconazole: In vitro and clinical studies [^113NdSsd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Recent anecdotal, unvalidated case reports have suggested potentiation of warfarin-induced anticoagulation by cranberry juice, possibly through inhibition of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, the enzyme responsible for the clearance of the active S-enantiomer of warfarin. To address this question, the effect of cranberry juice and other beverages on CYP2C9 activity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

- **Methods**: The effects of four beverages on CYP2C9 activity were studied in human liver microsomes, using flurbiprofen hydroxylation as the index reaction. In a clinical study, 14 healthy volunteers received 100 mg flurbiprofen on five occasions in a crossover fashion, with at least 1 week separating the five trials. Flurbiprofen was preceded in random sequence by the following: (1) cranberry juice placebo (8 oz), (2) cranberry juice (8 oz), (3) brewed tea (8 oz), (4) grape juice (8 oz), and (5) fluconazole, a CYP2C9 inhibitor serving as a positive control, with 8 oz of water.

- **Results**: Flurbiprofen hydroxylation in vitro was reduced to 11% ± 8% of control by 2.5% (vol/vol) brewed tea, to 10% ± 7% of control by grape juice, to 56% ± 16% of control by cranberry juice, to 85% ± 5% of control by cranberry juice placebo, and to 21% ± 6% of control by the index inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.5 micromol/L) (P < .01 for all comparisons versus control). Flurbiprofen clearance (29–33 mL/min) and elimination half-life (3.3–3.4 hours) did not differ significantly among trials 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, clearance in the fluconazole treatment condition (trial 5) was significantly reduced.
