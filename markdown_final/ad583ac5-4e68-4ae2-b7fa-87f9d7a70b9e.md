## Question

What do we order before we initiate a patient on TNF inhibitors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what tests and screenings should be ordered before starting a patient on TNF inhibitors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-yield infectious screening, especially tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Then, I should verify viral hepatitis C and HIV considerations. Next, I will review baseline hematologic and hepatic labs, followed by disease-specific screening such as chest radiography and endemic fungal risks. After that, I need to check immunization status and contraindications like demyelinating disease and heart failure. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation, and a concise summary algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and labels before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the infectious risk hierarchy, because TNF blockade materially increases the risk of TB reactivation and new infection, and this is the most consequential pre-initiation domain. I should screen all patients for latent and active TB using a chest radiograph plus an interferon-gamma release assay, recognizing that IGRA is preferred over TST in immunosuppressed or BCG-vaccinated patients, while acknowledging that dual testing can increase sensitivity in high-risk settings and that a 5 mm TST threshold applies if TST is used for TNF candidates [^113idHpZ] [^112h7VhA] [^114onWrh] [^112tDeVx]. Wait, let me verify the timing of treatment for LTBI; guidelines support completing at least several weeks of LTBI therapy before starting the TNF inhibitor when feasible, and if disease severity demands earlier biologic initiation, it can proceed after 1–2 months of LTBI therapy if adherence and tolerability are assured, with close follow-up for breakthrough TB despite prophylaxis [^115etmR2] [^114hpXw9].

> I need to ensure hepatitis B screening is comprehensive because reactivation can be severe and even fatal with TNF blockade. I should order HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc to define susceptibility, immunity, or chronic infection, and if HBsAg is positive, I should consult hepatology and consider prophylactic antiviral therapy with entecavir or tenofovir before or at TNF initiation, with continued antiviral treatment through therapy and for at least 12 months after immunosuppression ends, plus periodic HBV DNA and LFT monitoring during and after treatment [^116CH8Vk] [^113pYHEM]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across agents; yes, all TNF inhibitors carry HBV reactivation risk and mandate pre-treatment HBV testing per FDA labeling and guidelines [^114gMw82] [^115HvkpH].

> Next, I should review hepatitis C, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize universal screening where prevalence is low. Universal HCV screening is reasonable and commonly recommended, but in low-prevalence settings, targeted screening based on risk factors may suffice; in either case, if HCV is active, I should coordinate management and consider that TNF therapy is not absolutely contraindicated, though coordination with hepatology is prudent [^116CH8Vk] [^1134Vc5T]. Let me reconsider whether any major society mandates universal HCV screening before TNF; while many centers screen broadly, some data in low-prevalence dermatology cohorts support targeted strategies, so I should align with local policy and patient risk profile [^1134Vc5T] [^116CH8Vk].

> I will now examine HIV screening, and I should confirm that recommendations are risk-based rather than universal. HIV testing is advised based on patient risk factors and local epidemiology, and in patients with HIV, TNF inhibitors can be used if HAART achieves viral suppression and immune reconstitution, ideally with CD4 normalization and no recent opportunistic infection, in coordination with infectious diseases [^115HvkpH] [^116CH8Vk]. Hold on, I should verify that no guideline mandates universal HIV screening before TNF; correct, testing is at clinician discretion guided by risk, though many centers adopt routine screening as best practice [^116CH8Vk].

> Let me think about baseline hematologic and hepatic laboratories, because cytopenias and transaminitis can occur with TNF therapy. I should obtain a CBC with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes, and document baseline values to contextualize future abnormalities; annual monitoring thereafter is conditionally recommended in pediatric and adult rheumatology contexts, with closer intervals if clinical concerns arise or if using agents like infliximab where hepatotoxicity has been reported [^116FA9BL] [^1179hUzE] [^111274MZ]. Wait, I should double-check whether dermatology guidelines de-emphasize routine labs; yes, some dermatology guidance allows physician discretion for routine CBC/CMP except with infliximab, where LFTs should be repeated periodically, so I need to tailor frequency to agent and risk [^1119kax7] [^113XDk7S].

> Next, I should review chest radiography, and I need to ensure I do not conflate TB screening with general lung disease assessment. A chest radiograph is indicated as part of TB screening before TNF initiation and can reveal prior granulomatous disease or alternative pathology; in patients with bronchiectasis, chronic cough, or radiographic abnormalities suggesting NTM, a noncontrast chest CT may be warranted to exclude active NTM before immunosuppression, recognizing that routine CT is not universal [^113idHpZ] [^112h7VhA] [^113bBpyh]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; CT is reserved for selected patients with clinical or radiographic clues, not for all-comers, so I should apply this selectively based on history and CXR findings [^113bBpyh].

> I should confirm endemic fungal risk assessment, particularly histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis, because TNF blockade increases the risk of severe disseminated disease. In patients from or with exposure to endemic regions, I should assess symptoms and consider chest radiography if there is a history suggestive of recent or active histoplasmosis; if there is suspicion, I should treat with itraconazole for at least 3 months before TNF initiation and, if TNF is still required, continue antifungal therapy for at least a year with symptom and antigen surveillance, while for coccidioidomycosis, baseline serology and clinical vigilance are advised without routine prophylaxis in asymptomatic patients [^111TEc1a] [^113PxkGC]. Wait, I should verify that routine serologic screening is not recommended for all; correct, targeted testing based on exposure and symptoms is the prudent approach [^113PxkGC] [^111TEc1a].

> Let me consider immunizations next, and I need to ensure timing relative to TNF initiation. I should update influenza, pneumococcal, and herpes zoster vaccination as indicated, ideally completing live vaccines at least 4 weeks before starting TNF therapy, and avoid live vaccines during treatment. For zoster, the recombinant vaccine is preferred in immunocompromised hosts when available [^111iwbLp] [^116CH8Vk]. Hold on, I should verify that live vaccines are contraindicated during TNF therapy; yes, live vaccines should be avoided while on TNF inhibitors, reinforcing the need to complete indicated live vaccines pre-initiation when feasible [^111iwbLp] [^116CH8Vk].

> I will now examine contraindications and special precautions, and I should confirm absolute versus relative issues. Active serious infection is a contraindication to TNF initiation, and moderate-to-severe heart failure, particularly NYHA class III–IV, should prompt avoidance; demyelinating disease or a first-degree relative with MS warrants caution or avoidance given reported associations with demyelination; malignancy history requires individualized risk–benefit discussion and may shift selection toward non-TNF options depending on type and remission status [^116HZbnu] [^114CHPsC]. But wait, what if the patient has only mild HF; in that case, I should verify ejection fraction and consider cardiology input before proceeding, recognizing that data are stronger for avoiding TNF in advanced HF [^114CHPsC] [^116HZbnu].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pediatrics, and I need to ensure I apply pediatric-specific thresholds. For children with IBD starting anti-TNF therapy, dual TB screening with TST and IGRA is recommended, using a 5 mm TST cutoff, and if either is positive, obtain a chest radiograph and treat LTBI for at least 2 months before initiating TNF therapy; annual risk assessment and selective retesting are advised during ongoing therapy, with heightened vigilance in those on corticosteroids or triple immunosuppression [^112efXzs] [^115H14dw]. Let me verify that adult IBD guidance also supports IGRA-first strategies; yes, adult IBD guidelines similarly endorse IGRA-based screening with CXR and treatment of LTBI before biologic initiation, aligning practice across ages [^112h7VhA] [^115etmR2].

> I should double-check pregnancy and reproductive considerations, and I need to separate safety from teratogenicity. TNF inhibitors are generally considered compatible with preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum periods, and should not be withheld solely due to pregnancy when clinically indicated, though shared decision-making and maternal–fetal consultation are appropriate [^115etmR2]. Hold on, I should verify that no guideline advises routine discontinuation before conception; correct, current guidance supports continuation when disease control is needed in pregnancy planning and during gestation [^115etmR2].

> Documentation and shared decision-making are essential, and I need to ensure the record captures risk counseling. I should document baseline disease activity metrics, infection screening results and actions taken, vaccination status, and explicit counseling on infection risks, malignancy signals, and the need to report fevers or respiratory symptoms promptly. This supports quality metrics and safe care pathways in IBD and rheumatology centers [^113pYHEM] [^112h7VhA]. Wait, let me verify that centers track LTBI screening as a quality indicator; yes, LTBI screening and prophylaxis completion are core quality indicators in IBD programs, reinforcing the need to record and close these loops [^113pYHEM].

> Finally, let me synthesize a concise, actionable summary to ensure nothing critical is missed. Mandatory elements before TNF initiation include TB screening with CXR and IGRA (or dual testing in high-risk patients), treatment of LTBI when detected, HBV triple serology with antiviral prophylaxis for HBsAg-positive patients, CBC and CMP for baseline hematologic and hepatic status, and an immunization review with live vaccines completed in advance when feasible. Additional steps include HCV and HIV risk-based testing, chest radiography for TB screening with CT reserved for selected lung disease, endemic fungal risk assessment with targeted diagnostics and pre-emptive therapy if indicated, and explicit contraindication checks for active infection, advanced heart failure, demyelinating disease, and recent malignancy, all documented with shared decision-making and specialty coordination as needed [^113idHpZ] [^112h7VhA] [^116CH8Vk] [^113pYHEM] [^111iwbLp] [^114onWrh]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis aligns with FDA labels and major guidelines. Yes, these steps reflect consensus recommendations from EULAR, BSG/ECCO, AGA, AAD-NPF, and FDA labeling across TNF agents, with pediatric nuances integrated where applicable [^113idHpZ] [^112h7VhA] [^115etmR2] [^115HvkpH] [^114onWrh].

Before starting TNF inhibitors, order a **comprehensive infectious screening** (TB with IGRA or TST plus chest radiograph [^113idHpZ], hepatitis B/C serology [^116CH8Vk], and HIV test) [^116CH8Vk] and **baseline labs** (CBC, LFTs, and creatinine) [^116FA9BL]. Also assess **vaccination status** (update influenza, pneumococcus, and varicella as indicated) [^111iwbLp] and screen for **latent TB**, treating positives before initiation [^112h7VhA]. These steps reduce serious infections and enable safe monitoring during therapy [^111RhqL1].

## Infectious disease screening

### Tuberculosis (TB) screening

- **IGRA or TST**: Perform IGRA (preferred) or TST [^113idHpZ] to screen for latent TB [^112h7VhA].
- **Chest radiograph**: Obtain a chest radiograph to exclude active TB or prior disease [^115ZcUi2].
- **Treat latent TB**: Initiate isoniazid or rifampin-based therapy for ≥ 2 months before starting TNF inhibitors [^notfound].

---

### Viral hepatitis screening

- **Hepatitis B**: Test HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs; if HBsAg-positive, start antiviral prophylaxis and monitor HBV DNA during therapy [^113pYHEM].
- **Hepatitis C**: Screen with anti-HCV; if positive, confirm with HCV RNA and manage before TNF initiation [^116CH8Vk].
- **HIV**: Perform baseline HIV screening in all patients [^116qCsfx].

---

### Other infections

Consider **histoplasmosis** screening in endemic areas or with suggestive symptoms [^111TEc1a]; **varicella** immunity should be confirmed or vaccination completed before therapy [^1161c7Gg].

---

## Baseline laboratory tests

### Hematologic assessment

Obtain a **complete blood count (CBC)** with differential to detect cytopenias or marrow suppression [^116CH8Vk].

---

### Hepatic and renal function assessment

Obtain **liver function tests (LFTs)** to screen for hepatic disease and establish a baseline for hepatotoxicity monitoring [^116CH8Vk], and **renal function tests** (serum creatinine) to assess baseline renal function.

6 Clinical performance of IGRAs in patients on anti-TNF therapy

Three studies to date report on the performance of IGRAs in patients already on anti-TNF agents. Neither corticosteroids nor DMARDs significantly affected the QFT-Gold in-tube response in patients with inflammatory rheumatic conditions, but the odds for a positive IFN-γ result were decreased in patients treated with TNFα inhibitors. In a second study, the magnitude of the IFN-γ response measured by ELISpot also significantly decreased 14 weeks after the start of anti-TNF treatment. In a third recent study using QFT-G, 2 patients with positive IGRA results at 12 months of adalimumab therapy developed active TB. The performance of IGRAs during anti-TNF treatment therefore needs to be systematically assessed to determine whether these tests can be used, if required, for regular screening of patients on anti-TNF agents in high prevalence countries or after an exposure event. In addition, alternative cytokine read-outs should be assessed to see if they are more robust to TNF blockade.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease [^115kTZwA]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease — the guideline states that the current evidence supports the use of reactive TDM to guide treatment changes in patients with active IBD who are being treated with anti-TNF agents or thiopurines; however, there is insufficient evidence to inform on the use of routine proactive TDM with anti-TNF agents in patients with quiescent disease. For thiopurines, routine proactive thiopurine metabolite monitoring is not recommended in patients with quiescent IBD. Current evidence supports testing for TPMT enzyme or genotype before initiation of a thiopurine; however, this is not a replacement for routine laboratory monitoring with CBC and liver enzymes after starting therapy. To support implementation, a clinical decision support tool on when to perform TDM and how to interpret TDM when patients are taking an anti-TNF agent or a thiopurine has been provided. Knowledge gaps include that it is unclear whether TDM should be performed during induction therapy in patients with suboptimal response and, if it is performed, what the target trough concentrations should be; similarly, target trough concentrations in the reactive setting during maintenance are unclear and whether they should differ by disease phenotype, disease state, and treatment target. Further studies are needed to better define clinically meaningful vs insignificant anti-drug antibodies, and well-designed RCTs are needed that compare routine proactive TDM vs reactive TDM and empiric dosing changes and evaluate frequency and timing; as newer biologic agents are approved, the use of TDM to optimize these drugs will need to be evaluated.

AGA guideline — therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease: In adults with active IBD treated with anti-TNF agents, "the AGA suggests reactive therapeutic drug monitoring to guide treatment changes" and this is labeled "Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence". In adult patients with quiescent IBD treated with anti-TNF agents, "the AGA makes no recommendation regarding the use of routine proactive therapeutic drug monitoring". For thiopurines, "In adult patients with IBD being started on thiopurines, the AGA suggests routine TPMT testing (enzymatic activity or genotype) to guide thiopurine dosing", and "Routine laboratory monitoring, including CBC, should be performed, regardless of TPMT testing results". In adults treated with thiopurines who have active IBD or suspected thiopurine toxicity, "the AGA suggests reactive thiopurine metabolite monitoring to guide treatment changes"; when metabolites are measured in active IBD-related symptoms, "we suggest a target 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) cutoff between 230–450 pmol/8 × 10⁸ RBCs when used as monotherapy; optimal 6-TGN cutoff when thiopurines are used in combination with anti-TNF agents is uncertain". In adult patients with quiescent IBD treated with thiopurines, "the AGA suggests against routine thiopurine metabolite monitoring".

Regarding diagnostic investigations for reactive arthritis, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to screen for latent tuberculosis before initiating biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, and/or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration) in patients at increased risk for latent tuberculosis. Follow national and/or international guidelines for screening latent tuberculosis, including a CXR and IGRA over tuberculin skin test where available.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) screening before anti-TNFα therapy: The history of receipt of 2 doses of varicella vaccine should be obtained; if a patient has not received 2 doses, immunity should be documented by measuring VZV IgG antibody in blood before initiation of anti-TNFα therapy; a history of disease is not reliable unless confirmatory diagnostic testing was performed with available results; in adults with IBD, the positive and negative predictive values for a reported history of VZV exposure were 93% and 0%, respectively.

### Impact of dosing on treatment with TNF inhibitors: managing dose adjustment [^113gCTeE]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represented a significant advance in the treatment of this debilitating disease, and led to dramatic changes in overall treatment goals and guidelines. Despite these advances, best practice use of TNF inhibitors in the clinical setting still needs to be determined. In particular, although all TNF inhibitors have standard, recommended doses that were determined in clinical trials, dose adjustments are often necessary in clinical practice to optimize therapeutic outcomes for individual patients. Dose escalation may be necessary in patients who experience disease flares, or because of insufficient initial efficacy or loss of efficacy over time, while dose tapering can be a response to adverse events, or if a patient achieves remission of disease. The amount of available evidence for managing dose adjustments for the currently available TNF inhibitors varies, and thus the strategies used with each are different. At present, although dose adjustments are common, data are insufficient for consensus guidelines to be recommended.

### International ASAS consensus statement for the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor agents in patients with ankylosing spondylitis [^115t8qJb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain an international consensus about the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF alpha) for treating patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Methods

These recommendations were developed by a review of published reports in combination with expert opinion, including a Delphi exercise, and a consensus meeting of the ASsessments in AS (ASAS) Working Group.

Results

The final consensus comprises the following requirements: (1) For the initiation of anti-TNF alpha therapy: (a) a diagnosis of definitive AS; (b) presence of active disease for at least four weeks as defined by both a sustained Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) of at least 4 and an expert opinion based on clinical features, acute phase reactants, and imaging modalities; (c) presence of refractory disease defined by failure of at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a single three month period, failure of intra-articular steroids if indicated, and failure of sulfasalazine in patients with peripheral arthritis; (d) application and implementation of the usual precautions and contraindications for biological therapy. (2) For the monitoring of anti-TNF alpha therapy: both the BASDAI and the ASAS core set for clinical practice should be followed regularly. (3) For the discontinuation of anti-TNF alpha therapy: in non-responders, consideration should be made after 6–12 weeks' treatment. Response is defined as improvement of (a) at least 50% or 2 units (on a 0–10 scale) of the BASDAI, (b) expert opinion that treatment should be continued.

Conclusion

This consensus statement on anti-TNF alpha treatment in AS may be used for guidance in clinical decision making and as the basis for the development of guidelines. Evaluation of the healthcare consequences of this consensus is subject to further research by the ASAS group.

### Adalimumab-fkjp (adalimumab) [^1173rUZ4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-fkjp and periodically during therapy.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-fkjp, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of ≥ 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette- Guerin (BCG).

Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-fkjp in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-fkjp treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-fkjp.

Discontinue Adalimumab-fkjp if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^113PxkGC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Recipients of biologic response modifiers — baseline testing and prophylaxis stance: For patients in the endemic area, we recommend screening with Coccidioides serology prior to initiation of biologic response modifier therapy, as well as regular clinical follow-up for new signs and symptoms (strong, very low), and we do not recommend regular serologic screening or antifungal prophylaxis in asymptomatic patients taking BRM (strong, very low). BRMs such as inhibitors of TNF-α seem to increase the risk of coccidioidomycosis and particularly of disseminated disease, but no studies of primary prevention using azoles or other antifungal therapy have been published, and the value of obtaining regular serologies on patients taking BRM has not been formally evaluated.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the story continues [^115SAWuf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Other recent prospective and retrospective studies that support early intervention with TNF inhibitors in adult and paediatric patients with CD are summarized inOverall, although the data on early intervention are promising, results must be interpreted with caution due to limitations associated with studies performed to date. This is emphasized by the ECCO guidelines, which note that TNF inhibitors may be more effective if introduced earlier in the disease course, but with the caveat that results are based on post hoc analyses from clinical trials.

There are currently limited data on the efficacy of early intervention with TNF inhibitors in UC, and results suggest that this strategy may offer limited benefits to this patient population. Yet, it is difficult to draw conclusions, as most of the study populations are small. Despite the 'very low' quality of this evidence, the AGA recommends the early use of TNF inhibitors for adults with moderate-to-severe UC (with or without an immunomodulator) rather than a step-up approach. The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology also currently suggests early use of TNF inhibitors if patients fail to respond to steroid treatment within 2 weeks of therapy. Further long-term, large-scale studies are needed in UC to clarify whether TNF inhibitors can modify the disease course and prevent progression, especially if used early.

5.2.4.3 Assessment after anti-TNF induction therapy

Good Practice Recommendation 15. All IBD patients should be reviewed 2–4 weeks after completing loading doses of anti-TNF therapy to assess response and optimise maintenance dosing based on clinical response and measures such as serum drug and anti-drug antibody concentrations, blood inflammatory markers, faecal biomarkers or endoscopy (Agreement: 82.5%).

Clinical response to anti-TNF agents is seen early in Crohn's disease and UC. Non-responders to induction therapy seem to have little benefit from sustained treatment, as shown in the ACCENT and CHARM studies. A clinical assessment should be made 2–4 weeks after loading doses have been given. For those who have responded, dose optimisation is recommended. If a response is unclear, then measurement of biomarkers, serum C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin, or comparison of disease activity scores or PROMs with baseline values, may be helpful. For those with complete lack of response, treatment should be discontinued and alternatives considered (choosing a different class of therapy). Further data are needed on the use of drug level monitoring during induction to guide therapy. Much of the data on drug levels after induction is at a later time point, such as 14 weeks after starting infliximab in the TAILORIX study (see below). Observational data in UC show that higher infliximab drug levels at weeks 2 and 6 during induction therapy are associated with early mucosal healing, but there are no prospective studies using drug levels at these early time points to guide dose adjustment.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adult-onset Still's disease, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to screen for latent tuberculosis before initiating biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, and/or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration) in patients at increased risk for latent tuberculosis. Follow national and/or international guidelines for screening latent tuberculosis, including a CXR and IGRA over tuberculin skin test where available.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that is antiproliferative and immunosuppressive: it impairs DNA synthesis (via inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase), decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and induces lymphocyte apoptosis. Methotrexate is mainly used to treat Crohn's disease; the use of methotrexate in patients with ulcerative colitis is controversial. A recent study of 179 patients with active ulcerative colitis found that 91 patients (51%) achieved steroid-free response with methotrexate induction therapy; however, in the 84 patients who then received maintenance therapy, methotrexate was not superior to placebo in the prevention of relapse. Adverse events in patients receiving methotrexate treatment include myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, both of which are dose-dependent.

Despite this, there is a lack of data available evaluating methotrexate therapy in IBD, and there are no societal recommendations for monitoring hepatotoxicity. The authors recommend complete blood count and liver function tests before, and 1 month after, initiation of methotrexate. If liver function test results are elevated, then the authors recommend reducing the methotrexate dose. In patients with normal test results remaining on methotrexate, the authors recommend repeating these tests every 2 to 4 months. Simultaneous treatment with folic acid can reduce the adverse events associated with methotrexate treatment, and is advisable. Several polymorphisms in enzymes involved in the metabolism of folic acid are associated with the toxicity of methotrexate, though study results are conflicting.

Biologic Agents

Anti-TNF Agents

The introduction of biologic agents has greatly improved the management of IBD. However, primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response are significant clinical problems, particularly with anti-TNF agents. In 2011, Ben-Horin and Chowersreviewed the literature on the loss of response to anti-TNF agents in Crohn's disease. They found that 23% to 46% of patients who initially responded to anti-TNF agents had experienced the secondary loss of response based on the need for dose intensification by 12 months of therapy. Several factors can cause nonresponse or loss of response, including patient characteristics such as increased body mass index, female sex, increased age, and severely active IBD leading to high inflammatory burden and fecal loss of the drug. Parenteral administration of large molecule biologic agents can lead to the development of ADAs (immunogenicity) that reduce serum active-drug concentrations, and this is the main cause of loss of response to anti-TNF agents.–In addition to the use of thiopurines in combination with biologic agents to reduce immunogenicity, other immunosuppressants, mainly methotrexate, can be of similar use.

### Role for therapeutic drug monitoring during induction therapy with TNF antagonists in IBD: evolution in the definition and management of primary nonresponse [^114Y8ES2]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Primary nonresponse and primary nonremission are important limitations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, occurring in 10% to 40% and 50% to 80% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. The magnitude of primary nonresponse differs between phase III clinical trials and cohort studies, indicating differences, e.g., in definition, patient population or blinding. The causes of nonresponse can be attributed to the drug (pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity), the patient (genetics, disease activity), the disease (type, location, severity), and/or the treatment strategy (dosing regimen, combination therapy). Primary nonresponse has been attributed to "non-TNF-driven disease" which is an overly simplified and potentially misleading approach to the problem. Many patients with primary nonresponse could successfully be treated with dose optimization during the induction phase or switching to another TNF antagonist. Therefore, primary nonresponse is frequently not a non-TNF-driven disease. Recent studies from rheumatoid arthritis and preliminary data from inflammatory bowel disease evaluating therapeutic drug monitoring have suggested that early measurement of drug and anti-drug antibody concentrations could help to define primary nonresponse and rationalize patient management of this problem. Moreover, a modeling approach including pharmacological parameters and patient-related covariants could potentially be predictive for response to the treatment. We describe an overview of this evolution in thinking, underpinned by previous findings, and assess the potential role of early measurement of drug and antidrug antibody concentrations in the definition and management of primary nonresponse.

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115PWMQ7]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Anti–tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti‑TNF‑α) therapy — tuberculosis screening and management: For patients who will undergo anti‑TNF‑α therapy, a chest radiograph is recommended prior to treatment and a tuberculin skin test is recommended to screen for latent TB prior to treatment. In patients with chest radiograph findings consistent with prior TB or a positive tuberculin skin test and/or who are high‑risk individuals, active TB infection should be excluded prior to treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab. For patients with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, active prophylactic treatment following published guidelines before initiation of anti‑TNF‑α therapy is recommended, and for latent M tuberculosis who will undergo anti‑TNF‑α therapy, close monitoring for TB is recommended for up to 6 months after discontinuing therapy. If symptoms indicative of TB develop, prompt evaluation for active disease is recommended.

### Proactive infectious disease approach to dermatologic patients who are taking tumor necrosis factor-alfa antagonists: part I. risks associated with tumor necrosis factor-alfa antagonists [^116Aqk6N]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alfa levels are linked to disease severity in patients with inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis. Inhibitors of this cytokine are commonly used with significant success in the treatment of such inflammatory disorders. Their use, however, can be plagued by infectious complications. An awareness of potential infections associated with these therapies is critical in order to maximize preventive efforts both before and during therapy. This review provides a guide for dermatologists caring for patients in need of this type of biologic therapy to preemptively address the infectious risks. Part I of this continuing medical education article reviews background information on the various infectious risks associated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy and appropriate historical data to obtain in the context of pretherapy evaluations.

### Ritlecitinib (Litfulo) [^1119ivSp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Serious Infections

Serious infections have been reported in patients receiving LITFULO. The most frequent serious infections have been appendicitis, COVID-19 infection (including pneumonia), and sepsis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, multi-dermatomal herpes zoster was reported with LITFULO.

Avoid use of LITFULO in patients with an active, serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating LITFULO in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to TB
with a history of serious infection or an opportunistic infection
who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses, or
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with LITFULO. Interrupt LITFULO if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with LITFULO should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. LITFULO may be resumed once the infection is controlled.

Tuberculosis

Screen patients for tuberculosis (TB) before starting therapy. LITFULO should not be given to patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be started prior to initiating therapy with LITFULO in patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or previously untreated latent TB. In patients with a negative latent TB test, consider anti-TB therapy before initiating treatment with LITFULO in those at high risk and consider screening patients at high risk for TB during treatment with LITFULO.

Viral Reactivation

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was reported in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting treatment until the episode resolves.

Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with LITFULO. Patients with evidence of HIV infection or hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials.

5.2	Mortality

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with LITFULO.

### How early should ankylosing spondylitis be treated with tumour necrosis factor blockers? [^114CKDiM]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Recognition and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the early stages of the disease has yet to be established. This paper considers the evidence available and the questions that need to be answered regarding the benefits of early diagnosis and treatment with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers in AS. The authors conclude that AS can and has to be diagnosed earlier than is being done at present, before radiological changes are evident, and the potential of TNF blockers to induce long term remission if given early enough needs to be clarified.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^115etmR2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — anti-TNF safety, pregnancy, and pretreatment screening: The safety profile of anti-TNF agents is generally favorable, but a small percentage of patients may experience severe adverse events, and a meta-analysis of 21 anti-TNF clinical trials including 5,356 patients with CD found that anti-TNF therapy did not increase the risk of serious infection, malignancy, or death compared with placebo. In addition, these agents are safe to use during preconception planning, throughout pregnancy and post partum. Before anti-TNF therapy is considered for use in patients with CD, pretreatment screening for infections and laboratory abnormalities is required; testing for latent and active tuberculosis should be undertaken as well as assessment of particular risk factors for exposure. Interferon-γ release assays are likely to complement the tuberculin skin test and are preferred in patients who are Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinated, if available. If latent tuberculosis is detected, initiation of chemoprophylaxis with antituberculous therapy should be initiated for several weeks before administration of anti-TNF therapy.

### Deuruxolitinib phosphate (Leqselvi) [^114VhNPJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monitor patients receiving LEQSELVI for signs and symptoms of active TB during treatment, including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to treatment.

Viral Reactivation

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster) were reported in clinical trials with LEQSELVI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting LEQSELVI treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of LEQSELVI on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Subjects with positive results for hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg), antibodies to hepatitis B core antigens (anti-HBc), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) with detectable HCV RNA at screening were excluded from LEQSELVI clinical trials. Perform screening for viral hepatitis before treatment with LEQSELVI. LEQSELVI is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C (HCV RNA detected).

If non-active hepatitis B infection is discovered, monitoring for reactivation or prophylactic treatment is recommended. Follow hepatitis B clinical guidelines or refer to a liver specialist. Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increase, with or without associated elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, has been reported in subjects with chronic HBV infections receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. The effect of LEQSELVI on viral replication in patients with chronic HBV infection is unknown.

5.2	Mortality

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of another JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects 50 years and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in subjects treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to and during treatment with LEQSELVI.

### Nontuberculous mycobacteria infections and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy [^113bBpyh]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the British Thoracic Society, and others have published recommendations describing the role of latent TB screening and treatment before use of anti–TNF-α therapy. Although screening can decrease the risk for TB in such patients, with the incumbent risk of illness and disease transmission, it is less clear what should be done to prevent NTM disease occurrence or progression in patients who use these compounds. Given the long median periods between the start of drug use and disease diagnosis within this case series, for many of these patients, NTM disease likely had been newly acquired during anti–TNF-α therapy.

Alternately, given the slow progression and insidious nature of pulmonary NTM disease, some of the patients in this series likely had existing but undiagnosed pulmonary NTM disease before starting their anti–TNF-α therapy. This likelihood raises the question whether patients should be screened for NTM disease before initiating anti–TNF-α therapy. According to published guidelines, all patients in the United States should be screened for latent TB infection before receiving therapy, a screening that includes a chest radiograph. Although abnormalities on such a radiograph could trigger sputum evaluation for TB and NTM, a chest radiograph is not sufficiently sensitive for detecting bronchiectasis or other lung abnormalities associated with NTM disease. If not previously obtained, clinicians could consider obtaining a noncontrast chest computed tomography scan before administering therapy to any patient with a history of bronchiectasis or other architectural lung disease, chronic unexplained cough, or abnormalities noted on their screening chest radiograph suggestive of NTM disease (e.g. reticulonodular infiltrate). If chest computed tomography suggests possible NTM disease, further pulmonary testing with sputum or other samples obtained by bronchoscopy would be indicated to rule out active NTM disease before initiating anti–TNF-α therapy.

### Baricitinib (Olumiant) [^1172M46g]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Evaluate patients for active infection prior to administration of OLUMIANT. OLUMIANT should not be given to patients with active TB.

Test patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata for latent tuberculosis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata and latent tuberculosis (TB) should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating OLUMIANT. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of OLUMIANT in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-TB therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

During OLUMIANT use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

Viral Reactivation

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt OLUMIANT treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of OLUMIANT on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, patients who were positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus RNA were permitted to enroll. Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core antibody, without hepatitis B surface antigen, were permitted to enroll; such patients should be monitored for expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Should HBV DNA be detected, consult with a hepatologist. Perform screening for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with OLUMIANT.

5.2 Mortality

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OLUMIANT.

### Appropriateness of testing for anti-tumor necrosis factor agent and antibody concentrations, and interpretation of Results [^1166r53Q]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The availability of tests for blood concentrations of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents and antibodies against these drugs could improve dose selection for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, there is little consensus on when to test and how to interpret test results. We used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to determine when these tests are appropriate and how to clinically interpret their results.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search in November 2013 to identify observational or experimental studies of the measurement of anti-TNF drug and antibody concentrations in patients with IBD and interpretation of their results. We developed 35 scenarios that assessed the appropriateness of testing and 143 scenarios that addressed clinical strategies in response to test results, and presented the findings to an expert panel. The appropriateness of each scenario was rated before and after an in-person meeting with the panel. Panelists rated the appropriateness of various clinical management options including changing therapy within class, switching out of class, adjusting drug dose or interval, adding or adjusting concomitant immune modulators, and doing nothing for each of 6 permutations of high versus low drug concentrations and high, low, or undetectable antibody concentrations. Disagreement was assessed using a validated index.

Results

Assessment of anti-TNF drug and antibody concentrations was rated appropriate at the end of induction therapy in primary nonresponders, in secondary nonresponders, at least once during the first year of maintenance therapy, and following a drug holiday. Routine assessment in responders at the end of induction was rated uncertain. In nearly all scenarios, escalation of drug dosing was rated appropriate when drug concentration was low in the absence of antibodies, and switching within class was rated appropriate when antibodies were present. Other recommendations depended on the specific clinical scenario for which the test was obtained.

Conclusions

Based on the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method of analysis, an expert panel recommends testing for drug and antibody concentrations in many clinical scenarios. The appropriate timing and best way to respond to anti-TNF drug and antibody testing for IBD depends on the specific clinical scenario. These recommendations can help guide clinicians to best optimize anti-TNF therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111rGK88]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — treatment assessment and sequencing principles state that any treatment that is selected and administered to a patient with UC should be assessed at a defined time point (6–12 weeks) to confirm its efficacy and safety, and a disease monitoring strategy should be incorporated to identify secondary nonresponse and allow subsequent adjustment in treatment to prevent complications and additional morbidity; choice of second-line therapy is dictated by similar principles, taking into account the initial therapy used; and patients with concomitant inflammatory arthritis may benefit from use of anti-TNF or JAK inhibitor therapies, while patients with concomitant inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, including those who develop inflammatory skin conditions while receiving anti-TNF therapy, may benefit from IL-23 based strategies.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112JKLnC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

TNF-α inhibitors — hypersensitivity patterns and injection-site reactions are outlined. TNF-α inhibitors are used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis and include infliximab, certolizumab, adalimumab, golimumab, and etanercept. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to infliximab occur in about 10% of patients, present with features suggesting mast cell/basophil activation and other nonspecific symptoms, and may occur with the first exposure but peak around the seventh infusion. Injection-site reactions occur in about 20% of patients treated with adalimumab or etanercept and in 2% to 6% of patients treated with certolizumab or golimumab; with etanercept, reactions occur in median on the fourth injection, have their onset 1 to 2 days after injection, last 2 to 3 days, and may be accompanied by recall.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^112tDeVx]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

T-cell interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are more specific and probably more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test (TST) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) and suspected LTBI who are candidates for anti-TNF therapy are at a significant risk of TB reactivation yet are prone to false-negative TST results because they are already on immunosuppressive medications. The role of these new blood tests in this patient population is therefore of considerable interest but is currently unclear. The limited published evidence-base shows that agreement between IGRA and TST results is poor in patients with IMID compared to patients without IMID, due to lower proportions of TST-positive results in patients with IMID. Discordant TST-positive, IGRA-negative results are associated with prior BCG vaccination and discordant TST-negative, IGRA-positive results are associated with steroid therapy. Notably, positive IGRA results are more closely associated with the presence of risk factors for LTBI than TST. The percentage of indeterminate IGRAs can be up to 12%. IGRA results in patients already taking anti-TNF agents currently remain uninterpretable. Given the clinical imperative to prevent reactivation of TB in patients starting anti-TNF therapy, screening algorithms should maximise diagnostic sensitivity for detection of LTBI. Therefore, a positive result to either an IGRA or TST, in addition to currently recommended clinical screening for risk factors for LTBI, should prompt consideration of preventive treatment of LTBI in this population.

### Golimumab (simponi) [^113zT2Gt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving TNF blockers, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating SIMPONI and periodically during therapy.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating SIMPONI, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; an induration of 5 mm or greater is a positive tuberculin skin test, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of SIMPONI in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Cases of active tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with SIMPONI during and after treatment for latent tuberculosis. Monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy, patients who are on treatment for latent tuberculosis, or patients who were previously treated for tuberculosis infection.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^115nckna]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Infliximab (anti–TNF-α) for immune-related adverse events is dosed 5 mg/kg IV, with a second dose that may be repeated 14 days later for severe or steroid-refractory colitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, arthritis, nephritis, uveitis, and hematologic irAEs. Infliximab at doses > 5 mg/kg is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure and it is also contraindicated in patients with previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab or known hypersensitivity to inactive components of infliximab or to any murine proteins. Discontinue infliximab if a patient develops a serious infection, perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB before starting infliximab, and monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative.

### Regression to the mean using the disease activity score in eligibility and response criteria for prescribing TNF-alpha inhibitors in adults with rheumatoid arthritis [^1159HCbJ]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

When patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are selected to start TNF-alpha inhibitors on the basis of high disease activity scores (DAS), some of the fall in DAS will be due to regression to the mean (RTM). We have assessed the extent to which such RTM explains DAS improvements on TNF-alpha inhibitors in routine clinical practice.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated DAS28 scores that had been recorded as part of routine assessment for two RA cohorts. (i) Thirty-five patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors who had been assessed when starting TNF-alpha inhibitors, 9–21 months prior and 1.5–6 months post-treatment. (ii) One hundred and seventy-seven clinic patients assessed twice, a year apart in the years immediately before the introduction of TNF-alpha inhibitors.

Results

In patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors, mean DAS fell 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 2.3) from baseline but only 0.9 (95% CI 0.4, 1.4) from the previous routine assessment. Twenty-four (69%) patients showed a fall in DAS of > 1.2 from baseline but only 17 (49%) from the previous assessment. Regression analysis of results from the pre-biological era estimated that as much as 0.6 of the 1.8 apparent DAS response to TNF-alpha inhibitors might be accounted for by RTM.

Conclusions

Assessing change in DAS from commencement of biological therapy may overestimate response, due to the impact of RTM and fluctuation in disease. Adequacy of response might be better assessed by serial assessments and a wider range of patient-centred outcomes.

### Adalimumab-aacf (idacio) [^11426Mc3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating IDACIO and periodically during therapy.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating IDACIO, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of ≥ 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of IDACIO in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti- tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during IDACIO treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with IDACIO, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with IDACIO.

Discontinue IDACIO if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with IDACIO, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of an oral JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.

5.5 Thrombosis

Thromboembolic events were observed in clinical trials with OPZELURA.

Thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death.

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of an oral JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers.

Avoid OPZELURA in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue OPZELURA and evaluate and treat patients appropriately.

5.6 Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, and Neutropenia

Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in the clinical trials with OPZELURA. Consider the benefits and risks for individual patients who have a known history of these events prior to initiating therapy with OPZELURA. Perform CBC monitoring as clinically indicated. If signs and/or symptoms of clinically significant thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occur, patients should discontinue OPZELURA.

### Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) [^114gB6Gu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Evaluate and test patients for latent and active tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to administration of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. Patients with latent TB should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients with previously untreated latent TB or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection.

Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-TB therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

During RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

Viral R eactivation

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster) and hepatitis B virus reactivation, were reported in clinical trials with RINVOQ [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of herpes zoster appears to be higher in patients treated with RINVOQ in Japan. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ until the episode resolves.

Screening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting and during therapy with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. Patients who were positive for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus RNA, were excluded from clinical trials. Patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B virus DNA were excluded from clinical trials. However, cases of hepatitis B reactivation were still reported in patients enrolled in the Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ. If hepatitis B virus DNA is detected while receiving RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ, a liver specialist should be consulted.

5.2 Mortality

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers.

For patients who present with a chest x-ray consistent with prior TB or a positive tuberculin skin test and/or are high-risk individuals, active TB infection should be excluded prior to treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab. For patients with latent M tuberculosis, active prophylactic treatment following published guidelines before initiation of anti–TNF-α therapy is recommended, and close monitoring for TB is recommended for up to 6 months after discontinuing therapy. For patients who develop symptoms indicative of TB, prompt evaluation for active disease is recommended. For patients with known grade III or IV New York Heart Association class heart failure, administration of adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab is not recommended; grade ratings are as stated in-line.

### Adalimumab (adalimumab-aacf) [^117Awmsn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-aacf and periodically during therapy.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-aacf, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of ≥ 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-aacf in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti- tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-aacf treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-aacf, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-aacf.

Discontinue Adalimumab-aacf if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-aacf, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

IL-12/IL-23 inhibitors — ongoing monitoring parameters list periodic history and physical examination (including screening for nonmelanoma skin cancer) and screening for adverse effects. Yearly testing for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or Quantiferon Gold) "should be done in patients at high risk", whereas for patients who are not at high risk screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist; results of the Quantiferon Gold test can remain positive after treatment of latent TB and caution should be exercised when using it. An annual chest radiograph may be considered at the treating dermatologist's discretion. Routine CBC with differential and CMP are not supported by evidence and are to be assessed at physician discretion, except with infliximab where "liver function tests be repeated every 3 mo after initiation, and if the result is normal, every 6–12 mo thereafter".

Histoplasmosis — diagnostic testing and screening before anti-TNFα therapy are specified: If histoplasmosis is suspected, diagnostic testing should include evaluation of histopathology, fungal blood and tissue cultures, antigen detection in both urine and blood, and serologic testing, with the highest diagnostic sensitivity achieved when both urine and serum antigen testing are performed concomitantly; antigen testing can also be performed on BAL fluid. Diagnostic testing should include antibody testing by both complement fixation and immunodiffusion methods, and negative results do not eliminate histoplasmosis because both antigen tests and serology testing may be negative in the setting of active infection. At this time, there are no data to support routine screening with serologic testing or antigen detection, and risk factor assessment is encouraged before starting anti-TNFα therapy in all patients; if significant recent exposure or symptoms of active or recent (in the previous 2 years) histoplasmosis are elicited, additional testing may be recommended, including a chest radiograph. Patients with history, clinical, or laboratory findings suggestive of active histoplasmosis should receive antifungal therapy with itraconazole for ≥ 3 months before starting anti-TNFα therapy, and antifungal therapy should be continued for ≥ 1 year if anti-TNFα therapy must be used, with continued surveillance of symptoms and urinary antigen level monitoring (every 3 months and as clinically indicated).

### Anti-TNF drug and antidrug antibody level monitoring in IBD: a practical guide [^1139zBXf]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications, adalimumab and infliximab, play an important role in the management of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For those in whom anti-TNF is effective, the therapy is associated with fewer symptoms, improved quality of life and disease and surgery-free survival. Unfortunately, up to 30% of patients will fail to respond to anti-TNF drugs while up to 50% of those who do see an initial response will lose response at some point. The introduction of drug monitoring for anti-TNFs, including drug level and antidrug antibody level testing allows a more personalised management of patients and improves patient outcomes. This article reviews the data for the use of anti-TNF monitoring and presents a 'how to' guide for clinicians.

Ongoing surveillance during anti-TNFα therapy in pediatric IBD — annual risk assessment and selective retesting are advised: Annual screening of patients who continue anti-TNFα therapy should be performed by risk factor assessment; repeat immunodiagnostic testing should also be considered, although the optimal testing strategy is not known; with identification of new risk factors or in those receiving corticosteroids and negative prior immunodiagnostic testing, consideration should be given to performing both TST and IGRA and to performing a chest X-ray; screening patients without new concerning risk factors and not receiving triple immunosuppression or corticosteroids with a single immunodiagnostic assay may be sufficient; if LTBI is diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient, anti-TNFα therapy should be withheld and antimicrobial therapy for LTBI provided for ≥ 2 months before restarting anti-TNFα therapy; if previously treated for LTBI, annual screening should include assessment of possible exposures, symptoms, and a chest X-ray as clinically indicated.

### Infliximab (Remicade) [^116rge9P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving REMICADE, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Cases of active tuberculosis have also occurred in patients being treated with REMICADE during treatment for latent tuberculosis.

Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating REMICADE and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Induration of 5 mm or greater with tuberculin skin testing should be considered a positive test result when assessing if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed prior to initiating REMICADE, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG).

Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to initiation of REMICADE in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Tuberculosis should be strongly considered in patients who develop a new infection during REMICADE treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with REMICADE, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with REMICADE.

REMICADE should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with REMICADE should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.

### National Psoriasis Foundation consensus statement on screening for latent tuberculosis infection in patients with psoriasis treated with systemic and biologic agents [^114hpXw9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic immunosuppression is a known risk factor for allowing latent tuberculosis (TB) infection to transform into active TB. Immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies, while highly efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, may be associated with an increased rate of active TB in patients receiving some of these therapies.

Objective

Our aim was to arrive at a consensus on screening for latent TB infection in psoriasis patient treated with systemic and biologic agents.

Methods

Reports in the literature were reviewed regarding immunosuppressive therapies and risk of TB.

Results

Screening patients for latent TB infection before commencement of treatment is of utmost importance when beginning treatment with the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, T-cell blockers, cyclosporine, or methotrexate. The currently recommended method for screening is the tuberculin skin test. It is preferable that positively screened patients be treated with a full course of latent TB infection prophylaxis before immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy is initiated. However, in the opinion of many experts, patients may be started on the immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy after 1 to 2 months, if their clinical condition requires, as long as they are strictly adhering to and tolerating their prophylactic regimen.

Limitations

There are few evidence-based studies on screening for latent TB infection in psoriasis patients treated with systemic and biologic agents.

Conclusions

The biologic TNF-alpha inhibitors are very promising in the treatment of psoriasis. However, because TNF-alpha is also an important cytokine in preventing TB infection and in keeping latent TB infection from becoming active disease, the use of TNF-alpha inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk of developing active TB. A higher incidence of TB has also been reported with other immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments for psoriasis. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to appropriately screen all patients for latent TB infection prior to initiating any immunologic therapy. Delaying immunologic therapy until latent TB infection prophylaxis is completed is preferable. However, if the patient is adhering to his prophylactic regimen and is appropriately tolerating the regimen, therapy may be started after 1 to 2 months if the clinical condition requires.

### Interferon-γ release assays for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: evidence in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders [^114XCsgc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a narrative synthesis of evidence on interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs).

Recent Findings

Only a few studies have evaluated IGRAs in IMIDs, and most were small and varied considerably with respect to the use of immunosuppressive medications and types of IMIDs. Current evidence does not clearly suggest that IGRAs are better than tuberculin skin test (TST) in identifying individuals with IMID who could benefit from LTBI treatment. To date, no studies have been done on the predictive value of IGRAs in IMID patients. Important questions remain unanswered as to the impact of immunosuppressive medications and the impact of type of IMID on IGRA performance.

Summary

Despite the lack of clear evidence, there is an increasing tendency for guidelines to prefer IGRA over TST in IMIDs or to recommend both TST and IGRA to enhance sensitivity. We believe the use of either test is acceptable for LTBI screening. Clinicians could consider starting with IGRAs in individuals with a history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination after infancy or with repeated BCG vaccinations. When the index of suspicion for LTBI is high, both IGRA and TST could be performed, especially prior to initiating TNF-α inhibitor therapy. Regardless of the test used, it is important to remember that in the face of immune-suppression, both IGRA and TST can be falsely negative and are thus only diagnostic aids - they will need to be interpreted with other clinical and risk factor data.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^1153PtYE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors — hypersensitivity reactions and diagnosis include that serum sickness–like reactions have been described with infliximab and adalimumab and onset is typically from 5 to 7 days after infusion with features such as fever, malaise, arthralgia/arthritis, and an erythematous (sometimes) urticarial eruption; IgE-mediated reactions account for a subset of immediate reactions to infliximab and may be the cause of some injection-site reactions and also of rare systemic reactions to adalimumab and etanercept. In reactive patients, a positive immediate skin test response to infliximab and anti-infliximab IgEs were seen in 28% (range, 4%-67%) and 41% (range, 13%-70%), respectively. Patients with anti-infliximab IgGs are at increased risk, with relative risk varying from 2.4 to 4.0 for immediate hypersensitivity reactions compared with patients without such antibodies.

Practical aspects of reactive TDM in anti-TNF therapy include timing and assay considerations. The panel recommends that a trough for infliximab or adalimumab be drawn "as close to the next dose as possible (ie, within 24 hours)". Drug trough concentrations are "consistent across different commercial assays", whereas "assays for anti-drug antibodies are not readily comparable". When antibodies are detected, "it is unclear what antibody level is clinically meaningful"; "Low-titer antibodies may be transient and non-neutralizing", and interval shortening and/or dose escalation may optimize troughs in this setting.

### Is universal screening for hepatitis C infection prior to commencing antitumour necrosis factor-α therapy necessary? [^1134Vc5T]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) prior to the commencement of antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF)-α therapies for dermatological disease is recommended for all patients.

Objectives

To determine the incidence of HCV infection among dermatology patients who were screened for HCV infection prior to commencing anti-TNF-α therapies.

Methods

We reviewed the HCV infection status of all patients attending our dermatology department who had been tested for evidence of HCV infection between January 2005 and November 2012. We identified patients who had been tested as part of routine screening prior to commencing anti-TNF-α therapy using dermatology departmental records.

Results

In total, 215 patients were screened for HCV infection prior to commencing anti-TNF-α therapies. Among this group, 143 patients (66·5%) were male and 72 (33·5%) were female. None of these patients tested positive for active HCV infection. One patient tested positive for HCV antibody with negative HCV antigen and HCV RNA. This indicated previous HCV infection that had cleared. This patient had abnormal liver function tests and a history of alcohol excess.

Conclusions

There were no cases of active HCV infection diagnosed through pretreatment anti-TNF-α screening in our department, which is located in a low-prevalence area for HCV infection. In view of the lack of evidence of harm associated with anti-TNF-α use in HCV-infected patients, we propose that screening for HCV infection in low-prevalence areas should be targeted to those with pre-existing risk factors. This is consistent with current guidelines from the Royal College of General Practitioners. Targeted screening rather than universal screening may be a safe and cost-effective option among patients being evaluated for anti-TNF-α therapies.

### To test or not to test? An evidence-based assessment of the value of screening and monitoring tests when using systemic biologic agents to treat psoriasis [^117Ap9EK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The development of new treatments for psoriasis provides dermatologists novel ways to help control the disease but raises questions about what laboratory screening tests are required. As of yet, no consensus or guidelines exist for dermatologists to follow and there may be misconceptions about the relative need for screening and monitoring tests in patients treated with biologic agents. Current practice ranges from no testing to blanket screening panels. The purposes of this review are to (1) systematically review the literature on the use of screening and monitoring tests when initiating and continuing biologic treatments (adalimumab, alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab) for moderate to severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis; and (2) suggest practical guidelines for dermatologists on which to base such testing. We searched the Cochrane Collaborative Database (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [Cochrane Reviews] and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Clinical Trials]) and the MEDLINE database using medical subject headings as search terms when available or key words when appropriate. We compiled published data on risk and risk assessment related to systemic psoriasis treatments, used expert opinion where appropriate when published clinical data were not adequately informative, and assigned evidence grades for various screening tests based on standard methods of the US Preventive Services Task Force. Finally, we developed a table of evidence grades for tests used to monitor different systemic medications. There is not strong evidence to recommend most screening tests for monitoring biological treatments. Neither is there strong evidence not to do such testing. Ultimately, from a practical standpoint, it is incumbent on the clinician to consider each patient independently and determine what screening tests are most appropriate for each individual patient.

### Laboratory monitoring of biologic therapies [^116PVGkY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this report is to provide suggested guidance concerning the monitoring of TNF blocker therapy. Since the completion of randomized trials, several new long-term safety concerns have arisen, involving mycobacterial and opportunistic infections, cytopenias, lymphoma, demyelinating disease, drug-induced lupus, congestive heart failure and hepatotoxicity. Since these serious events are rare, widespread post-marketing use and prolonged follow-up have been required to analyze their prevalence. Monitoring of TNF inhibitors is necessary to reassure physicians and patients of the continued efficacy and safety of these drugs. No published recommendations on monitoring are available. The clinician must weigh the potential clinical benefits of TNF inhibition against potential adverse effects. Patients should be evaluated carefully for the risk or presence of infection, tuberculosis and other serious adverse events by regular visits, careful clinical assessments, and an assiduous, high index of suspicion for these rare events. Tuberculin skin testing using PPD is recommended before starting treatment with any TNF inhibitor.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^114QaXjy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Infliximab immediate hypersensitivity — when treatment is indicated, patients with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab should preferably be reexposed through desensitization if skin testing result is positive or if the initial reaction was severe or recurrent despite premedication and/or a slowed infusion rate. The risk of a recurrent reaction with subsequent exposures is around 33% on the first reexposure and progressively decreases thereafter. Anti-infliximab antibodies do not cross-react with adalimumab, although patients who develop anti-infliximab antibodies are more prone to develop adalimumab antibodies and have a higher treatment failure rate with adalimumab; despite these caveats, switching to adalimumab after a hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab can be attempted. For TNF-α inhibitor injection-site or systemic reactions, desensitization could be considered, but desensitization is not a safe method of preventing nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions to TNF-α inhibitors; switching to another TNF-α inhibitor has not been adequately studied, and some reports note that reexposure to the suspected culprit drug may not necessarily lead to a recurrent reaction.

### Reactivation of tuberculosis in cancer patients following administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors: current evidence and clinical practice recommendations [^112GLS9v]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is accepted that ICBs may have infectious complications, indirectly as a consequence of the need for corticosteroids or TNF-a inhibitors to control irAEs associated with ICB therapy. Tuberculosis may be an exception to this rule, as the majority of reported cases from the literature and our experience were receiving neither corticosteroids nor TNF-a inhibitors when their reactivation was documented. Therefore, MTB reactivation may represent a direct complication of immunotherapy, although more data are needed to unequivocally establish this. The exact mechanism of increased susceptibility to MTB following administration of ICBs is not yet known. Preclinical data recognize a crucial role of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking in T cell exhaustion, evasion of immune surveillance and development of active tuberculosis. However, in clinical practice, the management of M. tuberculosis among cancer patients receiving ICBs presents challenges. Cancer itself is an independent risk factor for developing active MTB infection. This generally occurs early in the course of disease, and cancer progression is the most common misdiagnosis when constitutional symptoms such as weight loss and fever, common with active MTB, are developed. Thus, before changing treatment for a supposed disease progression or initiating corticosteroids for a suspected irAE, all cancer patients with appropriate symptomatology should be tested for tuberculosis and checked for any previous exposure to MTB, and other risk factors. The prompt diagnosis of a mycobacterial infection, even in a subclinical stage, is essential to avoid later potentially morbid exacerbation. Given that inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may favor tuberculosis reactivation, targeted screening for LTBC is suggested before initiation of an ICPI, especially in cancer subjects with additional independent risk factors (e.g. host comorbidities, exposure to MTB endemic regions, and immunosuppression). The preferred diagnostic modality (e.g. a single test or combination of TST and IGRA) for LTBC screening in these patients has not been clearly defined. In addition, no available data exist for the management of latent or active tuberculosis during PD-1/PD-L1 blockade; for this reason, therapeutic guidelines are adopted from the management of patients receiving TNF-a inhibition. In general, in case of active tuberculosis, ICPIs are temporarily withheld, any further immunosuppression is discontinued and anti-tuberculosis treatment is timely initiated. Also, in patients diagnosed with either active or latent tuberculosis, it is not clear how long after the corresponding anti-TB treatment ICPIs should be safely resumed or initiated, with a duration of 2–4 weeks to be suggested. The continuously expanded implementation of IPCIs in cancer treatment requires resolving of these challenges by upcoming research data in order to maximize the clinical benefits of immunotherapy uninterruptedly and safely.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the story continues [^117QoJBk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of TNF inhibitor failure

Although TNF inhibitors have transformed outcomes for many patients with IBD, it is estimated that 10–30% of patients will not respond to initial therapy (primary non-response) and 23–46% will lose response over time (secondary loss of response). Primary non-response and secondary loss of response can arise from three different scenarios: immunogenicity-mediated failure (in patients with low or undetectable trough concentrations and high titres of anti-drug antibodies), non-immunogenicity-mediated pharmacokinetic failure (in patients with subtherapeutic trough concentrations and absent anti-drug antibodies) and mechanistic or pharmacodynamic failure (in patients with therapeutic drug levels and absent anti-drug antibodies). As such, management approaches to treatment failure depend largely on drug concentrations and anti-drug antibody titres and have been reviewed in detail in other publications. Guidelines recommend evaluating patients who experience treatment failure with TNF inhibitors to determine whether their symptoms are the result of active disease. In addition, it is recommended that patients who have previously developed anti-drug antibodies receive combination therapy with an immunosuppressive agent.

What is already known:

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection
Screening for latent TB infection (LTBI) is recommended prior to anti-TNF therapy
Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis prevents TB infection during anti-TNF therapy

What the new findings are:

Immunosuppressive therapy does not only interfere with tuberculin skin test, but may also affect interferon-γ release assay results
TB reactivation can be detected in patients with negative LTBI screening tests
LTBI screening tests can be recommended to be performed prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, conceivably in the first visit of the patient

5.2.4.5 Primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy

Statement 92. We suggest that treatment options for failure of initial anti-TNF therapy (increase dose, shorten dosage interval, switch to alternative anti-TNF, or switch to different drug class) may be informed by the clinical context and by measurement of serum drug and anti-drug antibody concentrations (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.7%).

Treatment failure to anti-TNF therapy should be divided into primary non-response (failure to respond to induction therapy) and secondary loss of response. For patients with primary non-response to one anti-TNF, the likelihood that they will respond to a second is small but is dependent on the clinical context. Switching to a drug that acts through a different mechanism is more likely to be successful. Measuring drug and antibody levels may have a role, with recent evidence suggesting that drug levels in primary non-responders are often lower than in responders, and antibody formation can be a significant factor within a few weeks of treatment initiation.

### Sarilumab (Kevzara) [^114QGaAA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations Prior to Administration

Not Recommended for Concomitant Use with Biological DMARDS

The concurrent use of KEVZARA with biological DMARDs such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, IL-1R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and selective co-stimulation modulators has not been studied. Avoid using KEVZARA with biological DMARDs because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.

Recommended Evaluations Prior to Treatment

Complete blood count (CBC): Treatment initiation with KEVZARA is not recommended in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2000 per mm3, or platelet count below 150,000 per mm3. Monitor laboratory parameters [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Liver function tests (LFT): Treatment initiation with KEVZARA is not recommended in patients with or who have alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Monitor laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and/or triglycerides): Assess lipid parameters at baseline. Monitor laboratory parameters [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Active and latent tuberculosis infection evaluation: Prior to initiating KEVZARA, test patients for active and latent tuberculosis (TB). KEVZARA should not be administered to patients with active TB. If positive for latent infection, consider treating for TB prior to KEVZARA use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Evaluate for infections: Avoid KEVZARA use in patients with active infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended dosage of KEVZARA is 200 mg once every two weeks given as a subcutaneous injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

KEVZARA may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional DMARDs.

Modify the dosage as recommended in Table 1 if the patient develops neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or liver enzyme abnormalities [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Dose adjustments and discontinuation in TNF inhibitors treated patients: when and how. A systematic review of literature [^114LyRBx]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the available evidence concerning the possibility of discontinuing and/or tapering the dosage of TNF inhibitors (TNFi) in RA patients experiencing clinical remission or low disease activity.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature concerning the low dosage and discontinuation of TNFi in disease-controlled RA patients was performed by evaluation of reports published in indexed international journals (Medline via PubMed, EMBASE), in the time frame from 8 April 2013 to 15 January 2016.

Results

We analysed the literature evaluating the efficacy and the safety of two different strategies using TNFi, decreasing dosage or discontinuation, in patients experiencing clinical remission or low disease activity. After the analysis of online databases, 25 references were considered potentially relevant and 16 references were selected. The majority of data concerned etanercept and adalimumab. Results suggested the induction of stable clinical remission or low disease activity by using TNFi followed by a dosage tapering and/or discontinuation of such drugs may be associated with the maintenance of a good clinical response in a subset of patients affected by early disease.

Conclusion

RA patients treated early with TNFi and achieving their therapeutic clinical targets seem to maintain their clinical response after tapering or discontinuing TNFi. These data may allow physicians a more dynamic and tailored management of RA patients.

Use of TNF blockers, including REMICADE, has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy, including REMICADE. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. Patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, TNF blockers should be stopped and antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when considering resumption of TNF blocker therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis and cholestasis, have been reported in postmarketing data in patients receiving REMICADE. Autoimmune hepatitis has been diagnosed in some of these cases. Severe hepatic reactions occurred between 2 weeks to more than 1 year after initiation of REMICADE; elevations in hepatic aminotransferase levels were not noted prior to discovery of the liver injury in many of these cases. Some of these cases were fatal or necessitated liver transplantation. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or marked liver enzyme elevations (e.g., ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal) develop, REMICADE should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be undertaken. In clinical trials, mild or moderate elevations of ALT and AST have been observed in patients receiving REMICADE without progression to severe hepatic injury [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to screen for latent tuberculosis before initiating biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, and/or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration) in patients at increased risk for latent tuberculosis. Follow national and/or international guidelines for screening latent tuberculosis, including a CXR and IGRA over tuberculin skin test where available.

7 Concluding remarks

Published evidence on the performance of IGRAs suggests that IGRAs maintain their diagnostic sensitivity for LTBI better than TST in patients with IMID, most of whom are on immunosuppressive DMARDs. Most of the available data to date is derived from QFT-Gold in-tube and the evidence-base for both this assay and T-SPOT. TB needs to be expanded to assess whether these new tests are definitely superior to TST in this important patient population. Also, next-generation IGRAs that incorporate new M. tuberculosis -specific antigens which significantly enhance diagnostic sensitivity without compromising specificity hold promise and should therefore be assessed in this population. The lack of a gold standard for diagnosis of LTBI means that prospective longitudinal clinical outcome studies to determine the prognostic value of positive IGRA results for subsequent development of active TB in this population are urgently required.

In the meantime, some practical recommendations for screening for TB infection prior to TNF blockade can be made. Most importantly, active TB must first be excluded by history and chest radiograph. Screening for LTBI should include checking for a history of untreated or partially treated TB, risk-stratification for exposure to cases of active TB and searching for evidence of residual changes indicative of untreated prior TB infection on a chest radiograph (e.g. calcified granulomas, Gohn focus or complex, apical scarring). In addition, given the apparent diagnostic superiority of IGRAs over TST, one or the other of the new blood tests should be performed. However, given the very limited size of the evidence-base in support of IGRAs to date and the vulnerability of these patients to develop severe and disseminated forms of TB on TNF blockade, it may be prudent to perform TST in parallel with IGRA to maximise the diagnostic sensitivity of screening, at least until the IGRA evidence-base in this population has expanded sufficiently. Since some patients with LTBI may have false-negative IGRA results and true-positive TST results, while others will have true-positive IGRA results and false-negative TST results, a dual-testing strategy should enable physicians to offer all patients with LTBI preventative treatment. IGRA results in patients already taking anti-TNF agents currently remain uninterpretable.

### A microcosting study of immunogenicity and tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor drug level tests for therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice [^111gNaaR]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

TNF-α inhibitors (TNFi) have transformed the treatment of several chronic inflammatory diseases. Given their effectiveness in the most severely affected patients, the use of biologics in rheumatology continues to increase, but is associated with significant expenditure (£10 000/year/patient). TNFi agents such as adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are currently represented within the top five highest medicinal expenditures in England, with an estimated cost to the National Health Service (NHS) of ∼£160 million annually for RA. A targeted approach using robust predictive biomarkers of response in TNFi-treated patients may add value to the clinical decision-making process by potentially informing the selection of which TNFi drug to use first in specific patients, the appropriate biologic sequence and whether to continue the drug in patients established on therapy. However, there remain considerable gaps in the evidence base supporting the introduction of a targeted approach into clinics. In the era of finite budgets, robust economic evidence is required in order to ensure that the alternative uses for funds are considered in any decision, and decision-making groups must be aware of other funding pressures and service developments that will otherwise be forgone (opportunity costs).

An important mechanism for treatment failure of certain TNFi agents is immunogenicity involving the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAb) and low drug levels. While the presence of ADAbs and low TNFi drug levels, detected soon after treatment initiation, have been shown to predict subsequent treatment response, tests quantifying levels are not currently available in rheumatology clinical practice in the UK NHS. Such testing needs to be both effective in improving outcomes and a cost-effective use of the healthcare budget before it can be recommended for implementation into the clinic. To date, a description of the types and quantity of resources needed to provide the test is not available in the published literature. Identifying the resources required will facilitate the calculation of the costs of implementing these tests in a UK clinical setting if the introduction of such testing is shown to be clinically useful.

Microcosting is a method that allows robust assessment of the types and quantities of resources and associated costs of health interventions consumed. It is particularly useful for estimating the costs of new interventions and for interventions with large variability across providers, thereby potentially providing a key input for undertaking subsequent economic evaluations. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the resource use and associated costs required for introducing drug level and ADAb testing to assess response to TNFi drugs in routine practice in the UK setting.

### Approach to latent tuberculosis infection screening before biologic therapy in IBD patients: PPD or IGRA? [^112R9uMG]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of biological agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has been on the rise.1,2 Current biological therapies include antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α), anti-interleukin-12/23, and anti-integrin agents. Before initiation of biological drugs, screening for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is required to avoid reactivation or worsening of disease after immunosuppression. It has been shown that anti-TNF-α treated patients have a 14-fold increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection/reactivation compared with healthy controls.3 The methods for screening for TB have evolved over time and vary from region to region.

### Infliximab [^111RhqL1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving Infliximab, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Cases of active tuberculosis have also occurred in patients being treated with Infliximab during treatment for latent tuberculosis.

Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating Infliximab and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Induration of 5 mm or greater with tuberculin skin testing should be considered a positive test result when assessing if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed prior to initiating Infliximab, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG).

Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to initiation of Infliximab in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Tuberculosis should be strongly considered in patients who develop a new infection during Infliximab treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.

Monitoring

Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Infliximab, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Infliximab.

Infliximab should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Infliximab should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.

Invasive Fungal Infections

For patients who reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, invasive fungal infection should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic illness. Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. When feasible, the decision to administer empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections and should take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy.

TNF-α inhibitors — HIV and hepatitis B/C infections guidance advises caution with pre-existing immunosuppression-related conditions and states that patients with HIV may receive TNF-α inhibitors if they are also receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy that has effectively normalized CD4+ T-cell counts and they show no detectable viral load, provided there is no recent history of opportunistic infection; consultation with the patient's infectious disease provider is advised before initiating therapy. For hepatitis C, patients with a history of or currently active disease may receive a TNF-α inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis and concomitant management with an appropriate health care provider is warranted. For hepatitis B, patients with a history of or currently active disease may receive a TNF-α inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis; however, the patient should first be evaluated by an appropriate health care professional and may require concomitant antiviral medication, a hepatitis B core antibody test in this setting is recommended, and for confirmed resolved infection ongoing monitoring with HB surface antigen, anti-HB core antibody, and liver function tests should be considered owing to the potential risk of reactivation.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^114K7MBQ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Take-home messages

- Testing for and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) should be targeted to high risk groups who are at increased risk of progression to active tuberculosis.
- Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a key cytokine in protective host immunity against M. tuberculosis infection. The risk of incident tuberculosis (TB) in patients latently infected with M. tuberculosis increases substantially, from 4 to 5 fold over baseline in the case of infliximab, after initiation of anti-TNF therapy.
- TST is an inadequate tool for screening patients for LTBI before commencing anti-TNFα agents because of poor specificity in BCG-vaccinated individuals and poor sensitivity in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) on conventional immunosuppressants e.g. methotrexate and steroids.
- T-cell interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) detect interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released ex vivo from pre-sensitised M. tuberculosis -specific T cells in response to selected proteins which, unlike PPD, are highly specific for M. tuberculosis. Extensive published literature suggests that IGRA are a more specific and probably a more sensitive test for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection than the TST in immunocompetent persons.
- The limited available published data in patients with IMID on disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) who are candidates for TNF blockade shows that IGRA results agree poorly with TST results and are more closely associated with the presence of risk factors for LTBI than TST, suggesting that IGRAs maintain diagnostic sensitivity for LTBI better than TST in this key population. However, preliminary data suggests that in patients who are already on anti-TNF treatment the IFN-γ response is significantly reduced and negative IGRA results should therefore not be interpreted as implying absence of infection.
- IGRAs are a promising adjunct for screening patients with IMID prior to TNF blockade, but more data are required to validate their precise role in this setting.

5.2.1.2.1 Tuberculosis

Statement 80. We recommend that prior to commencing anti-TNF therapy, IBD patients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB) using a combination of clinical risk stratification, chest x-ray and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Screening for active or latent TB is essential prior to starting anti-TNF or other biologic therapy. A Dutch study suggested that screening rates for TB in IBD patients are high at 90–97%, with 3% latent prevalence. Tuberculin skin test is likely to have false-negative results due to immunosuppressive therapy, so interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) should be used. A high rate of anergy to skin-based antigen tests was shown by immunising 82 consecutive IBD patients against tuberculin (TST) or control antigens. In this study no TST result was positive, but 71% of patients failed to respond to any antigen. Importantly, 83% of patients on steroid or immunomodulator therapy were anergic versus 43% not on these therapies (p < 0.002). A retrospective study of TB screening in 340 patients in the USA with 512 Quantiferon TB Gold (QFT-G) IGRA tests reported 1.5% positivity, 2.7% indeterminate and 95.8% negativity. Only one case of tuberculosis reactivation occurred in 17 months of follow-up (0.3%). This patient had an indeterminate test and was on immunosuppressive therapy prior to testing. No significant difference was seen in positivity rates between those on immunosuppressive therapy and those not. Only moderate concordance was seen between TST and QFT-G in this study (kappa = 0.4152, p = 0.0041). IGRA tests were evaluated in 125 adult patients with IBD in London, 90 of whom were anti-TNF naïve, with 35 on established anti-TNF therapy.109 (87%) were BCG vaccinated. 98% IGRA tests were negative, 1% indeterminate and 2% positive. This method of screening was deemed cost-effective in comparison to the 2005 British Thoracic Society guideline. No subsequent cases of TB were reported with a median follow-up of 24 months. A Korean study examined newly developed TB cases in IBD patients on established anti-TNF therapy. They described 25 cases in total (84% pulmonary, 16% extrapulmonary), of whom 76% developed TB within 5 years of commencing anti-TNF despite previous negative screening for latent infection, and 12% developed reactivation of latent infection after 3 months of chemoprophylaxis. Primary infection with TB on anti-TNF agents is therefore a significant risk, particularly in higher incidence areas, irrespective of baseline screening.

Prevention of concomitant infections

Latent TB should be considered in patients with a history of recent exposure to the disease, positive initial tuberculin skin test (TST), positive booster TST or IGRA test and no radiological evidence of active TB. As effective therapeutic agents for IBD, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and biological agents may increase the risk of TB infection, decrease the positive rate of diagnosis, and cause more severe outcomes due to their effects on immune function. Therefore, ECCO suggested that patients should be screened for TB before treatment for IBD, and serial tuberculin skin tests (TST) may improve the detection of latent TB infection in patients with IBD. TB chemoprophylaxis regimens are based on treatment with isoniazid (INH) for 6–9 months. In conclusion, we recommend that patients should be screened for TB, and treated for latent TB before the initial therapy for IBD.

Researchers have also proposed that HBV treatment should be administered before the initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. Recently, studies have shownthat the immunosuppressants used for IBD including corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or anti-TNF might increase the risk of HBV infection and reactivation. In addition, immunosuppressants are independent predictors of liver dysfunction and result in liver failure and even death in patients with IBD and HBVsAg (+). To avoid poor outcomes, HBVsAg (+) IBD patients should be treated in a timely manner. ECCO proposed that before, during and for at least 12 months after immunomodulator treatment has ceased, patients who are HBsAg-positive (chronic HBV infection) should receive potent antiviral agents, and antiviral therapy should be continued until HBV DNA ≤ 2000 IU/mL. Nucleotide/nucleoside analogs are considered the first-choice agents for antiviral treatment in HBsAg (+) patients. Entecavir and tenefovir have been shown to be the preferred drugs because of their rapid onset of action, high antiviral potency, and low incidence of resistance. We suggest that HBsAg-positive patients should be administered antiviral therapy before immunosuppressive treatment and antiviral therapy should continue for at least 12 months after the cessation of immunosuppressants. Furthermore, adult patients with IBD should receive HBV non-live vaccines before anti-TNF therapy according to the guidelines of the American College of Gastroenterology.

Screening for, and treatment of, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) before anti- tumour necrosis factor α therapy has been shown to decrease the incidence of active tuberculosis by more than 80% and is recommended before initiation of treatment. In the absence of a 'gold standard' test for LTBI, current screening involves taking a clinical history of risk factors, chest radiograph and tuberculin skin test. Alternative cellular immune-based screening tests have been developed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This paper summarises the current position and advances in the use of newer screening strategies for LTBI.

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^1138ta4h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations for Administration

Not Recommended for Concomitant Use with Biological DMARDs

Tocilizumab products have not been studied in combination with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists, IL-1R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and selective co-stimulation modulators because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection. Avoid using TOFIDENCE with biological DMARDs.

Baseline Laboratory Evaluation Prior to Treatment

Obtain and assess baseline complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests prior to treatment.

RA, GCA, PJIA and SJIA – It is recommended that TOFIDENCE not be initiated in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2000 per mm, platelet count below 100,000 per mm, or ALT or AST above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
COVID-19 - It is recommended that TOFIDENCE not be initiated in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1000 per mm, platelet count below 50,000 mm3, or ALT or AST above 10 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

TOFIDENCE may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs as an intravenous infusion.

Recommended Intravenous Dosage Regimen:

The recommended dosage of TOFIDENCE for adult patients given as a 60-minute single intravenous drip infusion is 4 mg per kg every 4 weeks followed by an increase to 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks based on clinical response.

Reduction of dose from 8 mg per kg to 4 mg per kg is recommended for management of certain dose-related laboratory changes including elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in RA patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

When transitioning from intravenous therapy with TOFIDENCE to subcutaneous therapy with another tocilizumab product, administer the first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose.

Interruption of dose is recommended for management of certain dose-related laboratory changes including elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

### Clinical utility of random anti-tumor necrosis factor drug-level testing and measurement of antidrug antibodies on the long-term treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis [^112q47mW]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The introduction of anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) therapy transformed the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, up to 40% of patients with RA fail to respond to anti‐TNF treatment, because of either primary inefficacy or loss of response 1, 2, 3. When patients fail to have a response to their first anti‐TNF drug, therapeutic options may include switching to a biologic agent with a different mechanism of action, switching to an alternative anti‐TNF drug, or increasing the dose/reducing the length of time between infusions. The choice of a second‐line agent is often based on cost and local policies as opposed to an understanding of the mechanistic etiology of treatment failure. At present, no biomarkers are readily available to predict which treatments will work better for which patients, because until recently, the mechanisms underlying these responses have not received much attention 4, 5. The ability to predict nonresponse at an early stage of treatment with a biologic agent could potentially have major implications for health care economics and help to optimize patient care.

One explanation of the poor efficacy of anti‐TNF therapies is immunogenicity leading to the development of antidrug antibodies and low drug levels. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of antibodies against anti‐TNF monoclonal antibodies reduces the response to treatment and increases the risk of treatment discontinuation 6, 7. Meanwhile, the utility of pharmacologic monitoring in clinical practice continues to be debated 8, 9. Indeed, the 2013 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Task Force recommendations for the management of RA 9 included the following questions in their research agenda: "Is measurement of serum drug and/or drug antibody levels useful in clinical practice?" and "How can immunogenicity of [biologic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs] DMARDs explain the similarity of clinical trial data observed with both immunogenic and non‐immunogenic compounds?"

5.3 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Use of TNF blockers, including Infliximab, has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy, including Infliximab. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. Patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, TNF blockers should be stopped and antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when considering resumption of TNF blocker therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis and cholestasis, have been reported in postmarketing data in patients receiving Infliximab. Autoimmune hepatitis has been diagnosed in some of these cases. Severe hepatic reactions occurred between 2 weeks to more than 1 year after initiation of Infliximab; elevations in hepatic aminotransferase levels were not noted prior to discovery of the liver injury in many of these cases. Some of these cases were fatal or necessitated liver transplantation. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or marked liver enzyme elevations (e.g., ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal) develop, Infliximab should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be undertaken. In clinical trials, mild or moderate elevations of ALT and AST have been observed in patients receiving Infliximab without progression to severe hepatic injury [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

No consensus exists regarding the optimal laboratory screening for hepatitis B infection that should be performed before initiating therapy with tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitors or other immunosuppressive agents.

Objective

We sought to give guidelines on which tests to order for hepatitis B screening.

Methods

We review the pathophysiology and serology of hepatitis B infection and provide recommendations for screening for hepatitis B infection in patients with psoriasis before beginning anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa therapy or other immunosuppressive agents.

Results

We propose the standardized use of triple serology testing: hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B core antibody in combination with liver function tests as screening.

Limitations

Conclusions based on review of available literature is a limitation.

Conclusions

All patients with psoriasis who are candidates for tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitor should undergo screening for hepatitis B virus infection using the triple serology: hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B core antibody. It is advisable that patients, who are candidates for ustekinumab, cyclosporine, or methotrexate undergo the same screening.

### Assessment and management for latent tuberculosis before advanced therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: a comprehensive review [^112r3BPy]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is the most significant infectious cause of mortality across the globe. While TB disease can prey on immunocompetent individuals, it is more likely to occur in immunocompromised individuals. Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are a group of diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, autoimmune blistering diseases, and others) where there may be a need for systemic immunosuppression to control the disease manifestations, treat symptoms and improve long term outcomes. Immunosuppression may predispose them to active TB either from recent infection or reactivation of Latent TB (LTB). The major determinants of reactivation include the type of therapy (highest risk with TNF inhibitors and JAK inhibitors) and the underlying TB endemicity. The strategy to avoid TB reactivation includes the detection of LTB using tests that detect immunoreactivity to TB antigens (interferon-gamma release assays or tuberculin skin test) and treating LTB before or with initiation of IMID therapies. Available diagnostic tests have deficiencies in diagnostic sensitivity to detect LTB and even worse capability in predicting reactivation of TB. In addition to immunological tests, more stringent testing strategy utilizing one or many LTB equivalents may point towards subclinical TB. LTB equivalents include clinical (past history of TB, recent exposure to TB) and radiological criteria (use of chest roentgenogram, computed tomography, or, sometimes positron emission tomography - computed tomography). The present review summarizes the risk factors for TB reactivation in patients initiated on advanced therapies, geographically appropriate strategies for LTB testing, and treatment of LTB.

In the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosis of LTBI, current clinical management of patients with IMID requiring anti-TNF therapy involves checking for a history of untreated or partially treated TB, risk-stratification for exposure to cases of active TB, evidence of residual changes indicative of prior TB infection on a chest radiograph and a tuberculin skin test (TST).

The TST is a measure of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to intradermal inoculation of purified protein derivative (PPD), a crude mixture of more than 200 M. tuberculosis proteins. Because antigens within PPD are also found in other mycobacteria, the TST suffers from poor specificity in bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated persons. Moreover, the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test used to diagnose LTBI is compromised in patients on immunosuppressive therapy with a high rate of false-negative TST test results. For example, in a Peruvian study, the size of the TST response was significantly lower and the proportion negative (i.e. < 5 mm) to TST was significantly higher in patients with RA compared to healthy immunocompetent controls (median size PPD induration 4.5 vs 11.5 mm P < 0.01; 79/112 (70.6%) vs 25/96 (26%) P < 0.01, respectively). Logistical hurdles, including the need for a return visit to read the result of this in vivo test and operator variability in inoculation and reading of the result, also limit the effective use of TST.

Thus because almost all patients awaiting initiation of anti-TNF therapy are on immunosuppressive therapy, the TST is not an appropriate test to screen for LTBI in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. This concern around the interpretation of the TST in patients on disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is reflected in British Thoracic Society guidelines from 2005 that recommended replacing TST with an individual risk–benefit calculation in patients with a normal chest radiograph balancing the population risk of LTBI in different groups based on age and ethnicity with the risk of serious hepatotoxicity secondary to isoniazid therapy.

### Do patients with ankylosing spondylitis adapt to their disease? Evidence from a' then-test' in patients treated with TNF inhibitors [^1153rJip]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) adapt to their disease, using the 'then-test'.

Methods

Data from patients participating in the AS Study for Evaluation of Recombinant Infliximab Therapy (ASSERT) and continuing in the European AS Infliximab Cohort (EASIC) were used. At 5 assessments in EASIC, patients were asked to rerate their global well-being before the start of infliximab in ASSERT. The patients evaluated their past situation by using a 'then-test' ('retrospective patient global'). Initial and retrospective patient global were compared using a paired t test, and mixed linear models investigated whether the retrospective score of well-being was stable at all follow-up assessments in EASIC. Linear regression analysis explored whether treatment response was associated with the difference between the initial and retrospective score ('gap') while adjusting for possible confounders.

Results

86 patients (mean age 39.8 years (SD = 10.4), mean disease duration 10.8 years (SD = 8.5)) contributed to the current analyses. At the time of starting infliximab, patients judged their global at 7.0 (SD = 1.6), and with the 'then-test' at 7.2 (SD = 2.3) (p = 0.45). Time elapsed did not influence the 'then-test' (p = 0.13). Multivariably, the gap was irrespective of treatment response, but associated with initial patient global (p < 0.01) and initial Bath AS Disease Activity Index (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Patients with AS accurately judged their global well-being before starting treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibition, even though substantial time had elapsed. The difference between initial and retrospective judgment was irrespective of treatment response. In this setting, the 'then-test' could not prove adaptation in AS.

### Proactive infectious disease approach to dermatologic patients who are taking tumor necrosis factor-alfa antagonists: part II. screening for patients on tumor necrosis factor-alfa antagonists [^114rPwYd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alfa levels are linked to disease severity in patients with inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis. Inhibitors of this cytokine are commonly used with significant success in the treatment of such inflammatory disorders. Their use, however, can be plagued by infectious complications. An awareness of potential infections associated with these therapies is critical in order to maximize preventive efforts both before and during therapy. This review provides a guide for dermatologists caring for patients in need of this type of biologic therapy to preemptively address the infectious risks. Part II of this continuing medical education article reviews recommended screening methods for patients undergoing evaluations for tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy for psoriasis or other dermatologic diseases, and discusses possible prophylactic strategies to use, including the appropriate use of immunizations.

	Serious Infections

ILARIS has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections. Exercise caution when administering ILARIS to patients with infections, a history of recurring infections or underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. Avoid administering ILARIS to patients during an active infection requiring medical intervention. Discontinue ILARIS if a patient develops a serious infection.

Infections, predominantly of the upper respiratory tract, in some instances serious, have been reported with ILARIS. Generally, the observed infections responded to standard therapy. Isolated cases of unusual or opportunistic infections (e.g., aspergillosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster) were reported during ILARIS treatment. A causal relationship of ILARIS to these events cannot be excluded. In clinical trials, ILARIS has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Coadministration of ILARIS with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of new tuberculosis and reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that use of IL-1 inhibitors, such as ILARIS, increases the risk of reactivation of tuberculosis or of opportunistic infections.

Prior to initiating immunomodulatory therapies, including ILARIS, evaluate patients for active and latent tuberculosis infection. Appropriate screening tests should be performed in all patients. ILARIS has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of ILARIS in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. Treat patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening according to standard medical practice prior to therapy with ILARIS. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs, symptoms, or high-risk exposure suggestive of tuberculosis (e.g., persistent cough, weight loss, subfebrile temperature) appear during or after ILARIS therapy.

Healthcare providers should follow current CDC guidelines both to evaluate for and to treat possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ILARIS.

	Immunosuppression

The impact of treatment with anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) therapy on the development of malignancies is not known. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including ILARIS, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.

5.2.4.6 Secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy

Statement 93. We suggest that patients with secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy may have serum drug and anti-drug antibody concentrations measured to inform appropriate changes in treatment (GRADE: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.6%).

Secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy can occur as a consequence of immune-mediated neutralising antibodies to the drug (although there are likely to be other mechanisms including non-neutralising, drug-clearing antibodies or non-immune-mediated mechanisms). Measurements of drug and antibody levels are helpful in guiding next steps. A retrospective analysis of 247 IBD patients with 330 loss of response events (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab) showed that, following loss of response, trough concentration measurements and anti-drug antibodies could inform the likely outcome of interventions. Patients with either adequate drug concentrations (adalimumab > 4.5 µg/mL or infliximab > 3.8 µg/mL) or positive anti-drug antibodies (adalimumab > 4 µg/mL equivalent or infliximab > 9 µg/mL equivalent) did better by switching to an alternative anti-TNF or an alternative class of drug, whereas patients with low drug concentration and negative antibodies improved with dose increase. A decision analytic model in Crohn's patients losing responsiveness to infliximab showed that a testing strategy was likely to be cost-effective compared with empiric changes in treatment. In a prospective study of IBD patients with secondary loss of response to infliximab, all of whom had a dose increase, mucosal healing occurred in half of patients and was associated with a rise in trough levels. In patients losing response to infliximab and manifesting with 'end of dose' recurrence of Crohn's symptoms, drug levels and anti-drug antibody levels should be checked and consideration given to starting concomitant immunomodulator therapy where this is not already being used. To increase the drug levels of infliximab by shortening the infusion interval to 6 weeks may be as effective as shortening to 4 weeks or giving a 10 mg/kg dose. Once remission has been recaptured over a period of 3–4 months, it may be possible to reduce the dose or stretch the intervals back out again without losing response. In a further retrospective study in 168 Crohn's patients losing response, 112 patients were treated with 10 mg/kg 8-weekly and 56 with 5 mg/kg at 4-week intervals. Sustained response was achieved in 50% who received double dose and 39% of those with interval shortening, OR 1.5 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.9). Doubling the dose is generally more convenient and cost-effective than interval shortening.

### Optimizing withdrawal strategies for anti-TNF-α therapies in rheumatoid arthritis [^115rEXr1]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. While treatment options have expanded over the years, including the introduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) inhibitors (TNFi), optimizing withdrawal strategies for these agents remains a challenge.

Areas Covered

This review examines the current evidence on TNFi withdrawal strategies in RA, focusing on factors influencing withdrawal decisions such as disease activity monitoring, treatment response, patient characteristics, and biomarkers. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and expert guidelines. The pathophysiology of RA, current pharmacological agents, and the treat-to-target strategy are discussed to provide a holistic understanding of RA management.

Expert Opinion

Withdrawal strategies could be suitable for certain patients, keeping in mind that several factors influence withdrawal decisions, including treatment response, disease activity and monitoring, and patient characteristics. The decision to withdraw TNFi must balance the benefits against the potential risks of disease flare and long-term treatment-related adverse effects. Combining DMARDs and TNFi early improves outcomes, supporting tapering strategies for cost-effectiveness and flare prevention. Future directions, including precision medicine approaches, patient-centered care models, and health economics analyses, are proposed to further optimize RA management and improve patient outcomes.

### Clinical utility and accuracy of point-of-care testing for anti-TNF drug monitoring and loss of response [^117EhMJR]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Messages

What is already known? Point-of-care tests enable rapid measurement of drug concentrations, including anti-TNF agents such as infliximab and adalimumab.

What is new here? Infliximab and adalimumab serum concentrations measured by point-of-care tests are associated with loss of response in inflammatory bowel disease patients.

How can this study help patient care? These findings implicate the potential of point-of-care tests to provide real-time data, facilitating prompt therapy adjustments to improve patient outcomes.

### Evaluation of screening methods for identification of patients with chronic rheumatological disease requiring tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis prior to commencement of TNF-α antagonist therapy [^111Tkdha]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonist therapy are at increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation. The aim of this study was to determine the optimum available screening strategy for identifying patients for tuberculosis (TB) chemoprophylaxis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational study of consecutive adults with chronic rheumatological disease referred for LTBI screening prior to commencement of TNF-α antagonist therapy. All patients included had calculation of TB risk according to age, ethnicity and year of UK entry, as described in the 2005 British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines and measurement of tuberculin skin test (TST) and T. Spot.TB.

Results

There were 187 patients included in the study, with 157 patients (84%) taking immunosuppressants. 137 patients would require further risk stratification according to the BTS algorithm, with 110 (80.3%) classified as being at low risk of having LTBI. There were 39 patients (35.5%) who were categorised as low risk but were either TST and/or T. Spot positive and would not have received chemoprophylaxis according to the BTS algorithm. Combination of all three methods (risk stratification and/or positive T. Spot and/or positive TST) identified 66 patients out of 137 who would potentially be offered chemoprophylaxis, which was greater than any single test or two-test combination.

Conclusion

Performing both a TST and T. Spot in patients on immunosuppressants prior to commencement of TNF-α antagonist therapy gives an additional yield of potential LTBI compared with use of risk stratification tables alone. Our results suggest that use of all three screening modalities gives the highest yield of patients potentially requiring chemoprophylaxis.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^1119kax7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

TNF-α inhibitors — ongoing monitoring and visit frequency include specific assessment for infections (eg, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis), screening for skin cancer especially in those taking TNF-α-inhibitors and in high-risk patients, and that yearly testing for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or Quantiferon Gold) should be done in patients at high risk, whereas for patients who are not at high risk screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist; an annual chest radiograph may be considered at the discretion of the treating dermatologist. CBC with differential and CMP are not supported by evidence and are to be assessed at the discretion of each physicians' criteria except in cases involving patients treated with infliximab, for whom it is recommended that liver function tests be repeated every 3 mo after initiation, and if the result is normal, every 6–12 mo thereafter; a follow-up visit may be scheduled from quarterly to twice yearly depending on time of treatment, response, and tolerability of medication.

### Comparison of recommendations for the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy in ankylosing spondylitis in 23 countries worldwide [^114ErDnK]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To give an overview of the recommendations for the use of anti-TNF-α therapy in AS in 23 countries worldwide.

Methods

The recommendations were collected, translated and a summary was checked by Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) members from the respective countries. The recommendations were compared with the ASAS recommendations (2006) on three aspects: patient selection for initiation of treatment (diagnosis, disease activity, previous treatment and contraindications), assessment of disease and assessment of response.

Results

The majority of the recommendations are similar to the ASAS recommendation with regard to patient selection, assessment of disease and treatment response. Additional objective assessments of disease activity are required in eight countries, leading to a more strict indication to start anti-TNF-α therapy. CONCLUSION; Most national recommendations follow the international ASAS recommendations, suggesting that the latter are widely implemented. This might contribute to comparable access with anti-TNF-α treatment across countries. This article shows that general consensus exists about the use of anti-TNF-α therapy in AS across the world, although some countries require additional objective signs of inflammation and/or more pre-treatment, which limits access.

### The incidence of tuberculosis in patients treated with certolizumab pegol across indications: impact of baseline skin test results, more stringent screening criteria and geographic region [^1177kDYw]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antitumour necrosis factors (anti-TNFs) have provided a major breakthrough in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases but are associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, including active tuberculosis (TB). The onset of TB soon after initiation of anti-TNF therapy indicates the probable reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI), while TB appearing after several months or more of continuous exposure to anti-TNF is likely to arise due to a new infection. Reports suggest that the incidence of TB in patients treated with biologics has decreased over the past decade thanks to screening of LTBI, as recommended in several countries. However, the risk of active TB (particularly non-pulmonary TB) associated with anti-TNFsand underlying inflammatory diseasesremains an important concern. Thus, patients being considered for anti-TNF therapy should undergo initial screening for LTBI, and regular screening for TB infection should be performed during anti-TNF treatment if patients are living in, or have travelled to, TB endemic regions. However, the benefits of repeat screening in TB endemic regions are debatableand the perfect approach for screening patients with anti-TNF has not yet been resolved, with different strategies being used to try to identify patients at risk of developing TB.
