## Question

Is intranasal oxymetazoline indicated for epiglottitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intranasal oxymetazoline is indicated for epiglottitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of epiglottitis and the standard airway-first management. Then, I should verify oxymetazoline's pharmacology and labeled indications. Next, I will assess anatomic and mechanistic plausibility of an intranasal decongestant affecting the epiglottis. After that, I need to check safety considerations in a potentially unstable airway patient. Then, I will review guidelines and any direct evidence for this use. Finally, I will consider alternative contexts where oxymetazoline is used (e.g., nasal intubation) to avoid conflation, and synthesize a conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priorities in epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is a rapidly progressive supraglottic airway emergency where early airway evaluation and a low threshold for intubation are the cornerstone, with prompt antibiotics; in fact, guidance cautions against "conservative" distractions that may delay definitive airway protection, and the role of steroids is variable and secondary to airway management, so I should not let anything detract from airway security here [^115fuMT9].

> I will now examine oxymetazoline's pharmacology and approvals. Oxymetazoline is a topical alpha-adrenergic agonist vasoconstrictor approved intranasally for nasal congestion and topically for rosacea; it also has an ophthalmic use for acquired blepharoptosis, but there is no indication for epiglottitis or supraglottic airway edema in any labeling or trials I can find, which already makes me cautious about off-label application in an airway emergency [^111potk7] [^114sH6wf] [^114jgbi3] [^1161bJuT] [^111TVFjm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could intranasal vasoconstriction meaningfully reduce epiglottic edema via local or systemic effects. Wait, let me verify the anatomy and delivery: the epiglottis sits in the oropharynx/hypopharynx, anatomically distinct from the nasal cavity, so intranasal delivery won't reach the inflamed supraglottic tissues; epiglottitis is typically infectious/inflammatory and requires antibiotics and airway protection, and vasoconstriction of nasal mucosa neither treats the infection nor prevents abrupt airway loss, so the mechanistic fit is poor.

> Next, I should review safety in this context. Oxymetazoline can cause cardiovascular adverse effects including hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias; although a small randomized trial in nonhypertensive ED outpatients did not show significant blood pressure changes versus saline, pediatric case reports document hypertensive crisis and substantial overdose risk from device-related dosing variability, which is especially concerning in distressed patients with tenuous airways, so I need to be very cautious about iatrogenic instability here [^111Pd6aW] [^116RdUKp] [^111eUndf] [^113NsHJ7].

> I need to check whether any epiglottitis guideline or study supports this practice. Let me think about this carefully: the epiglottitis literature emphasizes early airway control, antibiotics, and supportive care; I find no trials, case reports, or guideline recommendations for intranasal decongestants in epiglottitis, and major rhinitis guidelines that discuss intranasal decongestants apply to nasal congestion syndromes, not to supraglottic infections, so there is a clear evidence gap and a mismatch in indication [^115fuMT9] [^113K7Fcs] [^114PQ2Kx] [^116Fdjxo].

> But wait, what if the question stems from uses around airway procedures. Let me consider that oxymetazoline and other vasoconstrictors are used intranasally to reduce bleeding and facilitate nasal instrumentation, such as nasotracheal intubation or nasoendoscopy; however, that preps the nasal passage and does not treat epiglottitis itself, and conflating these settings could mislead management of a supraglottic emergency [^114noUZR] [^11411ham].

> Let me reconsider my earlier thought about potential systemic absorption helping edema; on second pass, systemic exposure from standard intranasal dosing is low and not targeted to the supraglottic tissues, and even if minimal vasoconstriction occurred systemically, it would not address the infectious pathobiology or avert sudden airway compromise, reinforcing that this would be a distracting and potentially harmful detour from the airway-first standard of care [^114wCYm5].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should confirm that intranasal oxymetazoline is not indicated for epiglottitis because there is no therapeutic rationale for site delivery, no supporting clinical evidence, potential cardiovascular harm particularly in children, and it risks delaying definitive airway management and antibiotics; the appropriate course remains immediate airway evaluation with readiness for intubation and prompt antimicrobial therapy, without reliance on nasal decongestants for supraglottic disease [^1139pgks] [^115fuMT9] [^114wCYm5].

Intranasal oxymetazoline is **not recommended** for epiglottitis because it does not reduce supraglottic edema and may cause rebound congestion [^114SuHWo], mucosal irritation [^111Pd6aW], or systemic effects [^111eUndf] that can worsen airway obstruction [^1139pgks]. The standard of care is **prompt airway stabilization and intravenous antibiotics**; intranasal oxymetazoline is not supported by clinical guidelines or evidence for epiglottitis management.

---

## Pharmacological properties of oxymetazoline

Oxymetazoline is an **alpha-adrenergic agonist** [^114sH6wf] that causes vasoconstriction of nasal mucosal vessels, reducing congestion and edema [^111bzKb7]. It is commonly used for short-term relief of nasal congestion in conditions such as allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and the common cold [^1149eHUb]. However, its effects are primarily **limited to the nasal mucosa** [^114PQ2Kx] and do not extend to deeper airway structures, such as the epiglottis.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for intranasal oxymetazoline in the management of epiglottitis. The primary concern is the rapid progression of supraglottic edema leading to sudden airway obstruction [^114wCYm5], and the standard of care is **prompt airway stabilization** — typically via endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy — plus intravenous antibiotics [^115fuMT9]. Intranasal oxymetazoline **does not address the underlying inflammation or infection**, and its vasoconstrictive effects are limited to the nasal mucosa [^111bzKb7] with little impact on the edema of the epiglottis or surrounding supraglottic structures; therefore, its use in epiglottitis is **not supported by clinical evidence or guidelines**.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

In epiglottitis, intranasal oxymetazoline carries several **potential risks and adverse effects**:

- **Rebound congestion**: Prolonged use of oxymetazoline can lead to rebound congestion, which may exacerbate airway obstruction in epiglottitis patients [^114SuHWo].

- **Systemic absorption**: Oxymetazoline can be absorbed systemically [^111Pd6aW], potentially causing hypertension, bradycardia, and other cardiovascular effects [^111eUndf].

- **Mucosal irritation**: Oxymetazoline may cause local irritation, dryness, and discomfort, which could further aggravate the inflamed airway mucosa in epiglottitis [^111Pd6aW].

Given these risks, intranasal oxymetazoline is **not recommended** in epiglottitis.

---

## Alternative pharmacological interventions

The **primary pharmacological interventions** for epiglottitis include:

- **Intravenous antibiotics**: Empiric antibiotic therapy targeting common pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus is essential.

- **Corticosteroids**: Although controversial, corticosteroids may be considered to reduce inflammation and edema in some cases [^115fuMT9].

- **Epinephrine nebulization**: In certain cases, nebulized epinephrine may be used to temporarily reduce airway edema and facilitate airway management.

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient safety considerations

The primary clinical outcome in epiglottitis is maintaining **airway patency** and preventing respiratory failure. Intranasal oxymetazoline **does not significantly impact this outcome** and may add risk. Patient safety considerations include potential **rebound congestion**, **systemic absorption**, and **mucosal irritation**, which could compromise **airway management** and overall safety [^1139pgks].

---

Intranasal oxymetazoline is **not recommended** for epiglottitis due to lack of evidence and potential risks. The standard of care involves **airway stabilization and intravenous antibiotics**, with corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine as adjuncts.

### Sepsis in a patient with acute epiglottitis and respiratory failure [^1139pgks]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Whenever evidence for swelling of the upper airway exists, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of rapid clinical deterioration. Intubation should be evaluated early, aiming to avoid complications such as severe hypoxaemia. Neisseria meningitidis is a rare cause of epiglottitis/supraglottitis, usually responsive to most recommended antibiotic regimens. Steroid treatment is controversially discussed in the treatment of epiglottitis but can be considered in the clinical presentation of bacterial sepsis as part of sepsis bundle treatment.

We present three cases of adult epiglottitis in which the airway was lost prior to or during the intervention of an anaesthetist. We suggest that an emphasis on conservative management is distracting and belies the serious nature of this disease.

### Antipyrine and benzocaine [^112kYfSn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Antipyrine and benzocaine is indicated for use in acute otitis media of various etiologies. It provides prompt relief of pain and reduction of inflammation during the congestive and serous stages. It also serves as an adjuvant therapy during systemic antibiotic administration for the resolution of the infection. Due to the close anatomical relationship of the eustachian tube to the nasal cavity, otitis media is a frequent problem. This is particularly prevalent in children, as their eustachian tubes are shorter, wider, and more horizontal compared to adults.

Additionally, antipyrine and benzocaine facilitates the removal of excessive or impacted cerumen.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^111JATmB]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Drug-related adverse events occurred in less than 20% of patients in all treatment groups. The most common drug-related adverse event in all groups was epistaxis. This was also the most common drug-related adverse event in the subset of patients aged 2–6 years, occurring in 15% of patients treated with placebo compared with 5% and 7% of patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 110 µg, respectively. All epistaxis events were mild in intensity, with the exception of one patient in the placebo group for whom the event was unresolved. The 6–12-year age subset had a lower incidence of drug-related adverse events in the placebo and FFNS 55 µg treatment groups (post hoc analysis).

Only one serious adverse event of tonsillitis was reported in a 4-year-old patient treated with FFNS 110 µg, but it was not considered to be related to the study drug. The patient was withdrawn from the study due to the event.

### Oxymetazoline adds to the effectiveness of fluticasone furoate in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis [^111potk7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). High credibility.

In clinical trials, only about 60% of subjects report an excellent response to intranasal steroids, suggesting the need to add therapies to intranasal steroids to provide additional efficacy.

- **Objective**: To determine whether the combination of fluticasone furoate and oxymetazoline is more efficacious than either agent alone and to assess whether rhinitis medicamentosa develops after treatment.

- **Methods**: We performed a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel study. Sixty patients with perennial allergy were randomized to 4 weeks of once-a-night treatment with either fluticasone furoate, oxymetazoline hydrochloride, the combination of both, or placebo. They were monitored during treatment and for 2 weeks post-treatment.

- **Results**: The total nasal symptom score over the 4 weeks of treatment was lower with the combination (median, 143; range, 30–316) compared with treatment with placebo (262; 116–358) and oxymetazoline alone (219; 78–385; ANOVA, P = 0.04). When acoustic rhinometry was compared between the groups at the end of 4 weeks of treatment, the combination resulted in significantly higher nasal volume (mean + SEM, 15.8 + 1.1 mL; P < .03) compared with both placebo (12.1 + 0.9 mL) and oxymetazoline (12.4 + 0.8 mL) alone. The quality of life data showed no significant differences among the groups. Peak flow showed a nonsignificant improvement with the groups on fluticasone furoate. There was no evidence of rhinitis medicamentosa.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of oxymetazoline enhances the effectiveness of fluticasone furoate in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis.

### Effects of common cold and concomitant administration of nasal decongestant on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nasal glucagon in otherwise healthy participants: A randomized clinical trial [^116nL9RM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Comparable results were seen with nasal glucagon (NG) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were treated with single or repeated 3-mg doses of NG in a randomized sequence. Repeated doses of NG, which involved doubling the NG dose, resulted in higher glucagon concentrations, but glucose responses resembled those seen with a single dose. Although repeated dosing resulted in greater systemic glucagon exposure, it did not result in a clinically meaningful increase in glucose response. All NG treatments were generally well-tolerated. Many observed adverse events (AEs) were related to local tolerability, probably explained by the route of administration. Other AEs are well-known effects of glucagon administration, including nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure. An increased pulse rate is also generally observed with glucagon administration; however, a significant change in pulse rate was not seen in this study. The administration of oxymetazoline, acting as a vasoconstrictor, may have contributed to the rise in blood pressure, which was more pronounced in participants treated with a decongestant.

Despite the presence of cold symptoms in this study, these pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety results are similar to those observed in a study of glucagon in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who were not experiencing nasal congestion. This indicates that NG PK/PD were not significantly altered by nasal congestion, with or without the use of a nasal decongestant. This is in contrast to a study of nasally-administered fentanyl, where absorption was somewhat compromised and T_max was delayed by oxymetazoline administration.

### Oral midazolam vs. intranasal dexmedetomidine plus oral midazolam for sedation of pediatric outpatients: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial [^114F7V2h]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

To identify the safer and more effective sedative for use in pediatric dentistry, various dosages and routes of administration have been explored for multiple sedative drugs. Among them, dexmedetomidine is increasingly used in pediatric sedation. Dexmedetomidine can be administered by intravenous, oral, mucosal, and intramuscular routes. In this study, we used nasal spray administration. In contrast to oral administration, nasal spray administration avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism, providing more reliable absorption.

Intranasal dexmedetomidine is a noninvasive method of administration, which does not stimulate the nasal mucosa, avoids eliciting patient fear, and is more acceptable to children, in contrast to intravenous and intramuscular injections. Although bradycardia and hypotension are common side effects of dexmedetomidine sedation, intervention is rarely required, as observed in this study.

In our clinical experience, we found that sudden arousal in response to stimulation, such as pain or sound stimulation in the procedures, may be a disadvantage of dexmedetomidine as a sole sedative. This resulted in a clinically significant rate of sedation failure, corresponding with previous studies.

### Nasal decongestants in monotherapy for the common cold [^1149eHUb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Many treatments for the common cold exist and are sold over-the-counter. Nevertheless, evidence on the effectiveness and safety of nasal decongestants is limited.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and the short- and long-term safety of nasal decongestants used in monotherapy to alleviate symptoms of the common cold in adults and children.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 6, June 2016), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016), Embase (2010 to 15 July 2016), CINAHL (1981 to 15 July 2016), LILACS (1982 to July 2016), Web of Science (1955 to July 2016), and clinical trials registers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs investigating the effectiveness and adverse effects of nasal decongestants compared with placebo for treating the common cold in adults and children. We excluded quasi-RCTs.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently extracted and summarised data on subjective measures of nasal congestion, overall patient well-being score, objective measures of nasal airway resistance, adverse effects, and general recovery. One review author acted as an arbiter in cases of disagreement. We categorised trials as single and multi-dose and analysed data both separately and together. We also analysed studies using an oral or topical nasal decongestant both separately and together.

- **Main results**: We included 15 trials with 1,838 participants. Fourteen studies included adult participants only.

### Not just a drop in the bucket-inversion of oxymetazoline nasal decongestant container increases potential for severe pediatric poisoning [^113NsHJ7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Oxymetazoline is an over-the-counter nasal decongestant with potent alpha agonist properties. In overdoses as small as 1–2 mL, toxicity can be seen, including bradycardia and respiratory depression. We demonstrated that inverting the container increased the volume delivered 20- to 30-fold compared with holding it upright in an in vitro model.

### Lidocaine/phenylephrine nasal spray versus nebulization prior to nasoendoscopy: A randomized controlled trial [^115Qxdjv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018).

The objective of this study was to objectively compare the nasal decongestion potency of lidocaine/phenylephrine when delivered with a nasal nebulizer and a nasal spray before a rigid nasoendoscopic examination. This was an open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in a multicenter setting. The methods involved a prospective clinical trial with 106 participants suffering from untreated chronic rhinitis. Of these, 53 participants received 400 μL of lidocaine/phenylephrine administered into the right nostril with a nasal nebulizer, while the remaining 53 participants received the same volume administered with a nasal spray. The left nostril served as the control.

Nasal resistance at a 150-Pa fixed pressure was evaluated using active anterior rhinomanometry at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after the intervention. The pain score was assessed subjectively by applying pressure to the inferior turbinate 30 minutes post-intervention. The results demonstrated an overall reduction in nasal resistance of the right nostril when lidocaine/phenylephrine was administered with the nasal nebulizer compared to the nasal spray. A statistically significant difference in nasal resistance was observed at 5 minutes (P = 0.047), 15 minutes (P = 0.016), and 30 minutes (P = 0.036). The examining endoscopist supported the degree of nasal decongestion through a subjective assessment of the nasal cavity (P = 0.001). Pain scores indicated a significant decrease in the pain threshold when the nasal nebulizer was used instead of the nasal spray (P = 0.040).

In conclusion, this study suggests that delivering lidocaine/phenylephrine to the nasal passages via a nebulizer may be more effective than using a nasal spray for reducing nasal resistance and pain thresholds during nasoendoscopic examinations.

### Fluticasone reverses oxymetazoline-induced tachyphylaxis of response and rebound congestion [^114SuHWo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Chronic use of intranasal decongestants, such as oxymetazoline, leads to tachyphylaxis of response and rebound congestion, caused by alpha-adrenoceptor mediated down-regulation and desensitization of response.

- **Objectives**: We evaluated if tachyphylaxis can be reversed by intranasal fluticasone propionate, and the relative alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor components of tachyphylaxis using the alpha(1)-antagonist prazosin.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 19 healthy subjects received intranasal oxymetazoline, 200 micrograms three times a day for 14 days, followed by the addition of fluticasone, 200 micrograms twice a day for a further 3 days. On Days 1, 14, and 17, participants received a single dose of oral prazosin, 1 mg, or placebo with measurements made before and 2 hours later.

- **Measurements and main results**: Outcomes evaluated were peak nasal inspiratory flow, nasal resistance, blood flow, and the oxymetazoline dose-response curve (DRC). On Day 14 versus Day 1, inspiratory flow decreased (mean difference, 95% confidence interval) (-47.9 L min⁻¹; -63.9 to -31.9; P < 0.001) and the DRC shifted downward (24.8 L min⁻¹; 20.3–29.3; P < 0.001). On Day 17 versus Day 14, after fluticasone, inspiratory flow increased (45 L min⁻¹; 30–61; P < 0.001) and the DRC shifted upward (26.2 L min⁻¹; 21.7–30.7; P < 0.001). On Day 1, prazosin reduced inspiratory flow (-52.6 L min⁻¹; -86 to -19.2) compared with baseline. This effect was abolished on Day 14 (7.9 L min⁻¹; -41.3 to 25.5).

Oxymetazoline-induced tachyphylaxis can thus be reversed by intranasal fluticasone propionate.

### Oxymetazoline and hypertensive crisis in a child: Can we prevent it [^111eUndf]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Oxymetazoline nasal spray is not FDA approved for use in children less than 6 years; however, its safety and efficacy are widely accepted, and it is in widespread use in children prior to procedures that may lead to epistaxis. We report a case of intraoperative oxymetazoline toxicity in a 4-year-old boy that led to a hypertensive crisis. While examining the possible causes for this problem, we became aware that the method of drug delivery led to an unanticipated overdose. The position in which the bottle is held causes pronounced variation in the quantity of oxymetazoline dispensed.

- **Methods**: To examine the impact that bottle position has on the volume delivered, we measured the volume of oxymetazoline dispensed with the bottle in the upright and inverted position. We also measured the volume of a drop of oxymetazoline dispensed from the bottle. Because an additional source of oxymetazoline exposure is from packing the nares with surgical pledgets, we analyzed the volume of oxymetazoline absorbed by each pledget.

- **Results**: Squeezing the bottle in the upright position results in a fine spray of fluid that averaged 28.9 ± 6.8 μl and was largely independent of effort. This volume is nearly identical to the measured volume of a drop of oxymetazoline, which was 30 μl. However, squeezing the bottle in the inverted position resulted in a steady stream of fluid, and the volume administered was completely effort dependent. Multiple tests in the inverted position demonstrated an average volume of 1037 ± 527 μl, with a range of 473–2196 μl. Lastly, the volume of oxymetazol…

### Evaluation of the relative intranasal abuse potential of a hydrocodone extended-release tablet formulated with abuse-deterrence technology in nondependent, recreational opioid users [^114L1RtL]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Mean plasma hydrocodone concentration-time profiles over 24 hours for active treatments are shown in Figure 2B. The plasma concentration-time profile for each treatment resembled its corresponding profile for "at the moment" drug liking over time, shown in Figure 2A.

	- Table 2 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters for each active study treatment. Cmax was lowest for oral intact hydrocodone ER (25.1 ng/mL) and highest for intranasal HYD-OF (80.3 ng/mL). As expected, the rate of absorption of hydrocodone was slowest for oral intact hydrocodone ER, with a tmax of 9.1 hours, compared with the tmax for intranasal hydrocodone ER (2.6 hours), intranasal hydrocodone powder (1.4 hours), and intranasal HYD-OF (1.1 hours). Decline from peak plasma concentrations appeared to occur in a monophasic manner, with mean t1/2 of 10 hours for oral intact hydrocodone ER and 5.6 to 6.2 hours for intranasal hydrocodone treatments.

	- Overall systemic exposures (as assessed by AUC 0-∞ and AUC 0-t) were comparable after administration of intranasal hydrocodone ER and intranasal hydrocodone powder. However, peak hydrocodone plasma concentration was approximately 12% lower after administration of intranasal hydrocodone ER compared with intranasal hydrocodone powder. As a result of the lower and later peak value, early exposure, as assessed by AUC 0-tmax, IN(powder) and AUC 0-tmax, ER(IN), to hydrocodone was notably lower for intranasal hydrocodone ER, by approximately 51% and 30%, respectively.

### Comparison of hemostatic effect and safety between epinephrine and tramazoline during nasotracheal intubation: A double-blind randomized trial [^114noUZR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). High credibility.

Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is frequently necessary during dental, maxillofacial, and oropharyngeal surgeries. Although this method is very useful in operations where the operative field and airway are congruent, some complications associated with NTI include nasal bleeding, bacteremia, retropharyngeal perforation, and partial or complete obstruction of the tube has been reported. Several effective preventive measures against nasal bleeding, retropharyngeal perforation, and bacteremia have been reported.

Previous studies have compared the vasoconstriction effect of epinephrine (E) and xylometazoline during NTI; however, xylometazoline is not available in the authors' country. The nasal mucosa is usually treated with vasoconstrictors, such as E or tramazoline (T), prior to NTI in the authors' country. While xylometazoline is an imidazole derivative designed to mimic the molecular shape of epinephrine and binds with alpha 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors and can induce vasoconstriction, T stimulates alpha 2 receptors and constricts local blood vessels in the nasal cavity, eliminating hyperemia and swelling of the nasal mucosa.

The kind of vasoconstrictors used during NTI is still debatable. T has been used for treatment since 1960 and E even before that. Considering their significant use in medical procedures for over 60 years, their efficacy and side effects are well known. Although arrhythmia and cardiac arrest have been reported in the literature for nasal treatments performed with E and oxymetazoline, no previous reports have compared the vasoconstriction effects and safety of these drugs in this context.

### A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, intranasal human abuse potential study of oxycodone ARIR, a novel, immediate-release, abuse-deterrent formulation [^111hWXRd]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetic assessments**: The least squares (LS) mean C max was lower for intranasally administered crushed oxycodone ARIR (40.04 ng/mL) compared to intranasal administration of crushed IR oxycodone (55.56 ng/mL) and oral administration of intact oxycodone ARIR (56.97 ng/mL). Based on LS means, the oxycodone C max was 28% lower for crushed intranasal oxycodone ARIR than for crushed intranasal IR oxycodone. Crushed intranasal oxycodone ARIR exhibited a 35% longer median T max relative to crushed intranasal IR oxycodone. Oxycodone plasma concentrations were higher for crushed intranasal IR oxycodone than for crushed intranasal oxycodone ARIR for the first three hours after administration. From four hours onward, the concentrations were similar and decreased in parallel. Early oxycodone exposure (AUC 0–0.5 h) was 57% lower for crushed intranasal oxycodone ARIR and 78% lower for intact oral oxycodone ARIR than for crushed intranasal IR oxycodone. The AQs (C max /T max) for crushed intranasal oxycodone ARIR were 43% and 53% lower than those for crushed intranasal IR oxycodone and intact oral oxycodone ARIR, respectively (21.93 vs 38.42 vs 46.81 ng/mL/h, respectively).

Mean plasma concentration time profiles of oxycodone for each treatment were documented. The first comparison (A) covered the first three hours postdose, while the second (B) extended to 24 hours postdose. Error bars denote standard deviation.

### Sepsis in a patient with acute epiglottitis and respiratory failure [^115fuMT9]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians should be vigilant for rapid clinical deterioration whenever evidence of swelling in the upper airway exists. Early evaluation for intubation is crucial to avoid complications such as severe hypoxemia. Rare causes of airway swelling cannot be dismissed and should always be considered as part of the differential diagnoses. The early administration of antibiotic therapy, when an infectious origin is suspected, can be lifesaving and should not be delayed.

### Safety of once-daily oxymetazoline HCl ophthalmic solution, 0.1% in patients with acquired blepharoptosis: Results from four randomized, double-masked clinical trials [^111TVFjm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Oxymetazoline is thought to act via α-adrenergic receptors on Müller's muscle, resulting in muscle contraction and eyelid elevation. This muscle remains intact and functional in the most common form of acquired blepharoptosis (aponeurotic), and it is a common surgical target. Functional studies demonstrate that oxymetazoline is a full α2 agonist and a partial α1 agonist, with an approximately 5-fold greater affinity for α2. Within the α1 receptor subgroup, oxymetazoline has been shown to have a higher affinity for α1A vs. α1B, and weak affinity for the α1D subtype. The in vivo pharmacology of oxymetazoline 0.1% remains to be fully elucidated; however, it is possible that receptor selectivity may contribute to the observed safety profile.

Tachyphylaxis is common with prolonged use of α1-selective or mixed α1/α2 agents, and the mechanism of this phenomenon is thought to be a reduced α1-adrenergic receptor response. Improvement in upper eyelid elevation has been shown with naphazoline, a mixed α1/α2 agonist, but so has tachyphylaxis with repeated daily dosing. Similarly, rebound effects of ocular decongestants are also thought to occur via an α1-dependent mechanism. Following administration of phenylephrine, which is α1-selective, patients can experience clinically significant pupil dilation. In comparison, there was a negligible effect on pupil diameter with oxymetazoline 0.1% and no reports of a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of mydriasis in the present studies. Similarly, there were no documented cases of tachyphylaxis over 14–84 days of treatment with oxymetazoline 0.1%.

### The rising incidence of adult acute epiglottitis and epiglottic abscess [^1133HHch]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

To examine preliminary observations that the incidence of adult acute epiglottitis has risen between 1986 and 2000, demographics, annual and seasonal occurrences, clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, treatment, airway management, and complications of 116 consecutive adult patients with laryngoscopically confirmed acute epiglottitis are presented.

The mean annual incidence of acute epiglottitis per 100,000 adults significantly increased from 0.88 (from 1986–1990) to 2.1 (from 1991–1995) and to 3.1 (from 1996–2000) (P < 0.001). This rise seems to be unrelated to Haemophilus influenzae type b infection but related to miscellaneous pathogenic bacteria. During these periods, the number of epiglottic abscesses increased concomitantly with the rise in the incidence of acute epiglottitis (from 4/14 episodes [29%], to 8/38 [21%], and to 16/66 [24%], respectively), showing a relatively constant ratio between both phenomena (P = 0.843).

Twenty-five patients (21%) underwent airway intervention, 16 because of objective respiratory distress and 9 because of imminent respiratory obstruction. Stepwise logistic regression showed that drooling, diabetes mellitus, rapid onset of symptoms, and abscess formation were associated with airway obstruction. Diverse origins for the epiglottic abscess, either from coalescent epiglottic infection or from mucopyocele of the tongue base, are suggested.

A rise in the incidence of acute epiglottitis and a concomitant rise in the number of epiglottic abscesses were established.

### Improvement of CPAP tolerance and adherence in a patient with obstructive sleep apnea with the use of nasal steroids and nasal oxymetazoline [^115rZMkj]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is a challenge in patients with allergic rhinitis. We present a case of a 62-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who had been struggling with PAP therapy for 10 years. Intranasal fluticasone alone did not result in tolerance of PAP therapy. However, the combination of once-daily intranasal oxymetazoline with fluticasone led to significant improvement in tolerance and adherence to PAP therapy. Although twice-daily oxymetazoline alone has been associated with developing rhinitis medicamentosa, this side effect was not experienced by our patient. Some studies have shown that using intranasal oxymetazoline along with an intranasal steroid once daily for 4 weeks demonstrated improved effectiveness in relieving nasal symptoms with no development of rebound congestion or rhinitis medicamentosa. This strategy may be helpful in improving continuous PAP tolerance for patients with obstructive sleep apnea and rhinitis, a potential area to explore in the future to improve PAP adherence.

### Use of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray in the treatment of rhinitis medicamentosa: An experimental study [^116oDHPR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

We aimed to investigate histopathologic changes in the nasal mucosa of guinea pigs after prolonged administration of oxymetazoline, the development of rhinitis medicamentosa, and the efficacy of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray and saline in reversing the ultrastructural changes attributable to rhinitis medicamentosa.

In the study, 24 male guinea pigs (500 to 600 g) were used. Oxymetazoline (0.05%) was sprayed into the nasal cavities of the guinea pigs three times daily for eight weeks. At the end of this period, six guinea pigs were killed and examined to ensure that they had developed rhinitis medicamentosa. The remaining guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups. In the first group, one spray-puff of 0.05% mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray (50 micrograms) was applied twice daily for 14 days. In the second group, saline solution (0.9% NaCl) was applied twice daily for 14 days. No treatment was performed in the third group. At the end of the treatment period, nasal mucosal changes were evaluated by light microscopy and electron microscopy.

After oxymetazoline application for eight weeks, the main histologic changes included edema, congestion, proliferation of subepithelial glands, and squamous cell metaplasia. After topical mometasone furoate aqueous spray application for two weeks, the edema fluid was found to diminish markedly. In the saline and no treatment groups, edema and congestion continued. In these groups of guinea pigs, fibrosis was observed in the nasal mucosa.

We found that mometasone furoate nasal spray was effective in reducing the histopathologic changes associated with rhinitis medicamentosa.

### Rapid and sustained eyelid elevation in acquired blepharoptosis with oxymetazoline 0.1%: Randomized phase 3 trial results [^1161bJuT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Oxymetazoline HCl ophthalmic solution 0.1% (oxymetazoline 0.1%; Upneeq®, RVL Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) is a novel ophthalmic agent recently approved for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis in adults. The active agent, oxymetazoline, is a direct-acting α-adrenergic agonist commonly used in a 0.05% solution as an over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant and previously available in a 0.025% concentration as an OTC eye drop to reduce hyperemia of the eye. When applied topically to the eye, oxymetazoline 0.1% is thought to raise the upper eyelid by causing contraction of Müller's muscle, which is sympathetically innervated and expresses α-adrenergic receptors. The possibility that administration of an α-adrenergic agent might improve ptosis is also supported by the well-known effect of phenylephrine in transiently decreasing ptosis.

Oxymetazoline 0.1% has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of acquired ptosis in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical studies. In these trials, administration of oxymetazoline 0.1% once daily in both eyes resulted in significant improvements on the primary and secondary endpoints: superior visual field deficits and upper eyelid elevation on treatment days 1 (6 hours post-instillation) and 14 (2 hours post-instillation). The objective of this analysis was to further characterize the effect of oxymetazoline 0.1% on upper eyelid elevation in these studies, with a focus on the onset of effect after administration, as well as maintenance of the effect over 42 days of use.

### Comparison of hemostatic effect and safety between epinephrine and tramazoline during nasotracheal intubation: A double-blind randomized trial [^114EDrd6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

In this study, using epinephrine (E) or tramazoline (T) as a vasoconstrictor, we observed no difference in the frequency and degree of bleeding between the groups. Both T and E are excellent drugs to prevent bleeding because there was no severe bleeding in either group.

Nasal bleeding due to nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is mostly caused by damaging the venous plexus in the middle nasal mucosa, the curvature of the nasal septum, and adenoid enlargement. In addition, nasal bleeding during NTI can obstruct airway patency and cause serious complications such as airway obstruction. Considering that persistent bleeding can also affect the operative field, every effort should be made to prevent bleeding whenever possible.

Several pretreatment methods for nasal intubation using vasoconstrictors, nasal airway tubes, or cotton swabs have been reported. Generally, a cotton swab is used after the use of vasoconstrictors or nasal airway tubes to check the passage of NTI. As for the nasal airway tube, it is reported that inserting a nasal airway into the nostril just before the NTI may facilitate the intubation process by preparing the nasal passage. However, in this study, we did not use a nasal airway or cotton swab in order to examine the effects of vasoconstrictors alone.

Vasoconstrictors are used to achieve local hemostasis by constricting the intramucosal capillaries and reducing blood flow, thereby expanding the nasal volume and facilitating the passage of the intubation tube through the nasal cavity. Epinephrine is the most common vasoconstrictor for local hemostatic purposes, with recommended concentrations of 0.1–0.02%.

### Comparative evaluation of nasal blood flow and airflow in the decongestant response to oxymetazoline [^111bzKb7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Nasal blood flow (NBF) plays a crucial role in many physiological and pathological processes, but its regulation and relation to other rhinological outcomes are poorly understood. We measured nasal airway patency, nasal blood flow, and subjective and objective measures of decongestion, assessing their reproducibility and responsiveness.

In the study, 19 healthy adults attended twice. A dose-response curve was constructed using doubling doses of oxymetazoline of 25 μg, 50 μg, 100 μg, and 200 μg at 20-minute intervals. Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and nasal airway resistance (NAR) were measured at baseline and after each successive dose. Nasal blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry at baseline, 50 μg, and 200 μg, along with a decongestion visual analogue scale after the final dose.

After the final dose of oxymetazoline, the results showed a decrease in nasal blood flow by a mean (95% CI, P value) of 139.6 (108.3–170.8, P < .001) units and 99.4 (68.1–130.7, P < .001) units. Peak nasal inspiratory flow increased by 48.9 (22.0–75.8, P < .001) L.min⁻¹ and 38.9 (12.0–65.8, P = 0.003) L.min⁻¹, while nasal airway resistance decreased by 0.1 (0.02–0.15, P < .001) Pa/s/cm³ and 0.09 (0.02–0.15, P = 0.002) Pa.s.cm⁻³ at the first and second visits respectively. The area under the curve of decongestion was not significantly different between visits for each variable. The standardized response means for the decongestant response were as follows: NBF, 1.41; PNIF, 1.03; and NAR, 0.97.

In conclusion, nasal blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry is a sensitive and reproducible outcome for decongestion with oxymetazoline, similar to nasal patency and symptoms.

### Qnasl [^116W9QuT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Local nasal effects**: In clinical trials lasting from 2 to 52 weeks, nasal discomfort, epistaxis (nosebleeds), and nasal ulcerations were observed more frequently and with greater severity in patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol compared to those who received a placebo. Specifically, in a 52-week safety trial involving patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, nasal erosions were identified in 4 out of 415 patients, and a nasal ulceration was identified in 1 out of 415 patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol. No nasal erosions or ulcerations were reported in patients who received a placebo. In clinical trials conducted in pediatric patients aged 4 to 11, the local nasal effects were similar to those reported in patients 12 years and older. Patients using QNASL Nasal Aerosol over several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes in the nasal mucosa. If an adverse reaction such as erosion or ulceration is noted, discontinuation of QNASL Nasal Aerosol is recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Candida infection**: In previous clinical trials with an aqueous formulation of beclomethasone dipropionate administered intranasally, localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans were reported. However, no similar infections were observed in clinical trials with QNASL Nasal Aerosol. If such an infection develops, it may require appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of QNASL Nasal Aerosol treatment. Therefore, patients using QNASL Nasal Aerosol over extended periods should be examined periodically for any signs of infection.

### Intranasal corticosteroid therapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis of reported safety and adverse effects in children [^113JnYdb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

To address concerns related to the safety profile of both Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and non-FDA-approved intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) use in the pediatric population, a systematic review was performed. The data sources included comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases, incorporating all INCS formulations and adverse events. The study design followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with additional sources identified from study references of relevant articles.

A structured literature search was conducted. Extracted data included age, population size, study design, drug details (dosage, route, and frequency), presence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, ocular symptoms, and growth velocity adverse events.

A total of 33 studies met the inclusion criteria, examining the use of INCS as nasal sprays and drops. No persistent abnormalities in cortisol level or intraocular pressure change were observed. Growth velocity reduction was reported in 3 of 10 randomized trials. The meta-analysis of epistaxis and headache showed no significant difference in the incidence when FDA-approved INCSs were compared to placebo, with a relative risk of 1.12 (95% CI, 0.77–1.63; p = 0.56) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.60–1.18; p = 0.32), respectively. Meta-analysis was not performed for growth velocity, HPA axis suppression, and ocular change.

In conclusion, INCSs in FDA-approved routes of administration are generally safe to use in the pediatric population.

### Croup [^112fJVjR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Low credibility.

Croup leads to signs of upper airway obstruction and must be differentiated from acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or an inhaled foreign body. Croup affects about 3% of children each year, usually between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and 75% of infections are caused by the Parainfluenza virus. Symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours; however, severe infection can, although rarely, lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and arrest.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aimed at answering the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in children with mild croup; moderate to severe croup; and impending respiratory failure due to severe croup? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 43 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, corticosteroids, dexamethasone (intramuscular, oral, single-dose oral, route of administration), heliox, humidification, and intermittent positive pressure breathing.

### Laryngeal edema following remimazolam-induced anaphylaxis: a rare clinical manifestation [^11159iVk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

Importantly, we must underline that the laryngeal edema was the predominant clinical sign in this event. Visual laryngoscopy revealed epiglottic edema, suggesting that laryngeal edema contributed to the upper airway collapse. Although auscultation was unclear — such that no abnormal breathing sounds could be collected — we cannot rule out bronchospasm. After all, resuscitation with manual ventilation and oxygen was unsuccessful, leading to carbon dioxide retention. Arguably, we should have performed invasive arterial monitoring and blood gas analysis earlier to guide us in providing timely further treatment, such as tracheal intubation to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Thankfully, prolonged hypoxemia was corrected by laryngeal mask intubation followed by the administration of muscle relaxant.

The limitation of our study is that, due to a lack of reagents, we did not conduct the serum tryptase assay, which is helpful for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Despite this shortcoming, pathological evidence showed eosinophil infiltration in the intestinal mucosa, supporting the diagnosis. Eosinophils have been associated with allergic disease pathogenesis for over 100 years through the release of several cytokines and other cells involved in inflammation, amplification, and regulation of localized immune responses.

Our experience based on this case is that remimazolam-induced anaphylaxis has a rapid onset, accompanied by airway, skin, gastrointestinal, and hemodynamic changes. Thus, anesthesiologists should be particularly alert to the unknown adverse reactions of new anesthetics.

### Topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor preparations for flexible fibre-optic nasal pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy [^11411ham]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Nasal pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) is performed as an outpatient and inpatient procedure daily for various indications. It frequently causes some degree of discomfort to the patient. Various topical agents, intended to reduce this discomfort, are in common use. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of these agents.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of topical preparations used to reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adults.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, ISRCTN, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 April 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the effect of topical anaesthetic or vasoconstrictor agents used to reduce discomfort and facilitate NPL in adult patients.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for further information where necessary. The primary outcome measured was pain/discomfort. Secondary outcomes included side effects of the topical medications, ease of the procedure, and the quality of the view from the operator's perspective.

- **Main results**: We included eight RCTs (746 participants) in the review. The risk of bias in the studies was generally low.

### Effects of oxymetazoline on nasal flow and maximum aerobic exercise performance in patients with inferior turbinate hypertrophy [^112LT3rL]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of topical intranasal oxymetazoline on nasal resistance and aerobic exercise performance in patients with nasal congestion caused by inferior turbinate hypertrophy.

- **Study design**: Individual randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Eight patients with inferior turbinate hypertrophy performed a set of exercise tests to exhaustion one week apart. They were given either oxymetazoline or a placebo before each of the two test sessions according to a random pattern. Changes in nasal airflow were measured as peak nasal flow and ventilatory efficiency parameters, including ventilatory equivalents, end-expiratory pressure, oxygen consumption, cardiac efficiency, rate of perceived exertion, and maximal and submaximal mechanical power.

- **Results**: Ten minutes after use of the drug or placebo, improvements in maximum nasal airflow were seen in the oxymetazoline group (P < 0.05). There were no differences between groups in oxygen consumption, rate of perceived exertion, respiratory exchange ratio, ventilation, or ventilatory equivalents for oxygen.

- **Conclusion**: Oxymetazoline increased nasal airflow in patients with turbinate hypertrophy, but this change did not translate into gains in physical exercise parameters or perceived exertion.

Level of evidence: 1b.

### Effects of common cold and concomitant administration of nasal decongestant on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nasal glucagon in otherwise healthy participants: A randomized clinical trial [^112ostMg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Eligible participants were enrolled into two cohorts:

- **Cohort 1**: The first 18 participants enrolled were assigned to Cohort 1. These participants received nasal glucagon (NG) treatment twice: first, while suffering from untreated cold symptoms, and again 7 to 28 days later (at least 2 days after recovering from cold symptoms). Participants were required to have a Jackson cold scale score of 0 before the second NG treatment.

- **Cohort 2**: The subsequent 18 participants enrolled, also experiencing common cold with nasal congestion, were assigned to Cohort 2. These participants received NG only once. Two hours before NG administration, they were treated with nasal decongestant (oxymetazoline), sprayed twice into each nostril.

- **Administration and study procedures**: All participants fasted for 10 hours (overnight) before a single 3-mg dose of NG was administered in one nostril. Participants were closely monitored for safety. Blood samples were collected for measurement of glucagon and glucose concentrations 30 and 15 minutes before, just before (time 0), and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after NG administration.

- **Analytical methods**: Glucagon levels in plasma samples were analyzed using a radioimmunoassay (20 pg/mL quantification limit; Millipore Human Glucagon Assay, performed by Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratories, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington). Plasma glucose was measured using a Synchron® System, which determines GLUCm concentration by an oxygen rate method using a Beckman Coulter Oxygen electrode.

### Comparative efficacy of 6 topical pharmacological agents for preventive interventions of postoperative sore throat after tracheal intubation: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^11692Zxs]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Low credibility.

The full manuscripts of publications meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by two investigators (G.W. and Y.Q.), and the relevant data were extracted into an electronic database. This database included trial information such as author, publication year, sample size, types of intervention, and control. Population characteristics, including sex, age, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, were also recorded.

Furthermore, study characteristics, such as country, endotracheal tube (ETT) size, and surgery type, along with study intervention details like drug administration data (dosage, time, and mode of application), were documented. Reported outcomes included the risk of postoperative sore throat (POST) after surgery/extubation at the following time intervals: 0–1, 2–3, 4–6, and 24 hours. Additionally, information on methodology was captured. Disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus and, if necessary, by consultation with a third reviewer (L.W.).

- **Quality assessment**: The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool was used by two reviewers to independently assess the quality of the included studies. The ROB tool encompasses aspects such as randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Furthermore, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate. This assessment characterizes the quality of the evidence based on study limitations, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias for the primary outcomes.

The risk of POST after surgery/extubation was the primary outcome investigated in the study.

### Effect of intranasal vasoconstrictors on blood pressure: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116RdUKp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Treatment for epistaxis includes the application of intranasal vasoconstrictors. These medications have a precaution against use in patients with hypertension. Given that many patients who present with epistaxis are hypertensive, these warnings are commonly overridden by clinical necessity.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to determine the effects of intranasal vasoconstrictors on blood pressure.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from November 2014 through July 2016. Adult patients being discharged from the emergency department (ED) at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) were recruited. Patients were ineligible if they had a contraindication to study medications, had a history of hypertension, were currently taking antihypertensive or antidysrhythmic medications, or had nasal abnormalities, such as epistaxis. Subjects were randomized to one of four study arms: phenylephrine 0.25%, oxymetazoline 0.05%, lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000, or bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride (saline). Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 5 min for 30 min.

- **Results**: Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in the study; of these, 63 patients completed the study (oxymetazoline, n = 15; phenylephrine, n = 20; lidocaine with epinephrine, n = 11; saline, n = 17). We did not observe any significant differences in mean arterial pressure over time between phenylephrine and saline, oxymetazoline and saline, or lidocaine with epinephrine and saline. The mean greatest increases from baseline in mean arterial pressure, systolic and dia.

### Rhofade [^114sH6wf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: The pharmacological aspects of Rhofade are critical to understanding its effects.

- **Mechanism of action**: Oxymetazoline is an alpha1A adrenoceptor agonist. It acts as a vasoconstrictor.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The pharmacodynamics of Rhofade cream have not been studied.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:

	- **Absorption**: The pharmacokinetics of oxymetazoline were evaluated following the topical administration of Rhofade cream in a thin layer over the entire face in adult subjects with erythema associated with rosacea. The median weight of the cream for each dose administration was 0.3 g. Plasma oxymetazoline concentrations were measurable in most subjects. Following the first dose application, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) peak concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curves from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–24hr) were 60.5 ± 53.9 pg/mL and 895 ± 798 pg*hr/mL, respectively. After once-daily applications for 28 days, the mean ± SD Cmax and AUC0–24hr were 66.4 ± 67.1 pg/mL and 1050 ± 992 pg*hr/mL, respectively. After twice-daily applications (twice the recommended frequency) for 28 days, the mean ± SD Cmax and AUC0–24hr were 68.8 ± 61.1 pg/mL and 1530 ± 922 pg*hr/mL, respectively.

	- **Distribution**: An in vitro study demonstrated that oxymetazoline is 56.7% to 57.5% bound to human plasma proteins.

	- **Metabolism**: In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that oxymetazoline was minimally metabolized, generating mono-oxygenated and dehydrogenated products of oxymetazoline. The percentage of parent drug oxymetazoline remaining was 95.9% following a 120-minute incubation with human liver microsomes.

### Different types of intranasal steroids for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hi4hx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

This review is one of six examining the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterized by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain, and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Topical (intranasal) corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation in the sinonasal mucosa, aiming to improve patient symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different types of intranasal steroids in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months were included. These trials compared first-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide) with second-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. ciclesonide, fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, betamethasone sodium phosphate), or sprays versus drops, or low-dose versus high-dose intranasal corticosteroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related measures.

### A randomized controlled pilot study: Combined 595-nm pulsed dye laser treatment and oxymetazoline hydrochloride topical cream superior to oxymetazoline hydrochloride cream for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea [^115N3rzp]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). High credibility.

We report on the first randomized, baseline‐controlled prospective trial supporting the safety and benefit of combined topical oxymetazoline and PDL, compared with topical oxymetazoline alone. This study demonstrated greater improvement in CEA in the dual therapy arm following 6 months of topical oxymetazoline and three PDL treatments, compared with the topical oxymetazoline‐only cohort. Vessel size also improved significantly in the dual treatment arm, and the treatment outcome was associated with greater patient satisfaction. Treatment‐associated adverse events and side effects were minimal and comparable to expected sequelae, with no effects leading to patient dropout. No clinical worsening was noted during the study.

Recently, a prospective interventional trial showed that oxymetazoline can be safely combined with PDL, KTP, and IPL energy‐based therapy to reduce facial erythema in patients with moderate to severe persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea. All subjects received two monthly energy‐based treatments and once‐daily oxymetazoline. Energy‐based treatment was administered at baseline (day 1), and oxymetazoline was initiated on day 3. One‐grade or greater erythema improvement on the 5‐point validated CEA scale was observed in 20 (45.5%) patients before the application of oxymetazoline on day 3. Once‐daily application of oxymetazoline was continued through day 27, with an oxymetazoline washout prior to and after the second energy‐based treatment on day 29. Predose assessments showed improvement in 26 (60.5%) patients on day 31 and by 38 (88.4%) patients at 6 hours.

### Epistaxis risk associated with intranasal corticosteroid sprays: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jNHVP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids (INCSs) are widely utilized for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Epistaxis is a known adverse effect of INCSs; however, it is uncertain if the risk of epistaxis differs among various INCSs.

- **Data sources**: A systematic review of primary studies was conducted through Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed Central, and the Cochrane databases.

- **Review methods**: The systematic review followed the PRISMA standard, including English-language studies up to February 1, 2018. The search specifically identified randomized controlled trials of INCSs for allergic rhinitis that reported the incidence of epistaxis. Each included study underwent an itemized risk of bias assessment, and a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relative risk of epistaxis for each INCS.

- **Results**: Out of 949 identified studies, 72 met the analysis criteria. The meta-analysis revealed an overall relative risk of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.32–1.67) for epistaxis associated with all INCSs. The INCSs linked with the highest risk of epistaxis were beclomethasone hydrofluoroalkane, fluticasone furoate, mometasone furoate, and fluticasone propionate. Conversely, beclomethasone aqueous, ciclesonide hydrofluoroalkane, and ciclesonide aqueous were linked with the lowest risk. Conclusions regarding the use of budesonide, triamcinolone, and flunisolide are constrained due to the limited number of studies and high heterogeneity.

While a differential effect on epistaxis among INCS agents is not clearly demonstrated, this meta-analysis confirms an increased risk of epistaxis.

### Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate [^116BcnnZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were evaluated in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. This study involved 304 pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years who were diagnosed with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The trial design mirrored that of adult trials, with patients randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate or a placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over two weeks. While azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not show a statistically significant difference from placebo, results were numerically supportive in favor of the treatment over the placebo.

### Comparison of hemostatic effect and safety between epinephrine and tramazoline during nasotracheal intubation: A double-blind randomized trial [^1172ieia]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, nasal treatment with epinephrine or tramazoline shows no difference in nasal bleeding during nasotracheal intubation (NTI). Although no arrhythmia associated with epinephrine was observed in this study, it has been reported in the literature. Therefore, as the frequency and degree of nasal bleeding were comparable, nasal treatment with tramazoline could reduce the risk of NTI.

### Case report of a 5-year-old with epiglottitis: An atypical presentation of an uncommon disease [^115NaFdV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Epiglottitis is a rarely encountered infection in pediatrics since the advent of the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, first introduced in the United States in 1985. However, the disease remains a much-feared infection in pediatrics. The literature reiterates the importance of early recognition, avoiding agitation of the patient, and the need for securing the airway in the operating room as key features leading to a good outcome. Despite this, with only 1 case per 200,000 children reported in the United States in 2006, most practitioners have never encountered this infection. The following case involves a previously healthy and immunized child who presented to our emergency department and was ultimately diagnosed with epiglottitis.

### Limited evidence for effects of intranasal corticosteroids on symptom relief for recurrent acute rhinosinusitis [^114GwMRy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

To systematically review the evidence base on the effectiveness of intranasal corticosteroids in adult patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, data were sourced from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. A comprehensive search was performed up to March 20, 2013. Two reviewers independently screened publications based on title and abstract. The design of selected studies was assessed for directness of evidence and risk of bias. For included studies, risk differences with 95% confidence intervals were extracted or recalculated.

Out of 1850 unique records, 3 trials were included. The risk of bias was high and the directness of evidence was low for 2 trials. However, the third trial had a low risk of bias with moderate directness of evidence. This trial found a statistically significant difference in the median number of days to clinical success, defined as patients' report of symptoms being cured or much improved, favoring intranasal corticosteroids (6 days) over placebo (9 days). Additionally, the difference in the proportion of patients reporting clinical success after 21 days of treatment was 20%, favoring intranasal corticosteroids over placebo.

In conclusion, the evidence for the benefit of intranasal corticosteroids on symptom relief in adult patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis is rather limited. The findings are based on 3 trials, with the best evidence derived from 1 low-risk of bias trial providing moderate directness of evidence that intranasal corticosteroids may expedite symptom relief in these patients.

### Efficacy of oxymetazoline 0.1% in acquired blepharoptosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^11378dYw]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

- **Results - Study selection**: A total of 87 articles were yielded from the initial search of databases. After removing duplicates, only 57 articles remained. Fifty studies were eliminated after titles and abstracts were screened. Seven papers were then obtained and evaluated for inclusion through a full text review. Finally, three articles failed to meet the inclusion criteria and were therefore excluded, resulting in four Level II evidence articles being incorporated into the analysis.

- **PRISMA flowchart**: The PRISMA flowchart was used to visualize the articles screening process.

### Atrovent [^113qZohM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Patient's instructions for use: Atrovent (ipratropium bromide) nasal spray 0.03% (21 mcg/spray).

Read the complete instructions carefully before using. In order to ensure proper dosing, do not attempt to change the size of the spray opening. Atrovent nasal spray 0.03% is indicated for the symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea (runny nose) associated with allergic and nonallergic perennial rhinitis in adults and children age 6 years and older. Atrovent nasal spray 0.03% does not relieve nasal congestion, sneezing, or postnasal drip associated with allergic or nonallergic perennial rhinitis. Read the complete instructions carefully and use only as directed.

- **To use**:

	- Remove the clear plastic dust cap and the green safety clip from the nasal spray pump. The safety clip prevents the accidental discharge of the spray in your pocket or purse. The nasal spray pump must be primed before Atrovent (ipratropium bromide) nasal spray 0.03% is used for the first time. To prime the pump, hold the bottle with your thumb at the base and your index and middle fingers on the white shoulder area. Make sure the bottle points upright and away from your eyes. Press your thumb firmly and quickly against the bottle seven times. The pump is now primed and can be used. Your pump should not have to be reprimed unless you have not used the medication for more than 24 hours; repriming the pump will only require two sprays. If you have not used your nasal spray for more than seven days, repriming the pump will require seven sprays. Before using Atrovent nasal spray 0.03%, blow your nose gently.

### SPL drug information for oxymetazoline hydrochloride [^112Ub1c1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride TOP (also known as Rhofade) in pregnant patients across all trimesters, there is insufficient evidence. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Data from one literature article found a potential association between second-trimester exposure to oxymetazoline nasal spray and renal collecting system anomalies. In another case, fetal distress was reported in a 41-week pregnant patient following repeated use of oxymetazoline nasal spray at a dose five times the recommended amount. The fetal distress resolved hours later, prior to the delivery of a healthy infant.

Exposure to oxymetazoline topical cream has also been reported in two pregnant females. One pregnancy resulted in the delivery of a healthy child. The other pregnancy ended in spontaneous abortion, which was not considered related to drug exposure.

### Lidocaine and phenylephrine versus saline placebo nasal spray for the pain and distress of nasogastric tube insertion in young children and infants: a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial [^112Jkukr]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2019). High credibility.

Nasogastric tube insertion is a common but distressing procedure in young children. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of topical local anaesthetic and vasoconstrictor nasal spray with placebo for distress related to nasogastric tube insertion.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind, superiority trial in a single tertiary paediatric emergency department in Australia. Eligible participants were children aged 6 months to 5 years who were planned to have a nasogastric tube inserted as part of their emergency department treatment. Patients were assigned using computer-generated block randomisation to receive lidocaine and phenylephrine nasal spray (10 mg lidocaine and 1 mg phenylephrine for children weighing 6–12 kg; 20 mg lidocaine and 2 mg phenylephrine for children weighing more than 12 kg), or 0.9% sodium chloride placebo nasal spray, before nasogastric insertion. Guardians, observers, and proceduralists were all masked to the intervention. The primary outcome was procedure-related distress, measured using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale during the final attempt at nasogastric tube insertion. All patients were included in the primary analysis (intention-to-treat). FLACC scores were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and categorical outcomes were compared using χ² or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate.

- **Findings**: Between July 30, 2014, and August 17, 2017, 107 children in a convenience sample were studied, with results supporting the efficacy of the intervention.

### Combinations of pilocarpine and oxymetazoline for the pharmacological treatment of presbyopia: Two randomized phase 2 studies [^1122m14h]. Ophthalmology Science (2021). Low credibility.

Oxymetazoline (Oxy) is a selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist. As an ocular therapy, Oxy has been used to treat minor eye redness and ptosis. When applied topically to the eye, it can cause the contraction of the dilator muscles, subsequently dilating the pupils. Oxy also acts as a vasoconstrictor and has been added to tetracaine, an anesthetic, to slow its absorption and improve the duration of action for intranasal applications. Although the addition of Oxy to pilocarpine (Pilo) is hypothesized to dampen the initial peak effect of Pilo, it may also extend the duration of action and potentially reduce the rate and severity of Pilo's adverse events (AEs). Based on the expectation that Oxy would reduce Pilo's AEs and potentially prolong its duration of action, combinations of Pilo and Oxy were investigated for the treatment of presbyopia.

The purpose of these dose-ranging, phase 2 studies was to determine the optimal concentrations of Pilo and Oxy for the improvement of near vision in individuals with presbyopia. The safety, efficacy, and tolerability of fixed and unfixed Pilo/Oxy combinations were evaluated for this purpose in two phase 2 studies.

### Rhinocort Aqua [^116xhsXh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Systemic and intranasal corticosteroid use may result in the following adverse reactions:

- **Epistaxis, Candida albicans infection, nasal septum perforation, and impaired wound healing**: See warnings and precautions [5.1].

- **Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis**: See warnings and precautions [5.2].

- **Immunosuppression**: See warnings and precautions [5.3].

- **Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression**: See warnings and precautions [5.4].

- **Growth effect**: See warnings and precautions [5.6] and use in specific populations [8.4].

- **Glaucoma and cataracts**: See warnings and precautions [5.7].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The incidence of common adverse reactions is based upon two U.S. and five non-U.S. controlled clinical trials involving 1,526 patients with seasonal or perennial rhinitis in adults and children aged 6 years and above, treated with Rhinocort Aqua Nasal Spray at doses up to 400 mcg once daily for 3–6 weeks. This population included 745 females and 781 males with a mean age of 31 years (range of 6–85 years; 349 were aged 6 to less than 18 years). The racial distribution of patients receiving Rhinocort Aqua Nasal Spray was 93% white, 3% black, and 4% other.

Table 1 describes adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 2% or greater and more commonly among Rhinocort Aqua Nasal Spray-treated patients than in placebo-treated ones.

### Tonsillar hypertrophy and prolapse in a child - is epiglottitis a predisposing factor for sudden unexpected death [^114gjhAL]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. Tonsillar hypertrophy was present, and obstruction of the airway was suspected to be the mechanism of death. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics (Cefpodoxime) and oral paracetamol at her local clinic, and sent home. She was previously well, with no history of chronic disease or history of allergy. Clinical examination at the time was not suggestive of upper or lower airway obstruction, and she was not toxically sick. No bacterial or viral cultures or PCR testing was done, as she presented to a local clinic. During the course of the day preceding her death, she was feverish and vomited, but she remained responsive. She was found to be unresponsive and gasping for air by her mother's sister in her own bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of the antibiotics. Resuscitation efforts at a local medical facility were unsuccessful, and death was declared approximately 30 minutes after arrival at the facility.

A medico-legal autopsy was indicated under South African law as the death was classified as sudden and unexpected. The main external findings at autopsy were that the child was of normal weight and build for age. No fresh injuries or other signs of trauma were present. Both eyes were slightly sunken into the orbits. The tip of the tongue was clenched between the teeth.

Internal examination revealed massive and symmetrically enlarg…

### Influence of intranasal epinephrine and lidocaine spray on olfactory function tests in healthy human subjects [^116ogbZQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Although topical decongestants and anesthetics are widely used in preparation for nasal endoscopy, no controlled trials have evaluated the effects of these agents on olfaction.

- **Study design**: Randomized double-blinded controlled trial.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral hospital.
- **Materials and methods**: The authors recruited 72 healthy subjects and randomly assigned them to one of four groups: control, phenylephrine group, lidocaine group, and both agents. After baseline tests with the Korean version of Sniffin' Stick Test II (KVSS II), topical agents were applied to each nostril. Fifteen minutes later, repeat tests were carried out. Pre- and postspray results of the olfactory tests were compared, and the differences among groups were analyzed.
- **Results**: The mean ± SD prespray KVSS II score of the study group was 30.2 ± 3.8, and there were no statistically significant differences among the study groups (P = 0.353). Mean ± SD pre- and postspray KVSS II scores were: control group, 29.0 ± 3.5 and 30.7 ± 3.7 (P = 0.128); phenylephrine group, 30.6 ± 3.6 and 31.7 ± 3.3 (P = 0.262); lidocaine group, 31.4 ± 3.6 and 32.1 ± 3.1 (P = 0.557). In the phenylephrine and epinephrine spray group, the mean ± SD pre- and postspray scores were 29.9 ± 4.4 and 31.3 ± 3.7 (P = 0.071), respectively.
- **Conclusions**: Neither topical intranasal phenylephrine nor lidocaine use affected the results of the olfactory test, even when the agents were used in combination.

### Comparison of hemostatic effect and safety between epinephrine and tramazoline during nasotracheal intubation: a double-blind randomized trial [^113tJbti]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). High credibility.

In this study, as patients were undergoing oral surgery, a computed tomography of the facial area was taken in all cases prior to the study. Therefore, it was possible to include nasal stenosis as an exclusion criterion for the study. Hence, despite the four-year average intubation experience, the passage of the intubation tube was smooth and performed at once in all patients. Moreover, all patients were intubated using the right nasal cavity, as we have previously reported less epistaxis in the right nasal cavity compared with the left nasal cavity. Unlike the study, Sonan et al. used the left nasal cavity for intubation, but it is unclear which nasal cavity was used in the study by Jaegyok et al. We believe that the above three factors contributed to the lower percentage of bleeding observed in our study than in the previous studies.

In contrast, we also used tramazoline as a vasoconstrictor in this study. There are reports that nasal tramazoline infusion improves rhinitis and sleep apnea. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports regarding the use of tramazoline for preventing nasal bleeding during nasotracheal intubation. Our findings indicate that tramazoline is as effective as epinephrine regarding the prevention of nasal bleeding during nasotracheal intubation. The blood pressure fluctuation observed in the present study during the use of both drugs is due to the sympathetic stimulating effects of both drugs. Although the blood pressure fluctuations in both groups were clinically safe, epinephrine increased blood pressure more than tramazoline, suggesting that epinephrine stimulates alpha receptors more strongly than tramazoline within the concentrations used in this study.

### Safety of once-daily oxymetazoline HCl ophthalmic solution, 0.1% in patients with acquired blepharoptosis: Results from four randomized, double-masked clinical trials [^116ZXWFD]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Use of pharmacologic agents targeting α-adrenergic receptors, which are expressed on Müller's muscle, has been described, with some evidence of eyelid elevation with topical phenylephrine, apraclonidine, brimonidine, or naphazoline. The evidence for these agents is limited to short-term use, however, and their practical applications are limited, given their side effect profiles. For example, side effects of chronic apraclonidine use can include decreased visual acuity, allergic dermatitis, and dry mouth.

Oxymetazoline HCl ophthalmic solution, 0.1% (oxymetazoline [1 mg/mL, equivalent to 0.9 mg oxymetazoline base/mL]; Upneeq®, RVL Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Bridgewater, NJ) was recently approved for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis. The active chemical entity is the α-adrenergic agonist oxymetazoline, which has been used as a topical treatment for nasal decongestion (0.05% solution) and reduction of ocular hyperemia (0.025% solution). Application of oxymetazoline 0.1% to the eye is believed to stimulate α-adrenergic receptors on Müller's muscle, resulting in contraction and eyelid elevation.
