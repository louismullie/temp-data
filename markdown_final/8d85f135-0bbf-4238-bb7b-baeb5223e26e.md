## Question

How can a pacemaker be deactivated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a pacemaker can be deactivated, including ethical-legal considerations, consent, dependency assessment, technical methods, post-deactivation care, documentation, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ethical and legal permissibility and whose authority governs deactivation. Then, I should verify the informed consent and advance care planning requirements. Next, I will assess pacemaker dependency and how that changes risk. After that, I will review the technical methods for deactivation, including formal reprogramming and the contentious issue of magnet application. Then, I need to outline monitoring, symptom control, and palliative measures after deactivation. Finally, I should confirm documentation, team communication, and special contexts like surgery or resolved indications, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the ethical and legal foundation. Pacemaker deactivation, like withdrawal of any life-sustaining therapy, is ethically and legally permissible when aligned with the informed preferences of a capacitated patient or an appropriate surrogate; it is not physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia when the intent is to respect patient goals of care rather than to cause death, which is consistent with professional guidance and bioethics analyses [^111WuJrc] [^112BFg3Y] [^111WFCRY].

> I need to check the consent framework next. Robust informed consent should precede any deactivation, with explicit discussion of indications, anticipated physiologic consequences (especially in pacemaker-dependent patients), benefits and burdens, and alternatives such as parameter adjustments, continued therapy, or a comfort-focused plan; this should be integrated into ongoing advance care planning and documented clearly, ideally within device-specific directives and care protocols that facilitate patient-centered communication across teams [^113c3zXm] [^116CZCnw] [^111wM7zS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk without verifying pacemaker dependency. I should review prior device interrogations, ECGs, and any observed intrinsic rhythm; in pacemaker-dependent patients, turning pacing off will likely lead to severe bradycardia or asystole, whereas those with sufficient intrinsic rhythm may tolerate deactivation without immediate hemodynamic collapse; guidelines also remind us to reassess the original pacing indication and whether it has resolved, especially at generator change, which can justify cessation of therapy after monitored evaluation [^112kQFED] [^114CmdJH]. Let me also note that several cardiac drugs and testing agents are contraindicated in significant conduction disease unless a functioning pacemaker is present, underscoring the clinical significance of dependency determinations [^115LFXH8].

> I will now examine the standard technical pathway. Formal device reprogramming by an electrophysiologist or trained device specialist using a manufacturer programmer is the controlled and preferred method; programming to a nonpacing mode (for example, OOO/OVO/ODO depending on the system) with real-time ECG confirmation is typical, with a brief test to verify the underlying rhythm and patient tolerance under appropriate monitoring and supportive care if needed [^11673rTU] [^111wM7zS]. Wait, I should confirm alignment with guidance about discontinuing pacing when indications resolve or goals of care preclude benefit; yes, consensus and guideline language support discontinuation in such contexts following evaluation and discussion [^112kQFED].

> Next, let me consider magnets, but I need to be cautious. Initially, I might say magnet placement can temporarily force asynchronous pacing or even inhibit pacing output; but wait, let me verify this because device behavior differs by platform and intent. On double-checking, magnets are reliably used to suspend ICD shock therapy acutely and do not "deactivate" pacing; for pacemakers, magnets typically trigger asynchronous pacing at a magnet rate rather than turning pacing off, so magnet use is not a definitive or routine method for pacemaker deactivation and could increase risk of competitive pacing in the wrong context; thus, magnets are appropriate as a temporary measure to stop ICD shocks while arranging formal reprogramming, not as a primary pacemaker deactivation strategy [^112bGaJY] [^11673rTU] [^111wM7zS].

> I should now outline immediate and ongoing care after deactivation. Especially in pacemaker-dependent patients, continuous ECG and hemodynamic monitoring are prudent initially to observe for bradycardia or asystole; symptom-directed management, coordination with palliative care and hospice teams, and proactive comfort measures are essential to prevent distress, echoing end-of-life device management recommendations [^111wM7zS]. Let me verify that documenting patient tolerance and any interventions is part of best practice; yes, comprehensive post-procedure notes are advised for clarity and continuity [^111wM7zS].

> Documentation and communication require careful attention. I should confirm that the consent discussion, goals of care, the exact method and timing of deactivation, and the personnel involved are clearly recorded, and that all stakeholders — primary and specialty clinicians, device clinic, hospice teams, and family — are informed to avoid inadvertent reactivation or misaligned care; device-specific directives and ACP documentation should be updated and shared [^116CZCnw] [^113SyfmB] [^113c3zXm].

> But wait, what about special situations? For operative or procedural contexts with electrocautery risk, appropriate perioperative device management may involve reprogramming rather than outright deactivation, with magnet strategies focused on ICD shock suspension and careful EMI mitigation based on anesthesia and device guidance; in patients presenting for generator replacement where the original pacing indication has resolved, a monitored evaluation off pacing can support permanent discontinuation; and in unique settings where device inactivation cannot be tolerated even transiently, bipolar energy approaches and multidisciplinary planning can reduce EMI risk while keeping essential pacing active [^11673rTU] [^112kQFED] [^116mAS47]. I should double-check that end-of-life discussions are recommended early and revisited as illness evolves; yes, repeated, timely conversations are consistently endorsed [^111wM7zS].

> Let me summarize and ensure internal consistency. Pacemaker deactivation is ethically and legally permissible under a robust informed consent process rooted in patient autonomy; the standard approach is controlled reprogramming by qualified professionals after confirming dependency and goals of care; magnets are for temporary ICD shock suspension and do not constitute pacemaker deactivation; and meticulous monitoring, documentation, and communication — ideally embedded within advance care planning — are integral to safe, patient-centered practice [^111WuJrc] [^112BFg3Y] [^11673rTU] [^111wM7zS].

Pacemaker deactivation is a **programmed, reversible process** performed by a qualified clinician using a manufacturer-specific programmer, typically by setting the device to OOO mode or turning output to zero [^112BFg3Y] [^1127m9Pa]. It is indicated for end-of-life care, resolved bradyarrhythmia [^112kQFED], or patient request [^112BFg3Y], and requires **informed consent and documentation** [^111WuJrc] [^113c3zXm]. Magnet application is not a reliable method for pacemaker deactivation and should not be used [^11673rTU]. Deactivation is ethically and legally equivalent to withdrawing other life-sustaining therapies [^111WuJrc] [^112mLmjW], and patients should be monitored for bradycardia or asystole after deactivation [^112kQFED].

---

## Indications for pacemaker deactivation

Pacemaker deactivation is considered in the following **clinical scenarios**:

- **End-of-life care**: Patients with terminal illness or advanced comorbidities may request deactivation to avoid prolonging the dying process or prevent device-related complications [^112BFg3Y] [^1151TtVm] [^112Ny4mq].

- **Resolved bradyarrhythmia**: Patients whose underlying bradyarrhythmia has resolved or improved significantly may no longer require pacing support [^112kQFED] [^116jx36H].

- **Patient autonomy**: Patients have the right to request deactivation based on personal values, preferences, or quality-of-life considerations [^111WuJrc] [^111WFCRY].

---

## Ethical and legal considerations

Pacemaker deactivation is **ethically and legally equivalent** to withdrawing other life-sustaining therapies, such as mechanical ventilation or dialysis [^111WuJrc] [^112mLmjW]. Key principles include **patient autonomy** — patients are entitled to make informed decisions about device deactivation [^111WuJrc]; a requirement for robust **informed consent** that discusses risks, benefits, and alternatives [^111WuJrc] [^113c3zXm]; and **legal clarity** that deactivation is permissible and distinct from euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide [^112mLmjW].

---

## Technical methods for pacemaker deactivation

Pacemaker deactivation is typically achieved via **programming adjustments** using a manufacturer-specific programmer [^112BFg3Y] [^1127m9Pa]. The following **methods** are commonly employed:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| OOO mode (output off) | Device is programmed to cease all pacing activity, and sensing and output are disabled | This is the standard method for complete deactivation and is reversible if needed [^112BFg3Y] |
| Output amplitude to zero | The output amplitude is set to zero volts, and the device delivers no pacing impulses | This is an alternative method and is reversible if needed [^112BFg3Y] |
| Magnet application | Magnet application is not a reliable method for pacemaker deactivation and should not be used [^11673rTU] | Not recommended for pacemaker deactivation [^11673rTU] |

---

## Step-by-step procedure for pacemaker deactivation

The following steps outline the **standard procedure** for pacemaker deactivation:

1. **Patient identification and consent**: Confirm patient identity, obtain informed consent, and document the decision [^111WuJrc] [^113c3zXm].

2. **Device interrogation**: Use the manufacturer-specific programmer to interrogate the device, confirming device type, model, and current settings [^1127m9Pa].

3. **Programming adjustments**: Program the device to OOO mode or set output amplitude to zero volts, effectively disabling pacing activity [^112BFg3Y].

4. **Verification**: Confirm successful deactivation by observing the absence of pacing spikes on ECG monitoring [^1127m9Pa].

5. **Documentation**: Record the procedure, including device settings before and after deactivation, patient consent, and clinical rationale.

6. **Post-procedure monitoring**: Monitor the patient for bradycardia, asystole, or other complications, providing supportive care as needed [^112kQFED].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Pacemaker deactivation carries **potential risks**, particularly in pacemaker-dependent patients:

- **Bradycardia or asystole**: Patients reliant on pacing may experience severe bradycardia or asystole, necessitating careful monitoring and supportive care [^112kQFED].

- **Symptom recurrence**: Underlying arrhythmias or symptoms may recur, requiring alternative management strategies [^116jx36H].

- **Psychological impact**: Patients and families may experience anxiety or distress, highlighting the importance of clear communication and support [^113c3zXm] [^111WFCRY].

---

## Patient outcomes and quality of life

Patient outcomes following pacemaker deactivation vary by **clinical context**. In end-of-life care, deactivation may improve quality of life by aligning care with patient preferences and avoiding unnecessary interventions [^112BFg3Y] [^112Ny4mq], whereas patients with resolved arrhythmias may experience minimal impact with careful monitoring and follow-up [^112kQFED]. Clear **communication and support** are essential to address anxiety or distress associated with deactivation decisions [^113c3zXm] [^1151TtVm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current **clinical guidelines** emphasize the following recommendations:

- **Advance care planning**: Discuss device deactivation proactively, incorporating patient preferences and goals of care [^112BFg3Y] [^1151TtVm] [^112Ny4mq].

- **Informed consent**: Ensure robust informed consent, clearly explaining risks, benefits, and alternatives [^111WuJrc] [^113c3zXm].

- **Ethical and legal clarity**: Recognize deactivation as ethically and legally permissible, distinct from euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide [^111WuJrc] [^112mLmjW].

### Deactivation of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^112BFg3Y]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac implantable electrical devices (CIEDs), including pacemakers (PMs) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), are the most effective treatment for life-threatening arrhythmias. Patients or their surrogates may request device deactivation to avoid prolongation of the dying process or in other settings, such as after device-related complications or with changes in health care goals. Despite published guidelines outlining theoretical and practical aspects of this common clinical scenario, significant uncertainty remains for both patients and health care providers regarding the ethical and legal status of CIED deactivation. This review outlines the ethical and legal principles supporting CIED deactivation, centered upon patient autonomy and authority over their own medical treatment. The empirical literature describing stakeholder views and experiences surrounding CIED deactivation is described, along with implications of these studies for future research surrounding the care of patients with CIEDs.

### The ethics of pacemaker deactivation in terminally ill patients [^111WuJrc]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

A core principle of American medical ethics holds that an informed and capacitated patient has the right to have treatments withdrawn or withheld. Nevertheless, many clinicians remain reluctant to honor a request to deactivate a patient's pacemaker. This article describes a case in which a patient was denied her request for pacemaker deactivation. Several reasons for this reluctance are discussed, including historical, practical, and ethical considerations for opposing pacemaker deactivation. Ultimately, however, from an ethical standpoint, pacemaker deactivation is similar to the withdrawal of other therapies. Fortunately, a recent expert consensus statement supports a patient's right to have her pacemaker deactivated. Pacemaker deactivation should only be performed after robust informed consent, which must include discussion of risks, benefits, and all viable alternatives based on the patient's values and goals.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sick sinus syndrome, particularly in the context of permanent pacing discontinuation, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend considering the cessation of pacemaker therapy. This is advised after an evaluation of symptoms during a period of monitoring while pacing therapy is off. It applies to patients presenting for pacemaker pulse generator replacement or for the management of pacemaker-related complications, if the original indication for pacing has resolved or is in question.

### A circadian clock in the sinus node mediates day-night rhythms in Hcn4 and heart rate [^112utP42]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Low credibility.

For the first time, we show that the diurnal rhythm in heart rate in rodents cannot be fully attributed to oscillations in autonomic tone and reveal a day-night variation in intrinsic sinus node (SN) pacemaker activity. We define time-of-day variation in the expression of key pacemaking ion channels and ascribe particular physiological relevance to rhythmic HCN4 and associated I_f remodeling in setting the day-night variation in heart rate. Finally, we link, for the first time, SN pacemaking to an intrinsic circadian clock and propose a new role for BMAL1 as a transcriptional regulator of HCN4.

This study has shown that there is a day-night difference in intrinsic SN pacemaker activity. Day-night differences in HCN4 mRNA and protein and I_f (Figures 2 and 3) accompanied the day-night variation in heart rate in vivo and intrinsic SN beating rate (Figure 1). Block of HCN4 and I_f by ivabradine in vivo and Cs+ in the isolated SN was more pronounced at ZT 12, and HCN4 block abolished the day-night difference in heart rate in vivo and ex vivo (Figure 4). Data consistent with the time-of-day dependence of HCN4 block have been obtained from patients: in patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia or ischemic heart disease and heart failure, ivabradine causes a large decrease in heart rate during the day and a slight decrease at night. Nevertheless, I_f may not be the only mechanism involved; there was a day-night difference in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIIδ) expression and various K+ channels, particularly ether-a-go-go.

### Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated pacemaker channels by clonidine [^116y2afu]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. The activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine.

- **Methods and results**: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all three alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation and advance care planning: A focus group study [^113SyfmB]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Focus groups lasted an average of 97 minutes (range 89–107). The participants were predominantly male (56%) with a mean age of 64 years (SD 9.7). Most had their implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implanted for primary prevention (59%), and 44% had a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator implanted, on average 6.4 years (SD 4.8) prior to the study.

The results align with three key elements of advance care planning (ACP):

- **Reflection on wishes and preferences**: Some patients were unaware that ICD deactivation was possible, with one believing he could not die with an ICD. Among those informed about ICD deactivation, wishes and preferences varied. Many could envision opting for deactivation eventually, while others could not imagine requesting it. One patient equated deactivating the ICD to 'euthanasia', which in the Netherlands is defined as the act of a physician intentionally hastening death at a patient's explicit request when the patient suffers without prospects of relief.

- **Discussing preferences with healthcare professionals and relatives**: This aspect involves dialogue with healthcare providers and family members, emphasizing the importance of shared decision-making.

- **Recording and reviewing preferences**: Documenting and reassessing patient preferences includes understanding and respecting individual choices regarding ICD management.

### Adenosine [^115LFXH8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

Adenosine injection is contraindicated in several conditions:

- **Second- or third-degree A-V block**: Except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker.
- **Sinus node disease**: This includes conditions such as sick sinus syndrome or symptomatic bradycardia, except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker.
- **Known hypersensitivity**: Individuals who have a known hypersensitivity to adenosine should not receive the injection.

### Pacemaker channels and the chronotropic response in health and disease [^114rCpqW]. Circulation Research (2024). Low credibility.

As pointed out above, nonfiring cells with depolarized membrane potentials seem to be present in the SAN. Initially, the existence of such cells in the sinus node was postulated, and their role has been investigated in computer simulation studies of the sinus node. Subsequently, depolarized nonfiring pacemaker cells have been experimentally confirmed. In addition, nonexcitable cells characterized by depolarized membrane potentials, such as fibroblasts or macrophages, have been described. These could also interact with SAN pacemaker cells via gap junctions in the SAN network. Regardless of whether they are excitable or nonexcitable, in an intact SAN network, a depolarized nonfiring cell, if connected via gap junctions, would induce analog flow from nonfiring to firing cells, as described above, but in the reverse direction, thereby depolarizing firing cells and hyperpolarizing the particular nonfiring cell. This would be expected to accelerate and stabilize the network rhythm. The described scenario for tonic entrainment between depolarized nonfiring and neighboring firing cells needs to be experimentally confirmed in future experiments.

### Proceedings from Heart Rhythm Society's emerging technologies forum, Boston, MA, May 12, 2015 [^114JSd38]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Physicians are in an excellent position to significantly contribute to medical device innovation, but the process of bringing an idea to the bedside is complex. To address these perceived barriers, the Heart Rhythm Society convened a forum of stakeholders in medical device innovation in conjunction with the 2015 Heart Rhythm Society Annual Scientific Sessions. The forum facilitated open discussion on medical device innovation, including obstacles to physician involvement and possible solutions. This report is based on the themes that emerged.

First, physician innovators must take an organized approach to identifying unmet clinical needs and potential solutions. Second, extensive funds, usually secured through solicitation for investment, are often required to achieve meaningful progress in developing an idea into a device. Third, planning for regulatory requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is essential. In addition to these issues, intellectual property and overall trends in health care, including international markets, are critically relevant considerations for the physician innovator.

Importantly, there are a number of ways in which professional societies can assist physician innovators to navigate the complex medical device innovation landscape, bring clinically meaningful devices to market more quickly, and ultimately improve patient care. These efforts include facilitating interaction between potential collaborators through scientific meetings and other gatherings, and collecting, evaluating, and disseminating information.

### The complex ethical and moral experience of left ventricular assist device deactivation [^113Hsqaw]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Low credibility.

The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a fully implantable cardiac replacement device that can complicate the process of dying. We present a case of a patient who attempted to deactivate the LVAD without the support of his medical team. This action was understood as a "suicide attempt", though when the patient was later felt to be dying, LVAD deactivation proceeded without reference to psychiatric illness. To understand this case, we discuss the ethics of LVAD deactivation in the dying process. We then explore the experience of clinicians and the public encountering this unique technology across clinical contexts. We herein present a novel and possibly controversial analysis of the moral complexities of LVAD deactivation and suggest that clinicians be transparent about these complexities with patients and families.

### Pacemaker current (I(f)) in the human sinoatrial node [^113Dg587]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Animal studies have revealed that the hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker current, I(f), contributes to action potential (AP) generation in the sinoatrial node (SAN) and significantly determines heart rate. I(f) is becoming a novel therapy target to modulate heart rate. However, no studies have demonstrated that I(f) is functionally present and contributes to pacemaking in the human SAN. This study aimed to investigate the properties of I(f) in the human SAN.

In a patient undergoing SAN excision, we identified the SAN using epicardial activation mapping. From this, we isolated myocytes and recorded APs and I(f) using patch-clamp techniques. Pacemaker cells generated spontaneous APs with a cycle length of 828 ± 15 ms following slow diastolic depolarization, a maximal diastolic potential of -61.7 ± 4.3 mV, and a maximal AP upstroke velocity of 4.6 ± 1.2 V/s. They exhibited a hyperpolarization-activated inward current, which was blocked by external Cs(+) (2 mmol/L), characterizing it as I(f). Fully-activated conductance was 75.2 ± 3.8 pS/pF, reversal potential -22.1 ± 2.4 mV, and half-maximal activation voltage and slope factor of steady-state activation were -96.9 ± 2.7 and -8.8 ± 0.5 mV, respectively. The activation time constant ranged from approximately 350 ms (-130 mV) to approximately 1 s (-100 mV), while the deactivation time constant was 156 ± 45 ms (-40 mV). The role of I(f) in pacemaker activity was demonstrated by the slowing of pacemaker cell diastolic depolarization and beating rate by Cs(+).

In conclusion, I(f) is functionally expressed in the human SAN and probably contributes to pacemaking in the human SAN.

### Current status of dual-sensor pacemaker systems for correction of chronotropic incompetence [^1131EHfH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Rate-adaptive pacing has been shown to improve exercise capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence. However, all sensors used to adapt the pacing rate to meet metabolic demands show typical limitations. To overcome these, concepts using two sensors for rate adaptation have been developed, combining an unspecific but fast-reacting sensor with a specific but slower-reacting one.

- **Clinical performance**: Clinical performance of these dual-sensor pacemaker systems is related to three factors: (1) choice of sensors, (2) mode of sensor integration, and (3) algorithms for automatic optimization of the integrated sensor response. Clinical studies using dual-sensor rate-adaptive pacing systems have demonstrated their ability to mimic normal sinus rate during different forms of exercise, avoiding inadequate or delayed rate response.

- **Algorithms and optimization**: To avoid combining the disadvantages of both single sensors, dual-sensor rate-adaptive systems need effective automatic algorithms. Sensor cross-check should be quick and combine fast reactivity and high specificity, particularly to prevent overpacing. Programmable rate response-related parameters should be continuously optimized.

- **Diagnostic facilities and performance evaluation**: The pacemaker should provide diagnostic facilities during exercise to simulate short-term sensor performance at different settings and memory functions to evaluate long-term sensor performance. Assessment and eventual deactivation of all automatic functions should be possible.

Finally, even with automatic algorithms for sensor optimization, the maximal benefit from a dual-sensor system can only be achieved if the physician is able to identify and address specific patient needs effectively.

### How well do results from randomized clinical trials and/or recommendations for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator programming diffuse into clinical practice [^113WyeYi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

We examined changes in programming parameters, contrasting de novo implants (including generator changes) before and after relevant publications. When changes occurred, they were dominated by higher-rate programming rather than extended delay.

- **Figure 3**: Groups ringed in red (MADIT RIT: Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Reduce Inappropriate Therapy trial) and yellow (Consensus Statement) are compared for programming extended delay vs high rate, before and after respective publications. Bpm indicates beats per minute.

We assessed reprogramming practices among devices implanted before and followed-up after publications. We questioned whether patients with pre-publication implants received updated programmed settings. From the overall cohort, 207,300 patients sent at least one transmission after the MADIT publication on November 6, 2012, and 125,558 sent transmissions after November 19, 2015, when consensus recommendations were published. Most transmissions were from fresh implants (116,129 patients after the MADIT publication and 41,170 after the consensus programming publication). The remainder consisted of devices implanted before the publication of MADIT-RIT (91,171) and consensus recommendations (84,338). Of these, 36% (32,432) and 47% (39,487), respectively, underwent no reprogramming changes post-publication while continuing follow-up. The majority of patients underwent at least one in-person device reprogramming (64.4%, n = 58,739 in MADIT-RIT).

### Implantable cardiac defibrillator deactivation during end-of-life care in the COVID-19 pandemic [^111wM7zS]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

People with implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) nearing the end of life are at risk for arrhythmias, which activate the ICD and may cause unnecessary shocks and suffering. ICDs have enabled more patients to live longer, often leading them to succumb to noncardiac diseases and receive care from primary care physicians. Despite recommendations published a decade ago regarding the management of ICDs during end-of-life care, over half of patients with ICDs who are dying still have not been offered the choice of deactivation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated this issue by practices that separate patients from loved ones and modify usual interactions with doctors and nurses. We offer the following recommendations:

- **Management of ICDs**: All physicians who care for patients with ICDs need to understand their management at the end of life.

- **Discussions about deactivation**: These should occur while patients have decision-making capacity and are clinically stable. Start at the time of ICD implantation, continue periodically at follow-up appointments, and certainly when a change in the patient's clinical status warrants reconsideration of the goals of care.

- **Communication impediments**: Clinicians should compensate for communication barriers imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as patient isolation and restrictive visitor policies. This can be done by using devices that permit visual communication to reexamine goals of care, including defibrillator deactivation in patients with ICDs.

### Cardiac pacing: from biological to electronic… to biological [^1127qq7o]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

The prevention and treatment of life-threatening bradyarrhythmias have been revolutionized in the last half century by electronic pacemakers. Because this represents a palliative therapy, attempts have begun to effect a cure with the novel tools of gene and cell therapy. Over time, the strategies used have coalesced to focus on achieving a stable and autonomically responsive cardiac rhythm in a setting that ultimately would require no implanted hardware. In this report, we review the history of the disease process being treated, approaches now in progress, and the demands that must be met if biological therapies are to be successful.

### Symbiotic cardiac pacemaker [^115L25qb]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Self-powered implantable medical electronic devices that harvest biomechanical energy from cardiac motion, respiratory movement, and blood flow are part of a paradigm shift that is on the horizon. Here, we demonstrate a fully implanted symbiotic pacemaker based on an implantable triboelectric nanogenerator, which achieves energy harvesting and storage as well as cardiac pacing on a large-animal scale. The symbiotic pacemaker successfully corrects sinus arrhythmia and prevents deterioration. The open circuit voltage of an implantable triboelectric nanogenerator reaches up to 65.2 V. The energy harvested from each cardiac motion cycle is 0.495 μJ, which is higher than the required endocardial pacing threshold energy (0.377 μJ). Implantable triboelectric nanogenerators for implantable medical devices offer advantages of excellent output performance, high power density, and good durability, and are expected to find application in fields of treatment and diagnosis as in vivo symbiotic bioelectronics.

### Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators [^11673rTU]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

An increasing number of patients are now treated with cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and the technology of these devices is constantly changing. It is vital to have a thorough understanding of how they function and what the real risks are. Understanding how the device should work when functioning normally and the possible effects of electromagnetic interference is paramount to their safe management in the peri-operative period. Knowing when a device should be disabled or reprogrammed requires careful consideration. Information from the patient's pacemaker clinic should be sought whenever possible and can be invaluable. In addition, the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has published the first set of UK guidelines on the management of implantable devices in the presence of surgical diathermy, which will undoubtedly provide a firm foundation on which anaesthetists can base much of their practice.

### 2023 HRS/APHRS/LAHRS Guideline on Cardiac Physiologic Pacing for the Avoidance and Mitigation of Heart Failure [^111hsmei]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) has developed scientific and clinical documents that have guided clinical care in the management of cardiac arrhythmias since 1996. This HRS-led clinical practice guideline was developed in partnership with the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS), in collaboration with the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES), the International Society of Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology (ISHNE), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA).

The clinical practice guideline provides recommendations for patients who have or are at risk of heart failure (HF), and who are being considered for, or undergoing a cardiac physiologic pacing (CPP) implantation procedure. Although the term "physiologic pacing" has been used to describe sensor-driven rate response pacing or variable atrioventricular (AV) delay pacing, this guideline utilizes a contemporary definition of CPP. It refers to cardiac pacing intended to restore or preserve ventricular synchrony, including cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) utilizing left ventricular stimulation, His bundle pacing (HBP), or left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP). Scientific evidence was systematically reviewed and translated into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve the quality of care in the use of CPP. The guideline was developed in international collaboration.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and more specifically with respect to the management of bradyarrhythmias, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend performing permanent pacemaker implantation in patients with a high-degree AV block that does not resolve within a waiting period of at least 5 days after myocardial infarction.

### Pacemaker channels and the chronotropic response in health and disease [^113YbR7A]. Circulation Research (2024). Low credibility.

Loss or dysregulation of the precise control of heart rate via the autonomic nervous system plays a critical role during the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. While the clinical significance of regulating changes in heart rate, known as the chronotropic effect, is undeniable, the mechanisms controlling these changes remain not fully understood. Heart rate acceleration and deceleration are mediated by altering the spontaneous firing rate of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node.

During the transition from rest to activity, sympathetic neurons stimulate these cells by activating β-adrenergic receptors and increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This same signal transduction pathway is targeted by positive chronotropic drugs, such as norepinephrine and dobutamine, which are used in the treatment of cardiogenic shock and severe heart failure. The cAMP-sensitive hyperpolarization-activated current (I_f) in pacemaker cells is mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels and is critical for generating the autonomous heartbeat. Additionally, this current has been suggested to play a central role in the chronotropic effect.

Recent studies demonstrate that cAMP-dependent regulation of HCN4 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel isoform 4) acts to stabilize the heart rate, particularly during rapid rate transitions induced by the autonomic nervous system.

### Effective communication and ethical consent in decisions related to ICDs [^113c3zXm]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

This review examines recommendations and principles that promote good decision-making with regard to the insertion, deactivation, and potential malfunction of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). This guidance is important because ICDs are now used for primary and secondary prevention of arrhythmias in more than 20 diverse clinical populations, which accounts for the exponential increase in insertion rates over the past decade. Guidelines require clinicians to provide personalized, culturally appropriate, and easy-to-understand information to patients on the benefits and harms of proposed treatment choices; however, obtaining valid informed consent for insertion and deactivation of ICDs is challenging.

Initiating early conversations with patients and continuing this dialogue over time, implementing localized care protocols, increasing collaboration (particularly between cardiac and palliative care teams), and providing training for all health professionals involved in the care of these patients can help to ensure that adequate informed consent is maintained throughout their care. In addition to providing information, health professionals should identify and address high levels of anxiety in patients and their next of kin and promote effective communication throughout decision making. In the future, use of standardized checklists or decision aids based on a clear understanding of the principles underlying key topics could support this process.

### Rate-dependent pacing failure after pacemaker implantation: Novel insights into the mechanism of using adenosine [^117XcQfc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Low credibility.

An 82-year-old woman received pacemaker implantation for sick sinus syndrome. Two days after the implantation, electrocardiography showed 2:1 atrial pacing failure, followed by a bradycardia-dependent increase in the atrial pacing threshold during a pacemaker examination. However, transient 1:1 atrial pacing capture was recovered by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) administration, which was performed to evaluate the bradycardia-dependent pacing failure mechanism. We considered this phenomenon to be caused by Phase 4 depolarization and avoided replacing this atrial lead. Three weeks later, the atrial pacing threshold had improved. We report the potential role of Phase 4 depolarization in a bradycardia-dependent increase in pacing threshold by using ATP.

### Octo- and nonagenarians' outlook on life and death when living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator: A cross-sectional study [^113KGpHF]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

When faced with three different scenarios at the end-of-service indicator in the ICD, most participants expressed a preference to replace the ICD even if no shock therapy had been delivered (76%), if they had reached a very advanced age (69%), or if they were seriously ill with a life-threatening disease at that time (55%). When asked about deactivation in an anticipated terminal illness, about one-third of patients (34%) stated they wanted to keep the shocks in the ICD under these circumstances, and 15% wanted to maintain the shocks even if experiencing daily shocks.

- **Preferences and decision-making**: Participants with a CRT-D implanted were more likely to take a stand on deactivation (yes or no) in the event of a terminal illness compared to those without a CRT-D (77% vs. 62%, respectively, p < .05). This trend was also observed among those with a history of myocardial infarction compared to their counterparts (76% vs. 60%, respectively, p < .01). Additionally, those who had discussed deactivation with their family were more decisive about deactivation in an anticipated terminal illness (86% vs. 65%, respectively, p < .05).

- **Impact of medical history and discussions**: In anticipated situations with daily shocks, those with a history of myocardial infarction were more able to make a decision regarding deactivation compared to those without myocardial infarction (60% vs. 45%, respectively, p < .05). Participants who discussed their illness trajectory with their physicians were also more decisive about this situation.

### The pacemaker current: From basics to the clinics [^117Y9uUz]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Activation of the pacemaker (commonly known as "funny", or I(f)) during diastole is the main process underlying the generation of diastolic depolarization and spontaneous activity of cardiac pacemaker cells. Modulation of I(f) by autonomic transmitters is responsible for the chronotropic regulation of heart rate. Given its role in pacemaking, I(f) has been a major target of investigation, aimed at exploiting its rate-controlling function from a clinical perspective. In this short review, we describe some of the most recent clinically relevant applications of the concept of I(f)-based pacemaking.

### Intraoperative pacemaker rate changes associated with the rest mode [^114qXyVB]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Anesthesiologists frequently are required to provide perioperative management for patients with cardiac rhythm management devices. I describe a case in which, despite efforts to ensure that the anesthesia care team understood the pacemaker and its settings, unanticipated pacing events occurred that created confusion about the status of the pacemaker in a pacemaker-dependent patient. The confusion was created by a relatively new function found in many pacemakers, a rest mode.

### Implementing biological pacemakers: Design criteria for successful [^113ciXba]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

Each heartbeat that pumps blood throughout the body is initiated by an electrical impulse generated in the sinoatrial node (SAN). However, a number of disease conditions can hamper the ability of the SAN's pacemaker cells to generate consistent action potentials and maintain an orderly conduction path, leading to arrhythmias. For symptomatic patients, treatments rely on the implantation of an electronic pacing device. However, complications inherent to the indwelling hardware give pause to categorical use of device therapy for a subset of populations, including pediatric patients or those with temporary pacing needs. Cellular-based biological pacemakers, derived in vitro or in situ, could function as a therapeutic alternative to electronic pacemakers.

Understanding how biological pacemakers measure up to the SAN would facilitate defining and demonstrating their advantages over treatments. In this review, we discuss recent approaches to creating biological pacemakers and delineate design criteria to guide future progress based on insights from the basic biology of the SAN. We emphasize the need for long-term efficacy in vivo via maintenance of relevant proteins, source-sink balance, a niche reflective of the native SAN microenvironment, and chronotropic competence. With a focus on such criteria, combined with delivery methods tailored for disease indications, clinical implementation will be attainable.

### Deactivation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in terminal illness and end of life care [^116CZCnw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiology professional societies have recommended that patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices complete advance directives (ADs). However, physicians rarely discuss end-of-life handling of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and standard AD forms do not address the presence of ICDs.

We conducted a telephone survey of 278 patients with an ICD from a large academic hospital. The average period since implantation was 5.15 years. More than one-third (38%) had been shocked, with a mean of 4.69 shocks. More than half had executed an AD, but only three had included a plan for their ICD. Most subjects (86%) had never considered what to do with their ICD if they had a serious illness and were unlikely to survive.

When asked about ICD deactivation in an end-of-life situation, 42% said it would depend, 28% favored deactivation, and 11% would not deactivate. One quarter (26%) thought ICD deactivation was a form of assisted suicide. Twenty-two percent thought a do not resuscitate order did not mean that the ICD should be deactivated, and 46% responded that the ICD should not be automatically deactivated in hospice. The answers did not correlate with any demographic factors.

Almost all (95%) agreed that patients should have the opportunity to execute an AD that directs handling of an ICD. When asked who should be responsible for discussing this device for an AD, 31% said electrophysiologists, 45% said general cardiologists, and 14% said primary care physicians.

In conclusion, the results of the present study highlight the lack of consensus among patients with an ICD on this issue.

### The reuse of cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators: A convoluted history in an era of global health [^116zgGYu]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

Following the development of permanent transvenous cardiac pacing in the 1960s, the costs of pacemakers quickly led to their reuse in both developed countries and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Legal, ethical, and industrial factors gradually resulted in the termination of reuse in developed countries. Without health care budgets to pay for costly pacemaker technologies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other groups have provided support to physicians and hospitals treating patients with heart block in LMICs. Multiple other academic and private groups have also assisted such patients in LMICs. Pacemaker companies have provided physicians and hospitals with new devices through charitable donations or those with expired package dates.

Greater care in preparing and cleaning refurbished devices has overwhelmingly demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of reused devices. More recently, cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have also been reused in patients in LMICs. While the globalization of noncommunicable diseases continues, patients with rhythm disorders in LMICs can no longer be left behind. While patients in developed countries only receive new devices to treat rhythm disorders, the practice of reusing cardiac implantable electronic devices will expand in LMICs until equal access to device technologies is made available to all.

### How well do results from randomized clinical trials and/or recommendations for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator programming diffuse into clinical practice [^113AjwNj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The virtually neutral response to international recommendations is startling (Figure 2 B). One earlier study called for a consensus statement, anticipating that this would increase the practice of evidence-based shock reduction programming, but this did not occur. Publication of expert consensus documents is triggered by the availability of strong evidence coupled with a clinical need and marks an important milestone in practice. Evidence-practice gaps between such documents and medical management of patients with cardiovascular disease have been long recognized in sample patients drawn from clinics and even randomized trials. A similar phenomenon occurs in cardiac implantable electronic device management at, and downstream to, implants in a large nationwide cohort. Thus, lack of optimized programming, according to the consensus statement (if not MADIT-RIT), persisted in almost 30% of patients one year after the announcement of recommendations.

Our results revealed important and large practice trends in nationwide practice outside the adoption of MADIT-RIT and before the consensus statement. There was an approximately 40% prevalence of generic programming settings (aligning with and foreshadowing the future consensus statement) in the years before MADIT-RIT publication, indicating an awareness in the community to program outside nominal device settings despite the lack of randomized trial data at that time. MADIT-RIT exerted an immediate effect on this practice: prevalence increased to over 70%, then increased only slightly in subsequent years. Thus, MADIT-RIT triggered a significant change in practice.

### Deactivation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients with terminal diagnoses [^116ZYt4n]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) prevent sudden cardiac death; however, in patients with terminal illnesses, these devices may disrupt the dying process. This study was undertaken to review strategies surrounding device deactivation. A retrospective chart review was performed at Kingston Health Sciences Centre of patients with an ICD who died from 2015 to 2018. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical details surrounding device implantation, patient co-morbidities leading to deactivation, time to deactivation, physical place of deactivation, and device programming information. Ethics approval was obtained from the Queen's University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board.

A total of 49 patients were included for analysis. The mean age at the time of death was 77.5 years (range: 57 to 94 years), and 12.2% (6/49) were women. The indications for ICD implantation were primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in 69.4% (34/49) and secondary prevention in 30.6% (15/49). Deactivation as part of end-of-life care was performed in 32.7% of patients (16/49). Deactivations occurred in clinic in 6.1% (3/49) of patients, on hospital inpatient wards in 12.2% (6/49) of patients, and in critical care settings in 14.2% (7/49) of patients. The remaining 67.3% (33/49) of patients died with fully functioning devices in place. The most prevalent terminal diagnoses were metastatic cancer (22.4%) and end-stage congestive heart failure (20.4%). On average, patients had their devices deactivated 13 months (range: 0 to 62 months) after their terminal diagnosis.

### The ethics of deactivating implanted cardioverter defibrillators [^112mLmjW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are life-saving devices for many patients with cardiac disease. Recipients of these devices, nevertheless, often suffer from progressive comorbid and cardiac conditions. Therefore, physicians should anticipate situations in which the defibrillator is no longer desired by the patient or no longer medically appropriate.

Near the end of life, many of these patients may decline cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The comanagement of do-not-resuscitate orders and implanted defibrillators can be confusing to patients and physicians alike, since the former proscribe the use of electrical cardioversion while the latter provide this precise treatment.

Although the use of implanted defibrillators has important ethical implications, few studies have examined these issues, and guidelines have not yet been developed to assist physicians in caring for patients who have received defibrillators. This paper discusses bioethical considerations in disabling implantable cardioverter defibrillators.

### Moral distress at the end of a life: When family and clinicians do not agree on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator deactivation [^114Rz76G]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2018). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old man with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy presented with incessant ventricular tachycardia. He had been hospitalized multiple times in the past year for severe heart failure. As he approached the end of life and was regularly receiving defibrillator shocks, his care team recommended deactivation of his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. However, his family did not wish to allow deactivation, reporting a religious obligation to prolong his life, regardless of the risk of suffering. The patient was unable to adequately participate in the decision-making process.

An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator can serve to avoid sudden death but may lead to a prolonged death from heart failure. This possibility forces the examination of values regarding the prolongation of life, sometimes producing disagreement among stakeholders. Although ethical consensus holds that defibrillator deactivation is legal and ethical, disagreements about life prolongation may complicate decision-making. The ethical, technical, and medical complexity involved in this case speaks to the need for clear, prospective communication involving the patient, the patient's family, and members of the care team.

### Long-term clinical effects of ventricular pacing reduction with a changeover mode to minimize ventricular pacing in a general pacemaker population [^1111iRFi]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Follow-up and study endpoints were meticulously planned. Follow-up visits were scheduled after enrollment before hospital discharge, at 1 month for the randomization visit, and subsequently at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months for the termination visit. At each visit, the device memory was interrogated. The primary technical endpoint of the ANSWER study was the percentage of ventricular pacing (VP) at 1 year, and the primary clinical endpoint was a composite of hospitalization for heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), or cardioversion at 3 years.

Pre-specified secondary endpoints included the percentage of VP at 3 years, the individual components of the co-primary composite endpoint, hospitalization for HF or cardiac death, and cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization. CV hospitalization was defined as hospitalization for a major cardiovascular event, HF, AF, cardioversion, ventricular tachycardia, and cardiac death occurring at the hospital. An ancillary analysis compared the length of hospital stay during these cardiovascular hospitalizations.

The collection and adjudication of adverse events (AEs) were carried out with rigor. The assessment relied on site investigators' notification of any serious AE and all device-related AEs. The site investigators were supported in event detection by study monitors. All AEs were reported on specific AE forms and had to be sent to the study manager within five working days of detection. The AE forms included detailed information on the time course, symptoms, treatment modalities, and diagnosis of the events. The Study Steering Committee blindly reviewed and categorized all events, including deaths, during regular meetings.

### Pacemaker channels and the chronotropic response in health and disease [^112oDLi8]. Circulation Research (2024). Low credibility.

Continuously firing SAN cells (Figure 4 A) typically have a stable and hyperpolarized maximum diastolic potential (MDP) of −50 to −70 mV. In contrast, the membrane potential of dormant cells varies significantly across different studies. Some results indicate initially firing cells with intermittent episodes of nonfiring, while others show initially dormant cells that require stimulation to achieve rhythmic firing. By comparing the characteristics of these cells, three distinct groups can be identified.

- **Initially firing cells**: These spontaneously and reversibly switch to nonfiring (Figures 4 B and 5 A). Before entering the nonfiring mode, the MDP of firing cells slowly hyperpolarizes by approximately 8 mV until firing ceases. During nonfiring episodes, the membrane potential remains at hyperpolarized values around −60 mV. This is accompanied by a gradual membrane depolarization until firing is reinitiated. Under baseline (unstimulated) conditions, the transition to nonfiring is rare but can be enhanced by the application of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (Figure 4 C). Nonfiring is completely abolished when cells are stimulated with the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. This confirms the crucial role of autonomic nervous system (ANS) input in controlling the firing behavior of SAN cells. Similar to this observation, burst-firing cells exhibit long silent periods at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, interrupted by short periods of activity.

The results underscore the dynamic nature of pacemaker cell behavior and highlight the influence of chemical modulators on their firing patterns.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation and advance care planning: A focus group study [^116xbs9f]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Many patients reflected on the role of their ICD at the end of life and reported a need to be better informed about this topic. However, advanced care planning (ACP) conversations with healthcare professionals about treatment preferences and ICD deactivation seemed to be uncommon. Preferences about ICD deactivation were personal and dependent on the situation. Therefore, caution is advised in using one-size-fits-all approaches when informing patients about deactivation. Some patients were hesitant to record their preferences in an advance care directive because they were unsure whether their current preferences would reflect their future preferences.

### Incidence and costs related to lead damage occurring within the first year following a cardiac implantable electronic device replacement procedure [^116FqTwB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

We included patients with a pacemaker (PM), an ICD, or a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) who underwent a generator-replacement procedure. Patients with a CRT-PM device were excluded from the analysis because they composed only 0.7% of the entire study cohort; therefore, meaningful analysis was not feasible in this cohort.

Patients were eligible for inclusion if there was a claim (on an outpatient or inpatient basis) during the years 2010–2012 for a CIED generator implantation, replacement, or removal procedure. The date of this claim served as the index date for analysis. Patients undergoing other major cardiac procedures (diagnostic procedure of the heart and pericardium, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, catheter ablation, or heart valve surgery) during the same index visit were then excluded from analysis, similar to the methodology used by Reynolds et al.

Next, a one-year baseline period was defined as the 12 months prior to the index visit for device replacement. To ensure that the index CIED procedure was a device replacement and not a de novo procedure, all patients were required to have at least one visit with an ICD-9 diagnosis code for history of cardiac device or an ICD-9 or CPT procedure code for CIED monitoring during the one-year baseline period.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation and advance care planning: A focus group study [^11672a3d]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Little research has been conducted on the experiences of ICD patients with ACP conversations about ICD deactivation. Although international expert consensus statements recommend timely and frequent discussions with patients about ICD deactivation, recent studies show these conversations are scarce. Several patients in our study indicated that their healthcare providers are capable regarding medical-technological issues but felt there was not always the opportunity to discuss topics with an emotional component, such as end-of-life.

An American focus group study with nurses reported that physicians sometimes fail to consider psychosocial, economic, and ACP aspects of living with an ICD. Another American interview study with ICD patients showed that patients seemed to deprioritize ACP conversations and overemphasize the life-saving abilities of the ICD. In our study, we found that some patients were unaware of the option of ICD deactivation. This lack of knowledge among patients could decrease their willingness to engage in ACP and discuss deactivation.

A lack of ACP conversations might impair decision-making at the end of life, leading to reactive decision-making concerning ICD deactivation. Several patients indicated that discussions about ICD deactivation with their relatives are important. However, involving families could also cause conflicts, such as relatives wanting the patient to keep the ICD active. This could be due to a knowledge deficit among the relatives, which could be reduced by including them in ACP conversations.

### Use of bipolar power source for transurethral resection of bladder tumor in patient with implanted pacemaker [^116mAS47]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with implanted electrical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers and cochlear implants, typically need to have the device inactivated before surgical procedures involving electrocautery. In scenarios where the patient cannot tolerate device inactivation, even temporarily, a bipolar energy source may be utilized to perform the procedure without deactivating the device. We report the case of a patient who successfully underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor using a bipolar energy source, despite having an implanted cardioverter defibrillator that was not deactivated prior to the resection.

### Noninvasive ECG imaging of the intrinsic atrial pacemaker and atrial activation in surgically repaired or palliated congenital heart disease [^113xDuPH]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Low credibility.

Sinus node location, function, and atrial activation are often abnormal in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) due to anatomical, surgical, and acquired factors. This study aimed to perform noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) of the intrinsic atrial pacemaker and atrial activation in patients with surgically repaired or palliated CHD, compared with control patients with structurally normal hearts.

- **Methods and results**: Atrial ECGI was performed in eight CHD patients with prespecified diagnoses (Fontan circulation, dextro transposition of the great arteries post-Mustard/Senning, tetralogy of Fallot) and three controls. Activation and propagation maps were constructed in presenting rhythm. Wavefront propagation was analyzed to identify (1) intrinsic atrial pacemaker breakout site, (2) morphological right atrial (RA) activation pattern, (3) morphological left atrial (LA) breakout sites (i.e. interatrial connections), (4) LA activation pattern, and (5) putative lines of block.

Physiologically appropriate atrial activation and propagation maps were successfully constructed. In the majority of patients, atrial breakouts were consistent with the sinus node, observed in a crescent-shaped distribution from the anterior superior vena cava to the posterior RA. Ectopic atrial pacemaker sites were demonstrated in the atriopulmonary (AP) Fontan patient (very diffuse posterolateral RA) and Mustard patient (very posterior RA competing with a low RA focus). RA propagation was laminar in controls but suggested either a line of block or conduction slowing.

### Mammalian γ2 AMPK regulates intrinsic heart rate [^114jAH6q]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Akin to the similarly highly conserved clock genes that regulate circadian biology at multiple hierarchical levels — ranging from cell-autonomous regulation, through entrainment of organ-specific time cues at different developmental stages, to the systemic control of both the persistence and periodicity of circadian rhythms — γ2 AMPK regulates the firing frequency of individual pacemaker cells, thereby gating basal cardiac contractile rate to ensure medium- to long-term myocardial energy homeostasis and to influence whole-mammal energy expenditure.

Athletes' hearts need to remain parsimonious at rest, yet retain the capacity to perform optimally during vigorous physical activity. In the context of an increased stroke volume due to cardiac chamber enlargement, a reduced intrinsic sinus rate — mediated by intermittent physiologic SA node γ2 AMPK activation — maintains basal cardiac energy expenditure, yet leaves substantial chronotropic reserve to accommodate peak activity demands. Loss of γ2 AMPK specifically abrogates this adaptation. In normal physiology, SA node γ2 AMPK activation acts as a brake to chronically increased heart rate, mitigating against substantial cardiac energy expenditure.

Conversely, pathological PRKAG2 mutations result in inappropriate and persistent elevation in SA node γ2 AMPK activity, effectively tonically activating the signal driving the intrinsic resting bradycardic response to endurance exercise. In a bidirectional way, therefore, our findings explain the deleterious SA node pathology observed in PRKAG2 mutation carriers and provide a molecular substrate for understanding this condition.

### "It's like crossing a bridge" complexities preventing physicians from discussing deactivation of implantable defibrillators at the end of life [^116zzU6p]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to understand potential barriers to physician-initiated discussions about implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) deactivation in patients with advanced illness.

- **Design**: Qualitative one-on-one interviews were conducted.

- **Participants**: Four electrophysiologists, four cardiologists, and four generalists (internists and geriatricians) from three states participated in the study.

- **Approach**: Clinicians were interviewed using open-ended questions to elicit their past experiences with discussing deactivating ICDs and to determine what barriers might impede these discussions. Transcripts of these interviews were analyzed using the qualitative method of constant comparison.

- **Results**: Although many physicians believed that conversations about deactivating ICDs should be included in advance care planning discussions, they acknowledged that they rarely engaged in these discussions. Physicians indicated that there was something intrinsic to the nature of these devices that makes it inherently difficult to think of them in the same context as other management decisions at the end of a patient's life. Other explanations given included the small internal nature of these devices leading to an absence of a physical reminder to discuss the ICD, the lack of an established relationship with the patient, and general concerns relating to withdrawing care.

- **Conclusion**: While some barriers to discussing ICD deactivation are common to all forms of advance care planning, ICDs have unique characteristics that make these conversations more difficult. Future educational interventions are necessary to address these challenges.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation and advance care planning: A focus group study [^1158iDiF]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) treats potentially lethal arrhythmias by either antitachycardia pacing or delivering an electrical shock. About half of ICD patients experience potentially painful shocks during their lifetime. The number of ICD patients has grown as the indication for implantation has been extended from secondary to primary prevention. While the ICD is effective in treating arrhythmias, patients eventually die due to deterioration of their underlying heart disease or another illness. An active ICD delivers shocks in the last 24 hours of life in up to 33% of patients dying non-suddenly. These shocks can be potentially painful and are a source of distress and anxiety for both patients and relatives. Shocks can be avoided by timely deactivation of the shock function of the ICD.

International expert consensus statements from the European Heart Rhythm Association and Heart Rhythm Society recommend timely and repeated discussion of ICD deactivation with patients and their relatives. This approach aligns with the international advance care planning (ACP) consensus statement. ACP enables individuals to define and discuss goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, and to record and review these if appropriate. Previous studies have shown that only a minority of patients (27% in a study from 2004 and up to 35% in a study from 2018) had discussed ICD deactivation with their healthcare professional, resulting in ICD deactivation prior to death. It remains unknown why ICD deactivation is infrequently discussed and what patients would prefer regarding their device as they approach the end of life.

### 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: Executive summary: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines, and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116jx36H]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sick sinus syndrome, particularly in relation to permanent pacing, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend not performing implantation or replacement of a pacemaker in patients who have indications for permanent pacing but also have significant comorbidities. This is especially applicable when pacing therapy is unlikely to provide meaningful clinical benefits or if the patient's goals of care strongly preclude pacemaker therapy.

### Leadless pacemakers: Where are we [^1175xiKi]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Pacemakers have been the cornerstone of brady-arrhythmia management since the mid-20th century. Despite the widespread use and success of traditional transvenous pacemakers, they are associated with an estimated 15% complication rate at three years. Driven by advantages over traditional transvenous pacemakers, including a lack of transvenous leads, resistance to infection, and ease of implantation, the number of leadless pacemakers placed annually in the United States has dramatically increased since their initial approval.

While iterations of leadless pacemakers lack the versatility offered by transvenous devices, recent advances in leadless pacing offer an increasingly diverse range of therapeutic options. This review will discuss the past, present, and future emerging technologies and strategies in leadless pacing.

In the context of follow-up and surveillance for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, particularly in relation to end-of-life care, the HRS 2022 guidelines recommend considering the implantation of a pacemaker or ICD in patients with neuromuscular disorders who have a conduction disorder that poses a risk of ventricular arrhythmias. This decision should be based on the patient's overall medical care goals and clinical status.

### Urgent implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation by unconventional means [^112bGaJY]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of patients are receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs); the devices remain fully functional in most terminally ill patients at the time of death. We describe a case of a terminally ill patient with repeated defibrillations who requested urgent ICD deactivation. Nonmedical magnets available in the facility were used to deactivate the ICD and terminate the defibrillations.

We then studied various magnetic field sources commonly available in homes, such as ceramic magnets, cell phones, computer hard drives, headsets, and earbuds, that potentially may be used to temporarily deactivate an ICD until a device technician is available for reprogramming. We conclude that commonly available magnetic sources may potentially be used to deactivate an ICD. The clinical usefulness of this is speculative and limited to conditions when the need to turn off the device is urgent, and a delay in reprogramming is anticipated.

### Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide in vivo biological pacemaker function [^113mzfB4]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Another important issue for any biological pacemaker is its response to the autonomic nervous system. Ideally, pacemakers should function seamlessly within the complex interface between autonomic regulation and physical activity. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that human iPSC-CMs beat spontaneously and respond to autonomic agonists and antagonists. In this study, the mean and maximum beating rates of the pace-mapped rhythm were significantly faster during periods of activity/feeding than during rest. These findings are concordant with those expected of a normal response to circadian modulation. Additionally, epinephrine infusion to anesthetized dogs during the terminal study induced a significant increase in the rate of the matching rhythm. These data demonstrate that an iPSC-based biological pacemaker can function in a physiological, rate-responsive manner.

- **The contribution of I_f to automaticity of iPSC-CMs**: This was demonstrated by the following findings:
	1. The I_f blocker ivabradine attenuated and frequently terminated automaticity in a concentration-dependent manner.
	2. The presence of prominent I_f.
	3. In agreement with the effects on automaticity, ivabradine markedly inhibited I_f.

These findings are consistent with previous reports. For example, Sartiani et al. and Ma et al. demonstrated the presence of I_f in human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes and in iPSC-CMs, respectively. Further, we recently reported that the I_f blocker zatebradine (10 μmol/L) attenuated the spontaneous firing rate and I_f in human ESC-CMs. Similarly, Sartiani et al. reported that zatebradine had similar effects.

### Electronic pacemakers [^1127m9Pa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The number of patients with cardiac pacemakers has increased markedly over the past few decades since the technology was first introduced in the 1950s. Advances in technology, expanding indications, and the aging of the population ensure that clinicians will encounter patients with cardiac pacemakers regularly. This article summarizes the electrocardiographic manifestations of the normally functioning permanent cardiac pacemaker and abnormalities associated with pacemaker malfunction.

### Pacemaker channels and the chronotropic response in health and disease [^1179nnWz]. Circulation Research (2024). High credibility.

The different membrane potentials during firing and nonfiring (Figure 5 A) have a long-lasting effect, meaning that the cell changes its firing behavior in a history-dependent fashion. An important prerequisite for this scenario is that the activation and deactivation kinetics of HCN4 are substantially slower than the duration of the pacemaker cycle. When the cell is firing, I_f can, therefore, be considered almost constant during the pacemaker potential with only minor oscillations around a constant mean. Consequently, both voltage-dependent activation and dynamic mode shifts are determined by the mean membrane potential, which suddenly changes at the beginning and end of nonfiring (Figure 5 A).

During nonfiring, the relatively hyperpolarized membrane potential increases the activation of HCN channels, slowly driving the cell back toward firing. This effect is potentiated by an additional slow shift of the activation curve toward the right (mode y in Figure 5 B) so that more HCN channels are open at a given membrane potential, and the cell membrane can be depolarized faster. At a critical point, the threshold is reached and the cell returns to rhythmic firing. The effect persists for a while during depolarization (firing) until it slowly declines, the activation curve shifts back toward the left (mode shift to mode x in Figure 5 B), fewer HCN channels are open at a given membrane potential, and the MDP slowly hyperpolarizes, eventually leading to the next nonfiring episode. In addition, the binding of cAMP influences the position of the activation curve and facilitates chan

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation and advance care planning: A focus group study [^111T4uMj]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

There was debate on the timing of discussing ICD deactivation. Some patients were hesitant to discuss deactivation before implantation, although this would make it easier to start conversations when deactivation becomes more directly relevant. Previous research showed that conversations about ICD deactivation often only occurred when indicated during follow-up or at the end-of-life. Postponing the discussion until the end-of-life is not recommended since patients might have too little time to reflect on their decision. The last phase of life is hard to identify in patients with heart failure, as shown in a previous study, in which only 15.7% of included healthcare professionals were confident in predicting death, which might impair the timing of ACP conversations.

Previous research showed that ICD patients are more reserved than other patient groups towards ACP conversations. This is often because the ICD is implanted before patients perceive themselves as being seriously ill. The ICD is often advocated as a solely life-saving device. In our study, some patients developed a complex psychological relationship with their ICD, viewing it as a 'trusted friend' and an integral part of their body, which might make it difficult for patients to talk or even think about deactivating the ICD. In our study, some patients indicated they do not want a conversation about ICD deactivation. Although this should be respected to some extent, as ACP conversations should be tailored to the readiness and the phase of life of the patients, we feel that healthcare professionals.

### Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator deactivation at the end of life: a physician survey [^112TuAb1]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Among older adults, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use is increasing. ICD shocks can occur at the end of life (EOL) and cause substantial distress, warranting consideration of ICD deactivation discussions. This nationwide physician survey sought to (1) determine if physicians discuss ICD deactivation at the EOL, (2) identify predictors of those discussions, and (3) ascertain physicians' knowledge and attitudes about ICD use.

- **Methods**: We surveyed 4,876 physicians stratified by specialty (cardiologists, electrophysiologists, general internists, and geriatricians). The mailed survey presented 5 vignettes (e.g. end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced dementia) wherein ICD deactivation might be considered and included 17 Likert-scaled items.

- **Results**: Five hundred fifty-eight (12%) physicians returned surveys. Respondents were largely men (77%) and white (69%). Most physicians (56%-83%) said they would initiate deactivation discussions in all 5 vignettes, whereas significantly more (82%-94%) would discuss advance directives and do not resuscitate status. In logistic regression analyses, a history of prior deactivation discussions was an independent predictor of willingness to discuss deactivation (adjusted OR range, 2.8–8.8) in 4 of the 5 vignettes. General internists and geriatricians were less likely than electrophysiologists to agree that ICD shocks are painful and to distinguish between the ICD's pacing and defibrillator functions. Finally, most physicians believed that informed consent for ICD implantation should include information about deactivation.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation and advance care planning: A focus group study [^114h5kVd]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Patients often considered the balance between quality and length of life when reflecting on possible future ICD deactivation. This balance differed between individuals, but generally, patients indicated that postponing death, just because it is possible, without considering quality of life, does not make sense. The ICD was considered a lifesaving device by many patients, which was also evident in how they talked about their device. They often used words such as 'angel', 'guard dog', and 'safety net'.
However, some patients described a 'love-hate' relationship with their device: previous shocks had saved them from sudden death but were painful, often a source of concern, and a personal confrontation with being ill and the finiteness of life. The possibility of experiencing unwanted shocks while dying was often brought up as an important factor when reflecting on the role of the ICD at the end of life. One patient described that their fear of receiving shocks was greater than the fear of dying. However, another patient indicated always wanting arrhythmias to be treated by shocks, even if death was imminent.

Some patients stated that living longer with a compromised quality of life was undesirable. Losing independence and being diagnosed with a life-limiting illness were among the most frequently mentioned factors threatening quality of life. However, there was a distinction made in the nature of the disease. Advanced cancer or advanced lung disease was brought up by several patients as a clear indication for ICD deactivation, since an active ICD would potentially exacerbate the situation.

### Ethical and legal views of physicians regarding deactivation of cardiac implantable electrical devices: A quantitative assessment [^111WFCRY]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, little is known about physicians' views surrounding the ethical and legal aspects of managing these devices at the end of life. The purpose of this study was to identify physicians' experiences and views surrounding the ethical and legal aspects of managing cardiac devices at the end of life.

- **Methods**: Survey questions were administered to internal medicine physicians and subspecialists at a tertiary care center. Physicians were surveyed about their clinical experience, legal knowledge, and ethical beliefs relating to the withdrawal of PM and ICD therapy in comparison to other life-sustaining therapies.

- **Results**: Responses were obtained from 185 physicians. Compared to withdrawal of PMs and ICDs, physicians more often reported having participated in the withdrawal or removal of mechanical ventilation (86.1% vs 33.9%, P < .0001), dialysis (60.6% vs 33.9%, P < .001), and feeding tubes (73.8% vs 33.9%, P < .0001). Physicians were consistently less comfortable discussing cessation of PMs and ICDs compared to other life-sustaining therapies (P < .005). Only 65% of physicians correctly identified the legal status of euthanasia in the United States, and 20% accurately reported the legal status of physician-assisted suicide in the United States. Compared to deactivation of an ICD, physicians more often characterized deactivation of a PM in a pacemaker-dependent patient as physician-assisted suicide (19% vs 10%, P = 0.027) or euthanasia (9% vs 1%, P < .001).

In conclusion, a significant gap exists in understanding the ethical and legal nuances related to the management of cardiac devices at the end of life.

### Improving communication in heart failure patient care [^112Ny4mq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) reduce sudden death, these patients often die of heart failure (HF) or other diseases. To prevent shocks at the end of life, clinicians should discuss deactivating the defibrillation function.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to determine if a clinician-centered teaching intervention and automatic reminders increased ICD deactivation discussions and increased device deactivation.

- **Methods**: In this 6-center, single-blinded, cluster-randomized controlled trial, primary outcomes were the proportion of patients: 1) having ICD deactivation discussions and 2) having the shocking function deactivated. Secondary outcomes included goals of care conversations and advance directive completion.

- **Results**: A total of 525 subjects were included with advanced HF who had an ICD: 301 in the intervention group and 224 in the control group. At baseline, 52% (n = 272) were not candidates for advanced therapies (i.e. cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support). There were no differences in discussions (41 [14%] vs. 26 [12%]) or deactivation (33 [11%] vs. 26 [12%]). In pre-specified subgroup analyses of patients who were not candidates for advanced therapies, the intervention increased deactivation discussions (32 [25%] vs. 16 [11%]; odds ratio: 2.90; p = 0.003). Overall, 99 patients died; there were no differences in conversations or deactivations among decedents.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Among all participants, there was an increase in goals of care conversations (47% intervention vs. 38% control; odds ratio: 1.53; p = 0.04).

### Pacemaker channels and the chronotropic response in health and disease [^1155Eq8P]. Circulation Research (2024). Low credibility.

The second group of cells is initially dormant, exhibiting a relatively depolarized membrane potential of −30 to −40 mV. These cells develop rhythmic firing only upon hyperpolarization during sustained beta-adrenergic stimulation (Figure 4D). Such cells were found in wild-type (WT) preparations from mice and guinea pigs. Similar observations were made in human cells, although the responder rate to isoproterenol stimulation was considerably lower. Importantly, viability is confirmed as tonic firing can be induced in responding cells by applying isoproterenol (100 nmol/L–1 µmol/L). The cellular mechanism underlying the depolarized membrane potential during nonfiring has not been investigated. It is possible that ion conductances with a more positive reversal potential around −35 mV become dominant during nonfiring. In line with this, a background has been postulated, with an equilibrium potential between −30 and −40 mV. The selective activation of this could explain depolarized nonfiring pacemaker cells. Another explanation could be that the integrity of these pacemaker cells is compromised.

The third group comprises depolarized dormant cells that do not show changes in membrane potential and fail to elicit action potentials during beta-adrenergic stimulation (nonresponder; Figure 4E). While these cells still generate local calcium releases under baseline conditions and show increased membrane densities (I Ca, L, I K, and I f) during isoproterenol application, it is not clear why automaticity cannot be restored. Therefore, they may have been damaged.

### cAMP-dependent regulation of HCN4 controls the tonic entrainment process in sinoatrial node pacemaker cells [^114h9N8Z]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In WT channels, cAMP/isoproterenol shifts activation curves to more depolarized potentials, thereby decreasing the frequency and length of nonfiring by altering the time point at which firing is initiated and terminated. In HCN4FEA cells, nonfiring is observed more frequently than in WT with high cAMP (isoproterenol) and with basal cAMP. Also, the duration of nonfiring is longest in HCN4FEA cells, indicating that in the absence of CDR, activation curves cannot be sufficiently shifted to depolarized potentials. Hence, currents cannot be increased to a sufficiently high level to reduce or suppress nonfiring. Our data indicate that basal cAMP levels might actually shift the activation curves of WT channels to slightly more depolarized V₀.₅ values compared to the HCN4FEA mutant.

Our data show that shifts in V₀.₅ parallel respective changes in time constants. Importantly, activation time constants of HCN4FEA channels expressed in HEK293 cells are between the respective values obtained for WT channels in the absence of cAMP and the presence of saturating cAMP concentrations (order of activation time constants: WT w/o cAMP > HCN4FEA w/o cAMP = HCN4FEA cAMP > WT cAMP). Deactivation time constants of HCN4FEA are similar to WT under conditions without cAMP (order of deactivation time constants: WT w/o cAMP = HCN4FEA w/o cAMP = HCN4FEA cAMP < WT cAMP). Assuming a simple Hodgkin-Huxley formalism for HCN4 channels, one would expect that the peaks of the kinetic-voltage relationship follow the same order as respective V₀.₅ values.

### Implantable cardioverter defibrillator deactivation and advance care planning: A focus group study [^1151TtVm]. Heart (2020). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The study used a focus group design conducted with ICD patients. Participants were recruited through the Dutch national ICD recipient association, 'STIN', via their magazine, website, and social media. Eligible participants were over 40 years old, had an active ICD, spoke Dutch, and could provide written consent. Interested participants received information and consent forms by email. Focus groups took place at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants were given a €25 gift card and travel expense reimbursements.

Forty-one patients agreed to join the study, resulting in five focus groups organized as follows: nine, eight, nine, nine, and six participants per group.

- **Data collection**: Discussions were held in September 2017, led by senior researchers experienced in focus groups, supported by two researchers taking field notes. Participants filled out a demographic questionnaire before the discussions. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Summaries of the transcripts were later shared with the participants.

A semi-structured interview guide, developed by the research team based on expert opinion and literature, directed the focus groups. Topics covered included information provision and other key issues related to ICD deactivation and advance care planning.
