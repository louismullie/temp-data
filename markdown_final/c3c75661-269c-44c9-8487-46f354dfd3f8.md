## Question

do you hold warfarin for mitral valve replacement procedure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether warfarin should be held for a mitral valve replacement procedure and, if so, how to manage bridging and resumption of anticoagulation afterward. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the type of valve being implanted (mechanical versus bioprosthetic) because that dictates lifelong anticoagulation needs. Then, I should verify the perioperative timing for holding warfarin and whether bridging with heparin is indicated. Next, I will review immediate postoperative anticoagulation strategy, including when to restart warfarin and whether to bridge. Finally, I need to consider special scenarios like emergency surgery, device wires, and long-term INR targets, and close with a concise, clinically actionable plan.

> Let me first confirm the valve type because everything hinges on it. For a mechanical mitral valve replacement, lifelong vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) therapy is mandatory to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolism, whereas for a bioprosthetic mitral valve, warfarin is typically used for a short course (about 3 months) and then discontinued if there is no other indication, so the perioperative plan differs substantially between these two scenarios [^112VXKmX] [^1126G7L5].

> Now, I should verify the preoperative interruption strategy. For elective procedures, warfarin is generally held for about 3 to 4 days to allow the INR to fall below the procedural threshold, and the exact timing depends on the INR target and patient-specific factors. Importantly, for mechanical mitral valves, bridging with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is reasonable when the INR becomes subtherapeutic, balancing bleeding and thromboembolic risks on a case-by-case basis [^1158iCqD] [^116ncxRY] [^116YX1oS].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for bridging in mechanical mitral valves. The ACC/AHA guidance supports considering bridging in mechanical mitral valve patients during the preoperative subtherapeutic interval, but more recent ACCP guidance suggests against routine bridging for most mechanical valve patients undergoing elective procedures, except for selected high-risk subgroups. This reflects evolving evidence and the PERIOP-2 trial showing no reduction in thromboembolism but more bleeding with LMWH bridging, so I should individualize the decision rather than apply a blanket rule [^11629V9n] [^115NMEks] [^116ncxRY].

> Next, I should review immediate postoperative management. Hold on, I should verify when to restart warfarin after the surgery. Multiple high-quality sources recommend restarting warfarin as soon as adequate hemostasis is achieved, often within 24 hours postoperatively, and many centers initiate VKA on postoperative day 1 for mechanical valves; bridging with UFH or LMWH is commonly used until the INR is therapeutic, especially in mechanical mitral valve patients given their higher thromboembolic risk [^116MEM9A] [^1158iCqD] [^114xoCLL].

> I need to ensure I address the early postoperative sensitivity to warfarin. Patients are more sensitive to warfarin immediately after valve surgery, so starting doses should be conservative (often 3–5 mg) with frequent INR checks to avoid over-anticoagulation. A structured initiation protocol can shorten time to a stable therapeutic INR and reduce dose holds compared with empirical dosing, which is particularly useful in the early postoperative window [^112eYxsC] [^111MuQtS].

> Let me consider special circumstances. If emergency surgery is required while the patient is therapeutically anticoagulated, rapid reversal with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (with or without vitamin K) is reasonable to restore hemostasis, with plans to resume anticoagulation promptly once bleeding risk allows. Conversely, if temporary interruption is prolonged due to bleeding, the thromboembolic risk remains nontrivial in mechanical mitral valves, so minimizing time off anticoagulation is critical [^1173ygR6] [^115WKHxv].

> I should double-check the long-term INR targets after a mechanical mitral valve. The standard target INR is 3.0 with an acceptable range of 2.5–3.5, and if a thromboembolic event occurs despite a therapeutic INR, intensifying to a higher INR goal or adding low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily) can be considered after assessing bleeding risk. This aligns with ACC/AHA and international guidance [^112VXKmX] [^116A5PSJ] [^1126G7L5].

> But wait, what if the question refers to the initial implantation surgery itself rather than a subsequent noncardiac procedure. For the index mitral valve replacement operation, warfarin is universally held preoperatively to allow safe surgery, and anticoagulation is initiated postoperatively once hemostasis is secured, typically with early VKA plus bridging until therapeutic INR is achieved; this is standard for mechanical valves and reflects both thrombotic risk and postoperative coagulopathic dynamics [^116MEM9A] [^114xoCLL].

> Let me synthesize a practical, scenario-based answer. For a mechanical mitral valve replacement: yes, hold warfarin preoperatively for about 3–4 days, consider bridging with UFH/LMWH when INR is subtherapeutic if the patient is high risk or per local protocol, restart warfarin within 24 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is adequate, and bridge with heparin until INR is therapeutic. For a bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement: hold warfarin preoperatively if used for another indication, manage per AF/VTE guidance, and after implantation use warfarin for roughly 3 months if prescribed, then transition to aspirin or discontinue if no other indication, recognizing early thromboembolic risk is higher in the first 90–180 days [^1158iCqD] [^116MEM9A] [^1126G7L5] [^115hwX5K].

> Final check and concise answer: Yes, warfarin must be held before a mitral valve replacement procedure to permit safe surgery. For mechanical valves, bridging is often reasonable during the subtherapeutic interval and warfarin should be restarted promptly postoperatively with heparin bridging until therapeutic INR, whereas for bioprosthetic valves, short-term postoperative anticoagulation may be used but lifelong warfarin is not required in the absence of other indications. Throughout, individualize bridging decisions given evolving evidence and patient-specific risk [^1158iCqD] [^116MEM9A] [^11629V9n].

---

Warfarin should be **held before mitral valve replacement** [^1158iCqD] to reduce intraoperative bleeding risk. Stop warfarin **5 days pre-op** [^114gKqh6] and check INR before surgery to ensure it is < 1.5 [^notfound]. Bridge with **LMWH or UFH** [^1158iCqD] when INR is subtherapeutic if the patient is at high thromboembolic risk (e.g. mechanical valve, AF with high CHA2DS2-VASc) [^116ncxRY]. Resume warfarin **24–48 hours post-op** once hemostasis is secure, and continue bridging until INR is therapeutic [^115NMEks]. For bioprosthetic valves, stop warfarin 5 days pre-op and resume post-op when bleeding risk allows; bridging is not routinely required unless there are additional high-risk features [^1158iCqD].

---

## Indications for holding warfarin

Warfarin is held preoperatively to **reduce bleeding risk** [^114gKqh6]; however, this increases thromboembolic risk, especially in mechanical valves [^112iNfpQ]. The decision to hold warfarin balances bleeding and thromboembolic risks [^11629V9n].

---

## Timing of warfarin interruption

The **standard recommendation** is to stop warfarin 5 days before surgery [^114gKqh6] to allow INR to fall to a safe level (< 1.5) [^115p4x83]. This timing balances bleeding and thromboembolic risks [^115NMEks].

---

## Need for bridging anticoagulation

Bridging with LMWH or UFH is used when INR is subtherapeutic in patients at **high thromboembolic risk** (e.g. mechanical valves, AF with high CHA2DS2-VASc) [^116ncxRY]. It is not routinely required for low-risk patients [^11629V9n].

---

## Risks associated with holding warfarin

Holding warfarin increases **thromboembolic risk**, including valve thrombosis and stroke [^113wNkLm]. This risk is higher in mechanical valves, especially in the mitral position [^1114pYXF].

---

## Postoperative management of warfarin

Warfarin should be resumed **24–48 hours post-op** once hemostasis is secure, with bridging until INR is therapeutic [^114xoCLL]. Early resumption reduces thromboembolic risk [^1146gCHC].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mechanical valves**: Lifelong warfarin is required; hold 5 days pre-op, bridge if high risk, and resume post-op with bridging [^112VXKmX].
- **Bioprosthetic valves**: Warfarin is typically used for 3 months; hold 5 days pre-op, resume post-op, and bridge only if high-risk features [^1126G7L5].
- **Emergency surgery**: Use PCC or FFP for rapid reversal [^1173ygR6]; resume warfarin post-op when safe [^1158iCqD].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Valve type** | **Pre-op warfarin management** | **Post-op warfarin management** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanical valve | Stop 5 days pre-op; bridge if high risk | Resume 24–48 hours post-op; bridge until INR therapeutic |
| Bioprosthetic valve | Stop 5 days pre-op; no routine bridging | Resume 24–48 hours post-op; no routine bridging |

---

Warfarin should be **held before mitral valve replacement** [^1158iCqD] to reduce bleeding risk, with timing and bridging individualized based on thromboembolic and bleeding risk [^1158iCqD].

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease guideline — mechanical prosthetic valves states that in patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve, anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) is recommended. For mechanical bileaflet or current-generation single-tilting disk aortic valve replacement (AVR) and no risk factors for thromboembolism, anticoagulation with a VKA to achieve an INR of 2.5 is recommended. For mechanical AVR with additional risk factors or an older-generation prosthesis, anticoagulation with a VKA is indicated to achieve an INR of 3.0, and for mechanical mitral valve replacement anticoagulation with a VKA is indicated to achieve an INR of 3.0. For mechanical surgical AVR (SAVR) or mitral valve replacement managed with a VKA who have an indication for antiplatelet therapy, addition of aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily may be considered when the risk of bleeding is low. For mechanical On-X AVR and no thromboembolic risk factors, use of a VKA targeted to a lower INR (1.5–2.0) may be reasonable starting ≥ 3 months after surgery, with continuation of aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily.

### Peri-procedural anticoagulation management of mechanical prosthetic heart valve patients [^112Pv5Uf]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

To estimate the three-month cumulative incidence of thromboembolism and bleeding among mechanical heart valve (MHV) patients receiving peri-procedural anticoagulation management, consecutive MHV patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center for peri-procedural anticoagulation management over the seven-year period, 1997–2003, were followed for three months for thromboembolism, bleeding and vital status.

Materials and Methods

Warfarin was stopped 4–5 days prior to the procedure, and re-started after the procedure as soon as hemostasis was assured. The decision to provide bridging therapy with low molecular weight (LMWH) or unfractionated (UFH) heparin was individualized and based on the estimated risks of TE and bleeding.

Results

556 MHV patients (372 aortic only, 136 mitral only, 48 with multiple valves) underwent 580 procedures. The three-month cumulative incidence of thromboembolism was 0.9% which included: cerebral ischemia (n = 3), unstable angina (n = 1), acute myocardial infarction (n = 1). None were fatal. The cumulative incidence of major bleeding was 3.6% and fatal in 0.2%. The incidence of major bleeding events did not differ by postoperative anticoagulant strategy whether LMWH (3.7%), UFH (6.1%), or no heparin (2.4%) was used (p = 0.26).

Conclusions

The three-month cumulative incidence of thromboembolism among MHV patients in whom anticoagulation is temporarily interrupted for an invasive procedure is low. Whereas bleeding exceeds thromboembolic complications, our current practice is to restart warfarin as soon as possible post-procedure. Post-procedural heparin use is reserved for patients with the highest thromboembolic risk (mitral MHV, multiple MHVs, MHV with prior stroke or atrial fibrillation) waiting at least 48 hours before initiating.

### Who are we bridging? Description of warfarin patients receiving injectable bridging therapy [^115cZLCW]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The evidence guiding the decision to provide injectable anticoagulant bridging therapy during periods of subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is sparse. This study aims to identify the types of patients currently bridged within an academic medical center's Thrombosis Service, to highlight patient populations for future study of bridging outcomes.

Methods

This descriptive cohort study included patients taking warfarin managed by University of Utah Health Thrombosis Service who received outpatient enoxaparin bridging between January 1 and December 31, 2022. Anticoagulation indication, reason for bridging, and type of procedure were validated via manual chart review.

Results

During the one-year study period, 181 unique patients (9.4% of the service's total warfarin population) experienced 244 bridging episodes, mostlyin the periprocedural setting (67.6%) for gastrointestinal-type procedures (39.4%). The most common anticoagulation indications in all bridged patients were antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (23.2%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (21.5%), or a mechanical mitral valve plus another indication (13.3%). Most bridging episodes for VTE occurred > 3 months from the acute event, with the rationale for bridging including breakthrough VTE (31%) or APS (23%). Just over one-half of bridged patients fit the guideline-recommended criteria for high thrombotic risk, and just over one-third were low-moderate thrombotic risk.

Conclusions

In this one-year outpatient study, warfarin patients received enoxaparin bridging most commonly due to a gastrointestinal procedural interruption in the setting of APS, VTE with a prior breakthrough thrombotic event, or mechanical mitral valve. Just over one-third of bridged patients were guideline-classified as low-moderate thrombotic risk, indicating these populations may warrant further investigation or bridging de-escalation.

Study design

Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited consecutively in the prospective, single-center, observational cohort study. The study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, registration number ChiCTR1800019841. During a surgical procedure, UFH was given to sustain an activated clotting time above 400 s. When the cardiopulmonary blood bypass was stopped, protamine sulfate was used to neutralize UFH anticoagulation. At the end of the surgery, two surgical drains were placed around the heart, and, if necessary, a third surgical drain was placed in the pleural cavities. In the early postoperative period, patients stayed in the ICU ward until they achieved respiratory and hemodynamic stability; then, they were transferred to the general ward. The surgical drains were removed when the drainage volume was less than 50 ml/d in the general ward.

Bridging anticoagulation was initiated at 6 h postoperatively either subcutaneous UFH 25 IU/kg/dose four times daily or subcutaneous LMWH 4000 IU of anti-Xa/dose twice daily. Warfarin, starting dose 3 mg, was given as soon as patients were extubated on the postoperative day 1 or 2. Bridging anticoagulants were given until INR was within the target range for 2 consecutive days (1.5 to 2.5 for aortic valve replacement, 1.8 to 3.0 for mitral valve replacement and bivalve replacement, 2.5 to 3.0 for tricuspid valve replacement).

According to the physicians' orders after surgery, patients enrolled in the study were divided into three groups: the UFH group, the UFH-LMWH group and the LMWH group. Regardless of ICU or general ward stays, UFH was used as a monotherapy in the UFH group, and LMWH was used as a monotherapy in the LMWH group. For patients in the UFH-LMWH group, UFH was used as monotherapy in the ICU, and it was replaced by LMWH in the general ward to bridge anticoagulation (Fig. 1). All patients were followed for 4 weeks after operation.

### Warfarin sodium [^111BPf9f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Atrial Fibrillation

In five prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 3711 patients with non-rheumatic AF, warfarin significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke (see Table 4). The risk reduction ranged from 60% to 86% in all except one trial (CAFA: 45%), which was stopped early due to published positive results from two of these trials. The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0.6% to 2.7% (see Table 4).

Trials in patients with both AF and mitral stenosis suggest a benefit from anticoagulation with warfarin sodium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

14.2 Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves

In a prospective, randomized, open-label, positive-controlled study in 254 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, the thromboembolic-free interval was found to be significantly greater in patients treated with warfarin alone compared with dipyridamole/aspirin-treated patients (p < 0.005) and pentoxifylline/aspirin-treated patients (p < 0.05). The results of this study are presented in Table 5.

In a prospective, open-label, clinical study comparing moderate (INR 2.65) versus high intensity (INR 9.0) warfarin therapies in 258 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, thromboembolism occurred with similar frequency in the two groups (4.0 and 3.7 events per 100 patient years, respectively). Major bleeding was more common in the high intensity group. The results of this study are presented in Table 6.

In a randomized trial in 210 patients comparing two intensities of warfarin therapy (INR 2.0 to 2.25 vs. INR 2.5 to 4.0) for a three-month period following tissue heart valve replacement, thromboembolism occurred with similar frequency in the two groups (major embolic events 2.0% vs. 1.9%, respectively, and minor embolic events 10.8% vs. 10.2%, respectively). Major hemorrhages occurred in 4.6% of patients in the higher intensity INR group compared to zero in the lower intensity INR group.

Regarding perioperative care for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to pre-procedural anticoagulation bridging, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to do not administer bridging with LMWH in patients with AF interrupting warfarin while undergoing surgeries or procedures, except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for valvular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112FPNMt]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

INR targets and antiplatelet therapy for mechanical valves — In patients with a mechanical aortic valve, we suggest VKA therapy with a target of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) over lower targets, and we recommend VKA therapy with a target of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) over higher targets. In a mechanical mitral valve, we suggest VKA therapy with a target of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) over lower INR targets; in patients with mechanical heart valves in both the aortic and mitral position, we suggest target INR 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5) over target INR 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0). For patients at low risk of bleeding, we suggest adding over not adding an antiplatelet agent such as low-dose aspirin (50–100 mg/d) to the VKA therapy, with the remark that caution should be used in patients at increased bleeding risk, such as history of GI bleeding. For patients with mechanical aortic or mitral valves we recommend VKA over antiplatelet agents.

### 2022 ESC guidelines on cardiovascular assessment and management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^116YX1oS]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for prosthetic heart valves, more specifically with respect to perioperative management of anticoagulants, bridging, ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering UFH or LMWH for bridging (if interruption of oral anticoagulation is required) in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves undergoing noncardiac surgery and having any of the following:

- mechanical aortic valve replacement and any thromboembolic risk factor

- old-generation mechanical aortic valve replacement

- mechanical mitral or tricuspid valve replacement.

### The optimal management of anti-thrombotic therapy after valve replacement: certainties and uncertainties [^117ENEnm]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-thrombotic therapy after valve replacement encompasses a number of different situations. Long-term anticoagulation of mechanical prostheses uses vitamin K antagonists with a target international normalized ratio adapted to the characteristics of the prosthesis and the patient. The association of low-dose aspirin is systematic in the American guidelines and more restrictive in the European guidelines. Early heparin therapy is frequently used early after mechanical valve replacement, although there are no precise recommendations regarding timing, type, and dose of drug. Direct oral anticoagulants are presently contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthesis. The main advantage of bioprostheses is the absence of long-term anticoagulant therapy. Early anticoagulation is indicated after valve replacement for mitral bioprostheses, whereas aspirin is now favoured early after bioprosthetic valve replacement in the aortic position. Early dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, followed by single antiplatelet therapy. However, this relies on low levels of evidence and optimization of anti-thrombotic therapy is warranted in these high-risk patients. Although guidelines are consistent in most instances, discrepancies and the low-level of evidence of certain recommendations highlight the need for further controlled trials, in particular with regard to the combination of antiplatelet therapy with oral anticoagulant and the early post-operative anti-thrombotic therapy following the procedure.

### How did we get here? a historical review and critical analysis of anticoagulation therapy following mechanical valve replacement [^111ByZdq]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Managing severe valvular heart disease with mechanical valve replacement necessitates lifelong anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist. Optimal anticoagulation intensity for patients with mechanical valves remains uncertain; current recommendations are inconsistent across guideline bodies and largely based on expert opinion. In this review, we outline the history of anticoagulation therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves and critically evaluate current antithrombotic guidelines for these patients. We conclude that randomized trials evaluating optimal anticoagulation intensity in patients with mechanical valves are needed, and that future guidelines must better justify antithrombotic treatment recommendations.

### Variation in warfarin thromboprophylaxis after mitral valve repair: does equipoise exist and is a randomized trial warranted? [^1152GVgd]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited data available to inform decision making regarding warfarin thromboprophylaxis early after mitral valve repair.

Methods

We studied 13,082 patients from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (STS ACSD) who underwent primary mitral valve repair between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2010. Excluded were those having other major concomitant operations or with an indication/contraindication to warfarin. The predictors of warfarin administration at dismissal were evaluated.

Results

In this cohort (median age 58 years; 59% male), warfarin was prescribed at hospital dismissal for 46% (5,963) of patients. Median postoperative length of stay was 5 days overall (6 days warfarin versus 5 days, p < 0.0001). Substantial surgeon and center variation existed, and multivariable analysis identified that warfarin use was more common among patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] 4.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.57 to 4.58), postoperative neurologic events (stroke OR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.71; transient ischemic attack/reversible ischemic neurologic deficit OR 6.29, 95% CI: 2.67 to 14.84), and preoperative arrhythmia (OR 2.49, 95% CI: 1.84 to 3.38). Warfarin use was less common among patients having surgery in the more recent era (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.96, per half-year increase in date of surgery), those requiring intraoperative transfusion of red blood cells (OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.96), and patients with advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class IV OR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.00).

Conclusions

At present, half of patients are prescribed warfarin after isolated mitral valve repair in North American cardiac surgical practice which may impact the length of hospital stay. Although patient-level predictors of warfarin prescription exist, center- and surgeon-level variations are prominent. There is a pressing need for a randomized trial both to guide therapy and to ascertain the potential for resource conservation.

Prosthesis considerations

Choice of valve

Over recent decades, the proportion of bioprosthetic valves employed in younger demographics has risen in the UK. This increase is likely due to the anticoagulation burden associated with mechanical valve implantation. Such coagulopathic adverse events have been demonstrated to increase postoperative readmission rates compared with bioprosthetic mitral prosthesis choice. However, in non-elderly patients, the increased rate of valve degeneration associated with bioprosthetic valves has been demonstrated to increase the requirement for valvular reoperation and subsequently increase operative risk and long-term mortality. Mechanical mitral valve replacement should be considered in patients of age < 65 years without a contraindication to anticoagulation. The choice of valve prosthesis should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the associated risks of life-long anticoagulation, the potential requirement of reoperation, and the patient's wishes following extensive counseling. Current data suggest that IE should not influence the choice of prosthetic valve implantation beyond standard patient assessment of age and comorbidities.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113Yb5yZ]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Prosthetic valves: choice of bioprosthetic versus mechanical valve type emphasizes that when VKA anticoagulation (vitamin K antagonist) is "Contraindicated
- Cannot be managed
- Not desired", the algorithm lists "Bioprosthetic valve (1)". For patients between 50 and 65 years of age, selection "should be made in a shared decision-making process" considering durability, bleeding, and thromboembolism. In patients > 65 years receiving bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), "the likelihood of primary structural deterioration at 15 to 20 years is only about 10%", and "it is reasonable to use a bioprosthetic valve in patients > 65 years of age to avoid the risks of anticoagulation". Generally, mechanical valves have a "higher risk of bleeding because of anticoagulation", while bioprosthetic valves carry a "higher risk of repeat intervention" from structural deterioration; for mitral valve replacement in patients < 65 years, observational data "suggest better long-term outcomes with a mechanical" valve. In propensity-matched data for mitral valve replacement among patients 50 to 69 years, reoperation was lower with a mechanical valve (HR: 0.59) but stroke risk was higher (HR: 1.62), and a separate report in those 40 to 69 years found biological prostheses associated with significantly higher mortality than mechanical prostheses. Evidence context notes long-term (20-y) outcomes data for surgical bioprostheses but transcatheter data extend only to 5 y. The figure also lists "Pulmonic autograft at CVC (2b)".

While two studies did not have any funding, the remaining five studies did not disclose any possible sources of funding. The median sample size was 626 (range 144 to 13 082). Countries, years of recruitment and number of centres included in each study can be found in table 1. Median follow-up duration was 6 months (range 44 days to 4.9 years). Of the 10 observational studies, six of them used regression analysis, and one of them used inverse probability weightingfor controlling of potential confounders. The remaining three studies did not use any method to mitigate confounding. All studies had serious risk of bias and numerous major limitations. Furthermore, given that the patients included in the studies had MVr dating as far back to 1997, the surgical techniques and risk reduction therapies during the period could potentially limit the generalisability of results to current practice.

The sole RCT, which aimed to show non-inferiority of edoxaban compared with warfarin, had the following limitations: unclear if allocation sequence was concealed, open-label design, 61% of patients had AF documented postoperatively (confounder), wide non-inferiority margin (8% of the absolute difference in incidence rates) that did not exclude clinically important harm from edoxaban compared with warfarin, low time in therapeutic range of international normalised ratio (INR) and limited power due to lower-than-estimated event rates for both efficacy and safety.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111h6BFn]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in valvular heart disease (VHD) — anticoagulation recommendations are as follows. In patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mitral stenosis of moderate or greater severity and history of atrial fibrillation, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended over DOACs, independent of the CHA2DS2-VASc score to prevent cardiovascular events, including stroke or death (1 B-R). In patients with atrial fibrillation and valve disease other than moderate or greater mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, DOACs are recommended over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (1 B-NR).

Mechanical heart valves — early postoperative bridging (postoperative day 0 to 5): The options for antithrombotic therapy immediately after mechanical heart valve replacement include oral VKA therapy with or without initial bridging using unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and no randomized trials comparing these strategies were identified; among 3,056 patients who received VKA therapy immediately after surgery, there was an absolute rate of thromboembolism of 0.9% and a bleeding rate of 3.3% during the first 30 days. In a prospective observational study (n = 538), Group A (n = 245) received VKA alone, and Group B (n = 293) received enoxaparin 1 mg/kg started 6 hours after surgery and repeated every 12 h with VKA beginning day 1 until the INR was therapeutic; the target INR was 2.5 to 3.5 for mitral or multiple mechanical valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for aortic valve replacement, all patients received aspirin 150 mg daily and were followed for 6 months, and the incidence of prosthetic valve thrombosis was lower with enoxaparin (6.1% vs 2.0%, P = .01) with no significant difference in bleeding.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112iNfpQ]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — bridging therapy during interruption of oral anticoagulation in prosthetic heart valves: For patients with mechanical heart valves who are undergoing minor procedures (eg, dental extractions or cataract removal) where bleeding is easily controlled, continuation of VKA anticoagulation with a therapeutic INR is recommended. For patients with a bileaflet mechanical AVR and no other risk factors for thromboembolism who are undergoing invasive procedures, temporary interruption of VKA anticoagulation, without bridging agents while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended. For patients with a mechanical prosthesis receiving VKA therapy who require immediate/ emergency noncardiac surgery or an invasive procedure, administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (or its activated form) is reasonable. For patients with bioprosthetic heart valves or annuloplasty rings who are receiving anticoagulant therapy for AF, it is reasonable to consider the need for bridging anticoagulant therapy around the time of invasive procedures on the basis of the CHA2DS2-VASc score weighed against the risk of bleeding. For patients who are undergoing invasive procedures and have 1) a mechanical AVR and any thromboembolic risk factor, 2) an older-generation mechanical AVR, or 3) a mechanical mitral valve replacement, bridging anticoagulation therapy during the preoperative time interval when the INR is subtherapeutic is reasonable on an individualized basis, with the risk of bleeding weighed against the benefits of thromboembolism prevention.

### Intracerebral haemorrhage, anticoagulation and mechanical heart valves: what should I do next? [^1133xpP3]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Life-long oral anticoagulant therapy is recommended to all patients with mechanical heart valves to reduce the incidence of thromboembolic events. However, intracerebral haemorrhage is the fatal complication associated with anticoagulation, with an estimated 6-month mortality of 67%. (1) The incidence of cerebral bleeding while on anticoagulation is 0.3–0.7%/year, with as many as 85% of survivors left with permanent neurological deficits. (2) Difficulties in management arise when anticoagulation is temporarily discontinued as mechanical valves, particularly mitral, are exposed to significant thromboembolic and valve dysfunction risk. The decision on when to appropriately restart anticoagulation needs to be balanced with the risk of precipitating further cerebral haemorrhage. There are currently no guidelines on the optimal time to start anticoagulation. We describe a case of the management approach implemented in a patient with a mechanical valve presenting to the emergency department with an acute intracerebral haemorrhage.

### Variation in warfarin use at hospital discharge after isolated bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement: an analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons adult cardiac surgery database [^114sXYS6]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation with warfarin following bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement (BMVR) is recommended by multiple practice guidelines. We assessed practice variability and patient characteristics associated with warfarin prescription following BMVR.

Methods

We analyzed 7,637 patients in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database (January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2011) who were discharged following isolated primary nonemergent BMVR. Patients requiring preoperative warfarin, those with preoperative atrial fibrillation, or those with a contraindication to warfarin were excluded. The association between patient, hospital, and surgeon characteristics and warfarin prescription were evaluated.

Results

Fifty-eight percent of this cohort (median age, 66 years; female sex, 58.7%) was prescribed warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin were older (67 vs 65 years; P < .0001), were less likely to have had preoperative stroke (9.3% vs 12.1%; P < .001), CHF (51.4% vs 54.1%; P < .02), or dialysis (4.9% vs 9.0%; P < 0.001), and had a longer postoperative length of stay (8.0 vs 7.0 days; P < 0.01). Warfarin was prescribed less often for patients with postoperative GI events (44.4% vs 55.6%; P < .001) but more often for patients with postoperative myocardial infarction (75.8% vs 24.2%; P < .001) or new atrial fibrillation (68% vs 32%; P < .001) and those requiring blood transfusions intraoperatively (55.7% vs 44.3%; P < .001) or postoperatively (57% vs 43%; P < .03). Similar rates of warfarin prescription were observed in patients requiring reoperation for bleeding (54.9% vs 45.1%; p = 0.20) and those with postoperative stroke (53.6% vs 46.4%; p = 0.30). After adjusting for patient characteristics, significant surgeon and hospital variation in warfarin prescription at hospitals was observed.

Conclusions

Although patient characteristics and postoperative events may be associated with the prescription of warfarin following BMVR, substantial surgeon and hospital variability remains. This variability largely ignores the established practice guidelines and warrants further study to define the optimal anticoagulation strategy in patients undergoing BMVR.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-thrombotic therapy after surgical mitral valve repair: a scoping review [^113PutWM]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimise the impact of surgical-technique and post-operative care variability, we propose that stratification of patients based on the participating centre be completed. A priori defined subgroup analysis to investigate each stratum (ie, centre) may also help identify any potential confounding effects of surgical-technique and postoperative care variation between centres. Surgical techniques used would also be reported for each patient. Although we propose avoiding highly selected patients (eg, excluding patients based on comorbidities), we recommend that patients with preoperative AF and postoperative AF are excluded from the study, given that AF is substantially associated with higher mortality, stroke and heart failure hospitalisation following MVrand that a large majority of AF and postoperative AF patients would already receive an anti-coagulant based on guideline-recommended therapy.

The optimal intervention and comparator to prevent thromboembolic events after MVr can be debated. For decades, VKA was the oral anti-coagulant of choice after cardiac surgery, yet VKA has been superseded by DOAC's for most other thromboembolic conditions. Although weak quality, there are several studies that suggest that anti-coagulation may not be necessary and anti-platelet therapy may be sufficient to prevent thromboembolic events. There were no studies comparing different anti-platelet strategies after MVr (eg, dual or single anti-platelet). An ideal study could include multiple arms and compare VKA to DOACs to single anti-platelet for 3 months following MVr. Concomitant anti-platelet use in OAC groups should be standardised, as well as a bridging protocol and time in therapeutic range in patients on VKA. Given the pragmatic nature of the study and the hard clinical endpoints of interest, treatments could remain open-label. To ensure pragmatism and avoid data collection inconsistencies between centres, definitions for the primary thromboembolic outcomes and secondary bleeding events would be based on validated administrative data definitions. No extra follow-up appointments would be required for study purposes, which would also enable participant recruitment. In order to capture both short- and long-term complications following MVr, we propose that 1-month, 3-month and 6-month outcomes are collected.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^111ZNjDp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In RE‐ALIGN, most valvular thrombosis occurred in the immediate postoperative period, 26 suggesting that the increased release of pro‐thrombotic substances after surgery overwhelms the capacity of dabigatran to antagonize thrombin. Anticoagulation in this setting should occur with frequent and individualized dose adjustments that match the unpredictably released pro‐coagulant factors and maintain a net anticoagulant effect. 51 Although by study design dabigatran was dosed up to twice the Food and Drug Administration approved dose for AF, to achieve circulating levels > 50 ng/mL, this might not reflect the true anticoagulation effect of dabigatran, at the valve level, in the setting of unpredictable bursts of pro‐thrombotic factors after surgery. However, patients receiving dabigatran had a higher risk of bleeding compared with those receiving VKA. Contrary to this, INR measurements reflect the net anticoagulation effect of VKAs and enable individualized dose adjustment to achieve the desired level of anticoagulation. Given their short half‐lives, monitoring the net anticoagulation effect of NOACs in this dynamic setting would be challenging. Furthermore, dabigatran is a competitive inhibitor of a single coagulation factor while VKAs are noncompetitive irreversible inhibitors of multiple coagulation factors of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, as well as of factor X and thrombin in the common pathway. 52

VKAs remain the anticoagulation modality of choice in patients with mechanical valves. 31 In a meta‐analysis of 46 anticoagulation studies and 53 647 patients with mechanical valves, a mechanical valve in the mitral position was associated with a 2‐fold higher thromboembolic risk compared with the aortic position. Anticoagulation with warfarin was an effective approach for the reduction of thromboembolic events. 53 High INR variability is independently associated with reduced survival after a mechanical valve implantation. 54 There is limited experience on the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with AF and biological prosthesis or mitral valve repair. 55

Regarding patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease, the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend anticoagulation with VKAs in the presence of left atrial enlargement (> 55 mm), left atrial thrombus, AF, or history of systemic embolism. 31 There are no randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the benefit of VKAs in patients with rheumatic valve disease, and these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies. 56, 57 Patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease were excluded from all major NOAC trials and their use should be avoided until further studies become available.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112uWCDf]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Bioprosthetic valve anticoagulation after surgery — early stroke risk and registry signals: In bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement, patients who received anticoagulation had a lower rate of thromboembolism than those without vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, and the incidence of ischemic stroke within the first 30 postoperative days was higher after replacement with a biological prosthesis than after mitral valve repair (1.5% ± 0.4%) or replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. For bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), small studies have not established a convincing net benefit of anticoagulation, but a large observational Danish registry demonstrated a lower risk of stroke and death with VKA up to 6 months without a significantly increased bleeding risk. Concern has been raised about subclinical bioprosthetic leaflet thrombosis, and in the PARTNER 2 registry, anticoagulation after bioprosthetic AVR in intermediate– or higher–surgical risk patients was safe and associated with a significant reduction in 6-month stroke rates, with Ninety-five percent discharged on warfarin.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation but underlying native mitral and aortic valve disease participating in the ROCKET AF trial [^115v6XmY]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

The rationale and design of the ROCKET AF study have been published (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00403767). In brief, ROCKET AF was a multicentre, international, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial comparing fixed-dose rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted warfarin for prevention of all stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. The study was funded by Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development (Raritan, NJ, USA) and Bayer HealthCare AG (Leverkusen, Germany). The Duke Clinical Research Institute (Durham, NC, USA) coordinated the trial and performed the statistical analyses for this article independent of the sponsors. An international executive steering committee designed the study and takes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the analyses. All appropriate national regulatory authorities and ethics committees at participating centres approved the study.

This analysis included 14 171 of 14 264 patients in the ROCKET AF trial. Due to one site's violations of Good Clinical Practice guidelines that made the data unreliable, 93 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses before unblinding but were included in the safety analyses.

A total of 2003 patients had SVD. Eleven of these patients were at the site that violated Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and an additional 4 patients were randomized but did not receive study drug. Therefore, 1992 SVD patients were used in the analysis of efficacy endpoints [intention-to-treat (ITT) population], and 1999 SVD patients were used in the analysis of safety endpoints (safety population). None of the patients had undergone transcutaneous aortic valve replacement.

Five patients had been randomized despite the presence of a prosthetic valve. The sites were immediately contacted and instructed to discontinue these patients from study drug. These patients were included in the ITT population but not in the safety population. Three of these five patients died before the end of the study in 1 year to about 3 years after enrolment; the other two patients remained alive and were followed until the end of the study.

Patients were randomized to fixed-dose rivaroxaban [20 mg once daily; 15 mg daily for those with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min)] or dose-adjusted warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2.0–3.0), in a double-blind fashion.

### How safely and for how long can warfarin therapy be withheld in prosthetic heart valve patients hospitalized with a major hemorrhage? [^114jiZce]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To identify the risk of thromboembolism after withholding or reversing the effect of warfarin therapy following a major hemorrhage.

Design

Retrospective medical record review.

Setting

Tertiary-care hospital.

Patients

Twenty-eight patients with prosthetic heart valves receiving warfarin were hospitalized for major hemorrhage from 1990 to 1997. The mean ± SD age was 61 ± 11 years (15 men and 13 women). Twenty patients had St. Jude valves, 4 patients had Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthetic valves, 2 patients had Starr Edwards valves, and 2 patients had Bjork-Shiley valves. Valves were in the mitral position in 12 patients, the aortic position in 12 patients, and both mitral and aortic positions in 4 patients. The average interval from valve surgery to index bleeding was 7 years. Twenty-five patients had GI or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, 2 patients had an intracranial hemorrhage, and 1 patient had a subdural hematoma.

Interventions

Vitamin K was administered to five patients and fresh frozen plasma was given to seven patients to reverse anticoagulation. The mean duration of anticoagulation withholding was 15 ± 4 days.

Measurements and Results

None of the patients had thromboembolic complications. There were four in-hospital deaths. Twenty-two of the 24 hospital survivors resumed warfarin therapy at hospital discharge. At 6-month follow-up, 10 of 19 patients remaining on warfarin therapy had recurrent GI bleeding.

Conclusions

Thromboembolic risk is low in prosthetic heart valve patients hospitalized with major hemorrhage when their warfarin therapy is reversed or withheld. Recurrent bleeding within 6 months of the resumption of anticoagulation is common, and aggressive treatment of the bleeding source and the risk-benefit ratio of continued anticoagulation need to be considered.

### Comparing usual care with a warfarin initiation protocol after mechanical heart valve replacement [^111MuQtS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The immediate postoperative warfarin sensitivity for patients receiving heart valve prostheses is increased. Established warfarin initiation protocols may lack clinical applicability, resulting in dosing based on clinical judgment.

Objective

To compare current practice for warfarin initiation with a known warfarin initiation protocol, with doses proportionally reduced to account for the increased postoperative sensitivity.

Methods

We compared the Mechanical Heart Valve Warfarin Initiation Protocol (Protocol group) with current practice (clinical judgment-Empirical group) for patients receiving mechanical heart valves in an observational before-and-after format. End points were the time to achieve a stable therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR), doses held in the first 6 days, and overanticoagulation in the first 6 days.

Results

The Protocol group (n = 37) achieved a stable INR more rapidly than the Empirical group (n = 77; median times 5.1 and 8.7 days, respectively; P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that the Protocol group (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.22; P = 0.005) and men (HR = 1.76; P = 0.043) more rapidly achieved a stable therapeutic INR. Age, serum albumin, amiodarone, presence of severe heart failure, and surgery type had no impact. Protocol patients had fewer doses held (1.1% vs 10.1%, P < 0.001) and no difference in overanticoagulation (2.7% vs 9.1%, P = 0.27).

Conclusion

The Mechanical Heart Valve Warfarin Initiation Protocol provided a reliable approach to initiating warfarin in patients receiving mechanical aortic or mitral valves.

### Anticoagulation therapy and clinical outcomes following transcatheter mitral valve repair for patients with mitral regurgitation: a meta-analysis [^114JZR84]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

We believe that in patients with a low risk of bleeding after TMVR, it is possible that the application of short‐term anticoagulants (at least 4 weeks duration) is the best therapy to avoid thrombosis and reduce the incidence of stroke and bleeding events. However, the optimal therapy (type and duration of anticoagulant drugs) still needs to be further evaluated in larger studies.

4.1 Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, this analysis contains five observational cohort studies, therefore, it is subject to possible selection bias and confounding, inherent to this type of study designs. Second, the control group was receiving SAPT or DAPT, the intervention group was receiving OACs with SAPT/DAPT/ASA in some patients and only OAC in some. The intervention group was stratification by OAC, OAC plus DAPT, and OAC plus SAPT, but the sample size was small. The lack of detail in the stratification of the intervention group and control group as well as the small sample size led to low confidence in the conclusions. The finding on statistically significant lower risk of stroke is informed by a total of 4 lower stroke events. This also leads to less credible conclusion. Third, the baseline characteristics of the included population were incomplete, regarding prevalence of atrial fibrillation, risk of stroke and information on use of anticoagulants before the procedure Forth, none of the results from the included studies were proper time‐to‐event analyses. Simple measures such as RR based on time to event data and studies with variable follow‐up cannot be reliably compared.

### Increased sensitivity to warfarin after heart valve replacement [^112eYxsC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The dosage requirement of warfarin to achieve a given international normalized ratio (INR) often varies considerably between the immediate postoperative period and long-term follow-up in patients with prosthetic heart valves, leading to INR instability.

Objective

To document the extent of warfarin sensitivity in a prospective study of patients receiving heart valve replacements.

Methods

Clinical and laboratory data regarding anticoagulation for 111 patients who received warfarin following heart valve replacement were collected during their hospital stay (induction period) and between 1 and 3 months after surgery (follow-up period).

Results

Mean patient age was 65.39 ± 10.55 years (range 29–85), with 66 men. The mean INR value during the follow-up period was, on average, 0.21 higher than the induction period (2.81 ± 0.5 vs 2.6 ± 0.6; p = 0.007). The mean follow-up warfarin dose was 1.54 mg higher than the mean induction warfarin dose (5.09 ± 2.03 vs 3.55 ± 1.94 mg; p < 0.001). The warfarin dose index, which indicates relative sensitivity of warfarin, decreased from 1.16 to 0.65 (p < 0.001). Although the INR values during the induction and follow-up periods were similar, the dose requirement in the follow-up period was, on average, 43% higher than that of the induction period.

Conclusions

Immediately after heart valve replacement, patients are more sensitive to warfarin and should receive a lower warfarin dose during the initial phase of oral anticoagulation treatment. This enhanced sensitivity decreases with time. Patients require frequent monitoring and are likely to need an increase in the warfarin dose to avoid insufficient anticoagulation during the early follow-up period.

A pilot randomized trial included 75 aortic valve patients who received either warfarin (n = 34) or aspirin (n = 35); warfarin was dosed to reach an INR of 2.0 to 3.0, while the aspirin group received 100 mg daily of aspirin for 3 months, and these studies were not blinded and reported few events, with the quality of this evidence described as low.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^113dva2u]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanical Prosthetic Valves and Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease

Valvular heart disease has a prevalence of 2.5% (any valve) in the United States, and is equally distributed between men and women. 27 Prosthetic heart valve replacement is recommended for many patients with severe valvular heart disease 28 and on average 300 000 prosthetic heart valve replacements are performed every year worldwide, 100 000 of which are in North America. 29 By 2050, the annual number of valve replacements is projected to be 850 000. 30 Mechanical valves are more durable than bioprosthetic valves but typically require lifelong anticoagulation therapy. 31 The use of VKAs provides excellent protection against thromboembolic complications in patients with mechanical heart valves, 31 but its use is bound by the drawbacks previously described.

Although preclinical studies showed a potential role of NOACs in the presence of a mechanical valve, in the RE‐ALIGN trial, dabigatran was associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Patients with severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves were excluded from the major NOAC trials, and thus their results cannot be generalized in this distinct patient population. In vitro studies have demonstrated that dabigatran (1 μmol/L) 32 and high‐dose rivaroxaban (300 ng/mL) 33 were as effective as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in preventing thrombus formation on mechanical heart valves. In porcine models of heterotopic mechanical valve implantation, dabigatran 34 and rivaroxaban 35 have been equally effective as enoxaparin in preventing valvular thrombus formation. Dabigatran provides a mortality benefit when compared with warfarin after mechanical mitral valve replacement in pigs. 36 However, these results have not been translated in humans. Several case reports demonstrated severe valvular thrombosis when dabigatran was used in the setting of mechanical mitral valve, 37, 38 mechanical aortic valve, 39 or rheumatic mitral stenosis. 40 In the RE‐ALIGN phase II clinical trial, patients with mechanical heart valves were randomized to receive either dabigatran (150, 220, or 300 mg twice daily, to achieve serum dabigatran trough concentrations > 50 ng/mL) or dose‐adjusted warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5, depending on their thromboembolic risk. The trial was terminated prematurely because of significantly increased thromboembolic and bleeding rates in the dabigatran arm. 26 As a result, research for this indication has been stopped, and use of these agents is contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves.

### Making safer preoperative arrangements for patients using vitamin K antagonists [^115rZGDq]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In the perioperative phase a balance should be found between the risk of bleeding and the risk of a thrombo-embolic complication. In the Netherlands, the guideline "antithrombotic therapy" has recently been updated. This guideline has partially been based upon the 9th edition of the ACCP guideline Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis. It provides recommendations how to deal with VKA in the preoperative phase. The risk of arterial thromboembolism is defined as high when the risk is > 10% per year; for a venous thrombo-embolism it is a monthly risk of > 10%. Patients at high risk of a thrombo-embolic event, such as a patient with a mechanical heart valve prosthesis in the mitral position, have to be bridged after the preoperative discontinuation of the VKA with therapeutic doses of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) or heparin in order to minimize the risk of a thromboembolic event. However, this strategy has recently been questioned, because bridging with LMWH results in an increased risk of perioperative bleedingand the efficacy of bridging with LMWH in patients using VKA because of atrial fibrillation was doubted in the 'BRIDGE-trial'

### Antithrombotic therapy after heart valve intervention: review of mechanisms, evidence and current guidance [^116eXJnx]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

As the population ages and treatment options for heart valve disease increase, the number of patients with intracardiac valve prostheses is growing rapidly. Although all devices have the potential to cause thrombus formation, the propensity depends on the type of prosthesis as well as risk of the individual patient. Mechanical valve prostheses carry the highest (and persistent) risk of thromboembolism, and these patients require anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin). Required international normalised ratio levels are dependent on the location of the valve (mitral > aortic), type of valve (ball and cage vs bilealfet vs On-X bilealfet) and rhythm. The risk of tissue (biological) prosthesis is highest soon after surgery and is dependent on individual patient risk including age, valve location (mitral > aortic), history of thromboembolic events and rhythm. In patients with no other indication for anticoagulation, there is uncertainty on the benefits of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy in patients with tissue prostheses or repaired native valves. Patients with an a priori indication for anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant can continue taking this class of drug. Patients with transcatheter aortic valve implantation devices and no additional evidence-based indication for dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation can be maintained on aspirin monotherapy. Patients undergoing transcatheter instrumentation in the mitral valve position should be anticoagulated, although there is currently no published evidence for antithrombotic management in this group of patients. Patients with thrombosed devices (commonly mitral mechanical) should preferably be treated surgically. Patients at high risk of thromboembolism (with mechanical prostheses) should undergo bridging therapy when undergoing surgery.

### Freedom from thromboembolism despite prolonged inadequate anticoagulation [^111anKJ2]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Life-long and meticulous control of anticoagulation is mandatory following mechanical valve replacement to prevent thromboembolism. Two patients who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement with third generation bi-leaflet valves and in whom therapeutic anticoagulation could not be achieved for many months postoperatively form the basis for this report. In the first patient, the target international normalised ratio (INR) of 2.5–3.5 could not be achieved until 53.5 months postoperatively despite good compliance with oral anticoagulation and INR monitoring. In the second patient, the target INR was achieved after 16.9 months of oral anticoagulation treatment and regular INR monitoring. No thromboembolism occurred in either patient; nor did any valve-related event occur. The two patients are in excellent physical health 8 and 5 years, respectively, after the procedure. This unusual phenomenon is reviewed in light of the few reported cases of patients with mechanical heart valves surviving for prolonged periods without anticoagulation.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure.

If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

Antithrombotic management

Mechanical prostheses

The standard recommended international normalized ratio (INR) for patients who have received a mechanical mitral valve replacement is 2.5–3.5. The recently published results of the PROACT trial reported that low-dose warfarin (INR 2.0–2.5) following On-X mechanical mitral valve replacement did not achieve statistical non-inferiority compared with standard INR target warfarin despite demonstrating a similar occurrence of thrombotic and bleeding events. Duraes and colleagues randomized patients to rivaroxaban-based or warfarin-based anticoagulation following mechanical aortic/mitral prosthesis implantation in a small study group, reporting comparable clinical outcomes. However, there are a lack of observational/randomized data regarding the use of direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC) following mechanical prosthesis implantation. Additionally, the PROACT Xa mechanical aortic trial, which randomized patients to apixaban or warfarin therapy, was stopped early due to the safety concerns of DOAC therapy with increased rates of thromboembolic events. Standard warfarin-based anticoagulation with a target INR of 2.5–3.5 is recommended for patients with a mechanical mitral valve prosthesis.

Bioprosthetic prostheses and valve repair

There are a current lack of randomized data concerning antithrombotic management in patients with sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation following mitral bioprosthetic prostheses implantation or surgical valve repair. Various institutions employ warfarin, DOACs, antiplatelet, or dual-antiplatelet therapies in the short-term and long-term postoperative follow-up. A 3-month antithrombotic regimen should be employed following bioprosthetic implantation or valve repair in sinus rhythm patients. Warfarin-based anticoagulation without supplemental aspirin is recommended following bioprosthetic implantation. Warfarin or aspirin alone therapy may be considered following mitral valve repair, with current retrospective data demonstrating comparable antithrombotic efficacy. A UK prospective randomized clinical trial (AFFECT) is studying antithrombotic management in patients in atrial fibrillation after surgical valve repair. Anticoagulation is recommended following TEER.

### Preparation for pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implants in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events: oral anticoagulation or bridging with intravenous heparin? A prospective randomized trial [^115Xm1oe]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study to show that OAC maintenance is as safe as bridging with i.v. heparin in the implantation/replacement of a pacemaker or ICD in patients at very high risk for thrombo-embolic events (e.g. > 50% had a mechanical prosthetic valve in the mitral position). Moreover, the maintenance of OAC in these patients reduced the hospital stay by a mean of 2.5 ± 0.7 days. This is an important finding, since shortening hospital stay will reduce admission costs importantly. Moreover, one may consider implanting pacemakers as an outpatient procedure, as is currently done in patients without OAC treatment.

A recent prospective observational studyhas analysed the risk of complete interruption of warfarin therapy in a large series of patients who underwent minor interventions. A brief periprocedural interruption of OAC was associated with a low risk of thrombo-embolism and haemorrhage. However, the population included in this study was a heterogeneous group of patients with widely differing thrombo-embolic risk among them. Our study included only patients with high thrombo-embolic risk; > 50% of the population included in our study had a mechanical prosthetic valve and ∼40% had a previous embolic event. Current guidelinesrecommend peri-operative bridging therapy with heparin in this group of patients.

Bioprosthetic valve thromboembolism risk and early postoperative considerations: "The risk of thromboembolism is approximately 0.7% per year in patients with biological valves in sinus rhythm", and mitral prostheses have higher rates than aortic prostheses "(2.4% per patient-year versus 1.9% per patient-year)". In bioprosthetic aortic valves in sinus rhythm without other indications, "the incidence of thromboembolic events, bleeding, and death was similar" between aspirin and VKA groups. Many patients "will not require lifelong anticoagulation in the absence of an independent indication, such as AF", yet there is "an increased risk of ischemic stroke early after operation, particularly in the first 90 to 180 days after either bioprosthetic AVR or mitral valve replacement". Early anticoagulation is intended "to decrease the risk of thromboembolism until the prosthetic valve is fully endothelialized". A meta-analysis "comprising approximately 2500 patients" suggested single-agent therapy had fewer "30-day deaths and less major bleeding" than dual-agent therapy.

### Drug insight: an overview of current anticoagulation therapy after heart valve replacement [^117Lut5Y]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are the gold standard approach for the long-term anticoagulant therapy of patients with mechanical heart valves. Management decisions are, however, based predominantly on expert consensus and on data from nonrandomized, follow-up studies, which have inherent limitations in their methods. Low-intensity anticoagulation therapy provides protection against thromboembolic complications in patients with most types of modern prosthetic heart valve. The addition of low-dose aspirin is safe if international normalized ratio values below 3.5 are maintained. A combined regimen should be considered in high-risk patients and those with coexistent coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease, and in patients who have suffered a thromboembolic event despite a therapeutic international normalized ratio. Thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparins is restricted to specific situations, such as when a patient is intolerant to vitamin K antagonists, when surgical procedures require discontinuation of oral anticoagulation, or when the patient is pregnant. A lack of uniformity across practice guidelines make it difficult to reach treatment decisions. Each patient's preference, expressed after counseling about the risks and benefits of each treatment strategy, and an individual assessment of the patient's risk factors, should guide treatment decisions. At present, new anticoagulant agents such as factor Xa inhibitors do not represent a treatment option for heart valve recipients.

### Postoperative low molecular weight heparin bridging treatment for patients at high risk of arterial thromboembolism (PERIOP2): double blind randomised controlled trial [^115NMEks]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Uncertainty remains as to whether patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves who require interruption of vitamin K antagonists for invasive procedures benefit from bridging with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after the procedure. Many published and diverse protocols and guidelines have sought to address this common clinical problem, and the concern has always been that these patients are at high risk of thrombotic complications caused by a procoagulable state while off vitamin K antagonists.

In the typical bridging strategy, warfarin is held for four or five days before the procedure and is resumed after the procedure, on the same day or one or two days later.LMWH is given once or twice a day at a therapeutic dose for three to five days before the procedure and for a minimum of four days after the procedure until the international normalised ratio (INR) is therapeutic. The goal of bridging with LMWH is to reduce the risk of perioperative thromboembolism by minimising the time without anticoagulation while reducing bleeding risks with a short acting anticoagulant that allows for minimal or no anticoagulant effect at the time of interruption.

Bridging has been most studied in patients with atrial fibrillation in several observational or single armed studies. A recently completed double blind placebo controlled trial suggested that LMWH bridging is not necessary before or after the procedure for patients on warfarin. However, patients with mechanical heart valves were usually excluded from such studies and patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke were not well represented. In a previous single arm, multicentre pilot study of dalteparin bridging given once daily to 224 patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves, we found that the rate of thrombosis after the procedure was 3.1%; 75% of the events occurred in patients who had anticoagulation held due to a bleeding event after the procedure. These findings suggest that bridging after the procedure caused harm potentially because of a longer period without anticoagulation due to bleeding, which then led to thrombotic events.

Based on this information we performed a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the necessity of postoperative bridging with the LMWH dalteparin in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic mechanical valves who required warfarin to be held for a procedure. We hypothesised that patients who would receive placebo after the procedure would have fewer bleeding events and a lower rate of thromboembolism because of the association of thromboembolism with bleeding in our pilot study. We chose to only study the LMWH dose after the procedure because the dose before the procedure was unlikely to be causing harm and might be of benefit.

(3) Surgical strategies for rheumatic mitral valve

Common pathological changes in rheumatic mitral stenosis include commissural fusion, tendon fusion and shortening, leaflet thickening, and fusion. Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC) is recommended by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association as an intervention for rheumatic mitral stenosis, but appropriate surgical procedures must still be chosen when contraindications such as valve calcification and mitral regurgitation are present. Mitral valve replacement (MVR) and mitral valve repair (MVP) are the most widely used and effective surgical methods for rheumatic mitral stenosis. Major complications associated with mechanical valve replacement include thrombosis, thromboembolism, and bleeding, which require long-term anticoagulation after surgery with regular monitoring of the INR. For special populations such as young pregnant women, anticoagulant therapy after MVR surgery is susceptible to the effects of maternal stroke and adverse fetal outcomes. Additionally, there is controversy surrounding the optimal starting dose and duration of postoperative anticoagulation. The American College of Chest Physicians recommends an initial dose of 5–10 mg/day for individuals requiring long-term anticoagulation. However, when the dosage exceeds 5 mg, most patients surpass the upper limit of the therapeutic range, potentially leading to inconsistent anticoagulation therapy and increasing the risk of bleeding and delayed INR response. Many clinical practices thus favour using lower-dose warfarin. A prospective, single-blind, RCT conducted in the United States compared the time to achieve target INR, time within the therapeutic range, and occurrence of bleeding/thromboembolic events between post-MVR patients who received an initial warfarin dose of 5 mg or 3 mg. The results indicated that in post-MVR patients, the time to achieve target INR was shorter with an initial dose of 5 mg than with 3 mg, and the use of 5 mg warfarin as an initial dose significantly reduced the cost of bridging with enoxaparin, while bleeding events were comparable. A Canadian study also confirmed these findings. Further profound research on the initial dose and duration of anticoagulation therapy after MVR is necessary to guide clinical practice. In addition, the mismatch between mechanical valves and patients raises the risk of patient mortality. Improving the compatibility between mechanical valves and the body is also a challenging area of research. Biological heart valves are costly and prone to early degeneration. For young women of childbearing age, there is a significantly higher likelihood of requiring early reoperation.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1158iCqD]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease — planned interruption of VKA and bridging — When interruption of oral VKA therapy is deemed necessary, the agent is usually stopped 3 to 4 days before the procedure and restarted postoperatively as soon as bleeding risk allows; bridging with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is started when the INR falls below the therapeutic threshold (ie, 2.0 or 2.5), usually 36 to 48 hours before surgery, and is stopped 4 to 6 hours (intravenous UFH) or 12 hours (subcutaneous LMWH) before the procedure. There are no randomized comparative-effectiveness trials in adequate numbers of prosthetic heart valve patients, evidence derives mostly from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups, and in other patient groups bridging therapy exposes patients to higher bleeding risks without reducing thromboembolism; accordingly, decisions about bridging should be individualized and account for the tradeoffs between thrombosis and bleeding.

### Heparin bridge is associated with more post-polypectomy bleeding and emergency department visits among anticoagulated patients [^114T7r5H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Many risk factors have been associated with post-polypectomy bleeding, including age greater than 75 years, polyp size greater than 1 cm, location and morphology of the polyp, resection technique, and notably anticoagulation, with a 3- to 5-fold greater incidence of procedure-related bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants. Rates of thromboembolic events in the setting of temporary cessation of anticoagulation for endoscopy have been reported to be as high as 3%, with an absolute risk of 1% for patients who interrupt anticoagulation for ≤ 5 days. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians regarding anticoagulation management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in the periprocedural period recommend considering stopping vitamin K antagonists, based on the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding, and assessing CHADS 2 scores to determine the need for bridge therapy.

Current guidelines from both the European and American Gastroenterology Associations regarding the management of anticoagulation and the use of bridge therapy, specifically in high-risk patients undergoing endoscopy, are largely based on low-quality evidence and expert opinion. The guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy classify colonoscopy with polypectomy as a high-risk procedure for post-procedural bleeding, and suggest that pre-procedural bridge therapy should be used for patients on warfarin who are at high risk for thromboembolic events. These high-risk patients include those with atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis, patients with a prosthetic metal heart valve in the mitral position, a prosthetic heart valve and atrial fibrillation, and patients within 3 months of a venous thromboembolism. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy specifically recommends bridge therapy for high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation on warfarin who have mechanical valves, a history of a stroke, and a CHADS 2 score ≥ 2. The Society also recommends bridge therapy for patients with a mechanical aortic valve, any thromboembolic risk factor, and older-generation and mechanical mitral valve replacements in those with valvular heart disease. However, these societal guidelines from experts are based on very limited data. Previously published studies have compared bridge therapy to temporary cessation of anticoagulation with regard to post-polypectomy bleeding; however, they generally comprised small numbers of patients, while in one of them important thromboembolic event outcomes were not reported.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valve replacement or repair [^1121LdAB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In patients with AF, DOACs are associated with similar mortality in patients with surgical and transcatheter bioprosthetic valve replacement, and reduced mortality in those with surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair. Major bleeding was less with DOACs in both bioprosthetic valve replacement and valve repair cohorts. Ischemic stroke was higher with DOACs in patients with bioprosthetic valve replacement, but less in patients with valve repair, compared with warfarin. These rather novel findings call for future randomized controlled trials to determine the best anticoagulation strategy in patients with AF and concomitant valve disease.

### Antithrombotic medication use after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement in the VHA system… [^111fhh7V]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance These data demonstrate that bAVR procedures are increasingly being performed in VHA facilities and that aspirin only was the most commonly used antithrombotic medication strategy after bAVR. The risk-adjusted results suggest that the combination of aspirin plus warfarin does not improve either all-cause mortality or thromboembolism risk but increases the risk of bleeding events compared with aspirin only. As in the fully adjusted model, the sensitivity analyses found that the combination of aspirin plus warfarin was associated with a higher risk of bleeding at 90 days and at 180 days.

In the main analysis, the risk of any adverse event was higher in the group receiving aspirin plus warfarin, but this finding was not statistically significant; however, in the sensitivity analyses, the proportional hazard for the outcome of any adverse event was statistically significant at 90 days and at 180 days. All-cause mortality was lower in our VHA cohort vs that reported by Brennan et al6 for aspirin plus warfarin, aspirin only, and warfarin only. These findings differ from those by Brennan et al, who reported a lower risk of death and thromboembolism but a higher risk of bleeding for patients taking aspirin plus warfarin compared with patients taking aspirin only. Our results have been shared with VHA leadership to ensure that VHA practitioners are aware of these findings.

These data demonstrate that bAVR procedures are increasingly being performed in VHA facilities. Aspirin only was the most commonly used antithrombotic medication strategy after bAVR. The risk adjustment models suggest that the combination of aspirin plus warfarin does not improve either all-cause mortality or thromboembolism risk but increases the risk of bleeding events compared with aspirin only.

### Late incidence and determinants of stroke after aortic and mitral valve replacement [^1114pYXF]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is a devastating complication in patients with prosthetic valves, but characterization of its late occurrence from a large cohort is lacking.

Methods

Three thousand one hundred eighty-nine adult patients who underwent a total of 3,576 operations for left-heart valve replacement were managed with contemporary anticoagulation guidelines and prospectively followed in a dedicated clinic. Total follow-up was 20,096 patient years. Bootstrapped survival analysis was used to determine the impact of patient and valve related factors on the incidence of stroke.

Results

Most strokes were embolic. Linearized embolic stroke rates were 1.3% ± 0.2% per year for aortic bioprostheses, 1.4% ± 0.2% per year for aortic mechanical valves, 1.3% ± 0.3% per year for mitral bioprostheses, and 2.3% ± 0.4% per year for mitral mechanical valves (p = 0.002, vs other implant types). Age more than 75 years, female gender, and smoking were independent risk factors after aortic and mitral valve replacement. Atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, and tilting-disc mechanical prostheses were independent predictors of embolic stroke after aortic valve replacement. Preoperative left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was an independent risk factor in patients with mitral prostheses. Primary operative indication, diabetes, redo status, or the presence of two prosthetic valves were not associated with an increased hazard. The addition of acetyl salicylic or dipyridamole to warfarin anticoagulation did not significantly lower embolic stroke risk in patients with mechanical prostheses.

Conclusions

Approximately 20% of patients with valve prostheses have an embolic stroke by 15 years after valve replacement. Some risk factors such as the avoidance of smoking, mitral mechanical prostheses, aortic tilting-disc valves, and proceeding to mitral surgery before LV dysfunction occurs are potentially modifiable.

### Discontinuing anticoagulant therapy in surgical patients with cardiac valve prostheses… [^1137AyBQ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Between 1962 and 1975, a total of 159 patients with previously implanted man-made cardiac valve prostheses underwent 180 subsequent noncardiac operations at Mayo Clinic. All of these patients were receiving anticoagulants. The overall incidence of their documentable thromboembolic complications was approximately 10%. None of the postoperative complications occurred while the patient was in hospital, with the earliest such complication seen two years later. Patients receiving anticoagulants on a long-term basis did, however, have a 13% incidence of various difficulties with hemostasis during and following the later operations. We conclude that there is minimal risk to patients with cardiac valve prostheses who are receiving anticoagulants when the drug regimen is stopped for one to three days preoperatively and one to seven days postoperatively.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116ncxRY]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease — bridging during interruption of oral anticoagulation in prosthetic valve patients — For bioprosthetic heart valves or annuloplasty rings receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF), it is reasonable to consider the need for bridging anticoagulant therapy around invasive procedures on the basis of the CHA2DS2-VASc score weighed against bleeding risk. For patients undergoing invasive procedures who have 1) a mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) with any thromboembolic risk factor, 2) an older-generation mechanical AVR, or 3) a mechanical mitral valve replacement, bridging anticoagulation therapy during the preoperative time interval when the international normalized ratio (INR) is subtherapeutic is reasonable on an individualized basis with risks of bleeding weighed against benefits of thromboembolism prevention.

### Direct oral anticoagulants for rheumatic Heart disease-associated atrial fibrillation post-bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement [^111zfDvc]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in preventing ischemic and thromboembolic events may be suboptimal in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. However, their safety and effectiveness after mitral valve replacement (MVR) using bioprosthetic valves is unclear.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of DOACs vs warfarin among patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD)-associated AF after bioprosthetic MVR.

Methods

We performed an observational analysis identifying patients with RHD and AF who underwent bioprosthetic MVR. Primary effectiveness and safety outcomes were ischemic events and major bleeding, respectively. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiac thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and all-cause hospitalization. Propensity score matching was performed to account for the differences in baseline characteristics and comorbidities.

Results

A total of 3,950 patients were identified; 76% were on warfarin and 24% on DOAC post-MVR. The DOAC group had a higher burden of baseline comorbidities and prior cardiovascular procedures compared with the warfarin group. The propensity score matching balanced baseline characteristics in 1,832 patients (916 in each group), with a mean age of 69 years. At the 5-year follow-up, DOACs were associated with a lower incidence of major bleeding compared with warfarin (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62–0.94), with no significant difference in ischemic events, mortality, cardiac thrombosis, myocardial infarction, or hospitalization.

Conclusions

Among patients with RHD-associated AF patients post-bioprosthetic MVR, DOACs are associated with lower major bleeding and comparable effectiveness, indicating a potential alternative to warfarin. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these findings in this population.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^113y1CQm]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C).

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for valvular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1132p6LA]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Antithrombotic therapy in valvular disease is important to mitigate thromboembolism, but the hemorrhagic risk imposed must be considered.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines. Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

In rheumatic mitral disease, we recommend vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy when the left atrial diameter is > 55 mm (Grade 2C) or when complicated by left atrial thrombus (Grade 1A). In candidates for percutaneous mitral valvotomy with left atrial thrombus, we recommend VKA therapy until thrombus resolution, and we recommend abandoning valvotomy if the thrombus fails to resolve (Grade 1A). In patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and stroke or transient ischemic attack, we recommend initial aspirin therapy (Grade 1B) and suggest substitution of VKA if recurrence (Grade 2C). In patients with cryptogenic stroke and DVT and a PFO, we recommend VKA therapy for 3 months (Grade 1B) and consideration of PFO closure (Grade 2C). We recommend against the use of anticoagulant (Grade 1C) and antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B) for native valve endocarditis. We suggest holding VKA therapy until the patient is stabilized without neurologic complications for infective endocarditis of a prosthetic valve (Grade 2C). In the first 3 months after bioprosthetic valve implantation, we recommend aspirin for aortic valves (Grade 2C), the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin if the aortic valve is transcatheter (Grade 2C), and VKA therapy with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 for mitral valves (Grade 2C). After 3 months, we suggest aspirin therapy (Grade 2C). We recommend early bridging of mechanical valve patients to VKA therapy with unfractionated heparin (DVT dosing) or low-molecular-weight heparin (Grade 2C). We recommend long-term VKA therapy for all mechanical valves (Grade 1B): target INR 2.5 for aortic (Grade 1B) and 3.0 for mitral or double valve (Grade 2C). In patients with mechanical valves at low bleeding risk, we suggest the addition of low-dose aspirin (50–100 mg/d) (Grade 1B). In valve repair patients, we suggest aspirin therapy (Grade 2C). In patients with thrombosed prosthetic valve, we recommend fibrinolysis for right-sided valves and left-sided valves with thrombus area < 0.8 cm(2) (Grade 2C). For patients with left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis and thrombus area ≥ 0.8 cm(2), we recommend early surgery (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

These antithrombotic guidelines provide recommendations based on the optimal balance of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk.

14.1 Atrial Fibrillation

In five prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 3711 patients with non-rheumatic AF, warfarin significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke (see Table 4). The risk reduction ranged from 60% to 86% in all except one trial (CAFA: 45%), which was stopped early due to published positive results from two of these trials. The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0.6% to 2.7% (see Table 4).

Trials in patients with both AF and mitral stenosis suggest a benefit from anticoagulation with warfarin sodium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

14.2 Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves

In a prospective, randomized, open-label, positive-controlled study in 254 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, the thromboembolic-free interval was found to be significantly greater in patients treated with warfarin alone compared with dipyridamole/aspirin-treated patients (p < 0.005) and pentoxifylline/aspirin-treated patients (p < 0.05). The results of this study are presented in Table 5.

In a prospective, open-label, clinical study comparing moderate (INR 2.65) versus high intensity (INR 9.0) warfarin therapies in 258 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, thromboembolism occurred with similar frequency in the two groups (4.0 and 3.7 events per 100 patient years, respectively). Major bleeding was more common in the high intensity group. The results of this study are presented in Table 6.

In a randomized trial in 210 patients comparing two intensities of warfarin therapy (INR 2.0 to 2.25 vs. INR 2.5 to 4.0) for a three-month period following tissue heart valve replacement, thromboembolism occurred with similar frequency in the two groups (major embolic events 2.0% vs. 1.9%, respectively, and minor embolic events 10.8% vs. 10.2%, respectively). Major hemorrhages occurred in 4.6% of patients in the higher intensity INR group compared to zero in the lower intensity INR group.

### Single-arm study of bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin for patients at risk of arterial embolism who require temporary interruption of warfarin [^111wtzNE]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

When warfarin is interrupted for surgery, low-molecular-weight heparin is often used as bridging therapy. However, this practice has never been evaluated in a large prospective study. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin initiated out of hospital.

Methods and Results

This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm cohort study of patients at high risk of arterial embolism (prosthetic valves and atrial fibrillation with a major risk factor). Warfarin was held for 5 days preoperatively. Low-molecular-weight heparin was given 3 days preoperatively and at least 4 days postoperatively. Patients were followed up for 3 months for thromboembolism and bleeding. Eleven Canadian tertiary care academic centers participated; 224 patients were enrolled. Eight patients (3.6%; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.9) had an episode of thromboembolism, of which 2 (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.2 to 3.2) were judged to be due to cardioembolism. Of these 8 episodes of thromboembolism, 6 occurred in patients who had warfarin deferred or withdrawn because of bleeding. There were 15 episodes of major bleeding (6.7%; 95% CI, 4.1 to 10.8): 8 occurred intraoperatively or early postoperatively before low-molecular-weight heparin was restarted, 5 occurred in the first postoperative week after low-molecular-weight heparin was restarted, and 2 occurred well after low-molecular-weight heparin was stopped. There were no deaths.

Conclusions

Bridging therapy with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is feasible; however, the optimal approach for the management of patients who require temporary interruption of warfarin to have invasive procedures is uncertain.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in patients receiving surgical mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves… [^116Romuz]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 In patients with mechanical heart valves, use of direct oral anticoagulants is currently contraindicated, and their use in patients with bioprosthetic heart valves is off-label. 1, 2 We sought to determine the current state of use of DOACs in patients with surgical prosthetic heart valves in the US and evaluate differences in preoperative and postoperative profiles among patients discharged while receiving DOACs vs warfarin. In patients undergoing mitral valve replacement with bioprosthetic heart valves, the overall use of DOACs over the study period was 5. 89%, and 26 474 receiving exclusively warfarin. Of these, patients discharged receiving DOAC were older compared with those discharged receiving warfarin, and there was a greater prevalence. Postoperative events were also higher in patients discharged receiving DOACs than for those discharged receiving warfarin, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, and 48 107 receiving exclusively warfarin. The main limitation of this study is the lack of follow-up data to compare outcomes of DOACs vs warfarin in patients with prosthetic valves. Despite this limitation, our study suggests a prevailing off-label use of DOACs in patients with prosthetic heart valves without satisfactory safety data.

Until the completion of randomized clinical trials that provide sufficient evidence for DOAC use, physicians may wish to exercise caution with regard to DOAC prescription for patients with prosthetic heart valves.

### Acute thrombosis of bioprosthetic mitral valve [^113z1ktt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

A few studies on the diagnostic characteristics and management of late bioprosthetic valve thrombosis have been reported.

Patients with bioprosthetic aortic or mitral valve replacement have high risk of thromboembolism during the first 10 days. However, within two weeks postoperatively, the occurrence of a thrombosis in bioprosthetic mitral valves is very rare.

Some precipitating factors of the thrombotic process include acting as an underlying coagulopathy, left ventricular dysfunction, low cardiac output, atrial fibrillation, large LA size, and prior history of thromboembolic events.

A few cases involving the preservation of the mitral valve apparatus as a predisposing factor for bioprosthetic valve thrombosis have been reported because a complete preservation of the mitral valve apparatus during mitral replacement may lead to an increased incidence of early bioprosthetic thrombosis, although such incidences appear to be rare. However, a complication of mitral valve replacement, such as a left ventricular rupture could be prevented by maintaining the tethering effect of the intact subvalvular apparatus. In addition, there are isolated reports of bioprosthetic thrombosis after a complete valve excision.

Incidence of thrombo-embolism associated with AF ablation is reported to be between 0% and 7%; therefore, the 2007 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement recommends a minimum period of two months of warfarin anticoagulation. Although the policy of postoperative anticoagulation are different in each heart center, it took a long time for INR to reach 2.0 on the 6th postoperative day. We should have taken care of more optimal anticoagulation. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend an administration of warfarin for three months, following bioprosthetic valve replacement (BVR). The risk is particularly high in the first few days after surgery, and many centers start UFH as soon as the risk of increased surgical bleeding is reduced (usually within 24 to 48 h) with maintenance of aPPT between 55 and 70 seconds. After an overlap of UFH and warfarin for 3 to 5 days, UFH may be discontinued when INR reaches 2.0 to 3.0.

In our case, the patient had a large LA size, and underwent posterior leaflet preservation and a mini-Maze procedure. In this case, even though multiple factors are contributed to acute bioprosthetic thrombosis, we should keep up with current anticoagulation guidelines following the BVR and radioablative Maze procedure.

Further studies are needed in order to clarify the anticoagulation strategy after BVR.

Through this case, we also realized the importance of postoperative echocardiographic surveillance in high risk groups.

Antithrombotic therapy for prosthetic valves — mechanical valves: Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation (1) applies to mechanical valves, with international normalized ratio (INR) targets of "INR goal 2.5† (1)" for mechanical AVR with no other risk factors and "INR goal 3.0 (1)" for mechanical AVR with other risk factors and for mechanical mitral valves; if antiplatelet therapy is indicated, add aspirin (ASA) "75–100 mg (2b)". If VKA therapy is interrupted for noncardiac procedures, the figure states to "minimize time with subtherapeutic INR". Bridging differs by subgroup: mechanical AVR with no other risk factors has "No bridging needed‡ (1)", while the mechanical AVR with other risk factors and mechanical mitral valve boxes state "Bridging anticoagulation during time when INR is subtherapeutic (2a)". Abbreviations are defined in the legend (ASA, INR, VKA).

Thromboembolic events with prosthetic valves — management: In patients with a mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) who experience a stroke or systemic embolic event while in therapeutic range on vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation, it is reasonable to increase the INR goal from 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) to 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) or to add daily low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg), with assessment of bleeding risk. In patients with a mechanical mitral valve replacement with an event while in therapeutic range on VKA anticoagulation, it is reasonable to increase the INR goal from 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) to 4.0 (range, 3.5–4.0) or to add daily low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg), with assessment of bleeding risk. In patients with a bioprosthetic surgical or transcatheter aortic valve or bioprosthetic mitral valve who experience a stroke or systemic embolic event while on antiplatelet therapy, VKA anticoagulation, instead of antiplatelet therapy, may be considered after assessment of bleeding risk.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — mechanical mitral valve anticoagulation reports that thromboembolism is higher with mitral than with aortic mechanical valves and is lower in mitral mechanical valve patients with a higher rather than a lower INR; in GELIA a lower INR range (2.0–3.5) was associated with a lower survival rate than a higher target INR range (2.5–4.5). In one study, patients with a target INR between 2.0 and 3.5 were within that range 74.5% of the time, whereas those with a target INR of 3.0 to 4.5 were within range only 44.5% of the time; an INR target of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) provides a reasonable balance between the risks of under- or over-anticoagulation in patients with a mechanical mitral valve.

The authors do not discuss whether or not the patient was receiving anticoagulation therapy during the postoperative period. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation therapy (classification IIa) after placement of a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic or mitral position, but this is supported by very little data. Improving our understanding of this issue should be a focus of the structural heart community.

Until a dedicated transcatheter solution to mitral valve disease in MAC can be identified, novel techniques to improve open surgical outcomes should be applauded and encouraged.

### Using warfarin after heart valve replacement… [^114fbEGD]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Induction of anticoagulation using warfarin requires regular monitoring because patient responses vary widely. A history of heart valve replacement presents a particular problem because of the presence of pacing wires that are routinely left in place for approximately five days postoperatively. Most patients start oral anticoagulant treatment 24 to 48 hours after surgery but, until the wires are removed, anticoagulation should be maintained at low levels, with an International Normalization Ratio of less than 2.
6. Ageno and Turpie conducted a retrospective review of clinical records of patients receiving early anticoagulation treatment after HVR and a control group of nonsurgical patients. Factors that might interfere with the induction phase of anticoagulation were also reviewed. Basic data about the course of oral anticoagulation treatment with warfarin were collected, along with initial serum albumin levels.

The mean daily dose was collected for the first five days of treatment, as was mean daily prothrombin time expressed as INR. All surgical patients received low-dose heparin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism. Daily doses of warfarin were compared with initial serum albumin levels, patient age and body weight. A total of 84 surgical patients and 32 non-surgical patients was included in the study. During the first five days of the study, the average daily dose of warfarin was significantly lower in the HVR group than in the nonsurgical group. The mean INR was initially higher in the HVR group than in the nonsurgical group. Patients in the HVR group achieved the therapeutic range in approximately 36 hours, compared with 53 hours in the nonsurgical group. The incidence of bleeding was similar between groups, and the INR did not appear to be related to bleeding episodes.

In addition, patients with lower-than-normal serum albumin levels also received significantly less warfarin than patients with normal levels.

Mitral bioprosthesis — early postoperative stroke risk and evidence limitations: The risk of a stroke from a mitral bioprosthetic valve in the first postoperative month has been reported to be as high as 40 events per 100 patient-years, and the direct evidence on the effects of early anticoagulation on this risk is of low quality; an observational study reported a trend toward reduced thromboembolic events with warfarin over no warfarin, but the regimen, target INR, and comparator were not clearly reported and the estimates are based on 11 events, with bleeding increasing relative to aspirin or no antithrombotic therapy.

5 CONCLUSION

We observed a reduced risk of stroke without elevated risk of bleeding, combined endpoints, or all‐cause death in patients using anticoagulants (at least 4 weeks duration) after TMVR compared to no anticoagulants. The included studies were small, which could explain the nonsignificant results for the bleeding and mortality endpoints. So the findings in this study are based on observational studies and have to be considered as hypothesis generating. A rigorous, well‐designed, large‐scale RCT is needed to further validate this finding and guide anticoagulant treatment strategies in this population.

Introduction

Background

Mitral valve repair (MVr) is the gold standard and preferred treatment for degenerative mitral regurgitation. Since MVr preserves the native mitral valve structure with minimal amount of foreign implant material, the risk of thromboembolic complications after MVr is low, with an annual risk of 0.4 to 1.6%. There is ongoing controversy regarding the optimal anti-thrombotic therapy following MVr. Major guidelines have been inconsistent with anti-thrombotic recommendations following MVr ranging from acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-only to warfarin plus ASA. Historically, warfarin for 3 months was recommended for MVr, extrapolating from the recommendation for patients receiving mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve. More recent evidence suggests that anti-coagulation after MVr may be unnecessary and lead to net harm due to risk of bleeding and burdens related to warfarin monitoring and dosage adjustments. Despite this, warfarin continues to be used in almost half of patients following MVr without other indications for anti-coagulation. Although direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) have superseded warfarin as the anti-coagulant of choice in atrial fibrillation (AF) due to their superior safety and convenience, they are not currently approved for use after MVr.

Management of anticoagulation in elective cases

Three factors that need to be considered in the case of elective surgeries are (1) when to stop, (2) whether to bridge, and (3) when to restart.

Discontinuation prior to surgery: General recommendations are summarized in the table (table 8) below and are according to the American College of Chest Physician 2012 Guidelines published in Chest, the RE-LY trial published in Circulation 2012, the ROCKET AF trial, and the manufacturer's recommendations.

Table 8
Recommendations for timing of discontinuation of anticoagulation for elective surgery

Patients whose procedures are at low risk of bleeding may continue oral anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly true for high-risk patients such as those with mechanical heart values.

Indications for bridging: The need for perioperative bridging is decided on by taking into account the patient's thromboembolism and hemorrhage risk and stratifying them into low, medium and high risk. In the case of warfarin, recommendations are summarized in the flow chart below (figure 3), adapted from the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines. Bridging may be achieved either with intravenous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Temporary interruption of vitamin K antagonism agents, without bridging while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended for patients with bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacements and no other risk factors. All other mechanical valve settings should undergo bridging.

Efficacy of bridging: Whether or not outcomes are really better with bridging patients on vitamin K antagonists remains uncertain. A meta-analysis published by Siegal et al in 2012 found that the rate of thromboembolism was equivalent in patients who underwent periprocedural heparin bridging; however, there was a significantly higher number of patients who had major bleeding complications in those undergoing heparin bridging. These results were replicated in a randomized controlled trial by Douketis et al in 2015 demonstrating non-inferiority between patients undergoing no bridging versus those with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging and a significant reduction of major bleeding complications in those patients who did not undergo bridging.

Warfarin bridge therapy approach — For atrial fibrillation (AF), when there is no associated diagnosis and CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2, no bridge is recommended; when associated with mechanical valves, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2, bridge therapy is recommended. For valvular heart disease, bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) requires no bridge, whereas mechanical AVR with any thromboembolic risk factor, older-generation mechanical AVR, or mechanical mitral valve replacement warrant bridge therapy.

Introduction

Valvular heart disease is a common cardiovascular condition, comprising more than 10% of all cardiac surgical procedures in the United States. According to the 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline, prosthetic valve replacement is recommended when symptoms develop or valve repair is inappropriate. Tissue or mechanical valves can be used for heart valve replacement. For both mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), mechanical valves have resulted in a long-term mortality benefit in young patients due to the considerably lower reoperation risk compared with tissue valves. Patients who receive mechanical valve replacement surgery must take anticoagulants for the rest of their lives, mostly warfarin.

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are considered an alternative to warfarin in mechanical valve replacement. So far, 2 randomized clinical trials have compared NOAC and warfarin, ie, the Randomized Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients after Heart Valve Replacement (RE-ALIGN) and the Rivaroxaban vs Warfarin in Patients With Metallic Prosthesis (RIWA) studies. The RE-ALIGN study found that dabigatran was not as effective as warfarin at the tested dose for thromboembolic event prevention after mechanical valve replacement, and furthermore, it had a higher bleeding risk. However, it has some limitations, such as an inadequate trough plasma level and different mechanism from other NOACs. In the RIWA study, 15 mg of rivaroxaban twice daily exhibited similar numbers of bleeding and thromboembolic events compared with warfarin. However, contrary to the aforementioned study, thrombolyticand even fataloutcomes have been described. Furthermore, apixaban demonstrated comparable efficacy in preclinical AVR models. Further investigations are warranted; however, warfarin remains the first-choice anticoagulant after mechanical valve surgery.
