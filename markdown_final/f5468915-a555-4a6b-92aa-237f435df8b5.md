## Question

What causes elevated creatinine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of elevated serum creatinine and how to interpret it in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental physiology linking creatinine generation, filtration, secretion, and measurement. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies into prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes, and add pseudo-elevations. Next, I will review non-GFR determinants and transient factors. After that, I need to check guideline-based diagnostic thresholds and the limits of creatinine as a biomarker. Finally, I will integrate clinical context, propose a practical workup, and close with a synthesized, hierarchical framework for interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the basic physiology, because if I misstate the fundamentals, everything downstream gets shaky. Creatinine is a byproduct of creatine and phosphocreatine metabolism, produced at a relatively constant rate proportional to muscle mass, filtered at the glomerulus, and secreted by renal tubular transporters, so any reduction in GFR or inhibition of secretion will raise serum creatinine; steady-state assumptions matter, and changes lag by up to 24–48 hours after a new insult, which is a key pitfall in acute settings [^117H2XCL] [^113TefBz] [^113JB182].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the major etiologic buckets before drilling down. The classic framework is prerenal azotemia from hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal parenchymal injury, and postrenal obstruction, and I will add a fourth category of pseudo-elevations where creatinine rises without true GFR decline, because missing these leads to misdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions [^117E4SRg] [^111NmB7g] [^116ZMMaE].

> I will now examine prerenal causes, since they are common and often reversible. Volume depletion, heart failure, cirrhosis, sepsis, and NSAIDs reduce renal perfusion and GFR, producing a rise in creatinine; importantly, ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause a predictable, hemodynamic, and often acceptable early increase in creatinine by reducing efferent arteriolar tone, and current guidance cautions against reflexively stopping therapy for modest rises, especially if there is no volume depletion or hyperkalemia, and if the indication is strong [^111NmB7g] [^113YNnPu] [^113tVgEZ].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing of ACEi/ARB-associated creatinine changes, because I initially thought a 30% rise was uniformly a red flag. That is too simplistic. In patients with CKD, an early 20–30% increase can occur within 1–2 weeks and may stabilize, reflecting beneficial hemodynamic effects rather than structural injury, whereas larger or progressive increases warrant reassessment for bilateral renal artery stenosis, volume depletion, or other contributors; real-world data show a dose–response relationship between creatinine increases and long-term adverse outcomes, but this identifies high-risk patients rather than mandating automatic discontinuation without context [^1161tg2e] [^114UVwm5] [^113YNnPu].

> Next, I should review intrinsic renal causes, and I need to ensure I separate tubular, glomerular, and interstitial processes. Acute tubular necrosis from ischemia or nephrotoxins, glomerulonephritides and vasculitides, and acute interstitial nephritis from drugs are prototypical, and they often carry urine sediment abnormalities and other biomarker signals; importantly, even small creatinine rises in these settings portend worse outcomes, underscoring the need for early recognition and etiologic workup [^111NmB7g] [^113aLH8Z] [^114QCpNE].

> Let me consider postrenal obstruction carefully, because missing it delays definitive therapy. Benign prostatic hypertrophy, malignancy, stones, and neurogenic bladder can acutely reduce GFR and raise creatinine; bedside ultrasound can detect hydronephrosis, but I should double-check that hydronephrosis does not always correlate with creatinine elevation, so a negative scan does not exclude early or partial obstruction, and clinical suspicion should guide further imaging and urologic consultation [^117E4SRg] [^115ori1Z].

> I will now examine pseudo-elevations, because these are frequent and avoidable errors. Drugs can inhibit tubular secretion of creatinine via OCT2/MATE transporters without reducing GFR, including trimethoprim, cimetidine, dolutegravir, cobicistat, and some tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Assay interferences, especially with Jaffe methods, can spuriously elevate creatinine in the presence of nitromethane, ketoacids, bilirubin, or highly colored drugs like eltrombopag. And increased generation from high meat intake, creatine supplements, or rhabdomyolysis can raise measured creatinine independent of filtration, so I should confirm with enzymatic assays, cystatin C, or clinical correlation before labeling AKI [^116Uc1st] [^11574UKj] [^113NWAqR] [^112D5rKB] [^111wfonE] [^113vW8Xu].

> But wait, what if the patient has fluctuating muscle mass, low protein intake, or is pregnant? I need to check for non-GFR determinants that bias creatinine. Age, sex, race, and sarcopenia lower creatinine generation, masking CKD, whereas high muscle mass, anabolic steroid use, or trauma can raise it. Pregnancy and liver disease can also alter creatinine metabolism, so I should interpret values in the context of body composition and clinical state to avoid misclassification [^113JKcU3] [^113NWAqR] [^113JB182].

> Next, I should review diagnostic thresholds and the limitations of creatinine-based definitions, and I need to ensure I cite the right criteria. KDIGO defines AKI as a rise in creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days, but creatinine is insensitive early on, urine output adds prognostic value, and baseline is often unknown in practice; small creatinine changes are associated with worse outcomes, yet they may reflect non-GFR factors, so serial measurements and clinical context are essential to avoid over- or under-calling AKI [^111WXxDd] [^114QCpNE] [^113oe6hz].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize the workup so it is actionable. History should focus on volume status, heart failure, liver disease, nephrotoxins, and new medications. Exam should assess volume, rash, and bladder distension. Labs should include urinalysis with microscopy, electrolytes, BUN, and a careful BUN:creatinine ratio. Imaging with renal ultrasound is indicated when obstruction is possible. And in complex or severe cases, I should consider cystatin C, early biomarkers, or formal GFR measurement to clarify true function and guide management [^111NmB7g] [^117E4SRg] [^113gSKbC].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchical framework to ensure nothing is missed. Elevated creatinine arises from reduced GFR due to prerenal hypoperfusion, intrinsic parenchymal injury, or postrenal obstruction. It can also arise from increased generation or impaired secretion without GFR change. Alternatively, it may result from assay interference and other artifacts. Distinguishing these requires integrating the trajectory of change, the clinical context, and targeted confirmatory testing, and it avoids the trap of equating any creatinine rise with structural kidney injury [^111NmB7g] [^116ZMMaE] [^113JB182].

> Finally, I should double-check the key clinical takeaways so the reasoning is practical. Even modest creatinine increases can signal risk, but not all are harmful; ACEi/ARB-related early rises are often acceptable when hemodynamically mediated and indication-driven; pseudo-AKI from drugs or assays is common and preventable with method awareness; and a structured, etiology-focused approach prevents misdiagnosis and ensures timely, appropriate intervention rather than reflexive drug withdrawal or unnecessary procedures [^113YNnPu] [^116ZMMaE] [^111NmB7g].

Elevated creatinine reflects **reduced GFR from AKI, CKD, or prerenal azotemia** [^111NmB7g] and can also be spurious from **assay interference or high muscle load** [^113NWAqR]. Common causes include **volume depletion, heart failure, sepsis, nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, ACEi/ARB, contrast, aminoglycosides)** [^111NmB7g], obstruction, rhabdomyolysis [^113vW8Xu], and CKD progression [^113qXCvM]. Evaluation should confirm true elevation, assess chronicity, and identify the cause using history, exam, urinalysis, electrolytes, and imaging [^113gSKbC]; **management targets the underlying etiology** and avoids nephrotoxins [^111NmB7g].

---

## Physiological basis of creatinine elevation

Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism eliminated by **glomerular filtration and tubular secretion** [^116Uc1st]; thus, elevated serum creatinine reflects reduced GFR or increased production. True GFR decline is the **primary cause of sustained elevation**, whereas increased production or assay interference can cause spurious rises [^116ZMMaE].

---

## Classification of causes

Elevated creatinine can be categorized as **prerenal, intrinsic renal, postrenal, or spurious**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Prerenal | - Volume depletion <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - ACE inhibitors/ARBs <br/> - Hepatorenal syndrome [^117E4SRg] [^114NHJsm] |
| Intrinsic renal | - Acute tubular necrosis <br/> - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Interstitial nephritis <br/> - Rhabdomyolysis <br/> - CKD progression [^1133HscU] [^113vW8Xu] |
| Postrenal | - Urinary obstruction (BPH, stones, tumors, neurogenic bladder) [^111NmB7g] |
| Spurious | - Assay interference (Jaffe method) <br/> - High muscle mass <br/> - Creatine supplements <br/> - Cimetidine/trimethoprim [^113NWAqR] [^111wfonE] [^113JB182] |

---

## Common clinical scenarios

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Sudden rises from prerenal azotemia, ATN, or obstruction [^117E4SRg].
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Progressive GFR decline from diabetes, hypertension, or glomerular disease [^notfound].
- **Drug-induced nephrotoxicity**: NSAIDs, ACEi/ARB, contrast, aminoglycosides [^114NHJsm].
- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Massive creatinine release from muscle breakdown [^113NWAqR].
- **Urinary obstruction**: BPH, stones, tumors, neurogenic bladder [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential to **confirm true elevation, assess chronicity, and identify the cause**:

- **Confirm true elevation**: Repeat creatinine, review trends, and exclude assay interference [^113qXCvM].
- **History and examination**: Volume status, heart failure, nephrotoxin exposure, obstruction symptoms [^111NmB7g].
- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis, electrolytes, BUN, eGFR, creatine kinase, autoimmune panels [^117E4SRg].
- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound for obstruction or structural disease [^111NmB7g].

---

## Clinical significance and management

Elevated creatinine signals increased risk of **mortality, cardiovascular events, and CKD progression** [^111NmB7g]. Management focuses on the underlying cause: treat prerenal factors, stop nephrotoxins, manage obstruction, and provide supportive care (fluids, electrolytes, dialysis when indicated) [^111NmB7g]. Even small creatinine rises are prognostically important and warrant close monitoring and risk stratification [^114QCpNE].

---

Elevated creatinine reflects reduced GFR from AKI, CKD, or prerenal azotemia, and can be spurious; **evaluation should confirm the rise, determine chronicity, and identify the cause**, with management tailored to the etiology and risk profile.

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^112oXrdR]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

There were 135,052 patients with both unique NHS number and a SCr request from primary care identified between 1st of February 2009 and 31st July 2009, the study recruitment period; 24,019 people were then excluded because they were either under the age of 18, or they had an emergency admission during either the study recruitment period they were already on RRT, or the 24 months follow up period. The remaining 111,033 patients were identified using the NHS number on the hospital data warehouse to ascertain date of death and co-morbidity. Of these, 61,443 had a valid SCr that could be used as a baseline. A further 11 patients had to be removed as the data could not be validated, leaving the study population as 61,432. This process is shown in a data flow diagram (Figure 1). The patient cohort was then split into two study groups; people with and without acute elevations in SCr. Those with acute elevations were then defined and stratified according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network SCr criteria. People who had emergency (non-elective admissions) during the study period were excluded and formed a cohort for a separate study.

Figure 1
Derivation of the study population. This diagram shows the derivation of the study population with the numbers of patients remaining at each level exclusion criteria.

The AKIN criteria require a baseline SCr within 48 hours of the index value, however in primary care blood tests are seldom repeated this frequently, for that reason the lowest SCr in the twelve months prior to the index value was used as the baseline. This method has been previously described by LaFrance and Miller. If an individual with a raised SCr had multiple blood tests during the study recruitment period the highest SCr was used. In those people not fulfilling AKIN criteria the date of the first SCr in the recruitment period was used as the incident creatinine for subsequent follow up. For descriptive purposes those not fulfilling AKIN criteria were referred to as "no AKI", and those fulfilling AKIN criteria as "AKI 1", "AKI 2" and "AKI 3" (Table 1).

### Renal insufficiency as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in elderly individuals [^116LeeCb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between elevated creatinine levels and cardiovascular events.

Background

End-stage renal disease is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The association of mild to moderate renal insufficiency with cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective population-based study of subjects, aged > 65 years, who had a serum creatinine measured at baseline (n = 5,808) and were followed for a median of 7.3 years. Proportional hazards models were used to examine the association of creatinine to all-cause mortality and incident cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Renal insufficiency was defined as a creatinine level ≥ 1.5 mg/dl in men or ≥ 1.3 mg/dl in women.

Results

An elevated creatinine level was present in 648 (11.2%) participants. Subjects with elevated creatinine had higher overall (76.7 vs. 29.5/1,000 years, p < 0.001) and cardiovascular (35.8 vs. 13.0/1,000 years, p < 0.001) mortality than those with normal creatinine levels. They were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (54.0 vs. 31.8/1,000 years, p < 0.001), stroke (21.1 vs. 11.9/1,000 years, p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (38.7 vs. 17/1,000 years, p < 0.001), and symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (10.6 vs. 3.5/1,000 years, p < 0.001). After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical disease measures, elevated creatinine remained a significant predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), claudication, and congestive heart failure (CHF). A linear increase in risk was observed with increasing creatinine.

Conclusions

Elevated creatinine levels are common in older adults and are associated with increased risk of mortality, CVD, and CHF. The increased risk is apparent early in renal disease.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^111MKuJi]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly prescribed drugs for hypertension, heart failure, diabetic microalbuminuria, and proteinuric renal disease and after myocardial infarction. Patients may, however, have a sudden decline in kidney function after starting to take these drugs, owing to antagonism of angiotensin II mediated efferent arteriolar constriction. Despite unambiguous recommendations to detect sudden renal impairment by monitoring serum creatinine before and after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment and to discontinue treatment if creatinine concentrations increase by 30% or more, recent data show that only 10% of patients receive the recommended monitoring and only 20% of those with a creatinine increase of 30% or more after starting ACEI/ARB treatment discontinue the drugs.

Clinical trial data has indicated that ACEI/ARB induced renal impairment is uncommon. Patients seen in routine clinical practice are, however, on average older and have more comorbidity than those eligible for trials. As a consequence, the absolute risk of increases in creatinine of 30% or more in the community setting is not negligible. Although this level of creatinine increase after starting ACEI/ARB treatment raises concern about the long term balance of risks and benefits, smaller increases (< 30%) do not prompt consideration of treatment discontinuation according to current guidelines. The rationale for the 30% threshold in the context of adverse clinical outcomes is unclear, as little evidence is available on the actual risks associated with creatinine increases of less than 30%.

Considering the high prevalence of ACEI/ARB use in general practice, any additional previously unrecognised risks would have major clinical and public health implications. We therefore used real world data to examine the cardiorenal risks associated with different levels of increase in creatinine after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment.

### Kocher-debr é-semelaigne syndrome with rhabdomyolysis and increased creatinine [^112D5qm3]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Association of Kocher-Debré-Semelaigne syndrome-a myopathy of hypothyroidism in childhood characterized by muscular hypertrophy, with rhabdomyolysis is very rare. We present a case of Kocher-Debré-Semelaigne syndrome with rhabdomyolysis secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. He had muscular symptoms simulating poly/dermatomyositis, massively elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and high creatinine levels. All of the findings reversed on treatment of hypothyroidism. The response to the therapy strongly suggested that Kocher-Debré-Semelaigne (KDS) syndrome was the underlying etiology. Serum thyroid- stimulating hormone levels should be routinely determined in all patients with muscular symptoms and/or elevation of CK and creatinine, keeping KDS syndrome in mind.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113YNnPu]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockade — elevation in serum creatinine (up to 30% from baseline) with RAS blockers must not be confused with AKI, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be discontinued for increases in serum creatinine (< 30%) in the absence of volume depletion; prior concerns that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may promote AKI have not been confirmed in randomized controlled trials, and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) do not increase the risk of AKI when used to slow kidney disease progression.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^111WXxDd]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of AKI

The diagnosis of AKI is traditionally based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output. The definition has evolved from the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage (RIFLE) criteria in 2004 to the AKI Network (AKIN) classification in 2007. In 2012, both were merged resulting in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Accordingly, AKI is diagnosed if serum creatinine increases by 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) or more in 48 h or rises to at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days (Table 1). AKI stages are defined by the maximum change of either serum creatinine or urine output. The importance of both criteria was confirmed in a recent study in > 32,000 critically ill patients which showed that short- and long-term risk of death or renal replacement therapy (RRT) were greatest when patients met both criteria for AKI and when these abnormalities persisted for longer than 3 days.

Table 1
KDIGO definition and classification of AKI

AKI acute kidney injury, GFR glomerular filtration rate, KDIGO Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, RRT renal replacement therapy

Several studies in various different patient populations have confirmed an association between stages of AKI and short- and long-term outcomes. However, serum creatinine and urine output are markers of excretory function only and do not provide any information about any other roles of the kidney, i.e. metabolic, endocrine, or immunological functions. They are also not kidney specific and need to be interpreted within the clinical context. Some patients fulfil the AKI definition but do not have AKI, and there are also patients with clear evidence of renal injury who do not meet the creatinine or urine criteria for AKI (Table 2).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^111vnjzT]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Critical question 1 — Screening for target organ injury in ED patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure: Level A recommendations and Level B recommendations are none specified. Level C recommendations state that in ED patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure, routine screening for acute target organ injury (eg, serum creatinine, urinalysis, ECG) is not required, and in select patient populations (eg, poor follow-up), screening for an elevated serum creatinine level may identify kidney injury that affects disposition (eg, hospital admission).

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

### ACE inhibitor use and elevated creatinine levels… [^117AcskU]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

1 and editorial 2 on hypertension in patients with diabetes in American Family Physician. However, the editorial 2 by Dr. Bakris surprised me in its facile diagnosis and treatment recommendation of a rise in serum creatinine level after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Bakris states: "the most common cause of a rise in creatinine level is volume depletion. Rehydrating the patient with a fluid that contains salt, such as bouillon, will markedly reduce the creatinine level while the patient is taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker". A recent review 3 indicated that in patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure, a disruption in normal autoregulatory pathways blunts the "ability of the preglomerular circulation to dilate in response to a drop in the mean arterial pressure" causing "an exaggerated decrease in intraglomerular pressure" and an accumulation in creatinine.

In patients who do not have any particular acute conditions or a rise in creatinine of greater than 30 percent, the author recommends continuing ACE inhibitor therapy and following laboratory values closely to ensure that the creatinine stabilizes at the higher value, with the expectation that this initial decline in renal function will improve with long-term control of blood pressure. This is seen commonly in patients who are in nursing homes and in patients over 70 years of age who do not maintain adequate hydration. It is a method of rehydration without hospitalization to receive intravenous normal saline. The point of the comment is that people are denied agents that block the renin angiotensin system because of the perception that they have worsening renal function, when long-term outcome studies support just the opposite.

It also is true that not everyone who has a rise in creatinine levels while taking an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker has bilateral renal artery stenosis. This was in response to the editorial 2 that accompanied our article. While not wanting to speak for Dr. Bakris, we suspect that he is recommending this therapy as a short-term intervention in a patient who is volume depleted, not as a long-term treatment for elevation in the level of creatinine. A slight increase in creatinine is not unusual and usually has no clinically adverse significance as noted in the review article 3 cited by Dr. Steinberg. That article recommends continuing the ACE inhibitor in the presence of mild elevations in the level of creatinine. We agree with that recommendation and believe that acute volume depletion should be corrected.

### Co-ingestion of methanol and nitromethane: using falsely elevated creatinine as indicator for methanol antidote use [^114wYXM1]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of co-ingestion of methanol and nitromethane in a child in order to heighten the awareness of false elevation of serum creatinine from nitromethane ingestion.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit.

Patient

A 4-yr-old previously healthy girl ingested an unknown quantity of "Blue Thunder" model-engine fuel, which consisted of methanol and nitromethane. The patient was treated with fomepizole for methanol ingestion using elevated creatinine level as a reason for treatment.

Results

The patient was asymptomatic but her creatinine level increased ten-fold (from 0.4 mg/dL to 4 mg/dL) within 6 hrs. Blood urea nitrogen, anion gap, and osmolar gap remained within normal limits. When the serum creatinine level was measured with enzymatic method instead of Jaffe's method, a normal creatinine level was obtained. The falsely elevated creatinine level was due to nitromethane.

Conclusion

The falsely elevated serum creatinine levels due to nitromethane ingestion can lead to unnecessary therapeutic interventions. We intend to heighten awareness of this potential misstep by reporting this case.

### Prediction of fluoroquinolone-induced elevation in serum creatinine levels: a case of drug-endogenous substance interaction involving the inhibition of renal secretion [^113vrbMB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the mechanism underlying the elevation in serum creatinine levels caused by a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone antibacterial agent, DX-619, in healthy subjects. hOCT2 showed a prominent uptake of creatinine (K(m) = 56.4 mmol/l) among renal organic ion transporters. DX-619 is a potent inhibitor of hOCT2 (K(i) = 0.94 micromol/l), hMATE1 (0.82 µmol/l), and hMATE2-K (0.10 micromol/l). The pharmacokinetic model involving the inhibition of hOCT2 (model 1), hOCT2, and MATE1 or MATE2-K (model 2) could predict the elevation in serum creatinine levels in individual subjects receiving DX-619. This assumes that a significant contribution of tubular secretion (59, 38, and 31%) and reabsorption ranged from 3–50, 4–30, and 5–21% in model 1, -2a (hOCT2/hMATE1), and -2b (hOCT2/hMATE2-K), respectively, for creatinine. In conclusion, DX-619, at its therapeutic dose, is able to inhibit hOCT2, hMATE1, and hMATE2-K, leading to a significant inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine and consequently to elevation of serum creatinine levels.

### The two sides of creatinine: both as bad as each other? [^113Xwwis]. Journal of Thoracic Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased serum creatinine can be caused by liver cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, fluid overload, vegetarianism, muscular dystrophy, malnutrition, pregnancy, sarcopenia, Addison's disease and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretions.

### Creatinine elevation associated with nitromethane exposure: a marker of potential methanol toxicity [^1141iCr6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Nitromethane, methanol, and oil are the common components of radio-controlled (R/C) vehicle fuels. Nitromethane can cause a false elevation of serum creatinine concentration as measured by the widely used Jaffe colorimetric method. We gathered data from our poison control system and from previously published case reports to see if a correlation exists between serum methanol concentrations and spuriously elevated serum creatinine concentrations after human exposures to R/C fuel. The California Poison Control System (CPCS) computerized database was queried for all cases of human exposure to R/C vehicle fuel reported between December 1, 2002 and December 1, 2004. Serum creatinine and methanol concentrations were recorded when available, as was the method used to determine serum creatinine. A MEDLINE search was used to obtain previously published cases of human nitromethane exposure associated with falsely elevated creatinine concentrations. During the 2-year period, serum creatinine concentrations were recorded in 7 of 26 R/C fuel exposures (all ingestions), and 6 of these were abnormal (range of 1.9–11.5 mg/dL). In this series, the higher the serum creatinine concentration measured by Jaffe method, the higher the serum methanol concentration. The MEDLINE search yielded data from six previously published case reports on this topic. The data from these case reports seem to follow the trend seen in our case series. These data suggest that a spuriously elevated serum creatinine (by Jaffe method) may have value as an early surrogate marker of methanol poisoning in those who ingest R/C fuel. Also, the degree to which the serum creatinine is elevated may indicate the severity of methanol poisoning.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^11574UKj]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy — nephrotoxic effects, elevation in serum creatinine: associated antiretrovirals are DTG, COBI, RPV, BIC (dolutegravir [DTG], cobicistat [COBI], rilpivirine [RPV], bictegravir [BIC]). Onset is "Within 1 month of starting treatment", and presentation is "Asymptomatic. These drugs decrease renal tubular secretion of creatinine, leading to an increase in serum creatinine levels without a true change in eGFR". Estimated frequency is "Common laboratory finding". Risk factors note, "In adults, baseline serum creatinine, male sex, TDF use, and possibly defined polymorphisms (UGT1A1). The risk factors in children are unknown". Prevention/monitoring states, "Monitor serum creatinine. Assess for renal dysfunction if serum creatinine increases by > 0.4 mg/dL or if increases continue over time". Management advises "No need to change therapy" and to "Reassure the patient about the benign nature of the laboratory abnormality".

### Prerenal success in chronic kidney disease [^1143fW5X]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics are commonly prescribed to patients with chronic kidney disease to reduce systemic blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin inhibitors also reduce intraglomerular pressure. The lower pressures may result in initial increases in the serum creatinine. The long-term renoprotection provided by these therapies establishes the basis for tolerating the initial increases. However, physicians are sometimes reluctant to continue these treatments when the serum creatinine increases. Several reasons for this reluctance are discussed, including the failure to distinguish between hemodynamic- and parenchymal-mediated changes in kidney function. In addition, the lack of a formal term and place in our diagnostic algorithm for increases in serum creatinine that derive from ultimately beneficial hemodynamic alterations may be a hindrance. The term "prerenal success" is proposed to describe hemodynamic alterations associated with improved prognosis and is placed in a new algorithm. Finally, recent literature describing harmful effects of increases in serum creatinine in other cohorts is reviewed; these cohorts are sufficiently different from the stable chronic kidney disease patient that the results ought not to be extrapolated.

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^1172daMY]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The association between acute elevations in SCr categorised by AKIN criteria and survival was examined. The primary outcome assessed was all cause mortality. The results were expressed as Kaplan-Meier survival curves, first unadjusted and then adjusted for age, gender, stage of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Charlson co-morbidity score. Cox regression survival analysis was then used to examine the temporal relationship between the incident creatinine and death. These results were expressed as hazard ratios.

Finally the probability of dying at 30 days and12 months was estimated using logistic regression analysis. To allow for possible confounding variables, a series of four models were fitted with varying adjustments for other variables to allow comparison between the categories

The models fitted were as follows:
Unadjusted relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death
The relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death, adjusted for age and sex only
The relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death, adjusted for age, sex, baseline CKD stage & using individual co-morbidities
The relationship between elevated serum creatinine defined by AKIN criteria and death, for age, sex, baseline CKD stage & Charlson score

There was a non-linear relationship between age and all outcomes, therefore a linear and squared term were included for age to best fit the observed relationships.

Around 22% of patients had missing comorbidity data, and thus potentially excluded from models 3 and 4. In order to retain these patients in the analysis, an additional 'missing' category was included for the Charlson score in model 4. Each of the individual comorbidities was missing for the same patients, and thus it was not possible to include an additional category for each of these. Instead it was assumed that the individual comorbidities were absent for those with missing data, and an additional variable, missing comorbidity or not, was included in the model. Since none of the patients with AIDS died within 30 days of the incident creatinine AIDS was omitted from the analysis of 30-day mortality.

The data was then re-analysed dividing patient s into 6 groups based on their AKI status, no AKI, AKIN1, AKIN1a, AKIN2, AKIN3 and AKIN3a. The aim of the all analyses was to compare between the six AKI groups. An additional variable was added to the model three and four to adjust for time between incident creatinine and baseline creatinine (models 5, 6, 7 & 8).

### Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wfonE]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that creatine supplementation is associated with a modest increase in serum creatinine levels but does not adversely affect glomerular filtration rate. These results indicate that creatine is likely safe for kidney function in healthy individuals and various clinical populations when used within standard dosing protocols. However, researchers and clinicians should interpret elevated serum creatinine levels in the context of supplementation with caution and consider more specific renal function markers for accurate assessment.

### Biological markers of acute kidney injury [^117PdxEu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

An abrupt change in serum creatinine, the most common indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI), is strongly linked to poor outcomes across multiple clinical settings. Despite endless attempts to distill the magnitude and timing of a changing serum creatinine into a standardized metric, singular focus on this traditional functional marker obligates the characterization of AKI to remain, at best, retrospective and causally noninformative. The resultant inability to meaningfully segregate critical aspects of injury such as type, onset, propagation, and recovery from ongoing decrements in renal function has hindered successful translation of promising therapeutics. Over the past decade, however, the emerging field of clinical proteomics reinvigorates hope of identifying novel plasma and urine biomarkers to characterize cause and course of kidney injury. Efforts to validate these markers for use in clinical studies now show early promise but face important obstacles including interpretive difficulties inherent in using serum creatinine as a sole comparator for diagnostic performance, a need to better evaluate the incremental performance of new markers above established clinical and biochemical predictors, a relative lack of power to sufficiently examine hard clinical end points, and a potential over-reliance on use alone of receiver operating curves for assessing biomarker utility. Here, we discuss efforts to address these barriers and further ascertain the clinical value of new markers.

1. Proposal for uniform standards for definition and classification of AKI

Definition and diagnostic criteria of AKI

For any condition, the clinician needs to know whether the disease is present and, if so, where and when the patient falls in the natural history of the disease. The former facilitates recognition whereas the latter defines time points for intervention. Unfortunately, there has been no uniformly accepted definition of AKI. Studies describe ARF or AKI based on serum creatinine changes, absolute levels of serum creatinine, changes in blood urea nitrogen or urine output, or the need for dialysis. The wide variation in definitions has made it difficult to compare information across studies and populations.

Diagnostic criteria

Recognition of AKI requires the delineation of easily measured criteria that can be widely applied. Serum creatinine levels and changes in urine output are the most commonly applied measures of renal function; however, they are each influenced by factors other than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and do not provide any information about the nature or site of kidney injury. The proposed diagnostic criteria (Table 1) were based on consideration of the following concepts:

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury

The above criteria include both an absolute and a percentage change in creatinine to accommodate variations related to age, gender, and body mass index and to reduce the need for a baseline creatinine but do require at least two creatinine values within 48 hours. The urine output criterion was included based on the predictive importance of this measure but with the awareness that urine outputs may not be measured routinely in non-intensive care unit settings. It is assumed that the diagnosis based on the urine output criterion alone will require exclusion of urinary tract obstructions that reduce urine output or of other easily reversible causes of reduced urine output. The above criteria should be used in the context of the clinical presentation and following adequate fluid resuscitation when applicable. Note: Many acute kidney diseases exist, and some (but not all) of them may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). Because diagnostic criteria are not documented, some cases of AKI may not be diagnosed. Furthermore, AKI may be superimposed on or lead to chronic kidney disease.

### Assessment and diagnosis of renal dysfunction in the ICU [^117H2XCL]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with impaired renal function is crucial in the setting of critical illness. Serum creatinine serves as the gold standard for assessing steady-state renal function, helping to define those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although these baseline creatinine values are often not available in the setting of critical illness, CKD, whether defined by serum creatinine or proteinuria, increases the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite delays in elevations following renal insults, serum creatinine remains the standard for assessing acute changes in renal function. Standardized definitions of AKI, using changes in serum creatinine and urine output, have informed the epidemiology of ICU-acquired AKI and have helped define the long-term outcomes in patients who experience AKI. A complex cyclical interplay exists between AKI and CKD, in which CKD predisposes patients to an increased risk of AKI, whereas those with AKI, regardless of baseline renal function, are more likely to suffer from post-AKI CKD. The clarification of the AKI-CKD dynamic remains a work in progress and will be aided by the implementation of novel measures of renal function. Several novel biomarkers of renal function have been proposed to augment serum creatinine in the diagnosis of AKI and CKD. These biomarkers, taken with recent clinical investigations, have laid the groundwork for the impending paradigm shift in risk stratifying and in diagnosing changes in renal function in the ICU.

Defining renal injury

Table 1 describes the terminology used to describe and define AKI throughout its course from that described by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and others.

Table 1
Defining renal injury

The definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as published by the KDIGO guidelines is outlined in Table 1, with the latest review including 'with implications for health' in an attempt to contextualize the notion that a variety of kidney functional anomalies may exist that will not have bearing on the patient's health long term. CKD has then been sub-classified based on cause, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or albuminuria category into stages 1–5.

Perhaps the most challenging area to define is that of renal recovery; however, this is of vital importance, as a consensus agreement would likely yield a framework for efficacy of assessment of novel emerging therapies. However, it is not without difficulty. Within the critical care arena some would consider renal recovery as the return of eGFR to pre-morbid baseline levels (whatever that means in the context of critical illness) whilst others may consider the absence of the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) as sufficient recovery. Studies reporting renal recovery are often ambiguous at best. There has been some attempt at the classification of renal recovery (Table 2).

Table 2
Potential definition of renal recovery

Data adapted from Schiffl and Fischer. AKI acute kidney injury, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, RRT renal replacement therapy

However, using a crude marker of renal function such as serum creatinine outside steady-state conditions has significant limitations. Serum creatinine is used as a surrogate for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during AKI in critically ill unstable patients. The GFR is rarely measured in clinical practice but equations, such as the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) and the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, estimate the GFR (eGFR) from the serum creatinine where differences in age, sex, and race are considered. However, as noted, creatinine is a biomarker for the GFR only under clinically stable conditions. In the critically ill there is a significant overestimation of the eGFR due to, for example, reduced creatinine levels due to reduced muscle bulk and creatinine generation. Several studies have compared formal measurement of the GFR and eGFR with considerable disparity observed. Most importantly, of course, is that there is a delay between renal injury and any observed rise in creatinine, which may be masked for up to 48 h.

### Can bedside ultrasound assist in determining whether serum creatinine is elevated in cases of acute urinary retention? [^115ori1Z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There are no guidelines to determine which patients with acute urinary retention (AUR) require blood testing (i.e., serum creatinine) to assess for renal failure.

Objective

To determine if hydronephrosis on bedside ultrasound correlates with an abnormal serum creatinine (Cr) level in cases of AUR.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study of subjects clinically diagnosed with AUR at two associated urban academic centers from October 2004 through August 2006. Emergency physicians completed a data form and performed a bedside ultrasound to determine the presence or absence of hydronephrosis. The data collected included suspected cause of AUR, amount of urinary output after Foley insertion, and blood test results. Follow-up was obtained by telephone and electronic medical record for 1 month. Standard statistics were employed.

Results

Among 96 enrolled subjects with AUR, 43 had a serum Cr level obtained on the initial visit, and 10 (23%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 11–36) of these had an elevated Cr (10% [95% CI 4–16] of the study cohort). The test characteristics of hydronephrosis on bedside ultrasound to detect elevation in Cr were a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 70%, 67%, 39%, and 88%, respectively.

Conclusion

In cases of AUR, the prevalence of elevated creatinine is high, and hydronephrosis based on bedside ultrasonography does not correlate with elevation in creatinine.

### Management of acute renal failure [^115vHPYG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure is present in 1 to 5 percent of patients at hospital admission and affects up to 20 percent of patients in intensive care units. The condition has prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal causes, with prerenal conditions accounting for 60 to 70 percent of cases. The cause of acute renal failure usually can be identified through an appropriate history, a physical examination, and selected laboratory tests. The initial laboratory evaluation should include urinalysis, a determination of the fractional excretion of sodium, a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio, and a basic metabolic panel. Management includes correction of fluid and electrolyte levels; avoidance of nephrotoxins; and kidney replacement therapy, when appropriate. Several recent studies support the use of acetylcysteine for the prevention of acute renal failure in patients undergoing various procedures. The relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.11 in patients undergoing radiocontrast-media procedures (absolute risk reduction: 19 percent) and 0.33 in patients undergoing coronary angiography (absolute risk reduction: 8 percent). In patients pretreated with sodium bicarbonate before radiocontrast-media procedures, the relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.13 and the absolute risk reduction was 11.9 percent. Dopamine and diuretics have been shown to be ineffective in ameliorating the course of acute renal failure.

Recent prospective clinical investigations in high-risk patients receiving intravenous contrast media for computed tomography (CT) suggest that the incidence and serious negative clinical outcomes are much less common than previously believed. Additional perspectives comparing random variations in serum creatinine in subjects not receiving contrast media show similar fluctuations that would equate to contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN). Putative mechanisms for how CIN could cause death or other serious adverse clinical consequences have not been elucidated.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^111fDNrs]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5.4 Skeletal Muscle

Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of myopathy. Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of rhabdomyolysis, usually in patients with impaired renal function. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed.

5.5 Serum Creatinine

Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.

### Elevated serum creatinine levels in severe hypothyroidism… [^112DG82N]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The decreases in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate that accompany hypothyroidism are believed to be related to the generalized hypodynamic state of the circulatory system in hypothroidism. Elevation of serum creatinine levels is not generally mentioned as an abnormality that occurs in association with hypothyroidism, although reports of such an association exist. Kreisman and Hennessey evaluated serum creatinine levels in 24 consecutive patients with iatrogenically induced hypothyroidism in conjunction with treatment of thyroid carcinoma. The creatinine level was increased in 26 of 29 episodes of hypothyroidism in a subgroup of 15 patients in whom creatinine values were obtained during the euthyroid state before induction of hypothyroidism. The mean hypothyroid creatinine values were significantly greater during hypothyroidism than during the euthyroid state. Creatinine values increased by 34. 4 percent after induction of hypothyroidism.

Serum creatinine values above the normal range occurred in six of the 36 hypothyroid episodes. The rise in creatinine levels during hypothyroidism was not associated with abnormal creatine kinase levels or other evidence of hypothyroid myopathy or intrinsic renal disease. The findings demonstrated that very little time is required for the development of elevated serum creatinine levels during the hypothyroid state. The results argue against the previously held notion of a net unchanged creatinine value because of a balance between the decrease in renal clearance and a decrease in creatinine generation. The authors conclude that the hypothyroid state is associated with a consistent elevation in the serum creatinine level, presumably related to a decrease in the GFR. The changes in serum creatinine levels develop rapidly and appear to be reversible. It may be clinically relevant to know of this association in that it could account for creatinine elevation in a patient with hypothyroidism.

It should also alert the clinician to consider evaluation of thyroid function in a patient who has a modest serum creatinine elevation but whose thyroid status is unknown.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^111NrE32]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

We further stratified the 4017 individuals in the top1 dataset based on creatinine levels and investigated if the positive relationship between higher creatinine levels and increased risk for all five chronic diseases was observable in this set. We found a significant positive association for all diseases but acute myocardial infarction (P = 0.090, Fig. 2k–o, Table S2). These results suggest that, even with a relatively small sample size (4017 individuals) that includes individuals with extremely high creatinine levels, we can stratify chronic disease risk.

In summary, elevated creatinine levels result from reduced glomerular filtration, making them a key biomarker for chronic kidney disease (CKD). They are also associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. However, it remains unclear whether these associations arise in part because these chronic disease conditions themselves raise creatinine levels, or if the observed correlations are solely due to the fact that they are risk factors for CKD, and kidney impairment results in increased levels of the biomarker. If the former (i.e. independently raise creatinine levels), GWAS on the top1 dataset could identify genetic loci associated with the risk of developing impaired kidney function and CKD in individuals with chronic metabolic diseases. In the following section, for simplicity we assume that the identified genetic loci are associated with kidney function and disease, but discuss the confounding effects of risk factors such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension in later sections.

GWAS loci in top1 and bottom99 datasets respectively correlate with CKD and healthy individuals

We sought to examine the correlation of genetic loci identified by GWAS conducted on a range of creatinine and cystatin C levels as well as CKD status (disease, healthy). Given the fact that creatinine levels and cystatin C are only correlated at elevated levels (Fig. 1c and d), we hypothesized that conducting GWAS on individuals with physiologically normal levels would identify a combination of non-overlapping genetic loci associated with the metabolism of these biomarkers. And that GWAS performed on individuals with extremely elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C would identify genetic loci primarily associated with the risk of developing impaired kidney function and CKD. Further, the negative correlation of eGFRcrecys values compared with creatinine levels and cystatin C levels (Fig. 1a and b), suggest that GWAS for these traits should identify genetic loci with opposite effect sizes.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^113gSKbC]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

### Metabolic consequences of cystinuria [^114j8sWH]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous reports showed elevation of BUN in some Slc3a1 −/− mice strains but no elevation in serum creatinine in others. We therefore sought to evaluate for the development of CKD in this mouse strain with a mixed C57Bl/6 and 129/SvJ background. Interestingly, male mice fed only normal chow showed elevated BUN, whereas male mice fed breeder chow showed both elevated BUN and creatinine (Fig. 4). Mice evaluated were between 40 and 87 weeks old (Additional files 1 and 2). Histologic evaluation of the kidney tissue from Slc3a1 −/− mice with higher creatinine on normal chow (Fig. 5 b) demonstrated dilated tubules from obstruction and increased fibrosis when compared to those with normal creatinine (Fig. 5 a). The observed dilation of tubules and fibrosis was also observed in mice with elevated creatinine (Fig. 5 d) compared to normal creatinine when placed on the breeder chow (Fig. 5 c). Histologic evaluation of the bladders of male Slc3a1 −/− mice revealed increased inflammatory infiltrate within the bladder wall and cystine stones in the bladder in mice having a normal serum creatinine (Fig. 5 f) when compared to the bladders of wild type mice (Fig. 5 e). Some Slc3a1 −/− mice with an elevated serum creatinine showed embedded cystine crystals within the bladder wall in addition to bladder inflammatory infiltrate (Fig. 5 g). It is known that cystinuria results in stone formation leading to obstruction and CKD. However, we sought to determine if there might be other metabolic consequences of cystinuria beyond just stone formation. Glutathione, or γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine (GSH), serves as a detoxifier, protector from oxidative damage, and is arguably the most important low molecular weight antioxidant in cells. The availability of cysteine, formed by two molecules of cystine, is a major determinant of the regulation of GSH synthesis. Therefore, cystine deficiency could affect GSH levels. Martensson et al. previously reported decreased leukocyte GSH levels in homozygous cystinuric patients. We sought to evaluate GSH levels in male Slc3a1 −/− mice which exhibited lower plasma cystine levels. Therefore, we evaluated the levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in the livers of Slc3a1 −/− mice. We observed lower GSH and lower GSSG in the livers of Slc3a1 −/− mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 6). The total amount of glutathione (GSH + GSSG) was lower (Fig. 6), implying a possible connection between the lower availability of cysteine and total glutathione reserve. A reduction of the ratio of reduced to oxidized forms of glutathione was also observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that the ability of the liver to respond to oxidative stress is reduced in Slc3a1 −/− mice.

### Ramipril [^112cZnAN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen

Increases in creatinine levels occurred in 1.2% of patients receiving ramipril alone, and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril and a diuretic. Increases in blood urea nitrogen levels occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 3% of patients receiving ramipril with a diuretic. None of these increases required discontinuation of treatment. Increases in these laboratory values are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and, based on experience with other ACE inhibitors, would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. As ramipril decreases aldosterone secretion, elevation of serum potassium can occur. Use potassium supplements and potassium sparing diuretics with caution, and monitor the patient's serum potassium frequently [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)].

Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit (a low value and a decrease of 5 g/dL or 5%, respectively) were rare, occurring in 0.4% of patients receiving ramipril alone and in 1.5% of patients receiving ramipril plus a diuretic. No US patients discontinued treatment because of decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit.

Other (causal relationships unknown)

Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with ramipril administration. Elevations of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, uric acid, and blood glucose have been reported, as have cases of hyponatremia and scattered incidents of leucopenia, eosinophilia, and proteinuria. In US trials, less than 0.2% of patients discontinued treatment for laboratory abnormalities; all of these were cases of proteinuria or abnormal liver-function tests.

### Are small changes in serum creatinine an important risk factor? [^113aLH8Z]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Serum creatinine levels are strongly associated with longitudinal risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Recent studies addressed whether worsening renal function - defined by small increases in creatinine - is independently associated with adverse outcomes. This review evaluates the recent literature on worsened renal function as an independent risk factor.

Recent Findings

Studies have evaluated worsening renal function as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in three settings: cardiac surgery patients, hospitalized heart failure patients, and ambulatory coronary artery disease patients. Small creatinine changes following cardiac surgery were strongly associated with mortality risk. One study found a J-shaped association between 48 h post surgery creatinine change and 30-day mortality risk. Compared with patients with creatinine decreases of 0–0.3 mg/dl, patients with creatinine increases less than 0.5 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted mortality risk and those with creatinine increases of at least 0.5 mg/dl had a nearly sixfold mortality risk; surprisingly those with decreases over 0.3 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted risk. Worsening renal function was also a strong predictor of mortality for hospitalized heart failure patients independent of baseline creatinine; the magnitude of creatinine rise appeared to be linearly associated with mortality risk. However, one study found no independent association between worsening renal function and cardiovascular or mortality risk over longer follow-up.

Summary

Acute elevations in serum creatinine had a linear association with increased risk for adverse outcomes among patients hospitalized for cardiac surgery or heart failure. Future studies should determine interventions to prevent and treat in-hospital worsening renal function to reduce the risk for adverse outcomes.

### Is elevated creatinine a reliable marker for methanol toxicity in nitromethane-containing model fuel ingestions in children? [^116rkvUP]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

In the absence of a rapid serum methanol level estimation, it is difficult to assess the risk from unintentional childhood ingestion of model fuels containing methanol and nitromethane (MFNM). Previous reports have documented false elevations of serum creatinine from the nitromethane in these fuels, suggesting its utility as a readily available marker of significant methanol ingestion.

Method

We performed a 2-year retrospective chart review of cases of ingestion of MFNM in children, with both a methanol level and measured creatinine level.

Results

Seven children, ages 19 months to 3 years, ingested MFNM. All seven children were seen in a hospital and had measured methanol and creatinine levels. All blood samples for methanol and creatinine were drawn within 3 hours of ingestion with methanol estimation delayed up to 24 hours. Creatinine ranged from 0.39 (0.034 mmol/l) to 10.7 mg/dl (0.95 mmol/l). All methanol levels were < 10 mg/dl (0.31 mmol/l) or reported as negative. Fomepizole was initiated empirically in two patients due to delay in obtaining methanol analysis results.

Discussion

Transient elevations of creatinine occurred in five of the seven children. Blood urea nitrogen was within normal limits, and there was no history of renal impairment in these children, suggesting the elevated creatinine was mostly related to nitromethane ingestion. No child had a significantly elevated methanol level.

Conclusion

Elevated creatinine level, as measured by Jaffe colorimetric method, is not a reliable marker for elevated methanol levels after unintentional ingestion of MFNM.

### Transporters affecting biochemical test results: creatinine-drug interactions [^116Uc1st]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Creatinine is eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular filtration and active transport. Drug-induced increases in serum creatinine (SCr) and/or reduced creatinine renal clearance are used as a marker for acute kidney injury. However, inhibition of active transport of creatinine can result in reversible and, therefore, benign increases in SCr levels. Herein, the transporters involved in creatinine clearance are discussed, in addition to limitations of using creatinine as a biomarker for kidney damage.

### Defining acute kidney injury: what is the most appropriate metric? [^116vMrdK]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely accepted measure of kidney function. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a reduction in GFR. GFR is, however, rarely measured in clinical practice; instead, serum markers (primarily creatinine) are used to define AKI. Because serum creatinine level is not linearly related to GFR, the performance of this marker is associated with ascertainment bias and poor sensitivity. In this article we discuss the limitations and pitfalls of using serum markers to define AKI, and offer some suggestions for the future.

### Causes of acute renal dysfunction after percutaneous coronary intervention and comparison of late mortality rates with postprocedure rise of creatine kinase-MB versus rise of serum creatinine [^1154y2Ma]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Increases in both serum creatinine and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) after percutaneous coronary intervention are associated with increased risk for late adverse cardiovascular events. In 5,397 patients, the strength of the association of each with late events and the risk factors for each of these markers were compared. A postprocedural increase in creatinine was a more powerful predictor of late mortality than an increase in CK-MB. Risk factors for an increase in creatinine are similar to those for contrast-induced nephropathy, suggesting that vulnerability to such injury may identify patients with increased risk for late mortality.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### Case files of the California poison control system, San Francisco division: blue thunder ingestion: methanol, nitromethane, and elevated creatinine [^1146SuLd]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

In a human case report, a 20-year-old woman who had worked for 2 years using a mixture of trichlorotrifluoroethane (94%), methanol (6%), and nitromethane (0.25%) developed Parkinsonism in the absence of other potential etiologies. The authors concluded that exposure to nitromethane could have been the cause of the Parkinsonism. A 19-year-old man developed a primary, symmetric demyelinating polyneuropathy after a 2-month exposure to an industrial solvent composed primarily of 1-bromopropane, but also containing nitromethane and other components. The authors attributed the neuropathy to the 1-bromopropane exposure.

The limited acute toxicity of nitromethane suggests that exposures require only supportive care with no specific therapy. Although different racing car fuels contain varying concentrations of nitromethane and methanol, management of this mixed poisoning should focus on the appropriate treatment for methanol toxicity.

Why is There a False Elevation of Creatinine with Nitromethane?

Nitromethane cause spurious elevations of the serum creatinine when the Jaffe colorimetric method is used to determine serum creatinine concentration. This method involves injecting a sample of the patient's serum into an alkaline picrate solution. Creatinine in the sample combines with alkaline picrate to form a red-colored complex or chromophore, the light absorbance of which can then be measured in the 470–550 nm range using a double-beam spectrophotometer. The rate of absorbance is directly proportional to the creatinine concentration in the serum. Nitromethane also forms a red chromophore with alkaline picrate with an absorbance similar to that of the creatinine-picrate chromophore. Thus, when nitromethane is present in a patient's serum, the reaction of both creatinine and nitromethane with alkaline picrate can result in a significantly but spuriously elevated creatinine concentration.

### Prevalence of high blood pressure and elevated serum creatinine level in the United States: findings from the… [^111GWbMS]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Results Higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, presence of hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, older age, and diabetes mellitus were all associated with higher serum creatinine levels. An estimated 3. 0% of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population had elevated serum creatinine levels, 70% of whom were hypertensive. Elevated serum creatinine level was 8 times more common in hypertensive than normotensive individuals and 8 times more common in people already using medication for high blood pressure compared with people not using such medication. Figure 1 shows that the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level was markedly higher in individuals treated for hypertension compared with untreated individuals at every category of blood pressure. Among untreated individuals, prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level increased monotonically with higher blood pressure categories from 0. 8% to
13. 6%.

Among treated individuals, the association of prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level with blood pressure was J-shaped. Our results show that approximately 5. 6 million individuals in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population have elevated serum creatinine levels, 25 times the number of prevalent ESRD cases, and 108 times the number of incident ESRD cases in
1991. Elevated serum creatinine level is rare among young and middle-aged individuals with optimal blood pressure and becomes increasingly more common among individuals in higher blood pressure categories as well as among individuals using antihypertensive medications. First, despite similar current blood pressure levels in treated and untreated individuals, treated individuals are likely to have a longer duration of high blood pressure as well as a greater past severity of hypertension, both of which are risk factors for nephrosclerosis.

30 Second, antihypertensive medications may decrease glomerular filtration rate by decreasing systemic and glomerular capillary pressure and thus increasing serum creatinine levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, for example, often increase serum creatinine levels by up to 20% at the initiation of therapy with greater increases seen among patients with bilateral renal vascular disease31 and smaller increases in unselected patients with chronic renal disease. 32–34 Third, and most importantly, a wealth of clinical trial data supports the benefit of effective antihypertensive therapy in slowing the progression of renal disease.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^114UVwm5]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found that patients in routine clinical care who started treatment with ACEI/ARB and whose creatinine concentration had increased by 30% or more at their first follow-up monitoring visit were at increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes and death, compared with patients with more stable creatinine values. Our study thus confirms data from clinical trials in a real world clinical setting. Moreover, we established that risks were also substantially increased for end stage renal disease. In general, risks were highest in the first year after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment but were sustained up to 10 years later for end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, and death. Importantly, we showed a "dose-response" relation between the level of increase in creatinine values and risk of adverse outcomes, indicating that all increases below 30% cannot be viewed as safe. Our results were consistent across calendar periods and patient subgroups in a range of sensitivity analyses. It is not clear whether increases in creatinine values after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment are due to pathophysiological processes representing a biomarker of increased risk or whether a direct causal relation exists between reduced renal function and adverse outcomes. These results therefore identify a group of patients at high risk but do not necessarily support discontinuation of ACEI/ARBs.

### Practical guidance for the management of adverse events in patients with KRASG12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer receiving adagrasib [^1148dr6r]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Blood Creatinine Elevation

Treatment-related blood creatinine increase occurred in 26% of patients in cohort A of the KRYSTAL-1 study. Median time to onset was 11 days (IQR 8–46) and median time from onset to resolution was 19 days (IQR 14–36). The increase led to dose reductions and interruptions in 1 patient (1%) and 7 patients (6%), respectively.

Blood creatinine increases may represent pre-renal or post-renal causes, so volume status should be assessed and a low threshold for fluid replacement should be applied. Blood creatinine levels should be monitored regularly during treatment (every month for 3 months if the patient does not experience abnormalities). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen for pain) should be avoided or used with caution when creatinine is elevated. Preclinical models have not supported evidence for nephrotoxicity due to adagrasib. It should be noted that mild blood creatinine increases may be artificial (eg, due to multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 inhibition) and have no effect on the glomerular filtration rate. Dose modification guidance for blood creatinine elevation (per adagrasib clinical study protocols) is shown in Table 5.

### Vesiculobullous skin lesions on the hands and face [^115J7LGt]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following laboratory findings is most commonly associated with this condition?
A. Elevated serum IgE levels
B. Decreased serum ferritin levels
C. Increased plasma uroporphyrin levels
D. Antinuclear antibodies
E. Elevated serum creatinine levels

Answers:
A. Elevated serum IgE levels – Incorrect. PCT is not typically associated with elevated serum IgE levels.
B. Decreased serum ferritin levels – Incorrect. PCT is commonly associated with hyperferritinemia due to iron overload, not decreased levels. In the case presented herein, laboratory tests revealed hyperferritinemia (1035 ng/mL).
C. Increased plasma uroporphyrin levels – Correct. Increased serum uroporphyrin levels are a characteristic laboratory finding in patients with PCT. In the case presented herein, consistent biological findings with increased uroporphyrin in blood, urine, and stool confirmed the diagnosis. Twenty percent of PCT cases are of genetic origin, which justifies a systematic determination of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity (negative for the patient presented herein).
D. Antinuclear antibodies – Incorrect. PCT is not considered a primary autoimmune disease. Therefore, the presence of antinuclear antibodies is not a characteristic feature of PCT. If present, it may suggest the presence of another autoimmune condition rather than PCT itself.
E. Elevated serum creatinine levels – Incorrect. Elevated serum creatinine levels are not typically associated with PCT.

### Do acute elevations of serum creatinine in primary care engender an increased mortality risk? [^115bXUTo]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study suggests patients who develop acute SCr elevations in primary care and are not subsequently admitted to hospital have a significantly increased mortality compared to those whose SCr is stable. The increased mortality appears to be temporally associated with the acute SCr elevation, i.e. within 30 days, suggesting a direct association between the event and adverse outcome. This association persists even after multiple adjustments for potential confounders. Further studies are required to examine the potential causal association between these events in primary care and poor outcome. Clearly if there is a causal relationship this would be an important area in which to intervene.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114QCpNE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition — small changes in serum creatinine: The AKIN definition was based on evidence that minor fluctuations in serum creatinine concentration were strongly associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized individuals, with the association remaining, albeit attenuated, after multivariate adjustment. Subsequent studies have identified small changes in serum creatinine to be prognostically important, and even a 0.1-mg/dL increase appears to be associated with increased risk compared to no change. However, whether these small changes reflect clinically meaningful kidney function fluctuations or are merely markers of underlying conditions remains unresolved, and an implicit assumption is that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in an individual is constant over time and not subject to physiologic fluctuation.

### Serum creatinine levels and renal insufficiency… [^111fzoVp]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

A rise in serum creatinine or potassium level may result in discontinuation of the drug or use of lower dosages than what is recommended because of concerns about safety and tolerability in patients with renal insufficiency. Bakris and Weir reviewed 12 randomized trials to determine if an initial reduction in the glomerular filtration rate or elevation of serum creatinine levels from use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs results in long-term protection against decline in renal function in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal disease progression among patients with preexisting renal insufficiency was evaluated over a three-year period. The evaluations included patients with and without diabetes mellitus or systolic heart failure. GFR data was used if serum creatinine values were unavailable.

A limited elevation in serum creatinine level was seen following initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients who achieved their blood pressure goal. The increase usually occurred within two weeks of therapy. Regardless of the serum creatinine value, manifestations of renal failure were not apparent until the GFR was well below 30 mL per minute. Patients with the greatest degree of renal insufficiency experienced the greatest protection from renal disease progression. As renal disease increases, there is a loss of renal reserve as well as the autoregulatory ability of the kidney, resulting in a more acute fall in GFR following ACE inhibition. The studies also indicated that there is a low risk of hyperkalemia with use of drugs that block the reninangiotensin system. Results indicated that use of drugs that block the RAS is appropriate in patients with renal insufficiency.

Once marked elevations in serum creatinine levels are present and renal reserve is lost, the unique benefits of ACE inhibitors may not exceed that of achieving the recommended level of blood pressure reduction alone. Data from these studies in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease demonstrated that if an elevation in the serum creatinine level does occur, it stabilizes quickly and does not progressively worsen. In addition, this reduction in GFR is reversible. The authors conclude that no one should be denied a long-term trial of an ACE inhibitor because of a preexisting elevation of serum creatinine level or one that increases up to 30 percent from baseline and then stabilizes within two to three weeks. If elevations in serum creatinine of more than 30 percent occur on a chronic basis within the first month or if hyperkalemia occurs, the drug should be withdrawn.

### Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) [^111B4XFx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipid Elevations

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were observed at one month of exposure and remained stable thereafter. Changes in lipid parameters during the first 3 months of exposure in the placebo-controlled clinical trials are summarized below:

Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 15% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 19% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm.
Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 10% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 12% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm.
Mean LDL/HDL ratios were essentially unchanged in XELJANZ-treated patients.

In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, elevations in LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased to pretreatment levels in response to statin therapy.

In the long-term safety population, elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Serum Creatinine Elevations

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in serum creatinine were observed with XELJANZ treatment. The mean increase in serum creatinine was < 0.1 mg/dL in the 12-month pooled safety analysis; however with increasing duration of exposure in the long-term extensions, up to 2% of patients were discontinued from XELJANZ treatment due to the protocol-specified discontinuation criterion of an increase in creatinine by more than 50% of baseline. The clinical significance of the observed serum creatinine elevations is unknown.

### Acute kidney injury in critical care: time for a paradigm shift? [^11517ZeP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute alterations in renal function are commonly encountered in various settings with varied clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. Our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been fairly stagnant, until recently largely limited by a lack of concerted efforts in the field. This review summarizes the recent advances and provides an overview of emerging trends in this field.

Recent Findings

One of the limitations in our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been the lack of a standardized definition and staging criteria for this disorder. New information on the epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury has emerged providing an opportunity to reappraise our approach to this disease. Also, there has been new work on the relationship of alterations of renal function to short and long-term outcomes, particularly mortality.

Summary

To translate advances from basic research to clinical application a multidisciplinary approach is required. New research in the field of biomarkers combined with clinical markers will lead to therapies that can be introduced earlier in the course of the disease and, hopefully, lead to a decrease in mortality from this potentially reversible condition.

### Investigating the simultaneous effect of longitudinal biomarkers on long-term kidney transplant failure in Iranian kidney transplant patients: a multivariate joint model [^111NNgLS]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The results of this study showed that elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels, along with decreased hematocrit levels, are associated with an increased risk of graft failure. Accordingly, measuring these biomarkers in patients' visits after kidney transplantation is crucial. Although BUN was significantly associated with an increased risk of graft failure in the univariate joint models, this effect was not statistically significant in the multivariate joint model after adjusting for serum creatinine, hematocrit, and baseline covariates. This suggests that other correlated biomarkers, such as serum creatinine, may confound the apparent association between BUN and graft rejection. Therefore, the role of BUN as an independent predictor of graft failure should be interpreted cautiously, and future studies are warranted to clarify its clinical utility in multivariate contexts.

Previous studies have shown that serum creatinine and BUN are important biological markers, with increases in these levels being associated with decreased kidney function. In a study conducted on cohort data of kidney transplant patients using a multivariate joint model, Jaffa et al. concluded that there is a significant relationship between the trend of changes in serum creatinine and BUN and the risk of graft failure. In a 2016 study by Maraghi et al. that examined the effect of a single longitudinal biomarker, serum creatinine, on graft survival, each unit increase in serum creatinine (mg/dL) resulted in an estimated approximately 4-fold increase in the risk of graft failure. This risk is considerably higher than the risk calculated in our study, which could be attributed to differences in sample sizes between the two studies and the simultaneous examination of multiple longitudinal biomarkers in our research. According to Hariharan et al.'s study, serum creatinine levels increased one year after transplantation. Their studies showed a direct relationship between elevated creatinine levels and graft failure. Impaired kidneys and anti-rejection drugs cause elevated serum creatinine levels, which can lead to nephrotoxicity and kidney damage. Reduced urine output can be caused by poor kidney function or urinary tract obstruction. When kidney function is normal, the kidneys effectively clear waste products from the blood, leading to lower creatinine levels. However, when kidney function declines, waste products are not properly excreted, leading to an increase in blood creatinine and BUN levels. Anemia is a common complication of kidney failure, often caused by reduced erythropoietin production and disrupted iron homeostasis. In diagnosing anemia, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count are commonly measured. Hemoglobin is a complex hemoprotein found in red blood cells, while hematocrit represents the percentage volume of red blood cells in the blood, with its value depending on the number of red blood cells. Both hemoglobin and hematocrit are used in the diagnosis and management of hematologic disorders. In this regard, increasing trends in serum creatinine and BUN levels, along with decreasing hematocrit, may indicate declining kidney function and a higher risk of graft failure. Monitoring these biomarkers could support timely clinical evaluation and management.

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^116639p6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional, and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians, and other health-care professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

### Association of serum creatinine levels and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Korea: a case control study [^1171qx2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, lower levels of serum creatinine were significantly associated with an increased risk of T2DM in men with creatinine below 1.20 mg/dl but not in women. Therefore, measurement of serum creatinine would be useful for screening subjects with a high risk of diabetes, especially Korean men. Furthermore, these findings would be helpful to understand the heterogeneous pathophysiology of T2DM.

### Effect of elevated admission serum creatinine and its worsening on outcome in hospitalized patients with decompensated heart failure [^112XvsKj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Renal insufficiency (RI), as represented by elevated serum creatinine (> 1.5 mg/dl) on admission, is common and found in almost half of patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure. This finding is associated with prolongation of length of stay and rate of rehospitalizations after discharge and also has an independent unfavorable effect on 6-month mortality. Similarly, an increase in serum creatinine (> 0.5 mg/dl) in the hospital results in a significantly longer length of stay and has an independent effect on long-term mortality.

### Elevated serum creatinine: but is It renal failure? [^115iGBZ2]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Serum creatinine is typically used to evaluate kidney function. Yet, it is a marker that can only provide estimations of kidney function because it can be influenced by other factors, such as dietary intake. The expanding field of infant formula selection in recent history has given many options for parents who are unable to provide breastmilk. Standard infant formulas and breastmilk generally fall within a select range of creatine content. With greater accessibility to internet-based medical advice, parents and families have more chances to be exposed to opportunistic websites and opinions that may provide harmful information. In this report, we describe the case of excessive dietary creatine intake in an infant who presented with elevated creatinine while otherwise appearing healthy and having normal cystatin C.

After in-depth evaluation of nutritional intake, there was a suspicion for high creatine load of the infant's homemade formula, which was composed of beef liver and various unregulated nutritional powders. Within 12 hours of stopping the infant's homemade formula and providing intravenous fluids, the infant's creatinine normalized. We highlight the importance of in-depth nutrition assessments and education on the health risks associated with improper formula selection. Skip Nav Destination Molly Wong Vega, Sarah J.

### Conceptual advances and evolving terminology in acute kidney disease [^111FpwsK]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Over the past decade, new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology and biomarkers have modified our understanding of acute kidney dysfunction and damage, and their association with subsequent chronic kidney disease. The concept of acute kidney injury (AKI), which has relied on established but nonetheless flawed biomarkers of solute clearance (serum creatinine levels and urinary output), has been challenged by the identification of novel biomarkers of tubular stress and/or damage. The expression of some of these novel biomarkers precedes changes in conventional biomarkers or can increase their predictive power, and might therefore enhance the clinical accuracy of the definition of AKI. In addition, the need to consider AKI recurrence, duration and progression to chronic kidney disease within the clinical and epidemiological framework of AKI led to the emergence of the concept of acute kidney disease. New definitions of acute syndromes of kidney impairment and injury are needed.

### Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency: how concerned should we be by the rise in serum creatinine? [^1161tg2e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the association between the early rise in serum creatinine levels associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the long-term renoprotective properties of these drugs in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

Background

Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated survival benefits of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In patients with renal insufficiency, whether associated with diabetes mellitus or not, use of ACE inhibitors is associated with slowing in the progression of renal disease. In fact, patients who have the most advanced renal insufficiency at baseline are the ones who show the maximum slowing of the disease progression, but these patients are also more likely to show an early rise in serum creatinine levels after ACE inhibitor therapy. There is evidence that patients with renal insufficiency often do not receive ACE inhibitors. There is also evidence that patients with heart failure are not receiving this life-saving drug or are receiving it at dosages lower than that used in the clinical trials. One of the main reasons for this underutilization of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is the underlying renal insufficiency or the rise in serum creatinine level after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor.

Methods

The authors reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus or heart failure. Studies were included for review if they met the following criteria: subjects were randomized to receive ACE inhibitor; subjects were followed up for a minimum of 2 years; and most of the subjects had baseline chronic renal insufficiency (≥ 25% loss of renal function), irrespective of cause. Of the 12 studies that met these criteria, six were multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled studies. The other six were smaller randomized studies. The studies had a mean ± standard deviation follow-up of 3.2 ± 0.3 years. One thousand one hundred two patients were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of these, 705 (64%) had data on renal function at baseline (within 6 months of the start) and at the end of the study. The authors examined the changes in serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in patients who were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors. The authors also assessed the blood pressures achieved in the trials.

Results

Patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency who achieved their blood pressure control goals were likely to demonstrate an early rise in serum creatinine levels, approximately 25% above the baseline (approximately 1.7 mg/dL) after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This rise in serum creatinine was more acute (by approximately 15% from the baseline) during the first 2 weeks of therapy and was more gradual (additional approximately 10%) during the third and fourth weeks of therapy (Figure 1). The serum creatinine level was likely to stabilize after about 4 weeks, provided patients had a normal salt and fluid intake. In addition, patients who did not show a rise in serum creatinine level during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, were less likely to experience one after that period, unless they were dehydrated from use of diuretics or gastroenteritis or had used a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). In spite of this early rise in serum creatinine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (a serum creatinine level of ≥ 124 micromol/L or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL) who were randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor, these patients receiving the drug showed a 55% to 75% lower risk of worsening renal function than those with normal renal function receiving the drug. The rate of risk reduction was inversely related to the severity of renal impairment at baseline, but data were limited on the benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with more advanced renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min). The authors noted that those aged 65 and older were likely to have much lower GFRs for given levels of serum creatinine than younger patients and were therefore likely to have advanced renal insufficiency at serum creatinine levels as low as 2 mg/dL (vs 4 mg/dL for younger patients). Patients with normal renal function were likely to show a much smaller rise in serum creatinine level (approximately 10% above the baseline of 0.9 mg/dL), mostly occurring during the first week after initiation of therapy, with subsequent stabilization, whereas patients with normal renal function suffering from heart failure, volume depletion, or bilateral renal artery stenosis experienced a significant rise (approximately 225% above baseline) in serum creatinine level, much higher in magnitude and rate than that experienced by those with renal insufficiency (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels in these patients sharply increased (by approximately 75% above baseline) in the 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor, followed by an even sharper increase (another approximately 150%) during the subsequent 2 weeks. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) who received therapy with ACE inhibitors had about a five times higher risk of developing hyperkalemia than those with normal renal function, whereas presence of heart failure increased the risk of hyperkalemia by about three times over those without heart failure. Concomitant use of diuretics was associated with an approximately 60% reduction in risk of hyperkalemia.

Conclusion

The authors conclude that, in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL) treated with ACE inhibitors, there is a strong association between early (within the first 2 months) and moderate (not exceeding 30% over baseline) rise in serum creatinine and slowing of the renal disease progression in the long run. The authors recommend that ACE inhibitor therapy should not be discontinued unless serum creatinine level rise above 30% over baseline during the first 2 months after initiation of therapy or hyperkalemia (serum potassium level ≥ 5.6 mmol/L) develops.

### Salivary creatinine and urea analysis in patients with chronic kidney disease: a case control study [^116zneg1]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, patients with CKD showed elevated levels of salivary creatinine and urea compared to the levels in healthy individuals. In addition, the salivary levels of creatinine and urea showed positive correlation with the levels in plasma. Our findings are consistent with previous reports adding to the existing data to support the possibility of employing analysis of salivary creatinine and urea for the diagnosis and assessment of CKD.

The elevated levels of salivary creatinine and urea observed in patients with CKD are reflections of the blood levels as confirmed by the positive correlations. These elevated salivary levels of creatinine and urea could be responsible for the complaints of dry mouth, mouth odour or uremic breath as well as tongue coating and other oral complications of CKD. The uremic fetor, an ammoniacal odor from the mouth is a typical sign of uremic patients which is caused by the high concentration of urea in the saliva and its subsequent breakdown to ammonia. Similarly, the positive correlation between serum and salivary creatinine observed in this study could be explained by the increased concentration of creatinine and urea in patients with CKD which creates a concentration gradient that facilitates increased diffusion of creatinine and urea from serum into saliva.

Comparison with other studies

Many post hoc analyses of clinical trials have examined the prognostic significance of a deterioration in renal function after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. In clinical trials of patients with heart failure, deterioration in renal function after starting ACEI/ARB treatment is commonly found. Although this deterioration is associated with a poorer prognosis compared with patients with preserved renal function, the overall benefits of ACEI/ARB treatment compared with placebo remain for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Our study does not undermine that evidence but flags that the risk-benefit ratio may differ among patients with marked changes in creatinine concentrations. This is particularly the case for other prescribing indications for which the clinical trial evidence is less clear.

The recommendation in many international guidelines to stop ACEI/ARB treatment if creatinine rises by 30% or more after initiation are founded on a single review of 12 clinical trials of ACEI/ARB treatment for diabetes and heart failure. Studies included in this review evaluated progression of renal disease among patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Of these studies, only six were double blinded and included a total of 1102 participants. These trials were published during 1993–97 and may not relate to patients receiving contemporary routine clinical care. The methods that define a cut-off level of creatinine increase at 30% for cessation are not clearly presented. In addition, the results provided by these studies are not supported by later trials. Recent reviews have not shown the superiority of ACEI/ARBs compared with other antihypertensive drugs for treating early non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, diabetes with normal renal function, and diabetes and chronic kidney disease. A UK multicentre interventional trial to compare the outcomes of continuation versus cessation of ACEI/ARB treatment is under way in response to observational evidence that stopping ACEI/ARB treatment may slow progression in advanced renal disease.

A fixed recommendation to stop ACEI/ARB treatment only if creatinine is increased by 30% or more is also hard to reconcile with the growing body of evidence related to acute kidney injury, which shows that even a small deterioration in renal function is associated with a subsequently increased risk of mortality and other adverse outcomes. It is important to consider that the prognostic significance of ACEI/ARB associated renal impairment may depend on the underlying cause and on subsequent changes in renal function if ACEI/ARB treatment is continued. Underlying causes may be different in the routine care setting, in which patients are older, have multiple comorbidities, and have more advanced kidney disease compared with patients who participated in early clinical trials.

### Eltrombopag [^112D5rKB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.5 Interference with Clinical Laboratory Tests

Eltrombopag is highly colored and can cause patient sample discoloration, which is reported to interfere with some clinical laboratory tests, including, but not limited to bilirubin and creatinine.

Bilirubin Testing: Eltrombopag can cause both positive and negative interference with bilirubin assays. If the laboratory results for bilirubin are inconsistent with clinical observations, further evaluation of liver function should be performed to clarify the clinical status of the patient. Evaluating contemporaneous aminotransferase values (AST, ALT) may help determine the validity of normal total bilirubin levels in the presence of clinical jaundice.

Creatinine Testing: Eltrombopag can cause positive interference with creatinine measurements, leading to falsely elevated creatinine levels. In the event of an unexpected serum creatinine test result, further evaluation of renal function should be performed. Blood urea should be evaluated if serum creatinine is unexpectedly high.

Communicate to the lab conducting testing if the patient is taking eltrombopag. Re-testing using other methods may also help in determining the validity of the test results.

### Albuminuria, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate as predictors of cardio-renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and kidney disease: a systematic literature review [^115TEb34]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition characterized by a gradual decline in kidney function, which can result in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The global prevalence of CKD is estimated to be between 8% and 16%, and is thought to exceed 50% in certain high-risk populations. As of 2013, in the United States alone, more than 30 million adults were projected to have CKD, with the incidence rising profoundly among those aged 65 years and older.

The etiology of CKD is multifactorial, with glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration reflecting the most prominent mechanistic contributors to disease progression. Both systemic hypertension and glomerular hypertension resulting from glomerular hemodynamic changes, are known to provoke injury to the glomeruli. As a consequence, elevated blood pressure can overwhelm normal protection afforded from systemic hypertension to the kidney by autoregulation. Hyperfiltration initiates the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which in turn, increases glomerular permeability and gives rise to albuminuria, proteinuria, and dyslipidemia, while also diminishing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), thus reciprocally leading to hypertension.

### Prognosis and serum creatinine levels in acute renal failure at the time of nephrology consultation: an observational cohort study [^115SdCJB]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

We chose to calculate the percentage change in creatinine respect to its baseline because serum creatinine is modulated by muscle bulk. Therefore, smaller changes as 0.3 or 0.5 mg/dL will have distinct significance for patients with different genders and/or ages, whose normal baseline levels are different. For this reason, we found that a relative increase in creatinine was more accurate than an absolute increase one.

The higher presence of chronic renal failure in the < 101% increment group might be explained because concern about it could have induced earlier nephrology consultation, even if the patient did not present signs of ARF in that time. However, we must admit that 74 chronic renal failure patients (48.68%) might have presented an unstable serum creatinine value at hospital admission, thus underestimating the severity of ARF for them. Chronic renal failure was included in this study to represent the common clinical practice, and thereafter it was adjusted for in the analysis because of expecting different outcomes than the general population.

On the other hand, the higher proportion of cases of ARF developed in the community in the ≥ 101% increase group might suggest that nephrology consultation may have been delayed because of time spent before hospital admittance, giving serum creatinine an extra time to reach a higher value.

Our results about mortality in the Renal Replacement Therapy sub-group are consistent with previously reported, and it is of interest the higher mortality rate in patients in the ≥ 101% increase group. What we may learn here is that this group of patients is most likely to benefit from a more intensive treatment.

The degree of renal injury is likely to affect renal recovery. Patients where consultation was started with ≥ 101% creatinine increase had significant higher creatinine levels at discharge compared to their baseline levels, and many of them would be expected to develop chronic renal malfunction. Adjustment for confounding factors in the analysis was done, too.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^111mg36D]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden (within 7 days) loss of kidney function that is determined on the basis of reduced urinary output and/or increased serum creatinine levels. Acute kidney disease (AKD) includes a variety of acute and subacute kidney conditions, including AKI, lasting for up to 90 days. AKD can persist after incomplete resolution of an AKI episode or AKD can develop without ever meeting AKI criteria, for example, when kidney dysfunction evolves slowly. Kidney dysfunction lasting for > 3 months is referred to as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

As the diagnostic markers of AKI, serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output (UO), have poor sensitivity and specificity, it is possible that a healthy individual with transient volume depletion could fulfill the diagnostic criteria of AKI without having kidney injury or long-term health implications. Therefore, clinical judgement is required to diagnose AKI and consider the clinical context. AKI persisting despite volume repletion likely reflects structural damage to the kidney. Similarly, drugs that affect glomerular filtration may cause small changes in SCr levels that are not necessarily indicative of kidney injury.

AKI is a syndrome affecting 10–15% of hospitalized patients and more than 50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. AKI can be caused by different etiologies and the large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent evidence demonstrates that the AKI burden extends beyond the acute phase with progression to CKD, recurrent episodes of AKI, increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and reduced long-term survival. Finding specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the fact that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Existing animal models fail to recapitulate the complexity of human AKI, which is often multifactorial. In addition, many clinical trials do not enroll patients with the precise mechanisms and timing modeled in animal experiments thereby limiting translation. Therefore, the main focus lies on preventing AKI development and progression. Recently, several trials have identified measures to prevent the development of AKI in different settings.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, AKI-CKD transition, preventive strategies, as well as the choice of endpoints for AKI prevention trials. A discussion of other AKI etiologies (e.g. glomerulonephritis, vasculitis), AKI management and renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^113JB182]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current diagnostic methods for AKI and their limitations

The diagnostic criteria for AKI primarily include the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease), AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network), and KDIGO (kidney disease: Improving Global Outcomes) standards, all of which emphasize the importance of SCr. Common adjunctive diagnostic methods also include urine output monitoring, imaging tests, and assessments of electrolytes and acid-base balance. In clinical practice, the KDIGO standard is widely used as it combines the advantages of the RIFLE and AKIN criteria, providing a more comprehensive basis for the diagnosis of AKI.

Serum creatinine

SCr is the most used diagnostic tool for acute changes in kidney function. The 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommend the following criteria: an increase in SCr of ≥ 0.3 mg/mL (≥ 26.5 µmol/L) within 48 h; a SCr increase of more than 1.5 times baseline within the past 7 days; urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/(kg·h) for more than 6 h.

Due to the long half-life of SCr and kidney functional reserve, changes in SCr are not significant during early kidney injury and may not reflect pathological changes in a timely manner. SCr values are influenced by factors such as muscle mass, metabolism, liver function, diet, hydration, and exogenous creatinine intake, and can also be affected by physiological and analytical variability. Drugs (such as cimetidine and trimethoprim) that inhibit tubular secretion or blood concentration (such as diuretics) may cause false elevation, while changes during pregnancy can also affect SCr levels. Additionally, prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal AKI can all lead to an increase in SCr, requiring a comprehensive interpretation in conjunction with the specific cause. Faster testing methods, such as creatinine clearance over 2–4 h, dynamic estimated GFR (kinetic eGFR), or plasma clearance of renal clearance-dependent compounds (such as iohexol), though not yet widely adopted in clinical practice, have been proposed as alternative tools to SCr testing.

### Short-term effects of vitamin D receptor activation on serum creatinine, creatinine generation, and glomerular filtration [^115keRKH]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D receptor activation may have pleiotropic effects in a variety of tissues. Experimental studies with vitamin D receptor activation demonstrate an ability to delay progression of renal disease. In humans, vitamin D receptor activation reduces albuminuria. Yet some clinical studies demonstrate that patients receiving vitamin D supplementation have an elevation in serum creatinine and a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. These observations may be explainable by an effect of vitamin D receptor activation on creatinine metabolism.

### Changes in renal function associated with oral emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate use for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^113YK221]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Creatinine elevations confirmed at consecutive visits were more frequent in the treatment arm (7 vs. 1), but rare overall (7/1248 or 0.6%): The number needed to harm, defined as a confirmed creatinine elevation including elevations that remain in the normal range, was approximately 166. The risk of adverse renal outcomes was readily managed with every 12-week serum creatinine testing. This study indicates that TDF use in PrEP may lead to mild and subclinical decline in CrCl without proximal tubular dysfunction.

These findings support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention interim guidance that oral FTC/TDF PrEP should include monitoring of serum creatinine. Monitoring BUN, serum phosphate, and urine-derived parameters of proximal tubulopathy had no discernible value. We advise repeating the abnormal serum creatinine measurements on a separate specimen before discontinuing FTC/TDF because the majority of elevations are self-limited. The safety and optimal monitoring frequency for oral FTC/TDF PrEP users having risk factors for renal dysfunction warrants evaluation.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^1145JMAQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction: why focus on recovery?

While acute renal impairment is sometimes thought of as a relatively trivial insult defined purely by changes in serum creatinine, the introduction and subsequent acceptance of the concept of acute kidney injury (AKI) has gradually alerted critical care and nephrology clinicians to potential late complications in AKI survivors. It is well recognised that progressive or persistent impairment in renal function may occur following an episode of AKI, with the potential to progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with dialysis dependence. However, the outcome from an episode of AKI cannot simply be regarded as the binary administration for chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) or recovery. Several authors have highlighted the substantial risk of development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), short of ESKD which is in turn strongly associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. This association does not necessarily implicate causation but could also indicate a common underlying disease process (Fig. 1). The question thus arises 'What do we mean by renal recovery after AKI?' Furthermore, in the absence of an effective therapy to alter the acute course of established AKI, our current focus should be turned towards both AKI prevention and promotion of kidney repair in the recovery phase.

As in chronic kidney diseases, the concentrations of urinary AKI biomarkers have been normalized to urine creatinine concentration to account for creatinine clearance and urine flow. Waikar et al. challenge the assumption that normalization to creatinine clearance in a chronic disease state can be extrapolated to an acute state, in which creatinine clearance is, by definition, changing acutely.

### Evaluation of short-term changes in serum creatinine level as a meaningful end point in randomized clinical trials [^1177fkY5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown that acute change in kidney function (specifically, AKI) is a strong risk factor for poor outcomes. Thus, the outcome of acute change in serum creatinine level, regardless of underlying biology or etiology, is frequently used in clinical trials as both efficacy and safety end points. We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to quantify the relationship between positive or negative short-term effects of interventions on change in serum creatinine level and more meaningful clinical outcomes. After a thorough literature search, we included 14 randomized trials of interventions that altered risk for an acute increase in serum creatinine level and had reported between-group differences in CKD and/or mortality rate ≥ 3 months after randomization. Seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, increased risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.89), and seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, reduced risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.74). However, pooled risks for CKD and mortality associated with interventions did not differ from those with placebo in either group. In conclusion, several interventions that affect risk of acute, mild to moderate, often temporary elevation in serum creatinine level in placebo-controlled randomized trials showed no appreciable effect on CKD or mortality months later, raising questions about the value of using small to moderate changes in serum creatinine level as end points in clinical trials.

### Association of serum creatinine levels and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Korea: a case control study [^111GJL9T]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study showed that although there was a trend that reduced levels of serum creatinine were associated with an increased risk of T2DM among women with serum creatinine below 1.1 mg/dl, the association between the level of serum creatinine and the risk of incident diabetes was not significant in women. However, there were several studies showing that the inverse association between the level of serum creatinine and the risk of incident diabetes was consistent for both sexes. In a previous study including 9667 Japanese individuals without diabetes or hypertension and with normal creatinine levels at baseline during the follow-up period (mean: 5.6 years), low serum creatinine levels independently predicted T2DM development in both men and women. A Chinese cohort study including 41,439 participants (44.5% of those were women) who were ≥ 18 years (range 18–96) and did not have T2DM found that low serum creatinine levels were associated with an increased risk of T2DM after the exclusion of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and abnormally high serum creatinine levels (> 1.2 mg/dL for men and > 1.0 for women) for both men and women. Because we included women with mildly elevated levels of serum creatinine (1.0–1.4 mg/dl) and did not exclude those with comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or cancer, other confounding factors affecting serum creatinine may influence the results regarding the association between serum creatinine levels and the risk of incident diabetes in women.

### Screening for kidney diseases: older measures versus novel biomarkers [^112YaAVE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been used to screen for kidney disease since creatinine was recognized to be correlated with renal function. The measurement of serum creatinine as a screening test for kidney disease falls short, however, because serum creatinine is not particularly sensitive for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Creatinine reflects renal filtering capacity, which has a lot of reserve and is therefore not sensitive to acute or chronic kidney injury unless the injury is substantial enough to compromise the filtering ability. The sensitivity of serum creatinine is further diminished in certain patient populations that are prone to kidney disease because of the physiology of creatinine. Therefore, researchers are seeking new biomarkers that can aid in the diagnosis of both acute and chronic kidney diseases. The limitations of creatinine in screening for kidney diseases in specific patient populations as well as new potential biomarkers that are actively being researched are discussed in this review.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^114NHJsm]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is new in nephrotoxicity?

There are drugs that are directly nephrotoxic, drugs that are not nephrotoxic but interfere with intrarenal hemodynamics (i.e. ACE-inhibitors, NSAIDs) and drugs that are not nephrotoxic, but accumulate in renal failure and should, therefore, also be prescribed with caution. The most commonly incriminated drugs are contrast agents and antibiotics but multidrug toxicity maybe the predominant problem. When prescribing drugs, clinicians should consider how they affect kidney function and whether their clearance is affected by the presence of AKI. Prescription of nephrotoxic medications should be minimized in terms of frequency and duration, however, they should not be withheld in life-threatening situations owing to concern for AKI. Drugs with potentially renoprotective effects should be continued even if they are associated with a mild rise in serum creatinine (i.e. ACE-inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy).

Historically, contrast agents have been considered an important cause of AKI. However, recent observational studies with propensity score-adjusted models found no relevant difference in AKI incidence between those exposed or not exposed to modern contrast agents, even in septic and ICU patients, suggesting that the risk of contrast- induced AKI (causal association) is much lower than previously thought and that contrast -associated AKI (temporal association) frequently has other causes. The absence of a post-contrast increase of biomarkers of kidney injury supports this concept. Hence, contrast-enhanced CT scan should not be postponed if required for the diagnosis of a life-threatening condition. In all other situations, the uncertain risk of contrast- induced AKI should be balanced against the risk of missing an important diagnosis, taking into account the possibility of alternative imaging procedures. Recent guidelines suggest using moderate contrast doses and prophylactic isotonic hydration in patients at risk although even the latter has been questioned. It is evident that in critically ill patients hydration should account for the volume status of the individual patient, balancing the risk of kidney hypoperfusion against the risk of fluid overload. A large RCT confirmed that acetylcysteine has no benefit and that bicarbonate is not better than saline in preventing contrast nephropathy.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — implementation considerations — emphasize that "It is important to differentiate between progression of chronic disease and acute injury", and that "small changes in GFR could be consistent with AKI, whereas only large changes in GFR would indicate progressive CKD", so "Clinicians will need to attend to other clinical indicators to be able to accurately identify the cause of changes in GFR". They also note that "Change in eGFR may be due to true change in GFR or due to changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine concentrations, including assay fluctuations", and that "Differentiating between these requires serial assessments and consideration of potential changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine". Finally, "Use of validated prediction models for progression of kidney disease may be able to incorporate numerous clinical factors and provide a single prognostic metric, which can guide decisions", and "Incorporation of such models into laboratory systems may facilitate their use".

### Acute kidney injury [^114DQC2P]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by a sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or oliguria, and classified by stage and cause. This type of injury occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients, with major complications including volume overload, electrolyte disorders, uremic complications, and drug toxicity. Management includes specific treatments according to the underlying cause and supportive treatment to prevent and manage complications. Kidney replacement therapy is used when complications cannot be managed with medical therapy alone. Despite advances in care, the mortality rate in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy remains approximately 50%.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vW8Xu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

What laboratory findings aid in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (> 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.

Discussion

Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reperfusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation. In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level > 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.CK values may become elevated within 12 hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy.

Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1–3 hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%. Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdomyolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.

### Worsening renal function: what is a clinically meaningful change in creatinine during hospitalization with heart failure? [^116pNAz5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worsening renal function during hospitalization for heart failure, defined as elevation in creatinine during admission, predicts adverse outcomes. Prior studies define worsening renal function using various creatinine elevations, but the relative value of definitions is unknown.

Methods and Results

In a prospective cohort of 412 patients hospitalized for heart failure, we compared a spectrum of worsening renal function definitions (absolute creatinine elevations ≥ 0.1 to ≥ 0.5 mg/dL and 25% relative elevation from baseline) and associations with 6-month mortality, readmission, and functional decline. Creatinine elevation ≥ 0.1 mg/dL occurred in 75% of patients, and elevation ≥ 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 24% of patients. Risk of death rose with higher creatinine elevations (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89, 1.19, 1.67, 1.91, and 2.90 for elevations ≥ 0.1 to ≥ 0.5 mg/dL). Maximum sensitivity of any definition for predicting mortality was 75% and maximum specificity was 79%. High creatinine elevation was a more important predictor of death than was a single measure of baseline creatinine.

Conclusions

Larger creatinine elevations predict highest risk of death, yet even minor changes in renal function are associated with adverse outcomes. The choice of a "best definition" for worsening renal function has implications for the number of patients identified with this risk factor and the magnitude of risk for mortality.

### Pseudohypercreatininemia after surgery for aortic dissection: a case report [^114sNhVn]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated creatinine concentrations often indicate acute renal injury and renal biopsies are considered in this situation. However, pseudohypercreatininemia is potential cause of elevated creatinine concentrations, and invasive interventions should be avoided.

Case Presentation

A 54-year-old woman underwent surgery for descending aortic dissection. Nine days postoperatively, her creatinine concentration increased from 1 mg/dl to 5.78 mg/dl (normal range, 0.47–0.7 mg/dl). Azotemia and hyperkalemia were absent and physical examination findings were unremarkable. Cystatin C concentration was 1.56 mg/l (normal range, 0.56–0.8 mg/l) and pseudohypercreatininemia was suspected. Testing with different reagents showed a creatinine concentration of 0.84 mg/dl. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G was markedly elevated, and creatinine and IgG fluctuated in parallel, suggesting the cause of the pseudohypercreatininemia. IgG4 was also elevated at 844 mg/dl. Immunosuppressive steroid therapy effectively decreased the IgG concentration and resolved the pseudohypercreatininemia.

Conclusions

In cases of elevated creatinine concentration with the presence of abnormal proteins, pseudohypercreatininemia should be considered. We report a rare case of pseudohypercreatininemia caused by polyclonal IgG.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^1116SwRL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The acceptance of a unifying definition of AKI has increased awareness of the syndrome and generated much knowledge on morbidity and outcome. Less attention has been given to recovery from AKI. Despite many limitations, non-recovery of AKI is best defined as the presence of AKI criteria, and partial recovery as a fall in AKI stage. Both are associated with the development of CKD and cardiovascular diseases, need of chronic dialysis and mortality. The incidence of non-recovery differs between studies and populations. Risk factors include high age, CKD, comorbidity, higher severity of AKI and acute disease. After an episode of AKI serial follow-up measurements of serum creatinine and proteinuria are warranted to diagnose progressive renal impairment and implement measures to manage CKD if necessary.

Are There Other Causes of a Falsely Elevated Serum Creatinine Level?

The concentration of creatinine in serum is the most widely used and commonly accepted measure of renal function in clinical medicine. In renal failure, deterioration of renal function, results in the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products, including creatinine.

In the absence of renal failure, elevated creatinine levels may be due to factors influencing creatine production as well as elimination. The total muscle mass is the most important determinant of the creatine pool size and thereby of creatinine production. Hence serum creatinine is increased in people with increased muscle mass, those with a high-meat diet, users of anabolic steroids, and weight lifters. Trauma or febrile states have been associated with significant increases in the excretion of creatinine.

Rhabdomyolysis or extensive crush injury may result in an increase of serum creatinine, at times exceeding what can be accounted for by the decrement in renal function, the excess creatinine is generally assumed to derive from injured muscle. But it was found that phosphocreatine was present in muscle in sufficient amounts to serve as a direct intermediate in the conversion of phosphocreatine to creatinine.

Other substances that can cause false elevations of the measured serum creatinine determined by the Jaffe method include ketoacids, acetone, pyruvate, glucose, uric acid, proteins, creatine, ascorbic acid, dopamine, and certain cephalosporins. High concentrations of bilirubin can falsely lower the serum creatinine concentration determined by the Jaffe method. Enzymatic methods for determining serum creatinine concentration are not affected by the presence of nitromethane in serum. Substances that can interfere with this enzymatic method when present in the serum include creatine, bilirubin, dopamine, dobutamine, ascorbic acid, and calcium dobesilate.

What are Some Other Common Laboratory Analysis Cross-reactivities of Interest to Toxicologists?

The techniques for detecting the presence of drugs include a variety of chromatographic methods, immunoassays, and chemical and spectrometric techniques. A number of interferences resulting in "false-positive" results have been reported. Some common, important interferences resulting in false-positive results are listed in Table 1.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^115TGqyP]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — initial biochemical diagnosis: Best Practice Advice 2 states that initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring ALA, PBG, and creatinine in a random urine sample, with during acute attacks both ALA and PBG elevated at least 5-fold the upper limit of normal; the levels are high enough that a random urine sample is sufficient and a 24-hour urine collection is not recommended, and ALA and PBG excretion should be normalized to that of creatinine.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^113tVgEZ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications

In routine primary care, most patients starting treatment with an ACEI/ARB have only minor changes in renal function. However, increases in creatinine concentrations of more than 10% after starting ACEI/ARB treatment affect more than 15% of patients and have important implications. We have shown that creatinine increases after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment were associated with cardiorenal risks in a "dose-response" relation, with no distinct cut-off at 30%, as previously suggested. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether ACEI/ARB associated changes in renal function unmask underlying pathophysiology or lead directly to adverse outcomes by causing permanent renal impairment in some patients. In addition, a better understanding of the overall risk-benefit ratio of continuing treatment after loss of kidney function for different prescribing indications is needed. Most importantly, patients with substantial increases in creatinine after starting ACEI/ARB treatment should be recognised as a very high risk group needing close ongoing monitoring. Review is needed of the risks and potential benefits of continuation of drug treatment for the specific prescribing indication for each patient.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^111HQHz8]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute renal failure (ARF) is a complex disorder that occurs in a variety of settings with clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. It is often under-recognized and is associated with severe consequences. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate the wide variation in etiologies and risk factors, describe the increased mortality associated with this disease (particularly when dialysis is required), and suggest a relationship to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and progression to dialysis dependency. Emerging evidence suggests that even minor changes in serum creatinine are associated with increased in-patient mortality. ARF has been the focus of extensive clinical and basic research efforts over the last decades. The lack of a universally recognized definition of ARF has posed a significant limitation. Despite the significant progress made in understanding the biology and mechanism of ARF in animal models, translation of this knowledge into improved management and outcomes for patients has been limited.

During the last five years, several groups have recognized these limitations and have worked to identify the knowledge gaps and define the necessary steps to correct these deficiencies. These efforts have included consensus conferences and publications from the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) ARF Advisory group, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN), and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) groups. Additionally, the critical care societies have developed formal intersociety collaborations such as the International Consensus Conferences in Critical Care. Recognizing that future clinical and translational research in ARF will require multidisciplinary collaborative networks, the ADQI group and representatives from three nephrology societies (ASN, ISN, and NKF) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine met in Vicenza, Italy, in September 2004. They proposed the term acute kidney injury (AKI) to reflect the entire spectrum of ARF, recognizing that an acute decline in kidney function is often secondary to an injury that causes functional or structural changes in the kidneys. The group established the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) as an independent collaborative network comprised of experts selected by the participating societies to represent both their area of expertise and their sponsoring organization. AKIN is intended to facilitate international, interdisciplinary, and intersocietal collaborations to ensure progress in the field of AKI and obtain the best outcomes for patients with or at risk for AKI.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^1133HscU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Moving toward a contemporary classification of drug-induced kidney disease [^116ZMMaE]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Classification system of drug-induced kidney injury based on functional and damage biomarkers suggested by Ostermann et al. Since most experts prefer the term "damage" to "injury" for describing the pathology and pathophysiology of AKI induced by different etiologies such as medications, we have replaced "injury" with "damage" in the title of each DIKD category introduced primarily by the ADQI expert group. Drug or drug class examples for each category have been provided just to clarify more this classification system of DIKD. Listed medications are only examples of each category, and they should not be considered all-inclusive. In the presence of susceptibility factors, medications belonging to "neither dysfunction nor damage group" can move to other categories. This is also true for the "dysfunction without damage" and "damage without dysfunction" categories. Arrows depict the possible movements between categories. The movement of a given patient at a specific time course from the "damage without dysfunction" category to the "dysfunction without damage" category or vice versa makes no sense from pharmacological and clinical perspectives. The bidirectional arrows mean that both the progression and recovery of DIKD are possible in certain categories

Neither dysfunction nor damage

Mechanisms

Medications that cause an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) without causing renal dysfunction or damage based on the current knowledge inevitably fit into this category. For instance, certain medications can decrease tubular secretion of creatinine, interfere with the creatinine assay, or enhance creatinine production without changing kidney function. To the current knowledge, these drugs are not nephrotoxic, and this clinical situation is referred to as pseudo-AKI. Competition with creatinine secretion at the proximal tubule, mediated via drug efflux transporters such as organic cation transporter, is a major proposed mechanism for medications of this category. These changes in SCr are independent of any significant alteration in GFR or damage to the glomeruli, tubules, or interstitium of the kidney. Accordingly, this category can also be called "SCr elevations without dysfunction or damage".

### Apparent renal disease due to elevated creatinine levels associated with the use of boldenone [^1157kHk3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The widespread use of reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alongside serum creatinine has led to a heightened appreciation of renal disease. However, creatinine is recognized as an insensitive marker of true GFR and therefore can lead to misdiagnosis of renal dysfunction in the absence of true pathology. We report the case of a 37-year-old male referred due to abnormal eGFR and creatinine in the absence of clinical signs, symptoms or other biochemical abnormalities of renal disease. Subsequent investigations based on a high index of suspicion for exogenous substance abuse led to a novel observation of significantly raised creatinine due to the presence of boldenone, an equine anabolic steroid commonly abused in body building.

### Fluctuations in serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^113oe6hz]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Creatinine level–based eGFR may not accurately reflect the severity of the kidney injury in the acute setting, as creatinine levels are often not increased until several days after AKI has occurred. Despite this shortcoming, the use of creatinine level–based eGFR has distinct advantages compared with current risk stratification strategies, which focus on the presence of AKI and an increase in serum creatinine levels over time. First, reliance on the definition of AKI may fail to recognize clinical outcomes of patients with smaller serum creatinine increases or variable creatinine level fluctuations. Second, these approaches still require information on baseline serum creatinine levels, which is not always available. In addition, efforts to estimate baseline creatinine levels from in-hospital creatinine tests or by using other patient-based equations were inaccurate and resulted in misclassifications of AKI.

A possible explanation for our findings is that an observed decrease in kidney function during hospitalization might reveal an existing decreased kidney reserve, unmasked by the stress of acute illness. Even though kidney function may seem to be recovered at discharge, the persistent reduction in kidney reserve could have long-term implications. Setting the threshold for normal kidney function at an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m² revealed no associations with 1-year mortality, implying that more substantial kidney damage may be required to influence long-term outcomes.
