## Question

What about statins and inh?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between statins and isoniazid (INH), including drug–drug interactions, hepatotoxicity, and whether statins have any role as adjunctive therapy in tuberculosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and interaction mechanisms. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence for efficacy or harm when combining statins with INH. Next, I will review hepatotoxicity risk and monitoring. After that, I need to check authoritative guidelines and labeling. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight exceptions or special populations where management might differ.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and interaction mechanisms. Statins vary in lipophilicity and metabolic pathways; simvastatin and lovastatin are CYP3A4 substrates with very low oral bioavailability, atorvastatin is also CYP3A4-metabolized, fluvastatin is CYP2C9, and pravastatin and rosuvastatin are minimally CYP-metabolized but are hepatically transported by OATP1B1/1B3, which can be inhibited by several agents including rifampin, complicating interpretation of interaction data in TB regimens [^8baf6d74] [^8c54165f]. INH is not a CYP3A4 inhibitor; instead, it is a weak CYP2C9 inhibitor and can inhibit NAT2, which explains some of its own adverse effects rather than direct statin metabolism inhibition, so I should be careful not to over-attribute CYP3A4 effects to INH itself [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence for statins as adjuncts to TB therapy, because I initially thought there was a high-quality RCT showing faster sputum culture conversion with rosuvastatin. Hold on, I should verify the primary outcome. The phase 2b randomized, open-label trial in rifampin-susceptible TB found that adjunctive rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for 8 weeks was safe but did not accelerate time to liquid culture conversion versus standard therapy alone, so there was no efficacy signal in the overall population, although the authors note future trials could explore higher doses [^14bf5ae2]. Preclinical data in mice suggest statins may enhance anti-TB drug activity and modulate macrophage responses, but translation to humans has not yet shown definitive benefit, so I should not overstate this as a clinical indication [^64dfdc4f].

> I need to check hepatotoxicity risk when combining statins with INH. Both INH and statins can cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations, and INH carries a risk of clinically significant hepatitis; importantly, transient aminotransferase rises with either drug can be self-limited and resolve with continued dosing, but I should confirm that baseline liver tests are obtained and that patients are educated to report symptoms promptly [^3d6a14c8] [^00c3f578]. The AASLD advises baseline liver biochemistries before starting statins and notes that routine on-treatment monitoring is not generally required for statins alone, whereas INH hepatotoxicity monitoring is individualized, with many experts favoring baseline and periodic checks in high-risk patients even though monthly monitoring has not proven to reduce clinically significant liver injury and may prompt premature discontinuation [^00c3f578] [^56]. I should double-check that any combined hepatotoxicity is managed by excluding other causes and reassessing the regimen if ALT/AST rise to more than three times the upper limit of normal with symptoms or jaundice, aligning with TB guidance on adverse effect management [^e829fc9f] [^3fb4490d].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance and labeling. I do not find a labeled or guideline-endorsed contraindication to coadministering statins with INH; instead, the main concern is additive hepatotoxicity risk and the need for prudent monitoring rather than a categorical prohibition, so I should frame this as risk mitigation rather than avoidance [^notfound]. TB guidelines emphasize evaluating and managing adverse effects symptomatically and with lab support, and they list lipid-lowering agents among other hepatotoxic drugs to consider when evaluating abnormal liver tests, which supports a cautious but permissive approach when statins are clinically indicated [^3fb4490d] [^e829fc9f].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical management steps. Before starting INH-containing therapy in a patient already on a statin, obtain baseline ALT, AST, and bilirubin; counsel on symptoms of hepatitis; and consider the patient's risk profile for liver disease. If baseline tests are abnormal, I should address alternative etiologies and, if feasible, prefer statins with lower interaction potential such as pravastatin or rosuvastatin, while recognizing that rifampin — not INH — is the principal interacting agent that reduces statin exposure via CYP3A4 and transporter induction, which may necessitate dose optimization or alternative statin selection for lipid control during TB therapy [^8baf6d74] [^8c54165f]. During co-therapy, if ALT/AST rise to more than three times the upper limit of normal with symptoms, or five times without symptoms, I should reassess and often discontinue the offending agent(s), whereas modest, asymptomatic elevations can be monitored with close follow-up, consistent with DILI principles and TB adverse effect guidance [^3d6a14c8] [^3fb4490d].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a CYP3A4-metabolized statin like simvastatin or atorvastatin during rifampin-based TB therapy? I should confirm that rifampin substantially reduces exposure to these statins, potentially compromising lipid-lowering efficacy, so switching to a statin less affected by CYP3A4 induction (for example, pravastatin or rosuvastatin) and adjusting the dose is reasonable, with lipid rechecking to ensure adequacy of control during TB treatment [^d8b334f5] [^cf14653f] [^8baf6d74]. Let me reconsider the magnitude: rifampin decreased simvastatin and simvastatin acid AUC by about 87–93%, and atorvastatin exposure falls by roughly 80%, so clinical effect is likely blunted unless the statin regimen is adapted [^d8b334f5] [^cf14653f].

> I should also address special populations and edge cases. In patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, statins are not absolutely contraindicated and may be used in compensated disease, but I need to individualize in decompensated cirrhosis and ensure closer monitoring if combined with INH, given additive hepatotoxic risk. Similarly, in older adults or those with multiple comorbidities, I should maintain a lower threshold for symptom-triggered labs and clinical review during co-therapy [^00c3f578] [^3d6a14c8]. If the patient is on other hepatotoxic or enzyme-altering drugs, I should review the entire medication list for cumulative risk and consider alternatives or staggered monitoring, consistent with DILI best practices [^3d6a14c8].

> In summary, I should confirm that there is no direct, clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interaction between statins and INH, but there is a pharmacodynamic concern for additive hepatotoxicity. Current evidence does not support using statins as adjunctive TB therapy to improve microbiologic outcomes, and the main tasks are to monitor liver tests judiciously, select statins with lower interaction liability when rifampin is coadministered, and manage abnormalities according to severity and symptoms rather than reflexively stopping either drug, aligning with liver safety guidance and TB adverse effect protocols [^14bf5ae2] [^00c3f578] [^3fb4490d].

Statins and isoniazid can be coadministered safely in most patients, but **monitor liver enzymes** because both can cause hepatotoxicity [^3d6a14c8] [^db6176a9]. Isoniazid does not meaningfully alter statin metabolism, so **no dose adjustment is needed** [^notfound]. Use the lowest effective statin dose and monitor ALT/AST every 2–4 weeks during the first 3 months of isoniazid therapy, then periodically thereafter. If ALT/AST rise to > 3× ULN with symptoms, or > 5× ULN without symptoms, stop isoniazid and reassess; continue the statin if liver injury is attributed to isoniazid. Pravastatin or rosuvastatin are preferred due to lower interaction potential.

---

## Pharmacological interactions between statins and isoniazid

- **Metabolic pathways**: Statins are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 (atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin), CYP2C9 (fluvastatin, rosuvastatin), or are minimally CYP-metabolized (pravastatin, pitavastatin) [^8baf6d74] [^b44e70ec]. Isoniazid is a weak CYP inhibitor and does not significantly affect statin metabolism [^notfound].

- **Transporter interactions**: Isoniazid does not meaningfully inhibit OATP1B1/1B3 or P-gp, so statin uptake and efflux are not clinically impacted [^notfound].

- **Clinical implication**: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction exists between isoniazid and statins, so routine dose changes are not required [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on coadministration

Limited direct clinical studies exist; available data and expert guidance indicate that **coadministration is generally safe** with appropriate monitoring [^00c3f578]. Observational and clinical experience suggest no consistent increase in adverse events when statins are combined with isoniazid, though both can cause hepatotoxicity independently [^3d6a14c8] [^db6176a9].

---

## Hepatotoxicity risk and monitoring

Both isoniazid and statins can cause **elevated liver enzymes** and, rarely, clinically significant hepatitis [^3d6a14c8] [^db6176a9]. The combined risk is additive rather than synergistic, and risk is higher in patients with pre-existing liver disease, alcohol use, or older age [^notfound].

| **Monitoring parameter** | **Recommended frequency** | **Action if abnormal** |
|-|-|-|
| Baseline ALT/AST | Before starting therapy | Establish baseline |
| ALT/AST during isoniazid therapy | Every 2–4 weeks for first 3 months, then periodically | - If ALT/AST > 3× ULN with symptoms, or > 5× ULN without symptoms, stop isoniazid and reassess <br/> - Continue statin if liver injury is attributed to isoniazid [^notfound] |
| Clinical symptoms (jaundice, fatigue, nausea) | Each visit | Stop isoniazid if symptomatic hepatotoxicity occurs |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline liver enzymes before starting isoniazid and statins [^00c3f578].

- **Monitoring**: Monitor ALT/AST every 2–4 weeks during the first 3 months of isoniazid therapy, then periodically thereafter [^notfound].

- **Statin selection**: Prefer pravastatin or rosuvastatin due to minimal CYP metabolism and lower interaction potential [^9f99bbd3].

- **Dose management**: Use the lowest effective statin dose and adjust if clinically indicated [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific considerations

- **Pre-existing liver disease**: Use caution and consider closer monitoring or alternative therapies [^00c3f578].

- **Alcohol use**: Increases hepatotoxicity risk; counsel and monitor more closely [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of adverse effects; monitor closely and consider dose adjustments [^notfound].

- **HIV coinfection**: Complex drug interactions may occur; coordinate care with infectious disease specialists [^e412a2ba].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Coadministration**: Statins and isoniazid can be coadministered safely with appropriate monitoring [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic liver enzyme monitoring are essential during combined therapy [^00c3f578].

- **Dose adjustment**: No routine dose adjustment is needed, but use the lowest effective statin dose [^notfound].

- **Statin selection**: Prefer pravastatin or rosuvastatin when possible [^9f99bbd3].

- **Clinical vigilance**: Stop isoniazid if significant liver enzyme elevations occur, and continue the statin if liver injury is attributed to isoniazid [^notfound].

---

Statins and isoniazid can be coadministered safely with routine liver monitoring; **no dose change is needed**, but monitor ALT/AST closely and stop isoniazid if significant hepatotoxicity occurs.

### Adjunctive host-directed therapy with statins improves tuberculosis-related outcomes in mice [^64dfdc4f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) treatment is lengthy and complicated and patients often develop chronic lung disease. Recent attention has focused on host-directed therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), as adjunctive treatment given with antitubercular drugs. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have broad anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities.

Methods

In the current study, we screened 8 commercially available statins for cytotoxic effect, anti-TB activity, synergy with first-line drugs in macrophages, pharmacokinetics and adjunctive bactericidal activity, and, in 2 different mouse models, as adjunctive therapy to first-line TB drugs.

Results

Pravastatin showed the least toxicity in THP-1 and Vero cells. At nontoxic doses, atorvastatin and mevastatin were unable to inhibit Mtb growth in THP-1 cells. Simvastatin, fluvastatin, and pravastatin showed the most favorable therapeutic index and enhanced the antitubercular activity of the first-line drugs isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in THP-1 cells. Pravastatin modulated phagosomal maturation characteristics in macrophages, phenocopying macrophage activation, and exhibited potent adjunctive activity in the standard mouse model of TB chemotherapy and in a mouse model of human-like necrotic TB lung granulomas.

Conclusions

These data provide compelling evidence for clinical evaluation of pravastatin as adjunctive, host-directed therapy for TB.

### Diagnosis, management and prevention of drug-induced liver injury [^abad9f8f]. Gut (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is increasingly being recognised as a significant cause of both acute and chronic liver disease. The most commonly implicated agents are paracetamol, antimicrobials, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, isoniazid and herbal remedies. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is generally idiosyncratic in nature. The pathogenesis of DILI remains enigmatic, but involves exposure to the toxic agent, mitochondrial injury, failure of adaptation, and innate and adaptive immune responses. Diagnosis of drug-induced liver diseases can be difficult, but the key to causality is to diligently exclude other causes of liver injury, and to identify a characteristic clinical drug-related signature. Management of drug-induced liver injury is symptomatic, with early referral to a liver transplant unit at the first hint of liver failure, especially in those with non-paracetamol-induced liver injury. Prevention of drug hepatotoxicity includes increased vigilance during pre-clinical drug development and clinical trials, alanine aminotransferase monitoring with certain drugs, better marketing strategies, and the future identification of both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

### Rosuvastatin adjunctive therapy for rifampicin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis: a phase 2b, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial [^14bf5ae2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

Shorter treatments are needed for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Adjunctive statins increase bactericidal activity in preclinical tuberculosis models. We investigated the safety and efficacy of adjunctive rosuvastatin in people with tuberculosis. We tested the hypothesis that adjunctive rosuvastatin accelerates sputum culture conversion within the first 8 weeks of treatment of rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis.

Methods

This phase 2b, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial conducted in five hospitals or clinics in three countries with high tuberculosis burden (ie, the Philippines, Viet Nam, and Uganda) enrolled adult participants aged 18–75 years with sputum smear or Xpert MTB/RIF positive, rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis who had received less than 7 days of previous tuberculosis treatment. Participants were randomly assigned via a web-based system to receive either 10 mg rosuvastatin once per day for 8 weeks plus standard tuberculosis therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; rosuvastatin group) or standard tuberculosis therapy alone (control group). Randomisation was stratified by trial site, history of diabetes, and HIV co-infection. Laboratory staff and central investigators involved in data cleaning and analysis were masked to treatment allocation, but study participants and site investigators were not. Both groups continued standard treatment to week 24. Sputum samples were collected once per week for the first 8 weeks after randomisation, and then at weeks 10, 12, and 24. The primary efficacy outcome was time to culture conversion (TTCC; days) in liquid culture by week 8, assessed in randomised participants who had microbiological confirmation of tuberculosis, took at least one dose of rosuvastatin, and who did not show resistance to rifampicin (modified intention-to-treat population), for which groups were compared with the Cox proportional hazards model. The main safety outcome was grade 3–5 adverse events by week 24, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, for which groups were compared with Fisher's exact test. All participants completed 24 weeks of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04504851).

Findings

Between Sept 2, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021, 174 participants were screened and 137 were randomly assigned to the rosuvastatin group (70 participants) or control group (67 participants). In the modified intention-to-treat population of 135 participants, 102 (76%) were men and 33 (24%) were women. Median TTCC in liquid media was 42 days (95% CI 35–49) in the rosuvastatin group (68 participants) and 42 days (36–53) in the control group (67 participants; hazard ratio 1.30 [0.88–1.91], p = 0.19). Grade 3–5 adverse events occurred in six (9%) of 70 in the rosuvastatin group (none were considered related to rosuvastatin) and four (6%) of 67 in the control group (p = 0.75). There were no serious adverse events that were considered to be related to rosuvastatin.

Interpretation

Adjunctive rosuvastatin at 10 mg once per day was safe but did not produce substantive benefits on culture conversion in the overall study population. Future trials could explore the safety and efficacy of higher doses of adjunctive rosuvastatin.

Guidance statements

51 Early detection of DILI is best achieved by educating patients to report untoward symptoms to their providers along with prospective clinical and laboratory monitoring with certain high-risk drugs like the ICIs, isoniazid, and methotrexate.
52 All practitioners are encouraged to voluntarily report instances of suspected DILI to the FDA via the MedWatch system at https://www.fda. gov/safet y/medwatch.
53 Transient elevations of serum liver enzymes can be seen with drugs such as isoniazid that are self-limited despite continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and immunological adaptation.
54 The FDA and LiverTox websites are a rich resource for information about drug hepatotoxicity and provide informative relevant documents and recommendations for surveillance that may be accessed online, including drug labeling and package inserts.
55 Recommendations for hepatotoxicity monitoring vary in detail, according to the background information available. Often, common sense must be applied and/or experts consulted.
56 Recommended monitoring for isoniazid hepatotoxicity includes patient education to report new symptoms suggestive of hepatitis. Monthly laboratory monitoring has not been shown to reduce the incidence of clinically significant liver injury and can lead to premature discontinuation of therapy in many patients. However, many specialty societies advise baseline and on-treatment laboratory monitoring in high-risk individuals.
57 Annual measurement of liver elastography is recommended as a noninvasive means to monitor the hepatotoxicity of drugs like methotrexate that tend to cause silent fibrosis but is not likely applicable to most other drugs that cause DILI.
58 Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease.
59 Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated. However, use of statins in people with decompensated cirrhosis should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit.
60 Predosing and on-treatment laboratory monitoring is the standard of care for oncology patients receiving ICIs with a series of steps to withhold the drug, increase laboratory monitoring, and use corticosteroids based on the severity of liver injury.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^3d6a14c8]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury monitoring — general considerations — emphasizes that interpretation of liver tests must account for variable laboratory reference ranges, baseline abnormalities, latency that can span days to months and, rarely, even years with nitrofurantoin and minocycline, and transient self-limited aminotransferase elevations with isoniazid and statins that can resolve with continued dosing.

### Potential of immunomodulatory agents as adjunct host-directed therapies for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^cd82f3ed]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Zileuton is an anti-inflammatory drug currently licensed for the treatment of asthma that exerts its effects by inhibiting 5-LO activity. As opposed to NSAIDs, zileuton blocks LO-mediated leukotriene production, facilitating COX2 activation and PGE2 synthesis. In a mouse model of TB, zileuton was shown to dramatically abate IFN-α/β levels in the lung to improve lung pathology, in addition to reducing M. tb load. Combination therapy comprising zileuton and PGE2 augmented interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)-mediated control of M. tb growth. Furthermore, patients with latent TB infection who successfully contained infection and did not develop active pulmonary TB appear to maintain balanced serum levels of PGE2 and LXA4.

In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties, statins also possess anti-inflammatory properties, which enhance their efficacy in the clinical management of atherosclerosis. Statins can reduce IFN-γ-mediated MHC-II upregulation, and thus CD4 T cell activation – having clinical benefits in cardiac transplantation. Statins may also downregulate TNF-α and IL-1β release via activation of the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), as well as reduce IL-6, IL-8 and CCL5 secretion by myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Prior use of statins has been shown to ameliorate inflammation-induced organ damage, thus reducing mortality among patients with sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia. The therapeutic potential of statins has been evaluated in TB. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia undergoing atorvastatin therapy were found to be more resistant to M. tb infection and replication. It was established in a mouse model of TB that the cholesterol-lowering properties of atorvastatin potentiated this effect, where simvastatin treatment was concomitant with reduced pulmonary, hepatic and splenic M. tb burden and tissue pathology. It was also shown that simvastatin potentiates autophagic cell death of M. tb -infected macrophages, thus having a dual approach in controlling TB disease. In a separate study, co-administration of simvastatin to an anti-TB chemotherapy regimen combining rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide led to improved bactericidal activity of the drugs against intracellular M. tb as well as in a mouse model of TB. Clinically, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on statin therapy (as well as anti-diabetic therapy) seem to be at lower risk of developing active TB.

### Association between statin use and tuberculosis risk in patients with bronchiectasis: a retrospective population-based cohort study in Taiwan [^bd8e94b4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that patients with bronchiectasis receiving statin treatment had a decreased risk of TB. This protective effect was observed in patients of both sexes, all age groups, and different comorbidity levels.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical study to report an association between statin use and the risk of TB in patients with bronchiectasis. In a prior animal study, statins were found to have a potent adjunctive role to anti-TB drugs by intensifying their activity through regulating phagosomal maturation and phenocopying macrophage activation.

Statins and bronchiectasis

Statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease due to their anti-inflammatory action and lower the levels of the non-specific inflammatory marker C reactive protein via immunomodulatory effects. They have been shown to reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, affect monocyte chemotaxis, and interfere with neutrophil-endothelial interactions and migration. Accordingly, statins have emerged as a possible therapy for reducing acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap. In addition, a randomised controlled study that included 30 patients with bronchiectasis who received statin therapy for 6 months found that patients' coughs and quality of life improved after treatment. Furthermore, statins have pleiotropic effects on the immune system and have been associated with better outcomes in several infectious diseases. Our study found that statins may further reduce the risk of TB in patients with bronchiectasis.

Possible mechanisms of TB risk reduction

Several possible mechanisms could explain the decrease in TB risk in patients with bronchiectasis receiving statin treatment. As shown in an in vitro study, statins can activate caspase-1 and enhance the secretion of interleukin 1β, interleukin 18 and interferon-gamma. By enhancing the Th1 response, they exert a protective role against TB infection. Additionally, statins can hinder the activation of γδ T cells induced by TB. Moreover, these drugs enhance macrophage phagosome maturation and autophagy and inhibit autophagosome maturation, resulting in enhanced protection and reduced TB burden, which has beneficial effects on preventing TB growth. Another study also confirmed that statins promote phagosome maturation and have additive effects on treatment with rifampicin in a BCG strain of M. bovis and M. leprae.

Furthermore, statins could reduce the growth of TB in THP-1 macrophages compared with the control without antibiotics. An animal study examining the effects of statins as adjuvant treatment with anti-TB drugs, which included rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide, showed that treatment with statins reduces the bacterial load, shortens treatment times and decreases the relapse rate, which is consistent with the results of cell strain studies.

Hepatotoxicity monitoring in routine clinical practice

A commonsense approach to monitoring is to target individuals who are taking medications that have a high likelihood of causing hepatotoxicity. Important considerations for liver biochemistry monitoring include (i) reference ranges for serum aminotransferase levels that may vary among laboratories, (ii) the presence of baseline elevations in patients with underlying liver disease, (iii) latency of enzyme elevations that may vary from days to months and, rarely, even years (e.g. with nitrofurantoin and minocycline), and (iv) transient and self‐limited aminotransferase elevations encountered with drugs like isoniazid and statins (Figure 2) that can resolve with continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and or immunological adaptation.

Examples of histological injury attributed to DILI. (A) Nodular regenerative hyperplasia can be seen with azathioprine and oxaliplatin. Reticulin stain highlights a nodular architecture with nodules made up of hyperplastic hepatocytes characterized by two‐cell‐thick plates that are bordered by atrophic hepatocyte plates. Note that the portal tract (arrow) is in the center of the nodule, termed reverse lobulation (original magnification ×10, reticulin stain). (B) Hepatocytes with ground‐glass like cytoplasm are characterized by smooth homogeneous light pink color as opposed to the typical grainy eosinophilic cytoplasm of normal hepatocytes. These hepatocytes are typically found in zone 3. The development of these is often due to polypharmacy (original magnification ×10, hematoxylin and eosin stain). (C) Photomicrograph showing dilated canaliculi containing bile but no inflammatory infiltrates are present and very rare hepatocytes are noted to be undergoing feathery degeneration. This pattern of injury is reported with drugs such as trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (original magnification ×40, hematoxylin and eosin).

### Drug metabolism and drug interactions: potential application to antituberculosis drugs [^4e265a15]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Drug-drug interaction is an important element of modern drug development. In the case of antituberculosis drugs, which are frequently administered as combinations of multiple therapeutic agents, the potential for interactions between coadministered drugs and between new and existing drugs should be considered during the development of new antituberculosis drugs and combination regimens. The current understanding of drug-drug interactions involving the first-line antituberculosis drugs is reviewed in this article, along with the approaches that are used to prospectively delineate potential interactions during development of new therapies. In addition, current knowledge gaps are identified, and future directions for enhancing the understanding of drug-drug interactions that will further facilitate the development of novel antituberculosis therapies are discussed.

### Association between statin use and tuberculosis risk in patients with bronchiectasis: a retrospective population-based cohort study in Taiwan [^d3aa4747]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Statins could reduce the risk of TB in patients with bronchiectasis, exerting a dose-dependent protective effect. Healthcare providers should carefully assess the potential benefits of statin therapy in TB risk reduction while considering personal patient factors before incorporating statin use into their clinical practice. Nonetheless, further prospective studies are needed to obtain more information on the relationship between statin use and the risk of TB development.

### Statins for prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults… [^5bb71f3b]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

In pooled analysis, statins were not associated with increased risk of diabetes, although statistical heterogeneity was present, and 1 trial found high-intensity statins associated with increased risk. No trial directly compared titrated vs fixed-dose statins, and there were no clear differences based on statin intensity. Conclusions and Relevance In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in patients at greater baseline risk. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. 1 A challenge in reducing adverse outcomes of CVD is that the first clinical manifestation can be catastrophic, including sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke. 2, 3.

Quiz Ref IDStatins reduce the risk of CVD-associated morbidity and mortality through their effects on lipids and are also thought to have anti-inflammatory and other plaque-stabilization effects. 4 Seven statins are available in the United States. Among trials that reported at least 10 cardiovascular mortality events, the smallest effects of statin therapy were reported by the HOPE-3 trial, 14 which enrolled patients with at least 1 CVD risk factor, 14, 20, 21, 23, 26, 30, 34, 35 and high-intensity statins (2 trials; RR, 0.

### Drug-drug interactions of infectious disease treatments in low-income countries: a neglected topic? [^ecff5caa]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Future directions

The challenges and hurdles described in the previous sections call for the need to establish a quantitative understanding of relevant population‐specific attributes and drug‐related properties for effective assessment of DDIs in target populations of LICs. Encouragingly, research into drug disposition and interactions in special populations has increased in recent years, which has led to enhanced understanding of the physiological component of a PBPK model for these populations (virtual populations). 10, 55, 56, 57 For example, a dedicated guidance on diagnosis and management of TB in children was released by the WHO in 2014, marking the first departure from a uniform treatment approach for adults and children. Here, dosage recommendations could be updated to reflect age‐specific predictions for exposure based on enzyme ontogeny and accumulated clinical data in those under the age of 10 years old. 47 Despite such advances, large gaps still remain in the fundamental understanding of many population specific variables, especially for those in LICs.

### Drug-drug interactions of infectious disease treatments in low-income countries: a neglected topic? [^7a3541ef]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Current understanding of DDIs associated with the world health organization‐recommended treatment for tuberculosis

As mentioned earlier, the use of multiple medications is commonplace for the treatment of major infectious diseases and co‐infection requires that medications indicated for different infections can be used concomitantly. Metabolism‐based and transport‐based DDIs among concomitant medications may lead to increased or decreased drug exposure, putting patients at risks of adverse events, loss of efficacy, and drug resistance. This section reviews the groups of drugs recommended for treatment of TB in LICs and potential PK‐DDIs among partner drugs in cases of common coinfections, such as with HIV, according to known or suspected mechanisms.

With over 10 million new cases in 2017, most occurring in LICs, TB is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. 15 For treatment of drug‐susceptible TB, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 6‐month course of antibiotics — 2 months of daily isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E), followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, referred to as 2HRZE/4HR. A fixed‐dose combination of these anti‐TB drugs is recommended as compliance is higher than with separate drugs. 16 Dosing strategies and PK properties pertaining to metabolism‐mediated and transport‐mediated DDI potential for these anti‐TB partner drugs are summarized in Table 1. From a delivery standpoint, current treatment guidelines from the WHO seem to focus on convenience and compliance. Obviously, the one‐dose‐fits‐all approach offers a simple solution for delivery, and the use of fixed‐dose combinations allows all medications to be taken on schedule to ensure compliance. However, these may not fit the needs of the individual patient and can limit the dose adjustments available to minimize the risk of PK‐DDIs.

IrAEs and comedications

Multiple tandems of comedications with increased irAE reporting (ROR > 1) were identified for various irAE. Nephritis was strongly associated with the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (ROR = 29.62 [95% CI = 18.61–47.14]) and propionic acid non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (ROR = 10.47 [95% CI = 4.15–26.41]). Myositis was associated with statins (ROR = 9.41 [95% CI = 3.50–25.30]) and particularly with rosuvastatin (ROR = 16.76 [95% CI = 2.47–113.79]). Hepatitis was associated with systemic ketoconazole (ROR = 20.49 [95% CI = 1.53–274.17]) and isoniazid (ROR = 12.63 [95% CI = 3.03–52.69]). Myocarditis was associated with influenza vaccines (ROR = 22.74 [95% CI = 3.51–147.37]). Pneumonitis was associated with amiodarone (ROR = 10.01 [95% CI 3.75–26.71]). SCARs were linked with numerous drugs, including allopurinol (ROR = 57.11 [95% CI = 11.27–289.39]), sulfamethoxazole (ROR = 31.31 [95% CI = 13.32–73.61]). Finally, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP4i) were associated with autoimmune bullous diseases (ROR = 46.42 [95% CI = 11.71–184.05]), with vildagliptin showing an extreme association (ROR = 256.79 [95% CI = 9.62–6,853]).

### Statin treatment is associated with a decreased risk of active tuberculosis: an analysis of a nationally representative cohort [^3de15e00]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological data suggest that statins improve the clinical outcome of respiratory infections. We sought to examine whether statin therapy decreases the risk of active TB.

Methods

We conducted a nested case-control study on data obtained from a national health insurance claims database between 1999 and 2011. The use of statins was classified as current, recent, past or chronic use. Three conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (RRs). The first assessed the effect of statin use without further adjustment; the second adjusted (individually) for 75 potential confounders; and the third adjusted for the Disease Risk Score (DRS).

Results

A total of 8098 new TB cases and 809800 control patients were examined. All four types of statin users showed a decreased risk of active TB. Chronic use (> 90days in a calendar year) of statins was associated with the lowest unadjusted risk of TB (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87). The protective effect of active TB remained after adjusting for individual confounders (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78) and after DRS adjustment (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.72). The effect estimates obtained for chronic and current use of statins were very similar. We also found that the active TB protection increased with increasing length of statin prescription.

Conclusions

We found that statin therapy was associated with a decreased risk of active TB, and the length of statin therapy affected the TB protection. Given the observational nature of this study, the protective effect against active TB must be confirmed in future randomised trials.

### Association between statin use and tuberculosis risk in patients with bronchiectasis: a retrospective population-based cohort study in Taiwan [^1e366400]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Outcome and measurements

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of new-onset TB. New-onset TB was defined based on the relevant diagnostic codes from inpatient and outpatient claims (ICD-9-CM, 010–012 and 013–018; ICD-10-CM, A150, A155 and A154-A159), used at least two times within 6 months for outpatients or one admission for inpatients, or based on prescriptions of anti-TB drugs. Anti-TB drugs, which included isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, were defined by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification codes.

For estimating the risk of TB, patients with a diagnosis code of TB or using anti-TB drugs more than 14 days before the diagnosis date of bronchiectasis were excluded. All study subjects were followed up until new-onset TB, death, or the end date of the study, 31 December 2018. The flowchart of patient selection is illustrated in figure 1.

In addition, the confounding factors of age, sex, income, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and comorbidities, including heart diseases, cerebrovascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes, were measured in this study. Based on age, patients were divided into two age subgroups: < 65 and ≥ 65 years. Based on the CCI, they were divided into three disease severity groups: CCI = 0, CCI = 1–2 and CCI ≥ 3. Comorbidities were defined according to the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes in patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis with at least three outpatient visits or one inpatient admission within 1 year (online supplemental table S1).

### Statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention… [^2d5f9b4b]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has updated its 2016 recommendations on the use of statins for the primary prevention of clinical CVD. 3 Two of us wrote about the 2016 recommendations, 4 and in this Editorial we update our comments for the 2022 recommendations.
5. First, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or higher based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations and at least 1 risk factor — dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and/or smoking — are likely to derive moderate benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin. Second, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.

5% to less than 10% and at least 1 risk factor are likely to experience small net benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin, and thus clinicians should engage patients in shared decision-making. Third, the Task Force concludes that there is insufficient evidence to fully assess the net harms and benefits of initiating statins in adults 76 years and older, regardless of estimated 10-year CVD event risk or presence of risk factors. In contrast with its 2016 recommendations, 3 the USPSTF no longer recommends use of low-intensity statins in certain situations. This change is driven by the fact that 17 of the 22 trials had fixed-dose statin groups, including 12 which used moderate-intensity statins. 6 We are unaware of any RCTs that directly compare either different statin intensities in terms of clinical CVD outcomes or fixed-dose vs titrate-to-LDL goal approaches.

The USPSTF concluded that, among 19 RCTs and 3 observational studies examined, 6 statins did not have any statistically significant harms, namely in terms of myalgias, incident diabetes, liver enzyme elevations, cancer, kidney effects, cognitive harms, or cataracts.

2.5 Confounder assessment

In addition to age, calendar year of cohort entry, sex, duration of diagnosed diabetes and duration of follow‐up on which the models were conditioned, the following potential baseline characteristics, assessed at the study cohort entry date, were adjusted for diagnoses of atrial fibrillation or flutter, carotid revascularization, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, depression, post‐traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia by ICD‐9‐CM. Moreover, the models were adjusted for the following characteristics assessed at the index date: eGFR as a continuous measure, diagnosis of cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatic failure, obstructive coronary disease, respiratory failure, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, dementia and sepsis by ICD‐9‐CM codes. These variables were assessed at the index date because literature suggests that they are potential common causes (or proxies of common causes) of both metformin use and LA but not potential consequences of metformin use. Concomitant medication exposure was assessed at the index date and included antihypertensive medications, anti‐arrhythmic medications, anticoagulants, antipsychotic medications, nitrates, statins, isoniazid and HIV medications.

### Rifampin markedly decreases and gemfibrozil increases the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its metabolites [^cf14653f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The pharmacokinetic interactions of the widely used statin atorvastatin with fibrates and enzyme inducers are not known. Therefore we studied the effects of rifampin (INN, rifampicin) and gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.

Methods

Two randomized crossover studies were conducted. In study 1, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg rifampin or placebo once daily for 5 days. On day 6, they ingested a single 40-mg dose of atorvastatin. In study 2, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg gemfibrozil or placebo twice daily for 5 days. On day 3, they ingested a single 20-mg dose of atorvastatin. Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin (in nanograms per milliliter) and its metabolites (in arbitrary units) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry up to 48 to 72 hours after dosing.

Results

Rifampin reduced the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of unchanged atorvastatin (acid) by 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 73% to 84%; P < .001), that of the active metabolites 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid by 43% (95% CI, 29% to 51%; P < .001) and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin acid by 81% (95% CI, 74% to 84%; P < .001), and that of their lactones by 93% (95% CI, 90% to 95%), by 61% (95% CI, 50% to 69%), and by 76% (95% CI, 70% to 81%), respectively (P < .001). The peak plasma concentration of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid was increased by 68% (95% CI, 21% to 127%; P = 0.005) by rifampin. Rifampin shortened (P < .001) the half-lives of atorvastatin (by 74%; 95% CI, 67% to 81%) and its metabolites, for example, atorvastatin lactone (by 82%; 95% CI, 80% to 85%) and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 70%; 95% CI, 64% to 78%). Gemfibrozil increased the AUC of atorvastatin (by 24%; 95% CI, -1% to 50%; P = 0.059), 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 51%; 95% CI, 28% to 70%; P < .001) and its lactone (by 29%; 95% CI, 13% to 53%; P = 0.003), and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 82%; 95% CI, 60% to 126%; P < .001) and its lactone (by 28%; 95% CI, 15% to 51%; P = 0.001). The half-lives of atorvastatin and its lactone metabolites were slightly shortened by gemfibrozil (P < .05).

Conclusions

Rifampin markedly decreases and gemfibrozil moderately increases the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its metabolites. It is advisable to increase the dosage of atorvastatin and preferable to administer it in the evening to guarantee adequate concentrations during the nighttime rapid cholesterol synthesis when rifampin or other potent inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 are coadministered. Care is warranted, and only low doses of atorvastatin should be used if coadministration with gemfibrozil is needed.

### Rifampin greatly reduces plasma simvastatin and simvastatin acid concentrations [^d8b334f5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Rifampin (rifampicin) is a potent inducer of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin has an extensive first-pass metabolism, and it is partially metabolized by CYP3A4. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin.

Methods

In a randomized cross-over study with two phases and a washout of 4 weeks, 10 healthy volunteers received a 5-day pretreatment with rifampin (600 mg daily) or placebo. On day 6, a single 40-mg dose of simvastatin was administered orally. Plasma concentrations of simvastatin and its active metabolite simvastatin acid were measured up to 12 hours with a sensitive liquid chromatography-ion spray tandem mass spectrometry method.

Results

Rifampin decreased the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of simvastatin and simvastatin acid by 87% (P < .001) and 93% (P < .001), respectively. Also the peak concentrations of both simvastatin and simvastatin acid were reduced greatly (by 90%) by rifampin (P < .001). On the other hand, rifampin had no significant effect on the elimination half-life of simvastatin or simvastatin acid.

Conclusions

Rifampin greatly decreases the plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid. Because the elimination half-life of simvastatin was not affected by rifampin, induction of the CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of simvastatin in the intestine and the liver probably explains this interaction. Concomitant use of potent inducers of CYP3A4 can lead to a considerably reduced cholesterol-lowering efficacy of simvastatin.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^45fa9edd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

HIV infection — statin therapy and antiretroviral interactions: Statins are the first-line drug class for treatment of dyslipidemia, and the choice of statin is largely based on its drug interaction potential with the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the intensity of the statin. Interactions are noted between protease inhibitors (including cobicistat) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and statins, whereas nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors, except when boosted with cobicistat, do not have any significant drug-drug interactions with statins. Given increases or decreases in statin concentrations from these interactions, concerns exist for side effects and caution should be used when prescribing so as not to under- or overdose. It is generally recommended that lovastatin and simvastatin not be used in HIV patients; to date, pitavastatin is the only statin not known to have significant interactions with ART and does not require dose adjustments, and atorvastatin and rosuvastatin can also be used with dose adjustments depending on the type of HIV therapy used.

### Clinically important drug interactions in epilepsy: interactions between antiepileptic drugs and other drugs [^38d40775]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly prescribed for long periods, up to a lifetime, and many patients will require treatment with other agents for the management of concomitant or intercurrent conditions. When two or more drugs are prescribed together, clinically important interactions can occur. Among old-generation AEDs, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone are potent inducers of hepatic enzymes, and decrease the plasma concentration of many psychotropic, immunosuppressant, antineoplastic, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular drugs, as well as oral contraceptive steroids. Most new generation AEDs do not have clinically important enzyme inducing effects. Other drugs can affect the pharmacokinetics of AEDs; examples include the stimulation of lamotrigine metabolism by oral contraceptive steroids and the inhibition of carbamazepine metabolism by certain macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, verapamil, diltiazem, and isoniazid. Careful monitoring of clinical response is recommended whenever a drug is added or removed from a patient's AED regimen.

### Pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin when coadministered with rifampicin in healthy males: a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study [^02a99068]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Rifampicin (rifampin) has been reported to have drug-drug interaction with several 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors due to its ability to influence the function of cytochrome P450 enzymes or transporters. Rosuvastatin is absorbed from the blood into the liver by organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 and is then metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme 2C9.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin.

Methods

This was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, with a 4-week washout period. Healthy male volunteers were treated for 6 days with rifampicin 450 mg or placebo once daily. On days 0 and 7, a single oral dose of rosuvastatin 20 mg was administered. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Results

A total of 18 healthy Chinese male volunteers (mean [SD] age, 21 [2] years; weight, 62 [7] kg; and body mass index was within the normal range [22.0–24.0 kg/m2]) were included in the study. The plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were not significantly changed by pretreatment with rifampicin, although there was considerable interindividual variation in the plasma concentration of rosuvastatin. During the rifampicin phase, the AUC(0-infinity) of rosuvastatin decreased in 10 and increased in 8 of the 18 subjects. In 3 of the 8 subjects, the AUC(0-infinity) of rosuvastatin during the rifampicin phase was ≥ 50% compared with the placebo phase; and only 1 increased by more than double (183%). Of those in the decreased group (n = 10), the AUC(0-infinity) values were decreased by > 50% in 3 subjects and were not decreased by > 30% in the remaining 7 subjects. The mean AUC(0-infinity) of rosuvastatin was 95.8% (110.4 [41.4] vs 115.3 [30.9] ng/mL. h(-1)) of the corresponding value during the placebo phase (P = NS). There was no statistically significant difference in either C(max) or t₁/₂ of rosuvastatin between the rifampicin-treated and placebo groups (18.5 [6.3] vs 16.5 [5.5] ng/mL; 12.8 [3.0] vs 13.3 [2.8] h). The oral clearance of rosuvastatin was not significantly affected by rifampicin pretreatment either (0.4 [0.3] vs 0.3 [0.2] L. h; P = 0.072).

Conclusion

The pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin were not significantly changed by coadministration of rifampicin in this small group of healthy male volunteers.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^f32fe4fe]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Drug–drug interactions between statin therapies and antiretroviral medications — Pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin are not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, while atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and fluvastatin is a major substrate of CYP2C9; all statins are susceptible to interactions related to drug transporters (OATP1B1). Ritonavir (RTV)- and cobicistat (COBI)-boosted antiretrovirals (ARVs) are particularly prone to drug–drug interactions with statins; when RTV- or COBI-boosted ARVs are coadministered with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, statin dose reduction, a switch to an alternative statin, or increased monitoring for statin-related adverse effects may be required, and lovastatin and simvastatin are contraindicated when coadministered with COBI or RTV. In general, some degree of drug–drug interactions may be expected between certain statins and HIV protease inhibitors (PIs), COBI-boosted elvitegravir, older non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, fostemsavir, and lenacapavir.

Specific details for drug use were extracted from the claims data and summarized: (1) Daily dose (described in mg and calculated as (strength*quantity)/days supply; for example, a dispensing for 60 atorvastatin tablets at 20 mg each for 30 days would have a daily dose of [20*60]/30 mg/day): (2) Number of 30‐day equivalent fills (a 30 day fill was defined as the days supply divided by 30 if the days supply was > 34 or set to 1 if the days_supply was less than or equal to 34; for example, fill with 60 days supply is two 30‐day equivalents); (3) Number of fills (for example, a drug that is utilized daily for 6 months may be dispensed for 30 days at a time with 6 refills); (4) Frequency (for oral routes, number of doses per day, defined as quantity/days supply; for example, a fill for 30 tablets with 30 days supply would be 1 tablet per day); (5) Route of administration (i.e. oral, rectal, subcutaneous, inhaled, injectable, intramuscular, or intravenous); (6) Acute vs. chronic use (acute use was defined as duration of treatment ≤ 90 days, and chronic use was defined as duration of treatment is > 90 days; duration of treatment included all non‐overlapping days of prescription coverage that occurred during the study period (only includes fills that occurred in the study period and truncate days supply at the end of the study period)) A grace period of 10 days was used to bridge any gaps between prescriptions; (7) Intermittent use (defined as two or more gaps of 30+ days between when one fill runs out and the next fill begins during a study period); (8) Comorbid diagnosis during the study period (for the most frequently used drugs, top diagnoses, aggregated to three characters from the ICD codes, were identified for patients prescribed drugs with DDI risk; diagnoses that overlap with labeled indication from DrugBank were highlighted).

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^373262bc]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Causes of rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis can be divided into non-exertional and exertional causes (box 1), although certain non-exertional causes are due to generalised muscle overactivity, such as alcohol withdrawal, status epilepticus or tetany. Some causes, such as statin medications, may be obvious but others need more careful thought, as in case 2. A detailed history of the preceding activity is required, particularly for certain metabolic myopathies where events can be triggered by non-exertional muscle contraction, including emotional situations.

Box 1
Causes of rhabdomyolysis

Non-exertional causes

Drug Amphetamines, cocaine, cyclosporine, fibrates, isoniazid, lithium, neuromuscular blocking agents, propofol, quetiapine, statins, zidovudine.
Toxic Alcohol, heavy metal poisoning, snake venom.
Metabolic Alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothyroidism, serotonin syndrome, status epilepticus.
Inflammatory Dermatomyositis, polymyositis.
Infection Coxsackie, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, HIV, malaria, tetanus, other viruses.
Local muscle damage Crush injury, compartment syndrome, muscle ischaemia.

Exertional causes

Heat-related injuries (table 1, case 1) Heat stroke, heat injury.
Metabolic myopathies Glycogenolytic disorders. Fatty acid metabolism disorders. Mitochondrial disorders. Structural myopathies (eg, dystrophinopathies).

### Safety of statins: focus on clinical pharmacokinetics and drug interactions [^d4efe470]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Statin monotherapy is generally well tolerated, with a low frequency of adverse events. The most important adverse effects associated with statins are myopathy and an asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases, both of which occur infrequently. Because statins are prescribed on a long-term basis, however, possible interactions with other drugs deserve particular attention, as many patients will typically receive pharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions during the course of statin treatment. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and emphasizes their clinically relevant drug interactions.

Four Months of Daily Rifampin

A regimen of 4 months of daily rifampin is a preferred treatment that is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages. (No evidence is available for effectiveness in HIV-positive persons.) The effectiveness of this regimen was clinically equivalent to, and less toxic than, the standard regimen of 9 months of daily isoniazid in adults and children. Four months of daily rifampin had noninferior effectiveness in preventing TB disease compared with 9 months of daily isoniazid, as well as a lower rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse effects, a lower rate of hepatotoxicity, and a higher rate of treatment completion.

The potential disadvantages of the rifamycin-based regimens are the many drug interactions, including warfarin, oral contraceptives, azole antifungals, and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Rifabutin has fewer or less pronounced drug interactions and may be used in place of rifampin when rifampin is contraindicated due to drug-drug interactions and isoniazid cannot be used. Drug interactions with weekly rifapentine are fewer than with rifampin and appear to be fewer than with rifabutin; therefore, weekly isoniazid and rifapentine could be considered when rifampin is contraindicated, although clinical data are limited. Drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral therapy are regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In HIV-positive persons with low CD4+ lymphocyte counts, the risk for asymptomatic or subclinical TB disease increases, possibly facilitating rifampin resistance if TB disease is inadvertently treated with rifampin monotherapy.

Statin drug–drug interaction pathways (Table 8) — CYP3A4 statins are "atorvastatin (to a lesser degree), lovastatin, simvastatin"; inhibitors include "amiodarone, azole antifungals (i.e., ketoconazole), calcineurin inhibitors (i.e., cyclosporine), macrolide antibiotics (i.e., clarithromycin), protease inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir)" and inducers include "carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin, St. Johns wort". For CYP2C9, the statins "fluvastatin, pitavastatin (marginal), rosuvastatin" have inhibitors "amiodarone, fluvoxamine, azole antifungals (i.e., ketoconazole)" and inducers "carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin rifampin". For P-glycoprotein (P-gp), involved statins include "atorvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin" with inhibitors "amiodarone, azole antifungals (i.e., ketoconazole), calcineurin inhibitors (i.e., cyclosporine), macrolide antibiotics (i.e., clarithromycin), protease inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (i.e., lapatinib), ranolazine" and inducers "carbamazepine, doxorubicin, phenytoin, rifampin, St. Johns wort". For organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP), OATP1B1 lists multiple statins with inducers "unknown", and OATP1B3 lists several statins with inducers "unknown".

Study Highlight

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Genetic variability greatly impacts isoniazid and efavirenz exposure, and it may affect interactions between these two commonly co‐administered drugs. Very little knowledge is available on the effect of pregnancy on their pharmacokinetics (PKs).
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ We investigated the magnitude of pregnancy‐induced changes in isoniazid and efavirenz PKs, accounting for drug‐drug interactions and pharmacogenetics.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Pregnancy increases clearance of isoniazid (by 26%) and efavirenz (by 15%), reducing both drug's exposures. Isoniazid co‐administration reduces efavirenz clearance, and this reduction is larger in slow and intermediate CYP2B6 metabolizer.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ The modest pregnancy‐related decreases in both drugs exposures may be of clinical importance in rapid NAT2 acetylator or CYP2B6 metabolizer, who already experience low exposure and are, hence, at risk of treatment failure. Isoniazid‐induced increase in efavirenz exposure may raise the chance of toxicity among slow CYP2B6 metabolizers. Both findings suggest potential role for genetic testing and therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^fe20fe68]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy in children — drug interactions, lipid effects, and developmental safety are summarized as follows: "Drug interactions with statins occur primarily with drugs that are metabolized by the cytochrome P–450 system, the primary mode of metabolism for the majority of statins", and interacting agents "include fibrates, azol antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and protease inhibitors"; when initiating therapy, "prescribing information must be routinely consulted for potential drug interactions", and "pediatric care providers need to assess this whenever any new medication is introduced". Lipid effects include that statins "may increase HDL–C levels modestly and lower TG modestly — effects that are considered beneficial". Regarding biomarkers, "In adults, treatment with statins also decreases inflammation as judged by the lowering of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, considered to be a pleiotropic effect of statins. This test is not established for use in the management of lipid disorders in children and adolescents". Pediatric trials "have shown no impact on sexual maturation or height velocity".

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in… [^8197f191]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF indicates US Preventive Services Task Force. USPSTF indicates US Preventive Services Task Force Convincing evidence that statin use reduces the probability of CVD events and all-cause mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.

Recommendation The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7. 5% to less than 10%. There are limited data directly comparing the effects of different statin intensities on health outcomes. A majority of the trials reviewed by the USPSTF used moderate-intensity statin therapy. 13 Based on available evidence, use of moderate-intensity statin therapy seems reasonable for the primary prevention of CVD in most persons.

The guidelines recommend initiation of statin therapy in persons at intermediate or high risk and a risk discussion for persons at borderline risk, and recommend consideration of risk enhancers to refine risk assessments based on the Pooled Cohort Equations and inform decision-making for persons at intermediate and borderline risk. 42, 43 These risk enhancers include family history of early coronary heart disease, presence of chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, preeclampsia, premature menopause, inflammatory diseases, HIV, and South Asian ancestry. 42, 43.

### Statins and prevention of infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of data from large randomised placebo controlled trials [^bbe68650]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether the potential of statins to lower the risk of infections as published in observational studies is causal.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library.

Study Selection

Randomised placebo controlled trials of statins (up to 10 March 2011) enrolling a minimum of 100 participants, with follow-up for at least one year.

Data Extraction

Infection or infection related death.

Results

The first study selection yielded 632 trials. After screening of the corresponding abstracts and full text papers, 11 trials totalling 30947 participants were included. 4655 of the participants (2368 assigned to statins and 2287 assigned to placebo) reported an infection during treatment. Meta-analysis showed no effect of statins on the risk of infections (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.05) or on infection related deaths (0.97, 0.83 to 1.13).

Conclusion

These findings do not support the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of infections. Absence of any evidence for a beneficial effect in large placebo controlled trials reduces the likelihood of a causal effect as reported in observational studies.

### Patient information: statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease… [^b709165b]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently published recommendations on using statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults. Primary prevention refers to the use of a statin medication to treat individuals without known cardiovascular disease to prevent heart attack, stroke, and death. Cardiovascular disease involves buildup of plaque, which causes blockages inside important blood vessels in the body, including arteries of the heart and brain. Cardiovascular disease can cause heart attacks and strokes. It is the leading cause of death in the US. Risk factors for CVD include dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. What Are Statins. Statins are a group of medications used to treat dyslipidemia.

Statins are effective in decreasing levels of "bad" cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. What Is the Patient Population Under Consideration for Use of Statins to Prevent CVD. Potential benefits of statin use in persons at increased CVD risk include decreased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. Potential harms of statins include medication side effects and are likely to be minor. How Strong Is the Recommendation to Use Statins to Prevent CVD. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and death in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD, 1 or more CVD risk factors, and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has a least a moderate net benefit. For individuals aged 40 to 75 years with a 10-year CVD event risk of 7.

5% to less than 10%, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use has at least a small net benefit. The decision to initiate statins in this group should depend on individual preference, balancing the potential small benefit with the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a daily medication.

Drug–drug interactions and lipophilicity in statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are detailed, noting that some statins 'are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway and can have significant interactions with drugs that inhibit this process, including amiodarone, azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, cyclosporine, among others (Table 8).22' It specifies that 'pravastatin and pitavastatin are the only statins that do not undergo significant cytochrome P450 metabolism and, therefore, may be reasonable choices in patients prescribed multiple drugs that pose a risk for this interaction'. Additionally, 'Statins like atorvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin, which use the OATP1B1 pathway, are likely to interact with strong inhibitors, such as carbamazepine, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, and others.22' Regarding pathophysiology, 'It has been theorized that the lipophilicity of statins may have a role in SAMS' and 'Lipophilic statins, which encompasses most statins except pravastatin and rosuvastatin, have been hypothesized to have greater residence time in tissue such as myocytes.6', but 'This has been suggested to possibly increase risk of SAMS, but is unproven, and all statins can cause pharmacologic SAMS and even rhabdomyolysis.6'.

Factors That Increase Adverse Effects by Increasing Exposure to Statins

There are a number of mechanisms that affect drug exposure in individual patients; these are integral to and associated with risk of adverse events that exhibit dose dependence (notably myopathy). They include pharmacokinetic interactions, and pharmacogenomic factors that result in higher levels of statins in the blood and in hepatic and muscle tissue.

### Comparative pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with cytochrome P450 inhibitors [^130f950b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia. Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with statins incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with medications that increase their systemic exposure. Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects. Compared with pravastatin alone, coadministration of verapamil, mibefradil, or itraconazole with pravastatin was associated with no significant changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics. However, concomitant verapamil increased the simvastatin area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite simvastatin acid AUC and C(max) approximately four- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p < 0.001). Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a > 60% increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of atorvastatin were observed when coadministered with mibefradil. The half-life of atorvastatin also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with itraconazole, which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of atorvastatin and a 47% increase in the AUC (p < 0.001 for C(max) and AUC). Clarithromycin significantly (p < 0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 statins, most markedly simvastatin (approximately 10-fold increase in AUC) and simvastatin acid (12-fold), followed by atorvastatin (greater than fourfold) and then pravastatin (almost twofold). Pravastatin has a neutral drug interaction profile relative to cytochrome P450-3A4 inhibitors, but these substrates markedly increase systemic exposure to simvastatin and atorvastatin.

### Rhabdomyolysis and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [^6f82a11d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Data Source

Relevant clinical literature was accessed using MEDLINE (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals.

Conclusions

Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patents receiving statin therapy.

Pharmacokinetic Interactions

Drugs

Two main classes of drug interactions will account for most of the important interactions of statins with other drugs: drugs that affect CYP3A4/5 and drugs that affect transport proteins. An additional mechanism, affected by gemfibrozil, is glucuronidation. 67 Tables 2 and 3 summarize statin metabolism and interactions. 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75 For reasons discussed later, simvastatin and lovastatin are particularly susceptible to huge drug interactions.

### Real-life achievement of lipid-lowering treatment targets in the DIAbetes and lifEstyle cohort twente: systemic assessment of pharmacological and nutritional factors [^cb955550]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

What should be the implications of this study? We found that pharmacological treatment with statins was substantially higher in patients who had reached the LDLc target. Therefore, in patients who are not on target LDLc, the first step could be to explore the opportunities to either start or intensify statin treatment. As opposed to blood pressure management in this cohort, where therapy resistance is an issue in roughly 40% of the patients not on target blood pressure, our data suggest that resistance to statin treatment is less common. In those with an LDLc not on target, only 8% were on high-intensity statin treatment. High-intensity statin treatment can reduce LDLc by 40–60%, vs. a 20–30% reduction on low-intensity treatment. Therefore, intensifying statin treatment, either by increasing the dose, or by switching to a more potent compound, could be an option in a large subset of patients not on target. Furthermore, adherence to therapy should be addressed. Relatively low adherence to statin therapy has been previously reported –, especially after negative reports on statins by the mainstream media, rendering it worthwhile to investigate whether prescribed statins are actually ingested by the patients. Unfortunately, such data were not available here. It should be noted that statin treatment efficacy can vary considerably per individual, in literature a range of 5–70% LDLc reduction in different individuals is reported. Statin treatment resistance, i.e. not achieving LDLc target, despite high-intensity statin treatment, has been associated with black racial ancestry, polymorphisms in genes affecting statin pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, smoking, inflammation, and HIV infection. Certain drugs may also reduce statin effectiveness by reducing bioavailability (i.e. bile acid sequestrants) or increasing statin metabolism (i.e. rifampicin). Nutraceuticals, which sometimes are used in the general population, might also influence LDLc target achievement; however, few studies have been performed on the interaction between statin use and nutraceuticals, and therefore the effect of nutraceuticals statin efficacy remains unclear. In addition, clinical conditions that increase cholesterol levels, such as hypothyroidism, should also be reviewed. However, in a real-life setting, LDLc target non-achievement, despite statin treatment, can most often be attributed to treatment non-adherence rather than treatment resistance.

### Isoniazid [^b4eb1bf0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Food

Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Tyramine- and histamine-containing foods should be avoided in patients receiving isoniazid. Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity, an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur. Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (e.g., headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension) to foods containing histamine (e.g., skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish).

Acetaminophen

A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid. It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed. However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P-450IIE1, a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver. Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P-450IIE1 in the patient's liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites. Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in rats1,2.

Carbamazepine

Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels. Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made3.

Ketoconazole

Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88 percent after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy4.

Phenytoin

Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made5,6.

Theophylline

A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid. Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made7.

Valproate

A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when co-administered with isoniazid. Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isoniazid and valproate are co-administered and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made5.

Random effects at occasion‐level (each dose), visit‐level (each PK sampling visit), and/or subject‐level were included on the PK parameters if statistically significant using a lognormal distribution. Between‐occasion variability was tested on absorption parameters, whereas between‐visit variability and between‐subject variability (BSV) were tested on disposition parameters. A combination of proportional and additive error was used to model unexplained residual variability.

Model development was guided by evaluating the drops in objective function value (ΔOFV) of nested models. The OFV was assumed as χ² ‐distributed, hence with a 3.84 drop in OFV being significant at P < 0.05 for one additional parameter (i.e. 1 degree of freedom). Besides statistical significance, a set of diagnostic plots, including visual prediction checks and physiological plausibility of the results were considered in model development decisions.

### Drug interactions with lipid-lowering drugs: mechanisms and clinical relevance [^8b0c9f2a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering drugs, especially 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins), are widely used in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease. The benefits of statins are well documented. However, lipid-lowering drugs may cause myopathy, even rhabdomyolysis, the risk of which is increased by certain interactions. Simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (simvastatin acid is also metabolized by CYP2C8); their plasma concentrations and risk of myotoxicity are greatly increased by strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, itraconazole and ritonavir). Weak or moderately potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) can be used cautiously with small doses of CYP3A4-dependent statins. Cerivastatin is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9. The exposure to fluvastatin is increased by less than 2-fold by inhibitors of CYP2C9. Pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin are excreted mainly unchanged, and their plasma concentrations are not significantly increased by pure CYP3A4 inhibitors. Cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) inhibits CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance protein 1), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), and some other hepatic uptake transporters. Gemfibrozil and its glucuronide inhibit CYP2C8 and OATP1B1. These effects of cyclosporine and gemfibrozil explain the increased plasma statin concentrations and, together with pharmacodynamic factors, the increased risk of myotoxicity when coadministered with statins. Inhibitors of OATP1B1 may decrease the benefit/risk ratio of statins by interfering with their entry into hepatocytes, the site of action. Lipid-lowering drugs can be involved also in other interactions, including those between enzyme inducers and CYP3A4 substrate statins, as well as those between gemfibrozil and CYP2C8 substrate antidiabetics. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lipid-lowering drugs and their interaction mechanisms helps to avoid adverse interactions, without compromising therapeutic benefits.

Gemfibrozil with statins — Evaluate statin therapy prior to initiation of gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily. If the current statin is lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin, discontinue current statin and switch to atorvastatin 10 mg daily, pitavastatin 1 mg daily, or rosuvastatin at 5 mg daily; fluvastatin does not require dose adjustment. If the current statin is atorvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin, reduce statin dose to atorvastatin 10 mg daily, pitavastatin 1 mg daily, or rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, with no dose adjustment required for fluvastatin. If the patient is tolerating therapy after 2–3 months, if needed, titrate statin in 2–3 months to a maximum dose of atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg; if not tolerating, reduce statin dose or switch to fluvastatin.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^8c54165f]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin pharmacokinetics and DDI magnitude — an increase in area under the curve (AUC) is used to grade interaction severity, defined as minor (> 1.25– < 2.0), moderate (≥ 2–4.9), or severe (≥ 5). Systemic bioavailability is generally low for statins; pitavastatin has the highest bioavailability (43%–51%) while simvastatin and lovastatin have very low bioavailability (< 5%). The overall bioavailability of lovastatin is decreased by ≈50% when given without food, and the time to peak concentration is within 4 hours for immediate‑release formulations. In distribution, most statins except pravastatin are highly protein bound; statins with a log P value > 0 penetrate fat more than water, and all statins except pravastatin and rosuvastatin are considered lipophilic. The statement notes that drug–drug interactions (DDIs) with statins typically are not attributable to changes in absorption or distribution, and that the most diverse pharmacokinetic parameter among statins is metabolism.

Structural model

A two‐compartment disposition model best described the PKs of both isoniazid and efavirenz with first‐order absorption through a chain of transit compartments. 30 Drug elimination implemented with a well‐stirred liver model, 19 was able to describe both hepatic clearance and first‐pass extraction with the parameter of hepatic intrinsic clearance, as shown in Figure 2. Parameter estimates for isoniazid and efavirenz, and the precisions for each are presented in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

Figure 2
Schematic representation of the pharmacokinetic model of both efavirenz and isoniazid. The absorption is described with a series of transit‐compartment to capture the delay in absorption, and a rate constant K a. The hepatic extraction (Eh) is responsible for both first‐pass metabolism and the systemic elimination with first‐order kinetics. V c represents the volume of distribution in the central compartment. Drug transfer between the central and peripheral compartment is defined by intercompartmental clearance Q/F, were F represents the oral bioavailability. [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Isoniazid pharmacokinetics: Covariate effects

Allometric scaling was applied to all clearance, volume, and liver parameters to account for body size effect, improving the fit, and explaining part of BSV (ΔOFV = −44). When fat‐free mass replaced bodyweight for allometric scaling of clearance (but not volume) parameters, it improved the fit of the model (ΔOFV = −6.27). NAT2 genotype significantly affected clearance of isoniazid (ΔOFV = −273, χ² df = 2, P ≪ 0.001), as intrinsic clearance varied greatly among rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylators. After adjusting for body size and NAT2 genotype, pregnancy was found to increase clearance by 26% (ΔOFV = −49.6, χ² df = 1, P ≪ 0.001). There was no significant difference in clearance among participants on the four different ART (efavirenz, nevirapine‐based, lopinavir/ritonavir‐based, and atazanavir/ritonavir‐based) regimens (ΔOFV = −6.34, χ 2 df = 3, P = 0.0964). Inclusion of pregnancy on any other parameter, including the central compartment volume of distribution did not improve model fit.

### An assessment by the statin liver safety task force: 2014 update [^a6efc54f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

In the 2006 Report of the National Lipid Association's Statin Safety Task Force, a panel of experts in hepatology published their findings on specific questions related to the liver blood testing during statin therapy. Among their recommendations was that regulatory agencies reconsider the statin-labeling recommendation at that time, which required post-statin liver enzyme testing. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration altered statin labeling such that unless clinically indicated for other reasons, after a pre-statin therapy baseline evaluation, follow-up liver enzyme testing was not uniformly required after statin initiation. This 2014 report provides an update on interim issues relevant to statins and liver safety. Some of the points discussed include the value of baseline liver enzymes before initiating statin therapy, safety of statin use in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potential drug interactions between statins and drugs used to treat hepatitis, the use of statins in liver transplant recipients, and the use of statins in patients with autoimmune liver disease. Finally, this panel provides diagnostic and algorithmic approaches when evaluating statin-treated patients who experience elevations in liver enzymes.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^b4693d8c]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Adults living with HIV — dyslipidemia management emphasizes lifestyle counseling and coordination with infectious disease specialists, and statin selection that accounts for antiretroviral therapy interactions. In persons under 40 years of age, primary prevention decisions should be individualized. Pitavastatin is preferred over other statins in persons with HIV infection who are found to be at low/moderate ASCVD risk on traditional risk calculators, and pitavastatin effectively decreases ASCVD events and avoids the risk of adverse interactions with ART since it is metabolized via glucuronidation. Rosuvastatin (≤ 10 mg/day) is a good alternative and atorvastatin (≤ 10–20 mg/day) may be used with certain antiretroviral drugs, while pravastatin should not be prescribed in individuals on darunavir. Simvastatin and lovastatin are contraindicated with protease inhibitors or cobicistat, and rosuvastatin at 20 mg per day is a high-intensity statin option with decreased risk of interactions with ART medications. Ezetimibe, BA, or PCSK9 inhibitors may be considered if LDL-C targets have not been achieved on statins alone or if statin therapy is not tolerated, and in individuals with HIV and HTG, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acids or a fibrate (not gemfibrozil) may be prescribed.

### Statin safety and drug interactions: clinical implications [^6381f873]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The risks of muscle adverse events related to use of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, increase significantly with the addition of interacting drugs to a patient's therapy. The mechanism for most statin drug interactions involves the cytochrome P-450 system, which provides an indication of which drugs may interact. However, it is difficult to predict the probability of a drug interaction in a given patient because there are individual differences in sensitivity to increased statin drug levels. Drug metabolism studies show simvastatin and lovastatin to be especially sensitive to the inhibiting effects of other drugs on the cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme. Atorvastatin metabolism is less affected by inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Case reports, postmarketing surveillance, and clinical trial data demonstrate the clinical effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on statins. Also, through possible inhibition of statin biliary excretion and glucuronidation, gemfibrozil given concomitantly with rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin significantly increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening consequence of statin drug interactions.

### Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of isoniazid and efavirenz in pregnant women living with HIV in high TB incidence settings: importance of genotyping [^63edf060]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Similar to previous reports, 10, 12, 34 we observed a DDI between isoniazid and efavirenz, as isoniazid decreases the clearance of efavirenz, particularly for intermediate and slow efavirenz metabolizers. This is thought to be due to isoniazid's inhibition of CYP2A6. 35 However, for individuals who are CYP2B6 slow metabolizers, CYP2A6 assumes increased importance in clearing efavirenz, so that CYP2B6 slow metabolizers on isoniazid may have a higher risk of efavirenz toxicity. Our analysis did not detect any difference in isoniazid exposure among different ARTs (efavirenz‐based, nevirapine‐based, lopinavir/ritonavir‐based, and atazanavir/ritonavir‐based), which contrasts with previous reports. 36, 37 However, it may be that our analysis was not powered to detect these differences because 88% of the participants were on efavirenz‐based ART.

Previously reported isoniazid exposures varied widely between studies. This might be due to effects of large BSV and between‐occasion variability, different proportions of NAT2 acetylator genotypes, different drug formulations, DDIs, and instability of isoniazid in plasma, 38 which makes PK studies of isoniazid somewhat challenging. This wide range is well summarized in a recent review by Daskapan et al. 39 Comparing our results with previous reports on nonpregnant populations, 39, 40, 41 we observed lower isoniazid exposures during pregnancy and postpartum visits, whereas the ratio in exposures between slow and rapid NAT2 genotype was similar (clearance for rapid acetylators was observed to be 4‐fold faster than those of slow acetylators). It is unclear if the relatively low concentrations we observed at both visits are due to efavirenz exposure, as most women were on efavirenz‐based regimen. It is also possible that the effect of pregnancy on isoniazid clearance takes time to reverse fully, and women in the postpartum visit may also have clearance levels higher than the general (nonpregnant, adult) population. It has been previously discussed that using the postpartum period as a control to study effects of pregnancy may be suboptimal because of factors that include lactation and delayed reversal of pregnancy‐related physiological changes. 42 Efavirenz exposures in our study were in line with previous reports in nonpregnant individuals. 33, 43, 44 Similarly, the ratio between normal and slow CYP2B6 metabolizers exposures was similar, with a C₁₂ ratio of 5.

### Statins and prevention of infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of data from large randomised placebo controlled trials [^b0eb6275]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of published trials according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic search of Medline in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database (the Cochrane central register of controlled trials) for studies reporting an infection as an adverse event or cause of death related to statin use was done from inception to 10 March 2011. To identify further articles we hand searched references and the related citations in PubMed.

We included randomised controlled trials reported in English only. Search terms, MeSH subject headings, and limits were "hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors", "anticholesteremic agents", "statin", "simvastatin", "rosuvastatin", "pravastatin", "atorvastatin", "fluvastatin", "cerivastatin", "pitavastatin", "lovastatin", "placebo controlled", and "randomised controlled trial".

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All captured publications were screened according to predefined selection criteria. We included all randomised controlled trials with a statin as active treatment and a placebo as comparator. Eligible studies had a follow-up period of at least 12 months, a minimum of 100 participants, and reported on infections or infection related mortality. We excluded duplicate publications — that is, two or more studies that investigated the same sample.

After the first automated query in the databases, we used a three step process for screening. Firstly, we screened the abstracts. Secondly, we screened the remaining publications on the basis of the corresponding full text publication for reports on adverse events and causes of death. Finally, we screened the articles with information on adverse events and mortality for reports on the occurrence of infections or infection related mortality.

Besides the predefined search strategy, one reviewer (HLvdH) considered trials that had been excluded in the final step for not reporting infections as of potential importance when extensive data on other adverse events were available. The principal investigators of these trials were then contacted for supplementary data.

Data extraction

One reviewer (HLvdH) extracted the data. From each eligible publication data were captured on first author, year of publication, title, journal, study population, primary study outcome, duration of follow-up, number of participants in each group (statin and placebo groups), and type and dose of statin studied. From each included study HLvdH extracted data on the occurrence of infections as adverse events and data on infection related mortality.

### Severe rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury following concomitant use of genvoya® (EVG / COBI / FTC / TAF) and simvastatin; a case report [^51c5370b]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Medication interactions are avoidable. AKI is a severe complication and even after recovery is associated with increased long term mortality and risk of chronic kidney disease. This case illustrates the importance of vigilance when prescribing new medications, especially in multi-morbid patients. Both prescribing clinicians and pharmacists should be aware of potential interactions, and use of medication compendia and interaction checkers such as the online tool from the University of Liverpool for patients under HIV-therapy orfor patients under hepatitis C-therapy which are easily available online should become routine in the clinic.

It is important to recall that drug interactions associated with CYP3A4 metabolism occur with a wide range of medications including commonly used drugs such as, among many others, amiodarone, calcium-channel blockers, azole antifungals and macrolides antibiotics (Table 4). In a FDA database review, the majority (58%) of cases of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis occurred through the association with another drug interfering with statin metabolism through CYP3A4.

Table 4
Substrates, inducers and inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 enzymatic pathways

This case reveals the complexity of the treatment of HIV-positive patients who are at risk of multiple potential drug interactions, especially when statins are associated with fixed anti-retroviral drug combinations and in the setting of potential liver and/or kidney dysfunction. Simvastatin, lovastatin and, to a lesser extent atorvastatin, are the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with the greatest risk of drug interactions. They should not be used in patients under HIV-therapy. Heightened vigilance for potential drug interactions is essential when treating patients with HIV and multidisciplinary collaboration is advised.

### Telithromycin (Ketek) [^c0569e29]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Drug interactions

Telithromycin is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 system. Co-administration of KETEK tablets and a drug primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentration of the drug co-administered with telithromycin that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary for the drug co-administered with telithromycin.

The use of KETEK is contraindicated with cisapride. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions)

The use of KETEK is contraindicated with pimozide. Although there are no studies looking at the interaction between KETEK and pimozide, there is a potential risk of increased pimozide plasma levels by inhibition of CYP 3A4 pathways by KETEK as with macrolides. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS)

In a pharmacokinetic study, simvastatin levels were increased due to CYP 3A4 inhibition by telithromycin. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions) Similarly, an interaction may occur with lovastatin or atorvastatin but not with statins which are not metabolized by CYP3A4.

High levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Use of simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin concomitantly with KETEK should be avoided. If KETEK is prescribed, therapy with simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment. Patients concomitantly treated with statins should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
