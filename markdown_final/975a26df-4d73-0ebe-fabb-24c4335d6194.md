## Question

In the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico are black lava formations surrounded by light-colored sandy desert. Pocket mice inhabit both areas. Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?

Answer Choices:
A. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.
B. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.
C. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.
D. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement correctly explains the distribution of dark- and light-colored rock pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin, and to choose among four options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core evolutionary principle illustrated by this pattern. Then, I should verify what the provided sources say about the genetics and geographic distribution. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that evidence. Finally, I will select the best-supported option and note any nuances or limitations in the data.

> Let me first confirm the core principle. This is a classic example of crypsis and natural selection by visual predation, where coat color matches the substrate to reduce detection by predators, particularly owls, leading to differential survival and allele frequency shifts across habitats. This is precisely how the rock pocket mouse system has been described in the literature provided [^f6a8c45f].

> Wait, let me verify the genetic basis before drawing conclusions. In Pinacate, Mexico, dark coat color correlates with specific variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene, indicating a direct genotype–phenotype link under selection. However, in New Mexico populations, the same Mc1r variants do not explain the dark phenotype, implying independent mutations and convergent evolution of dark coloration on lava flows, which is a key distinction I need to keep in mind [^f6a8c45f].

> I will now examine Option A, which claims the two varieties descended from a recent common ancestor. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. While all individuals within a species share a common ancestor, the provided sources emphasize that the New Mexico dark phenotype arose independently of the Pinacate dark phenotype, reflecting convergent evolution rather than a single recent divergence event, so this wording is misleading in the context of the specific genetic evidence presented [^f6a8c45f].

> Next, Option B asserts the population split into two species because of mutations. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the taxonomic status. The sources consistently refer to these as populations of the same species exhibiting color polymorphism under selection, not separate species, so this statement oversteps the evidence and mischaracterizes the evolutionary scenario as speciation rather than local adaptation [^f6a8c45f].

> Option C states that selection favors some phenotypes over others. Let me consider whether this aligns with the data. Yes, the documentation explicitly describes strong selective pressure maintaining coat color matching across short geographic distances, with dark mice favored on dark lava and light mice favored on light sand, which is a textbook case of phenotype-specific fitness differences due to predation [^f6a8c45f].

> Option D proposes that mice were originally all dark and light color evolved as lava decomposed into sand. I need to check the geological and evolutionary timeline here. The lava formations are ancient volcanic features, whereas the selective pattern we observe reflects current habitat matching and convergent evolution of dark color on lava, not a historical transition from lava decomposition driving a color shift; moreover, the sources do not support the claim that all ancestors were dark, and they emphasize independent origins of dark color in different regions, so this narrative is inconsistent with the evidence [^f6a8c45f] [^2ebe1659].

> Putting this together, the most accurate and directly supported statement is Option C, that selection favors some phenotypes over others, as demonstrated by the maintenance of substrate-matching coat colors across adjacent dark and light habitats in rock pocket mice. The other options either misstate the genetic basis, overextend to speciation, or propose an unsupported historical sequence, so I should confirm C as the best answer while noting the convergent evolution nuance in the New Mexico populations [^f6a8c45f].

---

The correct answer is **C. Selection favors some phenotypes over others**. This is a classic example of **natural selection** [^f6a8c45f], where dark-colored mice on black lava and light-colored mice on light sand have higher survival due to camouflage from predators. Options A and B are incorrect because the mice are the same species and the color differences are due to selection, not recent divergence or speciation. Option D is incorrect because the lava did not decompose into sand; the sand is gypsum from ancient lakes, and the color differences evolved independently in different populations [^46857906] [^f6a8c45f].

## Analysis of answer choices

### A. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor

This statement is **not supported** by the provided information. While all individuals of a species share a common ancestor, the scenario does not provide evidence for a recent common ancestor or divergence event. The color variation observed in pocket mice is primarily due to environmental selection pressures rather than recent speciation or divergence [^f6a8c45f].

---

### B. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations

This statement is **incorrect**. The pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin are the same species, and the observed color variation does not indicate speciation. Mutations may contribute to color variation, but the primary mechanism driving the observed differences is natural selection favoring different phenotypes in different environments, not speciation [^f6a8c45f].

---

### C. Selection favors some phenotypes over others

This statement is **correct**. The scenario is a classic example of natural selection, where environmental pressures favor specific phenotypes. Dark-colored mice are favored on black lava formations because their coloration provides camouflage from predators, while light-colored mice are favored on light-colored sandy desert environments for the same reason. This differential survival and reproduction based on coloration is a direct demonstration of natural selection [^f6a8c45f].

---

### D. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment

This statement is **incorrect**. There is no evidence that the lava formations decomposed into sand, nor that all mice were originally dark-colored. The light-colored sandy desert environment is primarily composed of gypsum sand, not decomposed lava [^46857906]. Additionally, the color variation in pocket mice is due to genetic differences and natural selection, not environmental induction of color change in individual mice [^f6a8c45f].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. Selection favors some phenotypes over others**. This accurately reflects the principle of natural selection, where environmental pressures favor specific phenotypes, leading to differential survival and reproduction. The observed color variation in pocket mice is a direct result of natural selection acting on genetic variation within the population [^f6a8c45f].

### Past genomes guide future conservation: insights from extinct populations of the endangered pacific pocket mouse [^3466e6c0]. The Journal of Heredity (2025). Medium credibility.

Efforts to recover endangered species often rely on restoring populations to their historical range, yet reestablishing lost genetic variation is challenging when the ancestral genetic landscape is poorly understood. The Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus), a federally endangered heteromyid rodent, has been extirpated from most of its range in coastal southern California. Recovery efforts call for establishing new populations in their historic range through translocation, but the extent to which historical patterns of genetic variation can be recapitulated is unknown. To inform conservation planning, we sequenced whole genomes of historical samples, including individuals from populations that went extinct in the mid-1900's. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that mice from the southernmost extirpated population form a clade with a different subspecies, while populations to the north form a sister clade. These findings support morphological evidence calling for a taxonomic revision, which would modify the definition of the historic range and complicate the interpretation of suitable reintroduction sites. Despite this divergence, D-statistics and demographic models indicate historical gene flow among coastal populations, suggesting that alleles reintroduced to the southern coast may echo ancestral connectivity. Thus, management efforts should consider potential receiver sites that contain suitable habitat within this range as viable for population creation. These results highlight the value of historical genomics in guiding conservation decisions, particularly when taxonomic uncertainty, extirpation, and limited genetic diversity constrain modern management. Although historical baselines often cannot be restored, conservation strategies can leverage genomic insights to enhance future adaptive potential and long-term resilience of threatened species.

Circadian factors — control of timing in sex-difference experiments requires attention to circadian biology. Effects of circadian rhythm should be considered when investigating sex differences, and investigators should synchronize factors such as feeding time, duration of light exposure or darkness, and number of rodents in cages (same socialization) for both females and males. The investigators should perform their interventions and assessments at the same time of the day, because estrogens can modulate the expression of circadian clock genes, and thus synchrony in the estrous cycle and experimental times may be needed.

Beach umbrellas and sun-shade shelters — Several types of shade shelters are available, and people should choose a shelter made with a fire-resistant UPF 50 fabric, usually nylon or polyester, with a durable yet lightweight frame. Additional considerations include size, weight and portability, water-resistant fabric, open or mesh sides for air circulation, and secure anchoring with stakes or fillable sandbags; standard camping tents generally are unsuitable for shade shelters unless they are rated as such. Travelers should select beach umbrellas with ample diameter and directional tilt so the protective field can be adjusted as the sun rises and crosses the sky.

Sun exposure in travelers — risk factors and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) characteristics are summarized as follows: International travelers who engage in outdoor activities are often exposed to more ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVR) than usual, and both short bursts of high-intensity UVR and frequent, prolonged, cumulative UVR exposure can cause acute effects such as sunburn and phototoxic medication reactions and delayed effects including sun damage, premature aging, cataracts, and skin cancers. Time of year, time of day, latitude, altitude, geographic location, and meteorological conditions influence how much UVR reaches an area, and human behavior including attire, activities, time of day when outdoors, and sun-protective measures determines how much UVR reaches a person's skin or eyes. Most UVR reaches the earth's surface during summer months; ultraviolet B (UVB), which is more carcinogenic than ultraviolet A (UVA), is most intense during mid-day (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), at higher elevations, and as one gets closer to the equator, and reflective surfaces such as snow, water, and sand can increase potential UVB exposure. Although UVA is less carcinogenic than UVB, UVA occurs at high intensity throughout daylight hours, causes more acute photosensitivity reactions than UVB, and contributes more to premature aging.

### Sierra blanca (new Mexico)… [^2ebe1659]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Volcanology Sierra Blanca is a massive complex of volcanic rocks, including pyroclastic materials, lava flows, and intrusions. An ancient and heavily eroded volcanic pile, it is the largest mid-Tertiary volcanic complex east of the Rio Grande, with an estimated volume of erupted products of 185 cubic miles. Eruptions began about 38 million years ago, and extended over a twelve-million-year period. Most of the eruptions produced voluminous lava flows and breccias, with numerous intrusive dikes emplaced throughout the complex. The final activity produced the intrusions which form the present-day Sierra Blanca Peak. Following the volcanic period, the range's topography was modified by Pleistocene glaciation, block faulting, and erosion. Between 2007 and 2014, the Sierra Blanca complex was geologically mapped, and the following stratigraphy was adopted:

- Godfrey Hills Group
- **Husk Windmill Formation**: trachytic lava flows and tuff
- Crawford Canyon Trachyte
- Rose Peak Trachyte
- **Palisades Tuff**: trachytic tuff
- **Lopez Spring Formation**: lava flows of diverse composition.
- Nogal Peak Trachyte
- Church Mountain Phonolite.
- Walker Group
- **Three Rivers Formation, divided into members**:
- Buck Pasture Tuff.
- Double Diamond Member, laterally discontinuous volcaniclastics, basaltic trachyandesite, phonotephrite, and trachyte
- Argentina Spring Tuff
- **Taylor Windmill Member**: Maroon volcaniclastic sediments interbedded with flows of trachybasalt to trachyte.
- **Rattlesnake Member**: plagioclase-bearing basaltic trachyandesite flows
- **Hog Pen Formation**: interbedded debris flows and basalt to basaltic trachyandesite flows. These rest on the Sanders Canyon Formation, an Eocene sedimentary rock unit.

They are intruded by the Three Rivers, Rialto, and Bonito Lake stocks. The Three Rivers Stock, which underlies Sierra Blanca Peak itself, is the largest of these and consists of multiple intrusions, and is composed mostly of syenite to alkali feldspar granite. It was emplaced 29 to 28 million years ago and is interpreted as the shallow magma chamber below a deeply eroded caldera. The volcanic complex is part of the High Plains alkaline province, which lies along the boundary between the tectonically stable High Plains and the tectonically active western United States. It formed in the Sierra Blanca Basin, a northeast extension of the Tularosa Basin, during the time when the Rio Grande rift first began to open. See also

### Jornada del muertoen.wikipedia.org › wiki › jornada_del_Muerto… [^ec9579ca]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Cultural history Abundant evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation has been found near Mockingbird Gap in the northern Jornada. The projectile points and other remains found by archaeologists are examples of the Clovis culture and Folsom culture. Precipitation in the Jornada began to decline about 9000 BCE, resulting in less evidence of the presence of Paleo-Indian cultures. After passing the "Jornada del Muerto" the earliest Spanish traveling north encountered the walled villages of the Pueblo dwellers, who had a well-developed agriculture and a peaceable tradition. After the first crossing the Jornada del Muerto in 1598 they named one of the first pueblos they came to Socorro.

In 1680, during the Pueblo Revolt, 2, 000 Spanish settlers, including Indians from the Isleta and Socorro Pueblos, were forced to retreat southward, across the Jornada del Muerto, The survivors resettled on the Rio Grande around and south of El Paso del Norte, 'the Pass to the North', which is now separated between the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and the U. S. city of El Paso, Texas. In 1692, Diego de Vargas led a new group of settlers north across the Jornada del Muerto to resettle northern New Mexico. On horseback the Jornada could be traversed in as little as two days, as described by Bishop Tamarón traveling north on his visitation to New Mexico in 1760. Leaving the Paraje de Robledo, traveling five leagues: During this interval we ate what there was, and we traveled in this fashion until eight-thirty at night, when we halted opposite the Sierra of Fray Cristobal. On the fourteenth day of May, the eighth day of our journey, we made an early start.

We reached the river at eleven‑thirty. The livestock were so thirsty that they ran to reach the water. After this fashion were the thirty leagues of this difficult stage traveled. Homesteaders in the 1860s to 1920s tried to ranch in the Jornada del Muerto, digging wells for the cattle. The first well was at Aleman, dug by Lt. John Martin, and it appears to be the last of the homesteads to be abandoned at the end of the 20th century. Trail The Jornada del Muerto trail was part of the Camino Real which reached from Mexico City to the Spanish colonies in New Mexico. The Jornada trail departed from the Rio Grande from the Paraje de Robledo, later the site of Fort Selden, just north of Las Cruces, New Mexico. It continued northward through a gap, between the Selden Hills on the west and Doña Ana Mountains to the east, on to the plain of the Jornada.

The last opportunity for filling water barrels and watering stock before continuing farther north was from the Paraje de San Diego overlooking the Rio Grande five leagues beyond Robledo and one-half league from the River. The next intermittent water was at Paraje del Perrillo near where the trail passes Point of Rocks which is the southernmost point of the closed Jornada basin. The trail heads basically north through mesquite scrub land to another small intermittent watering place, La Cruz de Alemán, named for a fugitive German merchant who died of thirst there in the 1670s, at a time when it had no water. At that site there are now buildings of the Bar Cross Ranch built on the site of the original settlement in the Jornada del Muerto, the Aleman Ranch, established in 1867. Further north the trail crosses a number of small ephemeral lake beds the Jornada Lakes, on the way to Engle Lake then known as the Laguna del Muerto.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^92cbde28]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^10e52c57]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency testing — two-step algorithm and sequencing standard. Testing for alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency most commonly involves serum or plasma A1AT levels and targeted PCR genotyping, but these methods may misclassify some cases; a clear solution proposed is gene sequencing. The authors propose DNA sequencing of the SERPINA1 coding regions (exons 2–5) as the gold standard and propose a two-step approach: with moderate clinical suspicion, an A1AT ≥ 23 μmol/L (≥ 1.2 g/L) rules out severe deficiency (except rare dysfunctional variants), and with high clinical suspicion they suggest DNA sequencing as the initial test. As rationale, genetic mutations are invariable while A1AT levels may vary between repeat tests, some variants have normal circulating A1AT yet represent actual deficiency, and knowledge of the genotype is essential to understand the functional deficiency present.

American Thoracic Society workshop — rationale for using animal models in pneumonia research — notes that when studying the complex interplay between host and pathogen, the use of animals or animal-derived products for pathogenesis research currently provides the best scientific results, whereas ex vivo and in vitro systems are limited in their ability to recapitulate complex host–pathogen adaptations. It adds that researchers should recognize that the use of animals in research is a privilege that requires constant consideration of ways to replace, reduce, and refine animal experimentation.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^749917f7]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

Rigor in animal experimentation — reporting and bias control emphasize replicates, transparency, and blinding. Publication of work even with a number of replicates greater than three that has not been repeated reduces the scientific rigor of published research, which can ultimately lead to the inability to repeat experiments across laboratories, and reporting "negative data" is also important because this helps reduce animal use by limiting multiple laboratories reproducing the negative results in isolation. Experimenters should provide descriptions of blinding procedures used during clinical scoring and endpoint assessments to minimize the risk of experimental bias, and we also favor transparency in reporting statistical considerations, repetitions, and clinical scoring parameters, including the humane endpoints used in the study. For several pneumonia models, body temperature has been shown as a good predictor of mortality, and given the increasing recognition that microbiota changes can be highly influenced by the environment, standardization of housing and cage effects to the extent possible is critical.

### Elranatamab-bcmm (Elrexfio) [^ad17527e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Administer ELREXFIO subcutaneously according to the step-up dosing schedule to reduce the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Administer pre-treatment medications prior to each dose in the ELREXFIO step-up dosing schedule, which includes step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2, and the first treatment dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

ELREXFIO should only be administered by a qualified healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions such as CRS and neurologic toxicity, including ICANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Due to the risk of CRS, patients should be hospitalized for 48 hours after administration of the first step-up dose, and for 24 hours after administration of the second step-up dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

For subcutaneous injection only.

The recommended dosing schedule for ELREXFIO is provided in Table 1. The recommended dosages of ELREXFIO subcutaneous injection are: step-up dose 1 of 12 mg on Day 1, step-up dose 2 of 32 mg on Day 4, followed by the first treatment dose of 76 mg on Day 8, and then 76 mg weekly thereafter through week 24.

For patients who have received at least 24 weeks of treatment with ELREXFIO and have achieved a response [partial response (PR) or better] and maintained this response for at least 2 months, the dose interval should transition to an every two-week schedule. For patients who have received at least 24 weeks of treatment with ELREXFIO at the every two-week dosing schedule and have maintained the response, the dose interval should transition to an every four-week schedule.

Continue treatment with ELREXFIO until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Administer pre-treatment medications prior to each dose in the ELREXFIO step-up dosing schedule, which includes step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2, and the first treatment dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Jet lag — timed melatonin use notes that melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland in the brain during darkness and it is suppressed during the day with light exposure. Under a typical sleep-wake schedule without rapid travel across time zones, melatonin is secreted for approximately 12 hours at night — melatonin secretion starts to increase in the early evening about 2 hours before normal bedtime and peak plasma concentration occurs at approximately 3–4 a.m. Taking melatonin when the internal clock thinks it is morning will result in a phase delay which can facilitate adaptation to westward travel, whereas taking it when the internal clock thinks it is early evening will result in a phase advance which can facilitate adaptation to eastward travel. It is important to appropriately plan melatonin as taking it at the wrong time can increase misalignment, and taking melatonin when endogenous melatonin is high (body clock time 12–5 a.m.) is not as effective. Melatonin dosages vary, but 0.5–1 mg is often sufficient to produce a circadian shift.

### Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) [^0933df30]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3	Recommended Dosage and Dose Administration

Administer OCREVUS under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions such as serious infusion reactions.

Initial dose: 300 mg intravenous infusion, followed two weeks later by a second 300 mg intravenous infusion.
Subsequent doses: single 600 mg intravenous infusion every 6 months.
Observe the patient for at least one hour after the completion of the infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.4	Delayed or Missed Doses

If a planned infusion of OCREVUS is missed, administer OCREVUS as soon as possible; do not wait until the next scheduled dose. Reset the dose schedule to administer the next sequential dose 6 months after the missed dose is administered. Doses of OCREVUS must be separated by at least 5 months [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

2.5	Dose Modifications Because of Infusion Reactions

Dose modifications in response to infusion reactions depends on the severity.

Life-threatening Infusion Reactions

Immediately stop and permanently discontinue OCREVUS if there are signs of a life-threatening or disabling infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Provide appropriate supportive treatment.

Severe Infusion Reactions

Immediately interrupt the infusion and administer appropriate supportive treatment, as necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Restart the infusion only after all symptoms have resolved. When restarting, begin at half of the infusion rate at the time of onset of the infusion reaction. If this rate is tolerated, increase the rate as described in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. This change in rate will increase the total duration of the infusion but not the total dose.

Mild to Moderate Infusion Reactions

Reduce the infusion rate to half the rate at the onset of the infusion reaction and maintain the reduced rate for at least 30 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If this rate is tolerated, increase the rate as described in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. This change in rate will increase the total duration of the infusion but not the total dose.

Jet lag — timed light exposure guidance explains that intentional light exposure (or avoidance) at appropriate times of day can help facilitate circadian adaptation to the destination time zone, and when crossing time zones, light can play a key role in decreasing the duration of circadian desynchrony. Exposure to bright light in the morning following the circadian nadir (approximately 2–4 hours prior to habitual wake time) promotes phase advances, while exposure in the evening generally promotes phase delays. The optimal timing for light exposure is based on the direction of travel and the number of time zones crossed; consider using a jet lag calculator for individualized recommendations, and appropriately timed light exposure in combination with melatonin may further facilitate adaptation.

Altitude acclimatization recommendations — Wilderness Medical Society guidance and protective staging — note that acclimatizing for a minimum of 2–3 nights at around 2,450 to approximately 2,750 m (8,000–9,000 ft) before proceeding to a higher altitude is markedly protective against acute mountain sickness (AMS). The Wilderness Medical Society recommends avoiding ascent to a sleeping altitude of 2,750 m (≥ 9,000 ft) in a single day; ascending at a rate of no greater than 500 m per night in sleeping altitude once above 3,000 m; and allowing an extra night to acclimatize for every 1,000 m of sleeping altitude gain, while acknowledging these recommendations can still be too fast for some travelers and too slow for others.

### Ultramicrosize griseofulvin (fulvicin P / G 165) [^00028944]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Prophylactic Usage: Safety and efficacy of griseofulvin for prophylaxis of fungal infections have not been established.

Since griseofulvin has demonstrated harmful effects in vitro on the genotype in bacteria, plants, and fungi, males should wait at least 6 months after completing griseofulvin therapy before fathering a child. Females should avoid risk of pregnancy while receiving griseofulvin therapy.

Animal Toxicology: Chronic feeding of griseofulvin, at levels ranging from 0.5–2.5% of the diet, resulted in the development of liver tumors in several strains of mice, particularly in males. Smaller particle sizes result in an enhanced effect. Lower oral dosage levels have not been tested. Subcutaneous administration of relatively small doses of griseofulvin once a week during the first 3 weeks of life has also been reported to induce hepatomata in mice. Thyroid tumors, mostly adenomas but some carcinomas, have been reported in male rats receiving griseofulvin at levels of 2.0%, 1.0%, and 0.2% of the diet, and in female rats receiving the two higher dose levels. Although studies in other animal species have not yielded evidence of tumorigenicity, these studies were not of adequate design to form a basis for conclusions in this regard.

In subacute toxicity studies, orally administered griseofulvin produced hepatocellular necrosis in mice, but this has not been seen in other species. Disturbances in porphyrin metabolism have been reported in griseofulvin-treated laboratory animals. Griseofulvin has been reported to have a colchicine-like effect on mitosis and cocarcinogenicity with methylcholanthrene in cutaneous tumor induction in laboratory animals.

Griseofulvin interferes with chromosomal distribution during cell division, causing aneuploidy in plant and mammalian cells. These effects have been demonstrated in vitro at concentrations that may be achieved in the serum with the recommended therapeutic dosage.

Usage in Pregnancy: Griseofulvin should not be prescribed to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Animal Reproduction Studies: It has been reported in the literature that griseofulvin was found to be embryotoxic and teratogenic on oral administration to pregnant rats. Pups with abnormalities have been reported in the litters of a few bitches treated with griseofulvin.

Suppression of spermatogenesis has been reported to occur in rats, but investigation in man failed to confirm this.

### American academy of audiology clinical consensus statement: assessment of vestibular function in the pediatric population [^003a1be9]. Journal of the American Academy of Audiology (2025). High credibility.

Video head impulse test (vHIT) in pediatric right anterior and left posterior canal testing — test setup varies by equipment, with the head straight or rotated 35–45° to the left; the examiner places one hand under the chin and one on top of the head pointing toward the visual target, and the head should be thrust forward for the right anterior and backward for the left posterior using rapid (100–250° per second) downward and upward impulses. Twenty acceptable impulses are recommended for each canal, if possible. Results must be inspected for clean data prior to analysis, and messy tracings and poor-quality head impulses and eye recordings must be eliminated; one of the most common artifacts during anterior canal testing in children is eyelid artifact, where a "V" shape indicates the top of the pupil was obscured. To mitigate, pull up on the eyelid or down on the cheek to widen the recording area, consider starting with the head tilted backward slightly before thrusting anteriorly, perform vHIT in a well-lit room, and use a portable bright light, such as from an otoscope, to constrict the pupil for easier tracking. For interpretation, results of each test should be evaluated for both average gain and the presence of consistent saccades occurring during the head movement (covert) or after the head movement (overt), and low gain will likely be accompanied by a catch-up saccade.

### Striatal arbitration between choice strategies guides few-shot adaptation [^5fbb64f2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Unexpected event-driven few-shot adaptation hypothesis

In a context-switching environment with binary choices and probabilistic reward (Fig. 1 a left), a subject who infers the current task context as T 1 (p 1 > p 2; marked as a red square in the reward probability plot) is likely to choose the action A 1 since it leads to the outcome state S 1 with a higher reward probability (p 1). Suppose a reward is not offered, contrary to its expectation. Although this unexpected outcome can be regarded as a noisy event due to the probabilistic nature of the reward function, it could also indicate the context switching to T 2 (p 2 > p 1; marked as a blue square in the reward probability plot). This cognitive process might urge action A 2 at the trial right after, which can lead to highly rapid adaptation. Such contextual behavior patterns contradict the prediction of the conventional RL models that choices are made based on values of decision variables accumulated over several past trials.

This first article in a seven part series presents an overview of the essential elements of the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach that has proved extremely useful in systematic reviews, health technology assessment reports, and clinical practice guidelines. GRADE guidance has appeared in many articles dealing with both core issues and more specialised and complex guidance, and it has evolved over time. This series of articles presents GRADE essentials, Core GRADE, focusing on the core judgments necessary to summarise the comparative evidence about alternative care options and to make recommendations that apply to the care of individual patients. This article presents detailed guidance on formulating questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) structure, and refining the question considering possible differences in relative and absolute effects across patient groups. The article then provides an overview of the remainder of the Core GRADE approach, including decisions about the certainty of the evidence and considerations in moving from evidence to guidance and recommendations.

Advise patients that "off" episodes ("wearing-off" of drug effect) occur at the end of the dosing interval but unpredictable "off" episodes may occur at any time. Advise the patient to notify a health care provider for possible treatment adjustments if such response poses a problem to the patient's everyday life.

Advise patients that dark coloration (red, brown, or black) may appear in saliva, urine, or sweat after taking carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets. Although the color appears to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored.

Advise patients that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying, thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multi-vitamin tablets) may also reduce the effectiveness of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets.

### Black rock desert… [^c7913d91]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The Black Rock Desert is a semi-arid region of lava beds and playa, or alkali flats, situated in the Black Rock Desert–High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area, a silt playa 100 miles north of Reno, Nevada, that encompasses more than 300, 000 acres of land and contains more than 120 miles of historic trails. It is in the northern Nevada section of the Great Basin with a lakebed that is a dry remnant of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. The Great Basin, named for the geography in which water is unable to flow out and remains in the basin, is a rugged land serrated by hundreds of mountain ranges, dried by wind and sun, with spectacular skies and scenic landscapes. The average annual precipitation at Gerlach is 7. 90 inches.

The region is notable for its paleogeologic features, as an area of 19th-century Emigrant Trails to California, as a venue for rocketry, and as an alternative to the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah for setting land speed records. It is also the location for the annual Burning Man event. The Black Rock Desert is part of the National Conservation Area, a unit of the Bureau of Land Management National Landscape Conservation System. The NCA is located in northwest Nevada and was established by legislation in 2000. It is a unique combination of the desert playa, narrow canyons, and mountainous areas. Humans have been in Black Rock Desert since approximately 10, 000 B. P. Around 1300 CE, the area was settled by the Paiute people. The Desert's namesake large, black rock formation was used as a landmark by the Paiute and later emigrants crossing the area.

The landmark is a conical outcrop composed of interbedded Permian marine limestone and volcanic rocks. Geography The Black Rock Desert region is in northwestern Nevada and the northwestern Great Basin. The playa extends for approximately 100 mi northeast from the towns of Gerlach and Empire, between the Jackson Mountains to the east and the Calico Hills to the west. The Black Rock Desert is separated into two arms by the Black Rock Range. It lies at an elevation of 3, 907 ft and has an area of about 1, 000 sq mi. There are several possible definitions of the extent of the Black Rock Desert. Often, people refer only to the playa surface. Sometimes, terrain which can be seen from the playa is included. The widest definition of the Black Rock Desert region is the watershed of the basin that drains into the playa.

The intermittent Quinn River is the largest river in the region, starting in the Santa Rosa Range and ending in the Quinn River Sink on the playa south of the Black Rock Range. The desert's watershed covers 11, 600 sq mi, including the Upper and Lower Quinn River, Smoke Creek Desert, Massacre Lake, and Thousand Creek/Virgin Valley watersheds of northwestern Nevada as well as small parts across the borders of California and Oregon. If the playa is wet for a month or so, then the shallow waters teem with fairy shrimp, or anostraca born of eggs that lie dormant in the silt crust for long periods of time — sometimes for many years. The edges of the playa and the Quinn River Sink stay wet longer than the rest of the playa, which concentrates the fairy shrimp and migratory birds in those areas. More than 250 species of neo-tropical migrant birds and many other water birds stop in Black Rock–High Rock Country for varying lengths of time.

Zoonotic exposures: bites, scratches, and other hazards — risk overview and transmission — Animals including birds, reptiles, ruminants, rodents, bats, and non-human primates can be asymptomatic reservoirs, and transmission between animals and humans can occur through contact with infected animals, their body fluids or products, contaminated surfaces or habitats, foodborne or waterborne routes, or by bites of infected arthropod vectors. Animal bites and scratches are common sources of serious infections, any animal can bite or scratch if threatened or injured, domestic animal attacks are far more common than wildlife attacks, and infections from bite or scratch wounds can result in serious illness or death. Bites and scratches from bats, cats, dogs, non-human primates, and rodents present a risk for serious illness; certain reptiles and amphibians may be venomous and their bites require immediate medical attention; and exposure to saliva and other body fluids can occur through bites, scratches, skin cuts, or mucous membrane contact such as the eyes or mouth.

American Thoracic Society workshop — replacement, reduction, refinement, and responsibility in pneumonia animal models — emphasizes that initial in vivo studies should be performed with rodents before research using larger animal models and that it is preferable to use rodent models rather than larger mammalian models. Measures that address reduction and refinement should also be implemented when designing experiments, including proper power analyses that may save the lives of research animals otherwise used in pilot experiments, careful design with collection of several samples from the same animal to avoid having to repeat experiments, and live animal imaging that can be used to minimize the number of animals needed for longitudinal data at multiple time points. The document notes that collection of longitudinal clinical data on the same subject can provide increased data dimensionality and power without significantly increasing harm, and affirms a responsibility to treat animals with respect and address humane care and thoughtful stewardship.

Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated liver function tests at baseline, or a history of elevated liver function tests with drugs containing ELX, TEZ and/or IVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Interrupt ALYFTREK in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. These may include:

Significant elevations in liver function tests (e.g. ALT or AST > 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST > 3× ULN with bilirubin > 2× ULN)
Clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites)

Consider referral to a hepatologist and follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve and if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk, resume ALYFTREK treatment with close monitoring.

ALYFTREK should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). ALYFTREK is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, monitor patients closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^19b938fd]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

Animal models of bacterial pneumonia — rationale, scope, and cautions are delineated. Animal models that can recapitulate clinical parameters of bacterial pneumonia are instrumental to understand complex interactions between the mammalian host and pathogenic bacteria, thereby providing a mode to investigate methods of preventing disease manifestations in humans. Laboratory models are important for multiple reasons: 1) to dissect the biology and pathogenesis of bacterial infectious organisms, 2) to determine the host response to infection to complement clinical and translational research, and 3) to drive novel mechanistic investigations and interventional studies, and animal modeling is used as a prerequisite for therapeutic considerations before human use and is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The report cautions that variable results with commonly used models may hinder rapid advancement and translation to humans for the field, and that the application and interpretation of animal models of pneumonia must be considered carefully. It also notes that although modeling the totality of human bacterial pneumonia is an unreasonable expectation of laboratory models, specific aspects of the disease may be mimicked using in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo methodologies individually or in combination and that doing so requires appropriate considerations of the host and/or system, the pathogen, the environment, and the outcome to be measured to select the best-suited experimental model to use.

### White sands national parken.wikipedia.org › wiki › white_Sands_National_Park… [^46857906]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

White Sands National Park is a national park of the United States located in New Mexico and completely surrounded by White Sands Missile Range. The park covers 145, 762 acres in the Tularosa Basin, including the southern 41% of a 275 sq mi field of white sand dunes composed of gypsum crystals. Approximately 12, 000 years ago, the land within the Tularosa Basin featured large lakes, streams, grasslands, and Ice Age mammals. As the climate warmed, rain and snowmelt dissolved gypsum from the surrounding mountains and carried it into the basin. Further warming and drying caused the lakes to evaporate and form selenite crystals. Strong winds then broke up crystals and transported them eastward. A similar process continues to produce gypsum sand today. Thousands of species of animal inhabit the park, a large portion of which are invertebrates. Several animal species feature a white or off-white coloration.

At least 45 species are endemic, living only in this park, with 40 of them being moth species. The Tularosa Basin has also seen a number of human inhabitants, from Paleo-Indians 12, 000 years ago to modern farmers, ranchers, and miners. Projectile points and stone tools have been found in the basin associated with ancient shorelines, streams, and hills. As the large ice sheet that capped the North American continent receded, Lake Otero began to evaporate, leaving behind Alkali Flat and Lake Lucero. The grassland died and the basin became increasingly arid, slowly changing into desert scrubland. The megafauna disappeared from the basin leaving behind fossil footprints. The Archaic people improved upon the hand thrown spear used by Paleo-Indians with the invention of the atlatl. After Lake Otero dried out, wind carried large quantities of gypsum sand up from the basin floor which accumulated into a large dunefield.

Archaic people entered the Tularosa Basin about 4, 000 years ago, after the dunes had stabilized, possibly attracted by a cereal grass called Indian ricegrass. The Jornada Mogollon people made pottery, lived in permanent houses, and farmed the Tularosa Basin. Evidence of their prehistoric presence dates back to about 200 CE. The Jornada Mogollon inhabited the basin until about 1350 CE when they moved away, leaving behind puddled adobe structures and pottery sherds. Over 700 years ago, bands of Apaches followed herds of bison from the Great Plains to the Tularosa Basin. The Apaches were nomadic hunters and gatherers who lived in temporary houses known as wickiups and teepees. The Apaches had established a sizable territory in southern New Mexico by the time European explorers arrived. Between 1969 and 1977, 95 oryx were released on the missile range and adjacent areas of the Tularosa Basin by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish for hunting purposes.

The oryx, having no natural predators, entered the park and competed with native species for forage. Thousands of oryx reside on the missile range presently, though annual hunts have occurred since 1974 to help control and stabilize the population. The park is situated in the Tularosa Basin with elevations ranging from 3, 887 feet at Lake Lucero, to 4, 116 feet at a former military site called NE 30. The trapped water sank into the ground or formed shallow pools that subsequently dried out, leaving the gypsum on the surface in a crystalline form called selenite. Groundwater that flows out of the Tularosa Basin flows south into the Hueco Basin. During the last ice age, a 1, 600-square-mile body of water named Lake Otero covered much of the basin. When it dried out, a large flat area of selenite crystals remained, which is named the Alkali Flat. White Sands contains various forms of dunes.

### A behavioural science framework for tackling upstream challenges in health systems [^d920320e]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Phase 1: distill the system-level challenge into priority behaviours

Behavioural science offers insights into what drives behaviour; to apply it to health system challenges, it is necessary first to distill those challenges into one or more priority behaviours. This can be done systematically in four steps:

Identify an outcome of interest

The outcome should typically be defined broadly–to decrease maternal mortality or to reduce inequity in service access, for example. The answer to the question 'how will I define success from this effort?' guides application of the framework to where a behavioural approach may be most impactful.

Describe changes within the system that create a pathway to achieve the outcome

In some instances where programme or policy goals are narrowly defined, this pathway may be apparent from the outset, for example, decreasing the frequency of stock-outs of a commodity, increasing resource allocation to a community health initiative or facilitating adoption of a high-impact practice. In other cases, a range of plausible pathways might be considered. When prioritising between pathways, it is important to consider both the significance of each pathway to the outcome of interest and to what extent it is (or might be) possible to intervene.

Identify the behaviours implicit in the pathway(s)

This means identifying who needs to act and what actions they must engage in to influence the outcome through the prioritised pathway(s). Often, several behaviours will contribute to each pathway, and one behaviour may be necessary or advantageous to encourage another. See figure 2 for an example.

Figure 2
Phase 1 of Framework.

Defining which actors must engage in which actions is critical to seeing a complex challenge through a behavioural lens. No matter how complex the issue or how structural or systemic it may seem, it can be distilled to one or more people who are making decisions and engaging in actions that together contribute to that reality. Defining these behaviours does not reduce the complexity of the problem but offers a way forward to systematically address that complexity.

Prioritise among behaviours

Often, it will not be practical to address all of the relevant behaviours. Prioritisation among behaviours should consider the potential for impact by influencing each behaviour as well as political will, resources, timeline and connections to other priority behaviours. This prioritisation does not indicate a judgement about which behaviours or actors are most important, but instead an assessment of where a careful investigation is likely to generate the greatest value for policy, programme or service changes.

Stavudine (Zerit, d4T) — animal reproductive, carcinogenicity, and perinatal findings — In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, stavudine was noncarcinogenic at doses that produced exposures 39 times (in mice) and 168 times (in rats) the human exposure observed at the recommended therapeutic dose, whereas at higher levels of exposure (250 times [in mice] and 732 times [in rats] the human exposure seen at therapeutic doses), benign and malignant liver tumors occurred in mice and rats, and urinary bladder tumors occurred in male rats. No evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats with exposures (based on Cmax) up to 216 times the exposures observed following a clinical dosage of stavudine 1 mg/kg/day, although a dose-related cytotoxic effect on preimplantation mouse embryos included inhibition of blastocyst formation at 100 μM and inhibition of post-blastocyst development at 10 μM. No evidence of teratogenicity was noted in rats or rabbits with stavudine exposures (based on Cmax) up to 399 times and 183 times, respectively, the exposures seen at a clinical dosage of stavudine 1 mg/kg/day; in rat fetuses, the incidence of a common skeletal variation increased at 399 times human exposure with no effect at 216 times human exposure, a slight post-implantation loss was noted at 216 times human exposure with no effect at approximately 135 times human exposure, and early neonatal mortality (birth to day 4) occurred at 399 times human exposure while survival of neonates was unaffected at approximately 135 times human exposure. In placental transfer studies, the concentration in rat fetal tissue was approximately one-half the concentration in maternal plasma, the fetal-to-maternal plasma ratio in primates (pig-tailed macaques) was approximately 0.80, and stavudine is excreted into the breast milk of lactating rats.

### Tularosa basin… [^5d7f6c27]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

The Tularosa Basin is a graben basin in the Basin and Range Province and within the Chihuahuan Desert, east of the Rio Grande in southern New Mexico and West Texas, in the Southwestern United States. Geography The Tularosa Basin is located primarily in Otero County, New Mexico. It covers about 6, 500 sq mi. It lies between the Sacramento Mountains to the east, the Sierra Blanca to the northeast, and the San Andres and Oscura Mountains to the west. The basin stretches about 150 mi north–south, and at its widest is about 60 mi east-west. It is geologically considered part of the Rio Grande Rift zone, which widens there due to the slight clockwise rotation of the Colorado Plateau tectonic plate.

Notable features of the basin include White Sands National Park, Oliver Lee Memorial State Park, the Carrizozo Malpais lava flow, Holloman Air Force Base, and the White Sands Missile Range with the historic Trinity nuclear test Site. Tularosa Creek flows westward into the Tularosa Basin just north of the village of Tularosa. Hydrologically, the Tularosa Basin is an endorheic basin, as no water flows out of it. The basin is closed to the north by Chupadera Mesa and to the south by the broad flat 4000-foot-elevation plain between the Franklin and Hueco Mountains, with the conventional boundary taken to be the New Mexico–Texas border. Surface water that does not evaporate or soak into the ground eventually accumulates at playas, the largest of which is Lake Lucero, at 3888 feet elevation, at the southwest end of the White Sands dunes.

The White Sands are a 710-km^2^ field of white sand dunes composed of gypsum crystals. To the north of Lake Lucero are extensive alkali flats, which produce additional gypsum for wind deposition on the dunes. The town of Carrizozo at the northern edge of the basin has an elevation of 5, 545 ft. Near Carrizozo is the Carrizozo volcanic field, an elongated 5, 000 year old lava flow with a length of 42 m. History
- Upper Paleolithic The White Sands fossil footprints in the Tularosa Basin are estimated by the National Park Service to be 21 000 to 23 000 years old and include footprints possibly showing humans stalking a giant sloth. The footprints are located at the shore of an ice age era lake. As of November 2021, 61 fossil footprints have been found at the site.
- Apache, Spanish, and U. S.

'Old West' When the Spanish arrived in the Tularosa Basin, they found springs and small streams coming from the Sacramento Mountains that fed a relatively lush grassland on the eastern side of the basin. While the Spanish tried some sheep ranching and some mining, the area remained firmly under Apache control until the 1850s, when the United States established its military presence at Fort Stanton, Torreon Fort, and Camp Comfort at White Sands. Under US military protection, the first permanent settlement was established in 1862, when about 50 Hispanic farmers from the Rio Grande Valley moved to Tularosa. Efforts to control the Apache waned somewhat during the American Civil War and serious American settlement did not begin until the late 1870s, when settlers and cattle ranchers from Texas began moving into the basin. In 1969, the Gemsbok was introduced.

### Cost-effectiveness of gamification, financial incentives, or both to increase physical activity among patients with elevated risk for cardiovascular disease [^ecd8eb3a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The BE ACTIVE trial (Behavioral Economic Approaches to Increase Physical Activity Among Patients with Elevated Risk for Cardiovascular Disease) documented the effectiveness, compared with an attention control arm that received daily text messages, of gamification, financial incentives, or gamification+financial incentives to increase steps/day. Increases in daily step count are associated with longer life expectancy, but understanding the cost-effectiveness of these interventions is essential for payers and other stakeholders seeking to implement findings.

Methods

We built a probabilistic Markov model to compare intervention costs with lifetime estimates of life-years and quality-adjusted life-years for 2 sets of comparisons: (1) each behavioral intervention versus attention control, and (2) each trial arm, including attention control, versus no intervention. Since the durability of changes in steps/day post-intervention is unknown, we modeled optimistic, intermediate, and pessimistic scenarios.

Results

Over the 12-month intervention, per-participant cost to deliver attention control was $878, gamification $938, financial incentives $1534, and gamification+financial incentives $1712. Compared with attention control, gamification's cost-effectiveness ranged from $261 (95% CI, 259–263) per life-year gained if mean steps/day during the last 18 weeks of follow-up are maintained (optimistic), to $30550 (95% CI, 30503–30597) per life-year if steps/day continue to decline at the rate observed during the full 26-week follow-up (pessimistic). Gamification+financial incentives cost < $50000/life-year only under the optimistic and intermediate scenarios. Financial incentives was dominated by gamification and gamification+financial incentives. When all 4 trial arms, including attention control, were compared with no intervention, gamification again cost < $50000/life-year across all durability scenarios.

Conclusions

Across a range of scenarios about the durability of increases in steps/day post-intervention, gamification consistently cost < $50000 per life-year gained, the threshold for high value interventions set by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Gamification+financial incentives was high-value except in the pessimistic scenario. Financial incentives was dominated.

### Step-by-step insight into gait analysis: a narrative review unlocking knee biomechanics [^01a4c10d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Gait analysis offers a powerful tool for clinical and orthopaedic decision-making. By quantifying spatiotemporal, kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking, it provides a dynamic window into joint function that static imaging cannot capture. Despite its potential, gait analysis remains largely confined to specialised centres, with limited integration in clinical pathways, mainly due to its perceived complexity and lack of standardisation. This narrative review aims to bridge that gap through a step-by-step approach to guide orthopaedic surgeons, sports medicine physicians and musculoskeletal clinicians in understanding and interpreting key biomechanical markers relevant to common knee pathologies, such as osteoarthritis and anterior cruciate ligament injury. Particular attention is given to how deviations in parameters like joint angles and moments, dynamic alignment and centre of pressure trajectories can offer actionable insights into disease progression, treatment response and surgical planning. The urgent need for standardised protocols, encompassing marker placement, biomechanical modelling and data processing, is also underscored, as they are essential to ensure reproducibility and facilitate clinical translation. By clarifying the clinical meaning of gait metrics, this review empowers healthcare professionals to integrate dynamic functional data into everyday decision-making and move towards more personalised, biomechanically informed care. Level of Evidence: Level IV.

### Aripiprazole (Opipza) [^6f7d0fbc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in five short-term (4 week and 6 week), placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of aripiprazole and the active comparators.

In the four positive trials for aripiprazole, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. Efficacy was evaluated using the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient.

In a 4 week trial (n = 414) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 1 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 4 week trial (n = 404) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (20 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 2 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI- severity score.
In a 6 week trial (n = 420) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 3 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 6 week trial (n = 367) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of aripiprazole was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 4 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.

### Recurrent pattern completion drives the neocortical representation of sensory inference [^3ac198ef]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

Main

Illusions arise from rational mistakes in sensory inference. For example, a rational perceptual interpretation of the classic Kanizsa illusion is that of a white triangle in front of three black circles (Fig. 1a). The nervous system likely evolved to rely on inference because we must frequently infer objects from partial information, such as during occlusion. Many species, including humans, nonhuman primates, mice, fish and even insects, perceive illusory contours (ICs), implying that sensory inference is fundamental to perception –. For example, mice trained to perform an orientation discrimination task on real edges can generalize their performance to ICs and vice versa.

Fig. 1
Mouse V1 neurons respond to ICs despite the lack of contrast in their receptive fields.

### Notes from the field: increase in human and animal tularemia cases-Minnesota, 2024 [^1133b2f3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Tularemia is an uncommon but potentially serious bacterial zoonotic disease caused by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Tier 1 select agent Francisella tularensis that affects 200–300 persons annually in the United States. Although cases are reported from almost every state, tularemia is most frequently reported from the central United States. Symptoms vary based on the exposure route and commonly include fever and localized symptoms (e.g. lymphadenopathy and skin ulcers). Humans and animals are usually infected through the bites of arthropods (typically ticks and deer flies), contact with infected animals, or inhalation of contaminated material. No Food and Drug Administration–approved vaccine for prevention of tularemia exists. During 2000–2023, a median of one human and two animal cases were reported annually to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) and Board of Animal Health, respectively. Animal tularemia cases increased significantly in 2023, when 20 animal cases, but no human cases, were reported. In 2024, five human cases and 27 animal cases were reported in Minnesota, all in the seven-county Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. MDH staff members investigated each reported human and animal case to identify exposures and provide public health recommendations. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. *

### Rock pocket mouse… [^f6a8c45f]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

The rock pocket mouse is one of 19 species of pocket mice in the genus Chaetodipus. It is sometimes grouped in the genus Perognathus. Description Found mainly in rocky outcrops in the deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico, the rock pocket mouse is medium-sized and nocturnal. It eats mainly plant seeds and makes small burrows in soil close to or under rocks to evade owls, its main predator. The breeding season spans a few months, starting in February or March, and the litter size is typically between three and six. As with most pocket mice, the tail is longer than the body. Taxonomy Historically, rock pocket mice have been subdivided into as many as ten subspecies based on geographical distribution and coat colour. Most rock pocket mouse populations have light, tawny fur consistent with the colour of the desert rocks on which they live.

However, darker coloured rock pocket mice are found living amid black, basaltic rock formations. Example of natural selection In 2003, scientists sampled DNA from both light- and dark-coloured rock pocket mice from areas in Pinacate Peaks, Mexico and New Mexico, USA. In the Pinacate mice, they discovered a perfect association between different versions of the Melanocortin-1 receptor gene and coat colour. Subsequent studies demonstrated that there is strong selective pressure maintaining Mc1r allele and coat colour frequencies across the short geographic distances between the light- and dark-coloured rock islands. Thus melanism in rock pocket mice is considered a fabulous example of adaptation by natural selection.

Changes in the Mc1r gene sequence are not responsible for the colour difference in the mice sampled from New Mexico, however, leading the researchers to conclude that the almost identical dark coat colours developed multiple times in rock pocket mice, an example of convergent evolution. See also

### Two-step detection of lewy body pathology via smell-function testing and CSF α-synuclein seed amplification [^94cdef4b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We show that a two-step diagnostic workflow, combining UPSIT-based risk-stratification (step 1) and restricting confirmatory CSF testing to high-risk individuals identified in step 1 (step 2), can accurately predict postmortem LBP status in a heterogeneous cohort while reducing the number of necessary lumbar punctures (Fig. 1).

Our proposed two-step diagnostic workflow has potential utility across various clinical scenarios where CSF α-syn SAA testing might be relevant. Among individuals with clinical parkinsonism, the UPSIT by itself already yielded high performance (accuracy = 85%), which improved to 95% with the addition of step 2. However, the number of CSF tests saved in this group was modest (23%). In contrast, in individuals presenting with symptoms suggestive of AD, where postmortem studies have shown that comorbid LBP occurs in 30–40%, the UPSIT-based model (step 1) performed less well. This is likely due to the influence of other factors affecting performance on a test for smell function, such as age-related factors, cognitive impairment, or the accumulation of AD pathology in the olfactory system –. In this scenario, the two-step workflow improved LBP classification performance substantially over UPSIT alone, while reducing the number of lumbar punctures compared to a CSF-only approach. This is particularly relevant for AD clinical trials, where identifying comorbid pathologies such as LBP is critical for understanding their impact on clinical and biological disease progression. Finally, we show the potential of the UPSIT as a prescreening tool in clinically normal populations, where the number of confirmatory CSF tests was reduced by 80% while improving overall accuracy. This approach could be especially important for future clinical interventional trials targeting preclinical LBD pathology.

A. Sunday-Start Regimen: The patient begins taking the first light-colored tablet from the top row of the dispenser (labeled Sunday) on the first Sunday after menstrual flow begins. When the menstrual flow begins on Sunday, the first light-colored tablet is taken on the same day. The patient takes one light-colored tablet daily for 21 days. The last light-colored tablet in the dispenser will be taken on a Saturday. Upon completion of all 21 light-colored tablets, and without interruption, the patient takes one brown tablet daily for 7 days. Upon completion of this first course of tablets, the patient begins a second course of 28-day tablets, without interruption, the next day (Sunday), starting with the Sunday light-colored tablet in the top row. Adhering to this regimen of one light-colored tablet daily for 21 days, followed without interruption by one brown tablet daily for seven days, the patient will start all subsequent cycles on a Sunday.

B. Day-1 Start Regimen: The first day of menstrual flow is Day 1. The patient places the self-adhesive day label sticker that corresponds to her starting day over the preprinted days on the tablet dispenser. She starts taking one light-colored tablet daily, beginning with the first light-colored tablet in the top row. After the last light-colored tablet (at the end of the third row) has been taken, the patient will then take the brown tablets for a week (7 days). For all subsequent cycles, the patient begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the eighth day after taking her last light-colored tablet, again starting with the first tablet in the top row after placing the appropriate day label sticker over the preprinted days on the tablet dispenser. Following this regimen of 21 light-colored tablets and 7 brown tablets, the patient will start all subsequent cycles on the same day of the week as the first course.

Behavioral testing

All behavioral tasks were conducted in Bussey-Saksida touchscreen chambers (Model 80614E, Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN, USA). Male and female mice were tested in separate chambers. To analyze pose tracking from video data, chambers were modified to optimize the quality of the video recordings (Fig. 1). Briefly, the chamber cover was removed to provide an unobstructed view for the camera. Customized wall boosters were attached to the interior chamber to prevent mice from jumping out of the apparatus. The wall boosters were made of 0.56 cm thick transparent acrylic. The shape of the boosters matched the trapezoidal shape of the chamber and increased the overall height by 17 cm. To increase the video contrast, the default house lights in the chambers were replaced with led light strips attached on the top drawer and oriented toward the chamber. The camera location was moved to the center of the chamber.

Fig. 1
Customized touchscreen chamber and DLC-VFA analysis.

A To increase the clarity of the video recording, the cover of the touchscreen chamber was replaced by a transparent wall booster (red dotted box). Additionally, the default house lights in the chambers were replaced with LED light strips, which were attached to the top drawer (red arrows). Additionally, the camera position was moved to the center of the chamber. B The top-down video was used for DLC and VFA analysis. In the illustrated video frame, DeepLabCut identified key anatomical points: the nose (marked with a red dot), the left ear (blue dot), and the right ear (green dot). Utilizing these points, the VFA package calculated the percentage of the stimulus area (the center hole area on the screen, marked with orange) that falls within each visual field area of the mouse. The green line is the center line of visual field. The area between blue lines is the binocular visual field. The areas between the blue line and yellow line are the monocular left or right visual fields. The screenshots show examples of frames when a mouse is oriented and not oriented to the screen.

### Force-light-heat stimulation-induced multicolor chromism and multifunctional applications of europium tungstate phosphor [^7cc80bda]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Stimulus-responsive chromogenic luminescent materials are promising for security and optical storage, yet force-induced color change in inorganic materials remains rarely reported. Here we report a europium tungstate that exhibits mechanochromism, driven by pressure-induced tungsten valence transformation and color center formation. The sample color shifts from orange to black with increasing pressure, accompanied by a linear variation in reflectance. A luminescence modulation rate of 100% for Eu 3+ is achieved due to the strong reabsorption of the black state. Negative photochromism, switching from black/orange to white, occurs under laser irradiation or heating via the reversible phase transition between EuWO 4 and Eu 2 W 2 O 9. The luminescence modulation is attributed to the synergistic effects of body color reabsorption and nonradiative transitions. Our work demonstrates a robust inorganic material responsive to force, light, and heat, offering versatile functionality for pressure sensing, anti-counterfeiting, and optical storage, and provides a design strategy for multicolor chromogenic materials.

### Global assessment of current extinction risks and future challenges for turtles and tortoises [^1e1cccd4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Non-random extinction risk

The binomial distribution tests on these 335 species showed that the proportion of extinct or threatened species was higher in some chelonian families (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 1). The families with more extinct or threatened species than the average of 58.5% were Testudinidae (86.2%, n = 65, p = 1.07 × 10 − 6) and Trionychidae (83.3%, n = 30, p = 0.002) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, families of Pelomedusidae (12.5%, n = 16, p = 0.0001), Kinosternidae (13.3%, n = 30, p = 3.75 × 10 −7), and Chelidae (27.5%, n = 51, p = 5.22 × 10 −6) contained significantly fewer extinct or threatened species than the all-family average based on the combined Red List assessment (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 1). Although the binomial distribution results for five small families (e.g. Podocnemididae) were not significant (p = 0.243–0.585, Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 1), we classified them as high-risk because 100% of the family's species are threatened or extinct.

Fig. 2
The Indomalaya region is an extinction epicenter.

We show the proportion of threatened and extinct species among families or biogeographical realms in subplots A and B. The background colors in subplots A and B indicate significantly higher (red) or lower (blue) values of binomial test levels at 5% or having 100% or 0% threatened species. The Dunn-Sidak method was employed to adjust the critical values. Since the binomial test has relatively low statistical power when the family is small, we grouped small families into high-risk or low-risk groups when they contained 100% or 0% threatened or extinct species (those with > 0% and < 100% are omitted). Subplot C depicts the origins of species in families from various biogeographical realms. The map is from Olson et al.and is made available through the World Wildlife Fund website.

### Changing minds, saving lives: how training psychological safety transforms healthcare [^e8a0c692]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

The execution

Executing our innovative pedagogical and strategic initiative involved a comprehensive and iterative process. We used a combination of e-learning and immersive simulation to target soft skills and improve our organisation's safety and quality of care. Table 1 summarises the step-by-step training preparation, design and implementation.

Table 1
Description of the step-by-step training preparation, design, implementation and assessment. Each DOMA module included an impact survey before and a satisfaction survey at the end of the module. All training interventions (e-learning and DOMA) included pre-tests and post-tests

First, our execution strategy involved ensuring our training programme's feasibility, effectiveness and sustainability by convincing management of the value of investing in large-scale training initiatives.

Once the training programme was approved, we analysed expressed and observed training needs to feed the development of targeted e-learning courses and simulation scenarios to address these needs. The pedagogical strategy focused on leveraging e-learning to (1) teach, (2) demonstrate the ideal soft skills for crisis management, and (3) raise awareness of performance gaps among healthcare professionals. This initial phase aimed to establish a foundation for skill development and highlight improvement areas. Simultaneously, we developed in-person 2-day courses mixing innovative theoretical focused lectures on soft skills, immediately illustrated with immersive simulation scenarios. Those courses aimed to provide hands-on experience and demonstrate the gap between ideal and actual performance.

Participation in the educational project was mandatory as a continuing education process for all the VMHS anaesthesia staff (anaesthesiologists and nurses anaesthetic). By challenging professionals in simulated crises, we aimed to foster a deeper understanding of their capabilities and enhance skill acquisition in a realistic environment. The training programme was designed to facilitate a progressive increase in skills, focusing on routine practice reliability and managing life-threatening emergencies. Interactive debriefing sessions following simulations allowed thorough exploration of participants' understanding and skill mastery while providing opportunities for reflection and feedback.

Our execution strategy encompassed a structured approach to needs analysis, curriculum development, skill acquisition and impact assessment. By integrating e-learning and immersive simulation, we aimed to provide healthcare professionals with the necessary tools and training to enhance patient safety and care quality, ultimately driving a culture of continuous improvement within our organisation.
