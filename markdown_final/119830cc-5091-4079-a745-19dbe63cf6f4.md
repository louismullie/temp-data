## Question

incidental GFR of 55

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an incidental eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73 m², including questions about staging, confirmation, risk stratification, medication adjustments, monitoring, and referral thresholds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming chronicity and excluding acute kidney injury or acute kidney disease. Then, I should verify the accuracy of the eGFR using repeat testing and, if needed, cystatin C or measured GFR. Next, I will stage CKD using the GFR and albuminuria categories and assess progression risk. After that, I need to review medication safety and dose adjustments, especially metformin, RAAS inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, NSAIDs, and renally cleared drugs. Finally, I should outline monitoring intervals, lifestyle and cardiovascular risk reduction, and when to refer to nephrology, tailoring to age and comorbidities.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and chronicity, because an isolated eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73 m² does not by itself establish CKD. I need to ensure persistence for at least 3 months and exclude AKI or AKD, which can transiently depress eGFR, so I should repeat creatinine and eGFR in about 3 months and review prior labs and the history for intercurrent illness, volume status, or new medications that could acutely affect kidney function [^116arzYS] [^1117AbJV] [^116ktjfg].

> Wait, let me verify the accuracy of the eGFR estimate before I label this as CKD G3a. Creatinine-based eGFR can be biased by muscle mass, diet, and assay issues, so if the result is unexpected or will materially change management, I should obtain cystatin C and calculate eGFRcr-cys, which improves accuracy and prognostic performance, and if precision is critical for dosing or diagnosis, I should consider measured GFR using an exogenous marker when available [^114Li3Qz] [^111cJLNg] [^112yiJoE].

> I will now examine the staging once chronicity is established. An eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to CKD G3a, but hold on, I should verify albuminuria because risk stratification and management hinge on the combination of GFR and albuminuria, so I need a spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and, if positive, repeat to confirm persistence given diurnal and interindividual variability [^114KtcHN] [^111Yd4cx].

> Next, I should review progression risk and monitoring cadence. For G3a, baseline risk is modest, but I need to check for rapid eGFR decline, heavy albuminuria, diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease, and I should monitor eGFR and ACR at least annually, increasing frequency to every 3–6 months if albuminuria is ≥ 300 mg/g, eGFR is approaching 30, or there is rapid decline, with a change in eGFR > 20% or ACR doubling prompting evaluation for progression or acute contributors [^112g2Y3D] [^116pDVsD].

> Hold on, I should verify medication safety and dosing now. Metformin is acceptable at eGFR 55 but I need to reassess if eGFR trends toward 45 and avoid initiation below 45, and temporarily hold around iodinated contrast or acute illness, while NSAIDs should be minimized or avoided, and any renally cleared drugs should be reviewed and dose-adjusted to eGFR using validated equations rather than creatinine alone [^111eEWJ3] [^115P6YDs] [^1143XhFn].

> Let me consider disease-modifying therapy. If the patient has diabetes with albuminuria or hypertension with albuminuria, I should initiate or optimize RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitor or ARB, but not combine them, and I should monitor potassium and creatinine about a week after initiation or dose changes, temporarily withholding during acute illness or procedures that risk AKI [^115gCdmE] [^112ooudg].

> I should double-check SGLT2 inhibitor candidacy. In type 2 diabetes with CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney and cardiovascular events and can be initiated down to eGFR 30, with continuation often reasonable at lower eGFRs given ongoing benefit, though glycemic efficacy wanes as eGFR declines, so I need to counsel on this and monitor for euglycemic ketoacidosis and volume status [^1158cmfL] [^114xfYwD].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular risk reduction because CKD G3a confers elevated ASCVD risk. I need to ensure guideline-directed statin therapy based on diabetes, ASCVD, or elevated calculated risk, reinforce blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and lifestyle measures, and I should remember that eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is itself a risk enhancer in some frameworks, which strengthens the case for statins even when LDL is not markedly elevated [^114ge5vY] [^112cYLRs].

> But wait, what if the patient is older? I need to ensure I do not overdiagnose or overtreat based solely on an absolute eGFR threshold, since many older adults have eGFR 45–59 due to aging, so I should contextualize with prior trajectories, comorbidities, and life expectancy, and consider that the absolute risk of progression to ESRD at G3a is low, even though cardiovascular risk remains relevant [^111oKPw8] [^111USAJq].

> I should confirm referral thresholds. Routine nephrology referral is not mandated at eGFR 55, but I need to refer if eGFR is < 30, if there is rapid progression > 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, heavy albuminuria, refractory hypertension, hematuria with abnormal morphology or persistent hematuria after urologic evaluation, suspected hereditary kidney disease, or complex metabolic complications, and I should use the 4-variable KFRE to estimate 2-year kidney failure risk to guide timing of access planning if risk is high [^117RrQsk] [^115ZKcU6] [^111h1Y2k].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps. I will repeat creatinine with eGFR and obtain a spot ACR in about 3 months to confirm chronicity and albuminuria status, review medications for nephrotoxins and renally cleared agents, reinforce blood pressure and glycemic control if applicable, and if the repeat eGFR remains around 55 with ACR < 30 mg/g, I will continue annual monitoring and primary care management, escalating follow-up if albuminuria rises or eGFR declines meaningfully [^1151kJym] [^112g2Y3D].

An incidental eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates **stage 3a CKD** [^114KtcHN] and should be confirmed with repeat testing in 3 months [^1117AbJV] and combined with albuminuria assessment [^111Yd4cx] to guide risk and management. Most patients with stable stage 3a CKD have a **low risk of progression** [^111USAJq] and can be managed in primary care with annual monitoring, blood pressure control, and medication review; refer to nephrology if there is rapid eGFR decline, heavy albuminuria, or uncertainty about chronicity or cause [^117RrQsk].

---

## Confirming chronicity and staging

- **Repeat testing**: Confirm CKD with a repeat eGFR in 3 months [^1117AbJV] to ensure persistence ≥ 3 months [^1117AbJV].
- **Staging**: eGFR 55 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to CKD stage 3a (G3a) [^114KtcHN].
- **Albuminuria assessment**: Measure urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) [^111Yd4cx] to complete risk stratification [^111cJLNg].

---

## Clinical significance and risk assessment

- **Progression risk**: Most stage 3a patients have low progression risk [^111USAJq]; risk increases with albuminuria, rapid eGFR decline, diabetes, or hypertension [^117NcKTA].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Elevated cardiovascular risk exists even with mild eGFR reduction [^111cJLNg], especially with albuminuria [^111cJLNg].
- **Individualized risk**: Use the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) [^notfound] to estimate 2–5 year kidney failure risk and guide referral [^117RrQsk].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

| **Step** | **Recommended actions** |
|-|-|
| Confirm chronicity | Repeat eGFR in 3 months [^1117AbJV] |
| Assess albuminuria | Measure ACR; repeat if elevated [^1151kJym] |
| Evaluate cause | - History <br/> - Medications <br/> - Imaging <br/> - Consider cystatin C or mGFR if uncertainty [^112yiJoE] |
| Risk stratification | Use KFRE and clinical context [^114MUoHU] |

## Management strategies

### General principles

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg if albuminuria is present; use ACE inhibitors or ARBs when indicated [^115gCdmE].
- **Glycemic control**: Aim for HbA1c ~7% in diabetes, adjusting for comorbidities [^116TpWH4].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, smoking cessation, dietary sodium restriction, and physical activity [^112yEMN8].

---

### Medication management

- **Metformin**: Safe at eGFR ≥ 45; review at 30–44; avoid if < 30 [^111eEWJ3] [^115P6YDs].
- **NSAIDs**: Avoid or minimize use due to nephrotoxicity risk [^116TpWH4].
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Consider in type 2 diabetes with CKD for kidney and cardiovascular benefits [^114xfYwD].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **annual eGFR and ACR** for stable stage 3a patients, with more frequent checks if albuminuria is elevated or eGFR declines rapidly [^112g2Y3D]. Evaluate any **eGFR decline > 20%** or **ACR doubling** on subsequent testing [^112g2Y3D]. Continue comprehensive primary care management, including cardiovascular risk reduction and complication screening [^112cYLRs].

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

- **Rapid decline**: eGFR decline > 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year [^117RrQsk].
- **Heavy albuminuria**: ACR > 300 mg/g or proteinuria > 500 mg/day.
- **Uncertain diagnosis**: Unclear chronicity, atypical presentation, or suspected hereditary disease [^117RrQsk].
- **Advanced CKD**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or high KFRE risk [^116q89xW].

---

## Prognosis and patient counseling

Prognosis is generally favorable in stable stage 3a CKD, with **low short-term progression risk** [^111USAJq]. Emphasize adherence to blood pressure control, glycemic management, and lifestyle changes, and educate patients on avoiding nephrotoxins and recognizing signs of progression [^116TpWH4].

---

An incidental eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates stage 3a CKD [^114KtcHN]; confirm with repeat testing and albuminuria assessment, then manage with risk-based primary care strategies and refer to nephrology if risk is high or the diagnosis is uncertain.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals — ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1 — identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and/or a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) greater than or equal to 30 mg/g, is a major public health problem. Globally, nearly 10% of the adult population has a diagnosis of CKD which is associated with substantially increased risks for cardiovascular events, progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplant, in-hospital complications, and early death. The healthcare costs of CKD are substantial. In 2018, overall Medicare fee for service spending for patients with CKD exceeded $81 billion, representing 23% of total Medicare spending.

Most preventive guidelines recommend testing for CKD as part of the usual management of high-risk conditions including diabetes, hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. The rationale for these recommendations is that detection and staging of CKD are critical for proper kidney and cardiovascular risk stratification, prompt referral to nephrology care, and initiation of cardio-kidney preventive therapies. Collectively, these actions could vastly lower the adverse health consequences of CKD, but major evidence-to-care gaps exist in CKD detection which is the necessary first step towards optimizing clinical management and outcomes. For instance, less than 50% of patients with diabetes undergo regular testing for CKD with eGFR and albuminuria. For patients with hypertension but without diabetes, testing for albuminuria is routinely conducted in less than 10% of patients. As a result, CKD at early stages is poorly recognized, marking a missed opportunity to treat CKD in patients when preventive efforts could have the largest impact.

Prior research has identified multi-level barriers for the optimal detection and treatment of CKD in primary care. Primary care providers (PCPs) have reported limited knowledge of CKD and its complications and low awareness of guidelines for CKD care. In addition, PCPs have reported low self-efficacy in educating and treating patients with CKD. From a system-level perspective, PCPs have reported limited time and clinical support to care for patients with CKD who often have competing medical priorities. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the assessment and reporting of albuminuria and limited availability of cystatin C as a marker of kidney function to enhance CKD detection and staging. Lack of institutional support for CKD care improvement initiatives may further widen this care gap. While our research group has demonstrated that comprehensive CKD detection and treatment is feasible in primary care, larger implementation efforts are needed to bridge large evidence to care gaps.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes – A tiered approach: an overview of the joint association of British clinical diabetologists and UK kidney association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^114rULsB]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Metformin has been used as a first‐line oral drug for people with type 2 diabetes for over 60 years. The dose of metformin should be decreased to 500 mg twice a day if eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and omitted in the majority of circumstances if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Of note limitations of eGFR measurements need to be appreciated especially in those at extremes of body weight and individualised treatment decisions may need to be considered in people with eGFR 25–30 mL/min/1.73m 2.

The guidelines acknowledge that there is a lack of high‐quality clinical trial evidence for the use of metformin as a cardio‐renal protective agent in people with CKD but in most countries worldwide it remains the most widely used first‐line agent for type 2 diabetes.

### Prime time for chronic kidney disease [^111MKvTW]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

BMC Nephrology and BMC Primary Care are teaming up to bring a much-needed series for the primary care practitioner serving as an educational update of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This series will feature articles focused on the identification, diagnosis, management of complications, and treatment of patients with CKD geared towards the primary care practitioner perspective. CKD is a leading cause of medical illness worldwide with an estimated 8 to 16% of the world's population and 15% of the US population affected. CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) sustained over at least 3 months and then categorized in 5 stages based on GFR and 3 stages based on albuminuria, making up the CKD Heat Map (Fig. 1). Normal GFR is defined as greater or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 and normal albuminuria is defined as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) < 30 mg/gram or < 3 mg/mmol. Decreasing GFR and increasing albuminuria define the various stages of CKD. The prevalence increases with age and most patients are in CKD stage 3 at any one point in time. The lifetime risk of developing CKD stage 3a in the United States is estimated to be greater than 50%.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^112yEMN8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^112ooudg]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Management of hypertension/albuminuria in sickle cell disease — For children and adults with SCD and albuminuria, the ASH guideline panel suggests the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi's) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The initiation of ACEi's and ARBs for patients with SCD requires adequate follow-up and monitoring of side effects. When prescribing ACEi's or ARBs, recommended renal safety steps are to start medication at a lower dose in individuals with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess GFR and measure serum potassium within 1 week of starting medication or following any dose escalation, and temporarily suspend medication during interval illness, planned IV radiocontrast administration, or bowel preparation for colonoscopy or prior to major surgery. The panel did not assess evidence to guide albuminuria screening; Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines state albuminuria should be confirmed by either a first morning urine sample or 2 consecutive untimed urine samples.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

ICD implantation and eGFR — study-level findings indicate kidney function modifies benefit. For each 10-unit reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), all-cause mortality increased 16% (P = 0.003), and ICD therapy conferred benefit only when eGFR was > 35 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (overall risk reduction 32%; P = 0.001), with loss of benefit at eGFR < 35 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (HR: 1.09; P = 0.84). In pooled randomized controlled trials (2867 patients; 36.3% with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), mortality was 43.3% with usual care versus 35.8% with ICD; benefit was seen for eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (adjusted HR: 0.49) but not for eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (adjusted HR: 0.80). In a chronic kidney disease (CKD) registry, the ICD group had HR 0.69 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.82) with an interaction by eGFR (P = 0.04); stratified results showed benefit for eGFR 45 to 59 (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.77) and 30 to 44 (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85) but not < 30 (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.35).

Blood and urine tests are commonly performed by clinicians in both ambulatory and hospital settings that detect chronic and acute kidney disease. Thresholds for these tests have been established that signal the presence and severity of kidney injury or dysfunction. In the appropriate clinical context of a patient's history and physical examination, an abnormal test result should trigger specific actions for clinicians, including reviewing patient medication use, follow-up testing, prescribing lifestyle modifications, and specialist referral. Tests for kidney disease can also be used to determine the future risk for kidney failure as well as cardiovascular death.

Combining creatinine and cystatin C generally improves estimation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the combined eGFR also appears to be a better predictor of adverse outcomes compared with creatinine eGFR alone, though the data were somewhat mixed; a patient level meta-analysis found that the combined cystatin-creatinine eGFR was a better predictor of progression of kidney disease, cardiovascular outcomes, and healthcare utilization than the eGFR based on creatinine alone. The Work Group reported that the quality of studies was Low, noted that cystatin C is becoming more widely available but it is not as widely available as serum creatinine, and that while the cost has declined, the cystatin C assay is more expensive than serum creatinine; for military members, availability was important because a muscular individual could be incorrectly characterized as having CKD, which could limit their deployability and potentially degrade operational strength.

### The effect of kidney biopsy on glomerular filtration rate: a frequent patient concern [^112pWomM]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The effect of percutaneous kidney biopsy on glomerular filtration rate has never been identified, though it is frequently a concern raised by patients. Following a clinical interaction with an inquisitive patient undergoing her fifth biopsy, we attempted to estimate the effect using retrospective data. In a cohort of patients with stable kidney function undergoing transplant biopsy without clinical indication (as part of a surveillance programme) the effect of biopsy was observed as a step change in glomerular filtration rate. Reassuringly, the loss of glomerular filtration rate resulting from a biopsy, has a 1-sided 95% confidence interval of < 1.4 mL/min.

### Individualized risk of CKD progression among US adults [^111USAJq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study with results generalizable to the US adult population, we had several key findings. First, 1.04 million US adults who do not meet laboratory-based criteria for CKD have a high risk (risk ≥ 5%) of CKD progression, and this risk is driven by factors other than eGFR or albuminuria. Second, 60% of US adults with CKD are classified as CKD on the basis of albuminuria alone (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). In this group, over 3.73 million (24%) have a high risk of CKD progression. Importantly, 1.51 million (41%) of them do not have diabetes and would not qualify for UACR testing according to current Merit-based Incentive Payment System Clinical Quality Measures quality metrics. Third, 55% of US adults with CKD belong to stage G3a-A1, and 94% of them have a low risk of CKD progression (risk < 5%). Even among the 1.40 million adults with stage G3b-A1, 69% had 3-year risk < 5%. These findings highlight the importance of considering the individual-level risk of progression in the definition and management of CKD, similar to how the risk of cardiovascular disease is considered in the treatment of hypertension.

At present, most patients with CKD are diagnosed and staged using guideline-recommended cutoffs of laboratory values, namely UACR and creatinine-derived eGFR, on the basis of expert consensus. An eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 is the threshold for diagnosing CKD unless albuminuria or structural disease is present, irrespective of eGFR. Prognostication of CKD relies heavily on eGFR and albuminuria stages. However, the risks of CKD progression and kidney failure attributed per CKD stage in the KDIGO heatmapare relative to those with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and no albuminuria. A 65-year-old patient with an eGFR of 50 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and UACR of 15 mg/g is classified as stage G3a-A1 and deemed to have a four-fold higher risk of CKD progression and 22-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with someone without CKD. For an individual categorized as stage 3a-A1, however, their range of possible CKD progression risk, 0.5%–12% in our study, is widely contingent on the presence of other risk factors, with different clinical management implications.

### Glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria for detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney disease in adults: a systematic review [^111Yd4cx]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Because early-stage kidney disease is asymptomatic and is associated with both morbidity and mortality, laboratory measurements are required for its detection.

Objective

To summarize evidence supporting the use of laboratory tests for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to detect and stage acute kidney injury, acute kidney diseases and disorders, and chronic kidney disease in adults.

Evidence Review

We reviewed recent guidelines from various professional groups identified via the National Guideline Clearing House and author knowledge, and systematically searched MEDLINE for other sources of evidence for selected topics.

Findings

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines define and stage acute and chronic kidney diseases by GFR and albuminuria. For initial assessment of GFR, measuring serum creatinine and reporting estimated GFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2009 equation is recommended. If confirmation of GFR is required because of conditions that affect serum creatinine independent of GFR (eg, extremes of muscle mass or diet), or interference with the assay, cystatin C should be measured and estimated GFR should be calculated and reported using cystatin C (eGFRcys) and serum creatinine (eGFRcr-cys) or GFR should be measured directly using a clearance procedure. Initial assessment of albuminuria includes measuring urine albumin and creatinine in an untimed spot urine collection and reporting albumin-to-creatinine ratio. If confirmation of albuminuria is required because of diurnal variation or conditions affecting creatinine excretion, such as extremes of muscle mass or diet, the albumin excretion rate should be measured from a timed urine collection.

Conclusions and Relevance

Detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney diseases can be relatively simple. Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with kidney disease, early diagnosis is important and should be pursued in at-risk populations.

### Chronic kidney disease diagnosis and management: a review [^112cYLRs]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death.

Observations

Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria ≥ 300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114xfYwD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors have kidney and cardiovascular benefits, but their glucose-lowering effect decreases at low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD increases hypoglycemia risk requiring careful monitoring with insulin or sulfonylureas. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes. However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2. A secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent CKD when added to metformin in those without underlying CKD. Individuals with CKD are at high risk for hypoglycemia, and if treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs close monitoring and adjustment as eGFR declines with education on hypoglycemia occurrence.

### Measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate: current status and future directions [^117PWaEL]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the assessment of kidney function in medical practice, research and public health. Measured GFR (mGFR) remains the reference standard, but the past 20 years have seen major advances in estimated GFR (eGFR). Both eGFR and mGFR are associated with error compared with true GFR. eGFR is now recommended by clinical practice guidelines, regulatory agencies and public health agencies for the initial evaluation of GFR, with measured GFR (mGFR) typically considered an important confirmatory test, depending on how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for application to the clinical, research or public health setting. Our approach is to use initial and confirmatory tests as needed to develop a final assessment of true GFR. We suggest that GFR evaluation might be improved by more complete implementation of current recommendations and by further research to improve the accuracy of mGFR and eGFR.

The FDA states that metformin is contraindicated with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, eGFR should be monitored while taking metformin, benefits and risks should be reassessed when eGFR falls to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, metformin should not be initiated if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and it should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or before iodinated contrast imaging when eGFR is 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Polygenic association of glomerular filtration rate decline in world trade center responders [^117FLcDg]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The overall prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is ~ 15% among adults in the United States. The prevalence is comparatively lower in younger individuals (~ 6%, ~ 12% and ~ 38% for individuals in age groups 18–44, 45–64 and over 65 years receptively). A decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been associated with progression of CKD. CKD is associated with significant healthcare costs, as well as morbidity and mortality, and recent data suggest that even mild reductions in estimated (e)GFR is associated with adverse long-term outcomes. While eGFR is measured routinely in clinical practice, urine albumin measurements are not performed as frequently, and individuals with eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m who develop early decline in kidney function often remain undiagnosed. Consequently, in observational studies using electronic health record (EHR) data, a significant decline in eGFR might be a better measure of early kidney disease than a clinical diagnosis of 'incident CKD' that requires albuminuria assessment.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) medication management — Where precision is required for dosing or estimates may be unreliable, we recommend methods based upon cystatin C or direct measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (1C). We recommend temporary discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic and renally excreted drugs in people with a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G3a-G5) who have serious intercurrent illness that increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers (including ACE-Is, ARBs, aldosterone inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors), diuretics, NSAIDs, metformin, lithium, and digoxin (1C). We recommend that adults with CKD seek medical or pharmacist advice before using over-the-counter medicines or nutritional protein supplements (1B), and we recommend not using herbal remedies in people with CKD (1D). For metformin, we recommend that it be continued in people with GFR ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G1-G3a); its use should be reviewed in those with GFR 30–44 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR category G3b); and it should be discontinued in people with GFR < 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G4-G5) (1C). We recommend that all people taking potentially nephrotoxic agents such as lithium, aminoglycosides, and calcineurin inhibitors should have their GFR, electrolytes and drug levels regularly monitored (1A). The US Food and Drug Administration black-box warning for metformin states it is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women, and it is now recognized that the risk for lactic acidosis in patients on metformin is extremely low.

HIV-related chronic kidney disease — monitoring kidney function and albuminuria/proteinuria: The CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate and precise than MDRD in the general population and in HIV-infected persons and is the preferred creatinine-based GFR estimation method; the MDRD equation underestimates exogenously measured GFR in individuals with normal or near-normal kidney function; the Cockcroft–Gault equation estimates creatinine clearance rather than GFR and is less accurate and precise than MDRD and CKD-EPI, though it has historically been used for dosing of renally cleared drugs; most clinical laboratories report creatinine-based GFR by CKD-EPI or MDRD; the CKD-EPI equation that uses both creatinine and cystatin C has been reported to be more precise and accurate than either single-biomarker equation, yet many laboratories do not report cystatin C values calibrated to an international standard; use of the combined biomarker equation or an exogenous GFR measure may be helpful when estimated GFR–creatinine is near 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2 if a more accurate estimate would affect management; urinalysis is an acceptable screen for albuminuria/proteinuria; proteinuria ≥ 1+ on urinalysis should be quantified with either albumin-to-creatinine ratio or a protein-to-creatinine ratio; and diabetes management guidelines recommend monitoring albuminuria annually, which is appropriate to apply to HIV-infected diabetics.

Module A: Initial assessment of kidney disease — patients with "Concern for acute or chronic kidney disease (e.g., incidental lab abnormality, history, etc.)" are first asked "Does the patient have an urgent or emergent condition?" If "Yes", the action is "Refer to emergency department or manage and stabilize", followed by the risk-factor question "Does patient have risk factor(s) for CKD (e.g. DM, HF, CVD, HTN, age > 60 years)?", with "Yes" leading to "Obtain sCr, eGFR, and spot UACR at least annually" and "No" leading to "Initial assessment for kidney and non-kidney disease". If the answer is "No" to the urgent/emergent question, proceed to the same risk-factor question and subsequent actions. From Box 5, the next decision is "Does patient have evidence of kidney disease?", where "Yes" prompts "Are these findings new?"; a "Yes" response leads to "Assess for AKI/AKD (exit to Module B)" and a "No" response to "Assess for CKD (exit to Module C)". If there is "No" evidence of kidney disease at this step, the action is to "Obtain sCr, eGFR, and spot UACR at least annually". Box 6 then connects to "Does patient have evidence of kidney disease?"

### Kidney trajectory charts to assist general practitioners in the assessment of patients with reduced kidney function: a randomised vignette study [^111oKPw8]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant and growing problem worldwide, often existing with or preceding cardiovascular disease and diabetes.CKD is currently defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 present for > 3 months, irrespective of age. However, from a peak in the mid-20s, kidney function declines with age at a rate of about 1 mL/min/1.73m 2 /year. There are, therefore, concerns over the classification of declining kidney function in older people, and the potential for overdiagnosis. A persistent eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 is common in older people, with more than 40% of people over 70 years old meeting the current definition of CKD. One-third of people with CKD are in stage 3a (eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73m 2), with the majority being older. The increased mortality risk for older patients in stage 3a is very small, and only a minority (< 1%) of older patients with CKD will go on to have end-stage kidney disease. On the other hand, certain population groups, such as Aboriginal Australians, have higher rates of end-stage renal disease and earlier onset of CKD, associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Current CKD guidelines for general practitioners (GPs) do not consider patient age, with management recommendations being based on absolute eGFR cut-off values, irrespective of age. This may lead to overdiagnosis (the labelling of these people with disease) and overtreatment of patients who would otherwise not progress to kidney failure. Conversely, younger patients with a rapidly declining eGFR that is still in the normal range may not be recognised as having a clinical problem until their kidney function is substantially reduced.

To account for age, we propose an alternative model that allows GPs to make practical decisions about an individual patient, while considering the epidemiology of both end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular risk. This alternative model uses a 'kidney age trajectory chart' as a tool to assist GPs in the diagnosis and management of patients with declining kidney function. The aim of the current study was to investigate how GPs would use an age-based chart to help interpret declining kidney function. Specifically, we hypothesised that the chart would help GPs appropriately identify patients with reduced kidney function relative to their age, according to both the current definition of CKD and whether the patient had a clinically relevant problem with their kidneys.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

### Refining GFR estimation: a quest for the unobservable truth? [^115D3Jas]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is central to evaluating kidney health, remains challenging. Measured GFR is not widely available and lacks standardization. Estimated GFR can be highly inaccurate for some patients and has limited applicability to many patient populations, such as those who are acutely ill. Recent metabolomic advances show promise for identifying new filtration markers that might enhance GFR estimation. Improving GFR assessment will require refinement in both GFR measurement and estimation methods.

Progression of kidney disease

There is no consistent definition of what constitutes renal progression in the literature. Many studies have used a doubling of serum creatinine, corresponding to an approximate halving of GFR, as an end-point defining progression, but this is insufficiently sensitive to be useful in clinical practice. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have defined progression as a move to a higher disease category (e.g. stage 3A [GFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2] to stage 3B [GFR30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2]) confirmed by a fall in GFR of greater than or equal to 25%, an increase in albuminuria, a greater than 25% decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or a greater than 10%/year decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 54 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in one year). NICE defined progression as a decline in GFR of more than 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, or more than 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 averaged over 5 years.

Progression is not necessarily common even amongst people with known CKD e.g. amongst people with stage 3 CKD only 1.3% progressed to stage 5 CKD (established renal failure, typically requiring dialysis or transplantation) over 5 years. Amongst community dwelling older (greater than 65 years) adults with stage 3 CKD mean GFR declines of 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year have been reported respectively in male and female subjects with diabetes and somewhat lower values amongst subjects without diabetes (1.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year amongst males and females respectively). In the REIN study proteinuric (greater than 1 g/24 h) non-diabetic subjects with GFRs in the approximate range 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a decline of GFR of 7.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with slightly lower values being observed in those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade.

### Current status and future perspectives for CKD testing [^112m3BQQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in the United States. CKD usually is silent until its late stages; thus, many patients with CKD are not aware of their kidney disease. Often, they are found to have CKD only shortly before the onset of symptomatic kidney failure, when there are few opportunities to prevent adverse outcomes. Earlier detection allows more time for evaluation and treatment, but requires explicit testing strategies for asymptomatic individuals at increased risk. CKD is defined as kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for 3 months or longer. In the majority of patients, CKD can be detected by using 2 simple tests: a urine test for the detection of proteinuria and a blood test to estimate GFR. Understanding the strengths and limitations of CKD testing is critical for appropriate interpretation of the results. The major strength of CKD testing is its feasibility of implementation in public health activities and clinical practice, enabling the detection of CKD by using objective measures without knowledge of the cause of the kidney disease. The major limitation of testing for urine protein is that both total protein and albumin excretion can be increased transiently for a number of factors. The major limitation of current GFR-estimating equations is the inaccuracy of estimates at 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and greater, which is the threshold for the definition of CKD. Repeated testing for urine protein and interpretation of GFR estimates in the context of kidney damage and the clinical context of patient presentation can help overcome these limitations.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

### Glomerular filtration rate: when to measure and in which patients? [^111KXMDL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Of the glomerular, tubular and endocrine functions of the kidney, nephrologists have mostly focused their attention on the glomerular functions-albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-to grade the severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although both albuminuria and GFR are associated with renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the utility of measured GFR (mGFR) has been questioned. GFR when measured adequately is the most precise measure of glomerular function and can be useful to individualize therapy among patients with CKD. In situations where estimated GFR is known to provide imprecise estimates of glomerular function, for example, sarcopenia and advanced cirrhosis, the measurement of GFR may be especially important. We discuss several clinical situations where mGFR can potentially influence the quality of life or complications of therapy because of interventions based on imperfect knowledge of GFR. We reason that although large databases may not detect the benefits of mGFR at the population level, precision medicine requires that therapy be individualized based on the best estimate of GFR that can be obtained particularly when the risk of harm is increased. The recent standardization of mGFRs is a step in the right direction and may help in treating the individual patient with CKD with a lower risk of complications and a better quality of life. We call for research in these subgroups of patients where it is clinically felt that mGFR is useful for clinical decision-making.

Development of the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Cohort

The steps of developing a cohort of patients with CKD who were managed in primary care between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, from Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) data repository are shown. Chronic kidney disease was defined as at least 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at least 90 days apart.

Decision Process for Identification of Individuals With Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

A sample timeline of the decision process followed to identify patients with CKD (defined as having ≥ 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] measurements < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 within at least 3 months but not more than 18 months) in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data repository. Qualifying eGFR indicates an eGFR value less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2; blocked phase, period of 90 days after the first qualifying eGFR measurement at which no second eGFR measurement was considered confirmatory of CKD; qualifying phase, period of 3 to 18 months after the first qualifying eGFR measurement that a second eGFR measurement confirms CKD and qualifies the patient to be included in the study; and follow-up period, 1 year after confirmation of CKD to assess the use of appropriate medications.

Setting and Data Sources

The CPCSSN is composed of 13 regional networks that form a national disease surveillance system that collects primary care data from 9 of the 13 provinces and territories in Canada. Data in the CPCSSN repository are derived from primary care electronic medical records (EMRs) and are cleaned, coded, deidentified, and made available to users for research, surveillance, evaluation, and quality improvement purposes.

Appendix J. Approaches for eGFR calculation — glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is described as the best overall index of kidney function and a measure of how quickly plasma is filtered each minute by the nephron; in young adults normal GFR is approximately 90–130 mL/min and it declines on average 0.8–1.0 mL/min/year after age 30. In clinical practice, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is obtained from validated equations using creatinine, cystatin C, or both, and any estimate assumes steady-state kidney function; if kidney function is changing (e.g. AKI), the creatinine or cystatin C value is unstable and the estimating formulas should not be used, with rising levels in a non-steady state leading formulas to overestimate GFR and falling levels leading formulas to underestimate GFR. eGFR is used for screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) with urine albumin/creatinine assessment, determining CKD severity, and monitoring progression of kidney disease, and knowing the level of GFR is important for medication prescribing.

### Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate and outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^114FF5g6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is important in the diagnosis and prognostication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The current standards for CKD progression in clinical trials are kidney failure and the doubling of serum creatinine (∼57% decline in eGFR). These endpoints have limitations as they are only applicable to patients with later stages of CKD and often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power.

Recent Findings

Lesser declines in eGFR (30% and 40%) have been evaluated as potential endpoints in recent studies. These endpoints are more common and show a strong association with the risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality. These findings have been shown to be consistent across different causes of CKD and for different interventions. A particular limitation of reduced thresholds is an elevated risk of type I errors in the presence of acute treatment effects, particularly with a 30% eGFR decline cut off.

Summary

Surrogate endpoints for kidney failure and mortality are needed in clinical trials to allow for the reasonable management of timelines and resources, and the achievement of adequate sample sizes. Lesser eGFR decline thresholds should be considered to aid in the design and conduct of more randomized controlled trials in nephrology.

### The estimation, measurement, and relevance of the glomerular filtration rate in stage 5 chronic kidney disease [^115r82EC]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered the best index of overall kidney function. The level of GFR is used in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to classify them into CKD stages. Stage 5 CKD encompasses patients with a GFR below 15 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) and those requiring chronic dialysis. Preservation of GFR, even at its very low level, is of great importance in both dialysis and non-dialysis stage 5 CKD patients. Residual GFR is considered in the prescription of both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and interventions to preserve residual GFR are an active area of clinical research. The application of traditional methods of estimating and measuring GFR can be problematic in this patient population. This review will focus on the methods available to quantify GFR in stage 5 CKD and their use in both clinical and research settings.

In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2, we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

Evaluation of CKD — evaluation of chronicity: Practice Point 1.1.3.1 specifies that "Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by" review of prior GFR measurements, albuminuria or proteinuria with urine microscopy, imaging findings of reduced kidney size and reduced cortical thickness, kidney pathological findings such as fibrosis and atrophy, medical history of conditions contributing to CKD, and "repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point". Practice Point 1.1.3.2 cautions, "Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the finding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD)". Practice Point 1.1.3.3 advises, "Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at first presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators".

Point of care testing

The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline endorses point of care testing (POCT) for creatinine measurements given the convenience associated with this in some settings, and place less value on the diagnostic accuracy. Given the need to improve the rate of detection of CKD in the community, even in Europe where most health systems are relatively robust, POCT may be an important tool to improve the rates of case finding. POCT for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) may be similarly convenient and would permit more complete CKD staging in appropriately selected individuals.

The key practice points from the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline are summarized in Table 1. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of POCT devices for creatinine and uACR is beyond the scope of this article, but as discussed in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, it is important to highlight the potential drawbacks especially in regions where resources may permit more accurate testing. Given the relevant concerns regarding accuracy of the various devices for both creatinine and albuminuria, the potential benefits and harms should be considered and individualized. As with any test it is important that the test is performed when indicated, in patients at risk of CKD. Importantly, a diagnosis of CKD cannot be made on single testing and must be confirmed through nephrology consultation of suspicion of advanced CKD or repeat testing in individuals with higher eGFR and/or lower levels of albuminuria.

Table 1:
KDIGO practice points on POCT for kidney function.

The potential benefits of POCT, as outlined in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, include the convenience for the patient and the rapidity of obtaining the test result, which permit testing in non-clinical environments (nursing homes, remote areas). For individuals, the convenience may outweigh the concerns about accuracy. In children, the tiny volume of blood required may be an additional advantage, especially if used for follow-up testing once a diagnosis is established. The improved accuracy below an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 improved the value of POCT for those who most require a rapid diagnosis.

POCT may, however, be associated with potential harms, including overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis related to the accuracy concerns. These may differ between devices. The tendency of POCT for creatinine to 'overdiagnose' CKD stage may be beneficial from a clinical perspective in terms of fewer missed cases, however overdiagnosis may cause unnecessary anxiety in some patients. It is important that clinical guidelines and/or referral pathways are in place to ensure appropriate follow-up and management.

Evaluation of CKD chronicity and cause — KDIGO 2012 recommendation 1.4.1.1 advises that in people with GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (GFR categories G3a-G5) or markers of kidney damage, review past history and previous measurements to determine duration of kidney disease (Not Graded); if duration is > 3 months, CKD is confirmed, whereas if duration is not > 3 months or unclear, CKD is not confirmed and patients may have CKD or acute kidney diseases (including AKI) or both and tests should be repeated accordingly; additionally, evaluate the clinical context, including personal and family history, social and environmental factors, medications, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and pathologic diagnosis to determine the causes of kidney disease (Not Graded).

### The eGFR-C study: accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation using creatinine and cystatin C and albuminuria for monitoring disease progression in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease – prospective longitudinal study in a multiethnic population [^111Hw8G4]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the general population and is commonly identified using estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or detection of protein in urine (albuminuria/proteinuria). GFR is accepted as the best overall measure of kidney function and is central to diagnosis, staging and management of CKD. Ideally GFR would be measured using reference procedures which follow the clearance of an infused exogenous substance (e.g. inulin, 125 I-iothalamate or iohexol). However, these methods are cumbersome and impractical for general kidney disease detection and management. Estimation of GFR (estimated GFR [eGFR]) using equations based on serum creatinine with adjustments for age, gender and race are widely used as surrogate measures of GFR. In England, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have recommended which people should be tested for the presence of CKD (e.g. those with diabetes or hypertension) and that GFR should be estimated 6-monthly in people with stage 3 CKD (GFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2), comprising approximately 6–7% of the overall UK population. The aim of disease detection is to identify and manage those most likely to progress to kidney failure and/or those at high risk of morbidity and mortality. In addition to the accurate identification of CKD, the ability of tests to identify which individuals with CKD will have high risk (i.e. progressive or mortal) disease is a crucial issue. Many people with stage 3 CKD are not at increased risk of progressive disease and there are concerns that CKD detection using creatinine-based approaches may be identifying individuals who are at low risk and unlikely to benefit from active management and inappropriate surveillance. Recently, newer equations utilising cystatin C instead of, or in addition to, creatinine have been proposed. Given the high costs of cystatin C testing compared with creatinine, it is critical that its diagnostic accuracy and prognostic ability are carefully validated ahead of widespread introduction into the National Health Service.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^113NQZpX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) — progression and outcomes are marked by rapid decline and early transition to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with half the children with GFR < 75 mL/min/1.73 m^2 reaching ESRD in only 5 years and 70% in 10 years; after ESRD, by 1 year after identification > 50% receive a kidney transplant, and in the 0- to 14-year age group the expected remaining lifetime is only about 30 years, with the leading cause of death being cardiovascular disease (CVD). Children and teens with CKD due to chronic glomerular disease face a greater degree of risk factors (proteinuria, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) for any given GFR.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^113U2eFJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical terms used in the consensus recommendation

ASCVD

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined somewhat differently across trials; however, all the CVOTs overall had similar inclusion criteria. These criteria generally included a history of any of the conditions mentioned hereafter: acute coronary syndrome or MI, stable or unstable angina, CAD with or without revascularization, any other arterial revascularization, peripheral artery disease, stroke assumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. The relevant conditions compatible with clinically significant atherosclerosis consisted of transient ischaemic attack, hospitalised for unstable angina, amputation, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class II–III, arterial stenosis of more than 50%, symptomatic/asymptomatic CAD documented by imaging, chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Certain trials had included few patients without clinical ASCVD but required them to have a high burden of risk factors based on age and the presence of two or more cardiac risk factors.

MACE

In this document, three major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are considered as primary endpoints in the CVOTs:
3-point MACE: composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality.
4-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for unstable angina.
5-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for heart failure (HF) or unstable angina.

High risk of CVD

Patients with high risk for CVD included multiple risk factors for CV disease: men 55 years of age or older or women 60 years of age or older in addition to another traditional risk factor like hypertension, dyslipidemia (defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 130 mg/dL [3.36 mmol/L]) or the use of lipid-lowering therapies, and smoking. Furthermore, microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria [urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) higher than 30 mg/g or equivalent]; high renal risk, which included (a) eGFR of 45–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR higher than 200 mg/g or equivalent or (b) eGFR of 15–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 regardless of UACR. Participants with end-stage renal disease (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or requiring maintenance dialysis, history of CAD; stroke or peripheral vascular disease were excluded.

### Estimation of glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine and cystatin C in octogenarians and nonagenarians [^115SjcKh]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Accurate assessment of GFR is essential for the interpretation of clinical and laboratory abnormalities that may indicate CKD, for drug dosing, for diagnosis, management of CKD as well as establishing prognosis. The definition of CKD in the elderly has been a matter of debate. It has been questioned the appropriateness of the arbitrary cutoff value of eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the definition of CKD, without some adjustment for the normal gender-specific decline in eGFR with aging. Although a reduction in GFR to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 has been associated with worse outcomes, a lower cutoff of 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 has been proposed for the elderly.

In the present study conducted in a sample of community-dwelling octogenarians and nonagenarians, we found a mean mGFR of 55 ml/min/1.73 m 2, 59% of whom with values < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. The percentage of patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 varied widely from 53% to 86% depending on the estimating equation used, suggesting caution in the interpretation of the estimates.

### Practical approach to detection and management of chronic kidney disease for the primary care clinician [^116TpWH4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications, such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular disease, anemia, and metabolic acidosis, as well as mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis. To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins should be avoided, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent disease progression, minimize complications, and promote quality of life.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) evaluation — serum creatinine–based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in adults recommends using serum creatinine and a GFR estimating equation for initial assessment, and recommends that clinicians use a GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum creatinine (eGFRcreat) rather than relying on the serum creatinine concentration alone; laboratories should measure serum creatinine using a specific assay traceable to international standard reference materials, report eGFRcreat in addition to the serum creatinine concentration in adults, and report eGFRcreat in adults using the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation; when reporting eGFRcreat, it should be reported and rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area of 1.73 m2 in adults using the units ml/min/1.73 m2, and eGFRcreat levels less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 should be reported as "decreased"; additional tests (such as cystatin C or a clearance measurement) are suggested for confirmatory testing in specific circumstances when eGFR based on serum creatinine is less accurate.
