## Question

Patient presents with Neuralgia s/p trauma. Is Gabapentin 100mg BID appropriate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gabapentin 100 mg twice daily is an appropriate dose for post-traumatic neuralgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether gabapentin is indicated. Then, I should verify what dose ranges are supported by evidence and labeling. Next, I will check whether 100 mg BID sits within therapeutic windows and consider pharmacokinetics. After that, I need to review safety and tolerability, especially in special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and confirm any exceptions like trigeminal neuralgia or renal impairment.

> Let me first confirm the indication and context. Post-traumatic neuralgia is a neuropathic pain syndrome after nerve injury, and gabapentin is a first-line agent for many peripheral neuropathic pain conditions, though much of the highest-quality evidence base is in postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy rather than specifically in post-traumatic neuralgia, so I should be cautious about overgeneralizing while acknowledging reasonable extrapolation in practice [^2fc88a18] [^1495ac51] [^5adebd16].

> Wait, let me verify the dose question precisely. Gabapentin 100 mg twice daily equals 200 mg/day, which is far below the therapeutic ranges used in randomized trials and FDA-labeled regimens for neuropathic pain, where effective dosing typically starts around 900–1,800 mg/day and can extend to 3,600 mg/day in divided doses, with titration over days to weeks to improve tolerability [^2fc88a18] [^0faf5e27] [^3adc2ac6] [^89536793].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether any guideline or label supports 100 mg BID as a maintenance dose. I do not see evidence supporting 200 mg/day as a therapeutic maintenance dose for neuropathic pain; instead, authoritative sources recommend starting low and titrating to 300 mg three times daily by day 3, then increasing to 600 mg three times daily as needed, with many patients requiring 1,800–3,600 mg/day for meaningful benefit, and with efficacy diminishing at subtherapeutic doses [^3adc2ac6] [^0faf5e27] [^2fc88a18].

> I need to check pharmacokinetics to ensure I'm not missing a rationale for very low dosing. Gabapentin has nonlinear absorption and short half-life, which is why divided dosing and upward titration are standard; very low doses yield low bioavailability and are unlikely to reach exposure associated with analgesia, reinforcing that 100 mg BID is inadequate for maintenance therapy in most adults with neuropathic pain [^396e3522] [^0faf5e27].

> But wait, what if the clinician intends a microtitration start with plans to escalate? That would make sense. A 100–300 mg bedtime or divided dose is a reasonable starting point to mitigate sedation, with planned increases every 1–7 days toward 900–1,800 mg/day, and many patients ultimately requiring higher doses; this slow-titration approach is especially important in older adults or those with renal impairment [^34a9e76a] [^396e3522] [^0faf5e27].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability because underdosing often reflects concern about adverse effects. Common adverse effects include dizziness and somnolence, which are dose-related and often transient; in older adults, slower titration and renal dose adjustments mitigate risks like oversedation and falls, and guidelines advise caution with concomitant CNS depressants and in renal disease, which supports a go-slow but go-high-enough strategy rather than stopping at 100 mg BID [^59bcb4c7] [^396e3522] [^ae78ab35].

> Let me consider special exceptions. For trigeminal neuralgia, some guidance allows gabapentin as an alternative when first-line agents are not tolerated, but again, effective dosing is generally in the hundreds to thousands of milligrams per day, so 100 mg BID would still be subtherapeutic unless it is a transient starting dose with escalation planned [^9af140b0] [^07983a46]. For renal impairment, dose reductions are necessary, but even then, maintenance doses are typically higher than 200 mg/day when adjusted to creatinine clearance, underscoring that 100 mg BID is not a target maintenance dose in CKD either [^1b019208].

> Next, I should review the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. Gabapentin 100 mg twice daily is not an appropriate maintenance dose for post-traumatic neuralgia; it is far below evidence-based therapeutic ranges and is unlikely to provide meaningful analgesia. A more appropriate approach is to start low, for example 100–300 mg at bedtime or 300 mg on day 1, and titrate every 3–7 days toward 900–1,800 mg/day, and up to 3,600 mg/day if needed and tolerated, with earlier and larger dose adjustments in patients with normal renal function and slower titration in older adults or those with renal disease [^3adc2ac6] [^0faf5e27] [^2fc88a18] [^396e3522].

> Finally, I should confirm a practical plan and safety checks. Reassess pain, function, and adverse effects within 1–2 weeks and again by 4–6 weeks; if there is inadequate response after 2–4 weeks at a therapeutic dose, consider switching class or adding a second agent such as an SNRI or TCA rather than persisting with subtherapeutic gabapentin dosing; monitor for sedation, gait instability, and edema, and adjust for renal function at each step [^d4817226] [^1495ac51] [^1b019208].

---

Gabapentin 100 mg BID is **not an appropriate dose** for post-traumatic neuralgia. Evidence-based dosing for neuropathic pain starts at **300 mg TID** [^3adc2ac6] and is titrated to 1,800–3,600 mg/day as tolerated [^2fc88a18]; 100 mg BID is subtherapeutic and unlikely to provide meaningful benefit [^59bcb4c7]. Use a slow titration to improve tolerability, and adjust for renal function [^396e3522]. If gabapentin is not effective or tolerated, consider pregabalin [^18f1e21e], duloxetine [^c33c3d7b], or TCAs [^eb0a1f12] as alternatives [^d4817226].

---

## Evidence-based dosing for gabapentin in neuropathic pain

- **Standard dosing**: 300 mg TID (900 mg/day) [^3adc2ac6], titrated to 1,800–3,600 mg/day as tolerated [^2fc88a18].
- **Titration**: Increase by 300 mg every 2–3 days to minimize adverse effects [^0faf5e27].
- **Renal adjustment**: Required for creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min [^1b019208].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting higher doses

- **Efficacy**: Higher doses (1,800–3,600 mg/day) significantly reduce neuropathic pain [^2fc88a18] and improve sleep and quality of life [^59bcb4c7].
- **NNT**: ~6 for ≥ 50% pain relief at 1,800–3,600 mg/day [^notfound].
- **Safety**: Dose-related dizziness and somnolence are common but usually manageable [^59bcb4c7].

---

## Why 100 mg BID is inappropriate

- **Subtherapeutic**: 100 mg BID (200 mg/day) is far below the effective range [^2fc88a18].
- **Under-treatment**: Risks persistent pain, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life.
- **Guideline conflict**: Contradicts evidence-based dosing and current guidelines [^1495ac51].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

If gabapentin is ineffective or not tolerated, consider:

| **Medication** | **Typical dose** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Pregabalin | 150–600 mg/day | High [^18f1e21e] |
| Duloxetine | 30–60 mg/day | High [^c33c3d7b] |
| TCAs (nortriptyline, amitriptyline) | 25–150 mg/day | High [^d4817226] |

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Initiate**: 300 mg TID, titrate to 1,800–3,600 mg/day as tolerated [^3adc2ac6] [^2fc88a18].
- **Renal function**: Adjust dose if creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min [^1b019208].
- **Monitor**: Track pain, function, and adverse effects; adjust dose or switch if needed [^d4817226].

---

Gabapentin 100 mg BID is **inadequate** for post-traumatic neuralgia; use 300 mg TID and titrate to 1,800–3,600 mg/day, with renal adjustment and close monitoring.

Key points

Question Is pregabalin efficacious and tolerable for the treatment of chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain?

Findings In a double-blind, randomized international study of 542 evaluable patients (pregabalin n = 274) of whom approximately half had post-surgical neuropathic pain, the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo in change from baseline to week 15 (p = 0.1823). However, comparisons for key secondary outcome measures yielded p values < 0.05 favoring pregabalin. Safety and tolerability were consistent with the known profile of pregabalin.

Meaning Additional studies are needed to characterize the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin for chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain.

Introduction

Diverse types of nerve injury are recognized as triggers of chronic post-traumatic neuropathic pain (PTNP), including post-surgical syndromes. Tissue injury may chronically alter peripheral nociceptive processing, shifting pain from acute to chronic. The need for symptomatic treatment of PTNP is increasing but remains inadequately addressed.

Pregabalin, an alpha 2 -delta (α 2 δ) ligand (gabapentinoid), is approved in the United States for the treatment of three neuropathic pain (NeP) conditions: diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), and post-spinal cord injury (SCI). An 8-week randomized clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of pregabalin for the management of chronic post-traumatic/post-surgical pain.

A study of longer duration was designed to meet the US regulatory standard for a chronic pain indication: 12 weeks of maintenance or fixed dosing. Methodologic features were incorporated to increase assay sensitivity for the detection of an analgesic signal in this heterogeneous patient population. The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of pregabalin (flexibly dosed, 150–600 mg/day) versus placebo in the treatment of PTNP. Secondary objectives compared the efficacy of pregabalin vs placebo with respect to overall status, pain-related activity limitation, and sleep, in addition to safety and tolerability assessments.

### Gabapentin for pain: balancing benefit and harm… [^16f11d75]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is gabapentin effective for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Evidence-Based Answer At high dosages, gabapentin is moderately effective for neuropathic pain, although adverse effects are experienced as often as benefit. Practice Pointers Gabapentin is widely used for the treatment of pain, particularly in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Wiffen and colleagues performed a systematic review of randomized trials assessing the use of gabapentin in acute, chronic, or cancer pain, and found 15 studies with a total of 1, 468 patients. Only one study involved patients with acute pain. The remainder enrolled patients with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, or cancer-related pain, phantom limb pain, Guillain-Barré syndrome, spinal cord injury, and various neuropathic pains. Gabapentin was found ineffective for acute pain.

The studies of neuropathic pain used a wide variety of dosages, typically 900 to 2, 400 mg per day, and in one case up to 3, 600 mg per day. Data could be combined for six studies of neuropathic pain. In these trials, 42 percent of patients improved with gabapentin versus 19 percent with placebo, giving a combined number needed to treat of 4. However, adverse effects were common at the high dosages used in these studies, with 24 percent of patients experiencing dizziness, 20 percent somnolence, 10 percent headache, 10 percent diarrhea, and 7 percent confusion. The overall number needed to harm for adverse effects was also 4. Thus, for every patient who experiences a reduction in pain, another experiences an adverse effect.

The modest benefit of gabapentin for neuropathic pain must be balanced against its adverse effects. Whether this trade-off is worthwhile should be decided by the individual patient. The authors of this review report that based on preliminary data tricyclic antidepressants and carbamazepine are at least as effective as gabapentin and are less expensive.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^35737170]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The growing need for symptomatic treatment of post-traumatic neuropathic pain (PTNP) continues to be unmet. Studies evaluating the efficacy of pregabalin for reducing neuropathic pain following trauma and surgery yielded positive results over ≤ 8-week treatment. To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin over 3 months in patients with PTNP, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial evaluated patients with PTNP at 101 centers in 11 countries — the longest, largest such trial. Adults diagnosed with PTNP were randomly assigned (1:1) to 15 weeks of pregabalin (flexibly dosed 150–600 mg/day) or matching placebo. Primary efficacy analysis was by mixed-model repeated measures comparing change from baseline to week 15 in weekly mean pain scores between active and placebo groups. Evaluable patients included 274 in the pregabalin group and 265 in the placebo group. Trauma was surgical in 49.6% of patients, non-surgical in the remainder. The primary efficacy analysis showed no statistically significant difference between pregabalin and placebo groups in the change from baseline to week 15 [mean difference, − 0.22 points (95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.10); p = 0.1823]. However, comparisons for key secondary outcome measures yielded p values < 0.05 favoring pregabalin. Consistent with the known safety profile of pregabalin, the most common adverse events were dizziness and somnolence (14.6 and 9.9% of patients, respectively) with pregabalin (vs 4.2 and 3.4% with placebo). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a large, phase 3 registration trial in the heterogeneous PTNP study population.

### Gabapentin in traumatic nerve injury pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, multi-center study [^4c14f954]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over multi-center study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by traumatic or postsurgical peripheral nerve injury, using doses up to 2400 mg/day. The study comprised a run-in period of two weeks, two treatment periods of five weeks separated by a three weeks' washout period. The primary efficacy variable was the change in the mean pain intensity score from baseline to the last week of treatment. Other variables included pain relief, health related quality of life (SF-36), interference of sleep by pain, Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change, and adverse effects. Nine centers randomized a total of 120 patients, 22 of whom withdrew. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatments for the primary outcome efficacy variable. However, gabapentin provided significantly better pain relief (p = 0.015) compared with placebo. More patients had at least a 30% pain reduction with gabapentin compared with placebo (p = 0.040) and pain interfered significantly less with sleep during gabapentin treatment compared with placebo (p = 0.0016). Both the Patient (p = 0.023) and Clinician (p = 0.037) Global Impression of Change indicated a better response with gabapentin compared with placebo. Gabapentin was well tolerated. The most common adverse effects were dizziness and tiredness.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^ae78ab35]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Adjuvant analgesics — gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may lessen neuropathic pain but require caution. They "reduce neuropathic pain by inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels", and "gabapentinoid use decreases opioid requirements in select populations (e.g., in patients with spinal cord injury or burn)", yet "limited evidence exists to support a broad analgesic effect". Safety concerns include that "abuse and misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was reported", the directive to "Use gabapentinoids with caution in patients with or at risk of developing an SUD", and that they "produce additive CNS depression and increase risk of death when used in combination with opioids". Because "both pregabalin and gabapentin are renally eliminated", the page advises to "use lower doses or avoid them in patients with underlying renal disease and in elderly patients".

Table 1
Baseline characteristics (randomized population)

NRS numeric rating scale, SD standard deviation

Prior exposure to gabapentinoids (40 patients in total) was higher in the placebo group (9.4%) than in the pregabalin group (5.5%). Concomitant pain drug treatments (continuing stable treatment at randomization) were taken by 120 (43.8%) patients in the pregabalin group and 130 (49.1%) patients in the placebo group. The most common concomitant pain drugs were ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and tramadol. The proportions of patients taking antidepressants for any reason were similar between the treatment groups, comprising less than one-tenth of patients in either group, with a smaller subset of patients taking tricyclic antidepressants or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Rescue drug treatments were taken by 16 patients in the pregabalin group and by 37 patients in the placebo group.

At the end of the dose optimization period, the mean maintenance dose for evaluable pregabalin-treated patients (n = 256) was 473.7 mg/day. The maintenance dose of pregabalin was 600 mg/day for 150 (58.6%) patients, 450 mg/day for 54 (21.1%) patients, 300 mg/day for 28 (10.9%) patients, and 150 mg/day for 24 (9.4%) patients.

### Geriatric trauma management [^396e3522]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Medication management — gabapentinoids for neuropathic pain in older adults — Gabapentin and pregabalin are effective treatments for neuropathic pain, but sedation and dizziness may limit their usefulness in the frail older adult. Because of delayed onset, gradual titration over weeks is recommended to improve tolerability and avoid the risk of oversedation and overdose. Because elimination is entirely through the renal system, dosing will require adjustment in patients with renal impairment.

Discussion

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of patients with PTNP did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect with pregabalin on mean pain intensity scores at the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of the study, week 15. However, the primary efficacy parameter (change in mean pain intensity scores) was statistically significant at most other time points, and several secondary outcomes related to analgesic efficacy and quality of life improved with pregabalin compared with placebo treatment. Pregabalin was superior to placebo in reducing pain severity and interference with daily function as measured by the BPI-sf. A significantly greater number of patients in the pregabalin group described their overall status as very much improved or much improved when comparing their assessment on the PGIC during the last week of treatment (i.e. week 15) to that at study outset. Finally, there was a consistent and significant reduction in pain interference with sleep over the course of the study.

### Gabapentin dosing for neuropathic pain: evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^0faf5e27]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, and neuropathic pain is among the most common types of pain. Despite its prevalence, neuropathic pain is often underrecognized and inadequately treated. Many cases are refractory to the medications traditionally used for pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tricyclic antidepressants are considered first-line agents for neuropathic pain, but their use is limited by unwanted side effects and a risk of cardiovascular mortality.

Objectives

The goals of this article were to review data on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults and to determine the optimal dosing schedule.

Methods

Randomized controlled studies of gabapentin for neuropathic pain were identified through a search of PubMed and MEDLINE from 1966 to the present using the search terms gabapentin, randomized, placebo, and pain. Abstracts of identified articles were screened for study size (> 100 patients per treatment arm) and use of appropriate efficacy measures. A separate review based on information provided by the manufacturer of gabapentinaand clinical trial Web sites was conducted to ascertain whether there had been any other relevant industry- or government-sponsored trials. The manufacturer provided additional unpublshed study data.

Results

Data from 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials were included in the review, 1 of which has not yet been published. Gabapentin was effective in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and other neuropathic pain syndromes. It relieved symptoms of allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, and hyperesthesia. Adverse effects were typically mild to moderate and usually subsided within approximately 10 days from the initiation of treatment. Based on available data, it appears that treatment should be started at a dose of 900 mg/d (300 mg/d on day 1, 600 mg/d on day 2, and 900 mg/d on day 3). Additional titration to 1800 mg/d is recommended for greater efficacy. Doses up to 3600 mg/d may be needed in some patients. The effective dose should be individualized according to patient response and tolerability.

Conclusion

At doses of 1800 to 3600 mg/d, gabapentin was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of adults with neuropathic pain.

### Are gabapentinoids effective at reducing pain and improving sleep after nerve injury? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^8cd35df4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gabapentinoids are increasingly prescribed off-label to reduce the intensity of peripheral nerve injury-related pain and improve sleep. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gabapentinoids to placebo show differing results, and the crossover design used in some of these trials carries a significant risk of unblinding. Considering that side effects of gabapentinoids are common and misuse is increasing, we pooled the blinded data to provide the best available evidence on the efficacy of gabapentinoids compared with placebo.

Questions/Purposes

In this meta-analysis of RCTs of patients with peripheral nerve injuries, we asked: Are gabapentinoids superior to placebo in terms of (1) pain reduction or (2) mitigating sleep disruption?

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for RCTs from January 2000 up to January 2022. Only studies reporting on nerve injuries, measuring pain intensity with a VAS or numeric rating scale, were included. Our search yielded 1862 articles: 1218 from Embase, 559 from PubMed, and 85 from the Cochrane Library. We excluded 338 duplicate studies, leaving 1524 remaining studies. After an initial title and abstract screen, we excluded an additional 1512 studies. In all, 12 full texts were analyzed, and 4 studies were included in our meta-analysis, which involved 919 total patients: 402 were treated with either gabapentin or pregabalin, 394 with placebo, and 123 with both in two crossover trials. In the 3 of 4 studies wherein gender distribution of the patient populations was specified, women represented 57% (143 of 250) and 47% (118 of 250) of the patients in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. The mean ± SD age was 52 ± 13 years for both the treatment and placebo groups. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and was low for all included studies. We addressed the high risk of unblinding in the crossover trials by excluding the after crossover (unblinded) results. Certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was moderate. All included studies lacked an objective consensus reference test to diagnose peripheral nerve injury, therefore leading to indirectness of available results.

Results

Gabapentinoids did not reduce pain compared with placebo at 1 month (-0.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to 0.29]; p = 0.40) nor at 2 to 4 months (-0.38 [95% CI -0.76 to 0.00]; p = 0.05) after treatment. Additionally, gabapentinoids showed no clinically important difference in sleep interference compared with placebo at 2 to 4 months (-0.56 [95% CI -0.91 to -0.22]; p < 0.01), with a minimum clinically important difference of -1.5.

Conclusion

The best available evidence, now consisting of four RCTs, suggests that gabapentinoids should not be used to reduce pain intensity or sleep disruption in patients with peripheral nerve injuries, especially given their substantial side effects and potential for misuse.

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain [^2fc88a18]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is gabapentin associated with pain relief in people with chronic neuropathic pain?

Bottom Line

Oral gabapentin (1200–3600 mg/d for 4–12 weeks) for patients with moderate or severe neuropathic pain from postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) or painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is associated with pain reduction of at least 50% in 14% to 17% more patients than placebo.

14.1 Postherpetic Neuralgia

Gabapentin was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of a total of 563 patients with pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).

Each study included a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. Patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.

The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show pain intensity scores over time for Studies 1 and 2.

The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared to baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3).

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^ea40951c]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The 30 and 50% responder status was defined for each patient based on the percentage change in the MPS from baseline to each week, 1–15. Overall, there were more pregabalin 30% and 50% pain responders when compared with the placebo group. The incidence of responders generally increased over the first 3 weeks of treatment for both 30 and 50% responders. Responder data for weeks 1–3, 14, and 15 are summarized for brevity (responder percentage [week, number responders/number observed at week, p value pregabalin vs placebo]). Pregabalin 30% responders were 11.9% (week 1, 31/260; p = 0.0028), 27.2% (week 2, 69/254; p = 0.0360), 38.9% (week 3, 98/252; p = 0.0235), 57.4% (week 14, 128/223; p = 0.4245), and 57.7% (week 15, 113/196; p = 0.8464). Placebo 30% responders were 5.0% (week 1, 13/258), 20.1% (week 2, 49/244), 30.2% (week 3, 74/245), 54.3% (week 14, 113/208), and 58.3% (week 15, 109/187). Pregabalin 50% responders were 4.6% (week 1, 12/260; p = 0.1633), 11.4% (week 2, 29/254; p = 0.0652), 22.6% (week 3, 57/252; p = 0.0039), 37.7% (week 14, 84/223; p = 0.0314), and 39.8% (week 15, 78/196; p = 0.1889). Placebo 50% responders were 2.3% (week 1, 6/258), 7.0% (week 2, 17/244), 13.5% (week 3, 33/245), 29.8% (week 14, 62/208), and 34.2% (week 15, 64/187). Differences were statistically significant for pregabalin compared with placebo (p < 0.05, generalized linear model) for 30% responders at weeks 1–3, and for 50% responders at weeks 3–5, 7, 9, and 11–14. In the BPI-sf mean pain severity index, a statistically significant change from baseline to week 15 favored pregabalin over placebo (p = 0.0050; ANCOVA). The LS mean (standard error) change was − 2.40 (0.13) in the pregabalin group and − 1.95 (0.13) in the placebo group. In the mean pain interference index, a statistically significant change from baseline also favored pregabalin over placebo (p = 0.0168) (Table 2).

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^8402156f]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In future studies designed for a post-traumatic neuropathic pain study population, a few considerations are worth noting. For example, a retrospective analysis demonstrated the effect size was larger in the post-surgical vs non-surgical subgroup (− 0.43 vs 0.05, respectively), and nominal unadjusted P value was 0.04 compared with placebo (data on file). However, this is caveated in that the surgical and non-surgical subgroup analyses were not preplanned prior to unblinding, were conducted post hoc and not adjusted for multiple comparisons. It may be, for example, that post-surgical traumatic pain contrasted with non-surgical pain is diagnosed with greater definitiveness and/or that such subjects can rate their pain and change in pain better than non-surgical subjects. Thus, it would be premature to suggest meaningful significance to this finding; however, this finding could be considered or explored in future research. Fixed-dose studies in contrast to flexible dosing in registration studies might help to address any potential concerns for the adequacy of dose studied. When feasible, using countries with a well-established research infrastructure for neuropathic pain research may be advisable. Performing the final assessment 1 week prior to the end of the study while not making this explicitly apparent to the subjects may potentially avoid the presumed anticipatory narrowing of the treatment difference observed at the end of the current study.

### Gabapentin for acute and chronic pain [^28b33521]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Anticonvulsant drugs have been used in the management of pain since the 1960s. The clinical impression is that they are useful for chronic neuropathic pain, especially when the pain is lancinating or burning.

Objectives

To evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and adverse effects of gabapentin for pain management in clinical practice.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of gabapentin in acute, chronic or cancer pain were identified by MEDLINE (1966-Nov 2004), EMBASE (1994-Nov 2004), SIGLE (1980-Jan 2004) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators. Date of most recent search: January 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of gabapentin in patients, with subjective pain assessment as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, and trials were quality scored. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse effects and drug-related study withdrawal.

Main Results

Fourteen reports describing 15 studies of gabapentin were considered eligible (1468 participants). One was a study of acute pain. The remainder included the following conditions: post-herpetic neuralgia (two studies), diabetic neuropathy (seven studies), a cancer related neuropathic pain (one study) phantom limb pain (one study), Guillain Barré syndrome (one study), spinal chord injury pain (one study) and various neuropathic pains (one study). The study in acute post-operative pain (70 participants) showed no benefit for gabapentin compared to placebo for pain at rest. In chronic pain, the NNT for improvement in all trials with evaluable data is 4.3 (95%CI 3.5–5.7). Forty two percent of participants improved on gabapentin compared to 19% on placebo. The number needed to harm(NNH) for adverse events leading to withdrawal from a trial was not significant. Fourteen percent of participants withdrew from active arms compared to 10% in placebo arms. The NNH for minor harm was 3.7 (95% CI 2.4 to 5.4). The NNT for effective pain relief in diabetic neuropathy was 2.9 (95% CI 2.2 to 4.3) and for post herpetic neuralgia 3.9 (95% CI 3 to 5.7).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence to show that gabapentin is effective in neuropathic pain. There is limited evidence to show that gabapentin is ineffective in acute pain.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^d6bdbd28]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study patients

Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years and had PTNP for ≥ 6 months after a surgical or non-surgical traumatic event (e.g. history of a motor vehicle accident, fall, sports injury, knee or hip replacement, hernia repair, thoracotomy, mastectomy, focal/localized burns, or crush injury), a mean score of ≥ 4 in pain recall for the past week at screening, and a mean score of ≥ 4 and ≤ 9 on a 0–10 numeric rating scale (NRS) of average pain (0, "no pain" to 10, "worst possible pain") based on ≥ 4 daily diary scores from the last week of a single-blind baseline screening period (5–14 days before randomization). Peripheral nerve(s) implicated in the pain was identified to confirm nerve trauma, and pain was categorized as neuropathic based on prespecified criteria (i.e. neurologic exam, study-specific PTNP assessment including use of the PainDETECT questionnaire to identify neuropathic components of back pain) and diagnostic tests (e.g. electromyography, nerve conduction tests, skin or nerve biopsy) if available. While PainDETECT was a screening assessment and used as part of the initial diagnostic assessment, since it is not specifically validated for this indication, this instrument itself did not determine eligibility in the study.

### Efficient assessment of efficacy in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain patients: pregabalin in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study [^c8e13ffb]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Detecting the efficacy of novel analgesic agents in neuropathic pain is challenging. There is a critical need for study designs with the desirable characteristics of assay sensitivity, low placebo response, reliable pain recordings, low cost, short duration of exposure to test drug and placebo, and relevant and recruitable population.

Methods

We designed a proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study in patients with post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (PTNP) to evaluate whether such a study design had the potential to detect efficacious agents. Pregabalin, known to be efficacious in neuropathic pain, was used as the active analgesic. We also assessed physical activity throughout the study.

Results

Twenty-five adults (20–70 years of age) with PTNP for ≥ 3 months entered a screening week and were then randomized to one of the two following treatment sequences: (1) pregabalin followed by placebo or (2) placebo followed by pregabalin. These 2-week treatment periods were separated by a 2-week washout period. Patients on pregabalin treatment received escalating doses to a final dosage of 300 mg/day (days 5–15). In an attempt to minimize placebo response, patients received placebo treatment during the screening week and the 2-week washout period. Average daily pain scores (primary endpoint) were significantly reduced for pregabalin versus placebo, with a mean treatment difference of -0.81 (95% confidence interval: -1.45 to -0.17; P = 0.015).

Conclusion

The efficacy of pregabalin was similar to that identified in a large, parallel group trial in PTNP. Therefore, this efficient crossover study design has potential utility for future proof-of-concept studies in neuropathic pain.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^afe01045]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — first-line pharmacotherapy and evidence gaps: The two drugs to consider as first-line therapy in TN are carbamazepine (CBZ) (200–1,200 mg/day) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) (600–1,800 mg/day). Although the evidence for CBZ is stronger than for OXC, the latter may pose fewer safety concerns. There is little evidence to guide the clinician after the treatment of patients with TN who fail first-line therapy, the effect of other drugs commonly used in neuropathic pain is unknown, and there are no published studies directly comparing polytherapy with monotherapy.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^b1f9c6cd]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pregabalin is an effective treatment option for many patients with neuropathic pain. Higher doses of pregabalin have been shown to be more effective in improving pain outcomes but, in practice, failing to appropriately increase the dose can leave patients under-treated.

Methods

This was a pooled analysis of 6 flexible-dose clinical trials of pregabalin in patients with neuropathic pain (diabetic peripheral neuropathy, peripheral herpetic neuralgia, posttraumatic pain, or postsurgical pain). Patients were divided into "dose pathway" groups based on their weekly pregabalin dose from the start of their trial to the first week of their maintenance phase. These were: 150 mg/day only; 150 to 300 mg/day; 150 to 300 to 450 mg/day; 150 to 300 to 450 to 600 mg/day; 150 to 300 to 600 mg/day; 300 to 600 mg/day. Pain outcomes assessed for each group at each new dose were proportion of 30% and 50% responders (≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction in mean pain score from baseline) and mean change in pain score. Percent change in mean pain score from baseline was assessed using a marginal structural model.

Results

Seven hundred and sixty-one patients treated with flexible-dose pregabalin were included in the analysis. For each dose pathway group, there was a notably greater proportion of 30% and 50% responders and change in pain score, at each escalating dose. As assessed by the marginal structural model, higher doses of pregabalin were estimated to result in a significantly greater change in mean pain score at each week. This dose response with flexible-dose pregabalin was consistent with that previously observed with fixed-dose pregabalin.

Conclusion

Many patients who do not respond to lower doses of pregabalin will respond with notable improvements in pain outcomes when the dose is escalated. These data should encourage physicians treating patients with neuropathic pain to escalate pregabalin to the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects.

### Gabapentin (gaba 300-EZS) [^e1f13c11]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

14.1 Postherpetic Neuralgia

Gabapentin was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of a total of 563 patients with pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).

Each study included a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1,200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. Patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.

The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show pain intensity scores over time for Studies 1 and 2.

The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared to baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3).

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^59bcb4c7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is commonly used to treat neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This review updates a review published in 2014, and previous reviews published in 2011, 2005 and 2000.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2014 to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing gabapentin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). We performed a pooled analysis for any substantial or moderate benefit. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four new studies (530 participants), and excluded three previously included studies (126 participants). In all, 37 studies provided information on 5914 participants. Most studies used oral gabapentin or gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 mg or more daily in different neuropathic pain conditions, predominantly postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. Study duration was typically four to 12 weeks. Not all studies reported important outcomes of interest. High risk of bias occurred mainly due to small size (especially in cross-over studies), and handling of data after study withdrawal. In postherpetic neuralgia, more participants (32%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (17%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1); NNT 6.7 (5.4 to 8.7); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (46%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (25%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0); NNT 4.8 (4.1 to 6.0); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). In painful diabetic neuropathy, more participants (38%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (21%) (RR 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.3); NNT 5.9 (4.6 to 8.3); 6 studies, 1277 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (52%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (37%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6); NNT 6.6 (4.9 to 9.9); 7 studies, 1439 participants, moderate-quality evidence). For all conditions combined, adverse event withdrawals were more common with gabapentin (11%) than with placebo (8.2%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7); NNH 30 (20 to 65); 22 studies, 4346 participants, high-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were no more common with gabapentin (3.2%) than with placebo (2.8%) (RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 19 studies, 3948 participants, moderate-quality evidence); there were eight deaths (very low-quality evidence). Participants experiencing at least one adverse event were more common with gabapentin (63%) than with placebo (49%) (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4); NNH 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6); 18 studies, 4279 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Participants taking gabapentin experienced dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (14%).

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily (1200 mg to 3600 mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and work. Around 3 or 4 out of 10 participants achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin, compared with 1 or 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief but may experience adverse events. Conclusions have not changed since the previous update of this review.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^23984444]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain (NeP) is triggered by a lesion or a disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system that alters its structure and function, so that pain occurs spontaneously and responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli are pathologically amplified. Peripheral causes of NeP are for example, polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, postoperative pain, and posttraumatic neuralgia, while causes of central NeP are spinal cord injuries, stroke, and so on. The current Danish treatment algorithms–are founded on the evidence-based recommendations provided by the international pain societies. The European guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of NeP issued by the European Federation of Neurological Societies recommend tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), gabapentin, and pregabalin as first-line treatment for the most common NeP conditions, including diabetic neuropathy where serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are also recommended. Finnerup et al, recently revised the worldwide applied NeP pharmacotherapy recommendations from the Special Interest Group on neuropathic pain concluding that there was a strong Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendation for use and proposal as first-line treatment for TCA, SNRI, pregabalin, and gabapentin.

Combination therapy, that is, the combination of different pharmacological treatments, has not been a part of guidelines until recently. The combination of pregabalin or gabapentin with either TCAs or SNRIs is now mentioned as a treatment option if a patient cannot tolerate high-dose monotherapy. The idea of combination therapy using two drugs with different mechanisms of action is of great interest, as it is widely acknowledged that many patients have insufficient pain relief on monotherapy with the currently used drugs. Furthermore, the drugs used for treatment of NeP have severe dose-dependent side effects and tolerability issues, that often lead to discontinuation of high-dose monotherapies. Other fields of medicine apply combination therapy so as to avoid high-dose monotherapy such as for example, treatment of hypertension or diabetes. In a similar fashion, pain medicine could benefit from using lower dose combination therapies with different mechanisms of action. An example could be a moderate dose of a drug reducing calcium influx (pregabalin or gabapentin) combined with a moderate dose of a drug inhibiting the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake (duloxetine).

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^47908c6c]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Demographic and baseline characteristics

This study was conducted between 31 October 2012 and 4 August 2015. Of 1164 patients screened for inclusion, 622 did not meet the inclusion criteria, most often because of failure to meet eligibility criteria (n = 584; 93.9%), specifically, the NeP criteria (n = 190). A total of 542 patients were randomized, 3 of whom were not treated (pregabalin, n = 274; placebo, n = 265) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Trial profile. Subjects may have met more than one criterion for exclusion. Of 584 not meeting eligibility criteria, 190 did not meet requirements for neuropathic pain assessment; 71 did not meet the required duration of PTNP; 69 did not meet pain diary criteria prior to randomization; 65 were unwilling/unable to comply with study procedures; 44 had exclusionary pain conditions; 43 did not have the implicated peripheral nerve identified; 34 had other exclusionary NeP conditions; 34 had creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min; and 22 were taking prohibited medications

Approximately half the patients were male; mean age was 53 years (range, 20–85 years). Most patients were white (79.7%). Approximately half the patients had pain from surgery, and the remainder had pain from other traumatic injuries. All randomized patients had a primary diagnosis of peripheral nerve injury, with the nerves most commonly affected (i.e. amounting to > 5% of cases) as follows: peroneal (10.1%), ulnar (6.6%), sural (6.1%), median (6.0%), sciatic (5.9%), radial (5.6%), lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (5.3%), and other (6.3%). Demographic characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Mean duration between symptom onset and enrollment in the trial was 8.0 years in both treatment groups. The MPS from the baseline week of the daily NRS diary was 6.41 in the pregabalin group and 6.54 in the placebo group (Table 1).

In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin tablets may be initiated on Day 1 as a single 300 mg dose, on Day 2 as 600 mg/day (300 mg two times a day), and on Day 3 as 900 mg/day (300 mg three times a day). The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a dose of 1800 mg/day (600 mg three times a day). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range; however, in these clinical studies, the additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated.

2.2 Dosage for Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures

Patients 12 Years of Age and Above

The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The recommended maintenance dose of gabapentin tablets is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been administered in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration. Administer gabapentin tablets three times a day using 600 mg or 800 mg tablets. The maximum time between doses should not exceed 12 hours.

Pediatric Patients Age 3 to 11 Years

The starting dose range is 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses, and the recommended maintenance dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The recommended maintenance dose of gabapentin tablets in patients 3 to 4 years of age is 40 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended maintenance dose of gabapentin tablets in patients 5 to 11 years of age is 25 mg/kg/day to 35 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. Dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day have been administered in a long-term clinical study. The maximum time interval between doses should not exceed 12 hours.

14.1 Postherpetic Neuralgia

NEURONTIN was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of a total of 563 patients with pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).

Each study included a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. Patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.

The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show pain intensity scores over time for Studies 1 and 2.

The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared to baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3).

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

CTN pharmacotherapy — carbamazepine (CBZ) demonstrates robust efficacy with defined tolerability, and oxcarbazepine (OXC) yields comparable pain reduction. Four placebo-controlled studies totaling 147 patients showed CBZ efficacy, with CBZ doses 300 to 2,400 mg a day and responses of 58 to 100% versus 0 to 40% on placebo; the number needed to treat to attain important pain relief was less than 2, while numbers needed to harm were 3 for minor and 24 for severe adverse events. Two Class II masked RCTs including 130 patients compared OXC 600–1,800 mg a day to CBZ, and reduction in pain was equally good for CBZ and OXC with 88% achieving a reduction of ≥ 50%. Conclusions state that "carbamazepine is established as effective" for controlling CTN pain, "oxcarbazepine is probably effective", "baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide are possibly effective", "topical ophthalmic anesthesia is probably ineffective", and "there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of clonazepam, gabapentin, phenytoin, tizanidine, topical capsaicin, and valproate" for CTN.

### A retrospective evaluation of the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with postherpetic neuralgia in usual-care settings [^d8f20af4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Both gabapentin and pregabalin are approved for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), although dosing and pharmacokinetic differences between these medications may affect their use in actual practice.

Objectives

This study was conducted to characterize the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in the management of PHN in clinical practice, with a specific focus on the doses actually prescribed and changes in the use of other neuropathic pain-related medications after the initiation of gabapentin or pregabalin.

Methods

The PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database was used to identify patients with PHN who were newly prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin between September 1, 2005, and March 31, 2006. The out-comes of interest were the prevalence of comorbidities, exposure to neuropathic pain-related medications (ie, the proportions of patients receiving ≥ 1 prescription for these medications in the 6-month periods before and after the date of the first gabapentin or pregabalin prescription), and attainment of therapeutic dose levels (gabapentin, ≥ 1800 mg/d; pregabalin, ≥ 150 mg/d).

Results

The database search identified 151 patients with PHN who were newly prescribed gabapentin (57.0% female; mean [SD] age, 55.8 [11.3] years) and 100 patients who were newly prescribed pregabalin (62.0% female; mean age, 52.8 [9.4] years). The prevalence of comorbidities did not differ significantly between recipients of prescriptions for gabapentin or pregabalin, with the exception of hyperlipidemia, which was more prevalent in those prescribed gabapentin (33.8% vs 22.0%, respectively; P = 0.044), and depression, which was more prevalent in those prescribed pregabalin (12.0% vs 4.6%, respectively; P = 0.031). In the pretreatment period, those who were prescribed pregabalin had significantly greater use of long-acting opioids (P = 0.005), anticonvulsants (P < 0.001), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (P < 0.001), and the lidocaine 5% patch (P = 0.005) compared with those prescribed gabapentin. Use of any opioid increased from pretreatment to follow-up in those prescribed gabapentin, significantly so in those who received ≥ 2 opioid prescriptions (P = 0.016). Use of any opioid decreased significantly from pre-treatment to follow-up in those prescribed pregabalin (P = 0.005), particularly in those who received ≥ 2 opioid prescriptions (P = 0.004). Tramadol use decreased significantly in those prescribed gabapentin (P = 0.045), and anticonvulsant use decreased significantly in those prescribed pregabalin (P = 0.004). Among patients prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin who received 1 prescription, 2 consecutive prescriptions, and ≥ 3 consecutive prescriptions, a greater proportion of those prescribed pregabalin attained therapeutic dose levels by their first, second, and third consecutive prescriptions compared with those prescribed gabapentin (69.0% vs 3.5%, respectively [P < 0.001]; 71.4% vs 21.7% [P < 0.001]; and 89.3% vs 46.2% [P < 0.001], respectively).

Conclusions

In these patients with PHN in the usual-care setting, opioid use increased after the initiation of gabapentin and decreased after the initiation of pregabalin. Few of those prescribed gabapentin received a prescription for a therapeutic dose, whereas a greater proportion of patients who were prescribed pregabalin received a prescription for a therapeutic dose.

Cation-Channel Blockers

Drugs that block entry of sodium or calcium into neurons reduce their action potentials. Most often used as anticonvulsants, several have efficacy in neuropathic pain documented in large RCTs, meta-analysis and systematic reviews (level 1 evidence). Gabapentin, first-line treatment for neuropathic pain, came to the attention of pain specialists in an anecdotal report of efficacy for CRPS. It works at the alpha(2)-delta auxiliary subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels and well-powered large RCTs have demonstrated its efficacy, in postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (level 2 evidence). A case series in adults and one pediatric case report suggest efficacy in CRPS (level 4 evidence). The only RCT of gabapentin in CRPS (level 2) was "negative", however it used a sub-maximal dose (1800 mg/day). As gabapentin neared the end of its patent-protection a large pharmaceutical firm developed a closely-related compound, pregabalin, with essentially the same mode of action. Its major advantage is that some patients can manage with twice-daily dosing, but relative cost should be considered when deciding between the two [level 2] There are no clinical trial data evaluating pregabalin for CRPS.

Carbamazepine has a traditional place in the treatment of neuropathic pain, and is FDA-approved for trigeminal neuralgia. One preliminary RCT with an experimental design that included several patients with CRPS responsive to spinal cord stimulator treatment (and the SCS off) indicated that 600 mg/day of carbamazepine, taken over 8 days, had some analgesic efficacy. Oxcarbazepine is a similar anticonvulsant that often replaces carbamazepine because it has fewer serious adverse effects (specifically bone-marrow suppression or liver failure); headaches, dizziness, and nausea are the most common adverse effects of oxcarbazepine. Oxcarbazepine has not been studied specifically in CRPS. Phenytoin is an older agent (with many side effects) sometimes considered in neuropathic pain especially in cases that involve "ectopic nerve firing" (level 2), but there are no reported outcomes in CRPS. RCTs for lamotrigine have studied its effects on other neuropathic conditions, but not CRPS. There is anecdotal evidence (level 4) for efficacy of a variety of other anti-convulsants/neuro-modulators (levetiracetam, topiramate) in CRPS, but no compelling clinical trial evidence supporting their use at this time.

### Substituting gabapentin for opioids has significant downsides… [^44bf35e8]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on October 3, 2022 Although gabapentin is effective at relieving some types of neuropathic pain, namely diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, it is notably ineffective for treating other types, such as radicular low back pain. A 2019 editorial in. American Family Physician warned of potential unintended consequences of using gabapentinoids as alternatives to opioids for pain management. The authors observed that "as many as one in three patients taking therapeutic doses will experience dizziness or somnolence"; also, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety communication about gabapentinoids causing serious breathing problems in patients with chronic respiratory diseases and older patients.

A recent cohort study in JAMA Internal Medicine examined gabapentin use in the perioperative period and in-hospital adverse events in nearly 1 million patients aged 65 years or older. More than 3 in 4 patients underwent orthopedic surgeries. Overall, 12. 3% were prescribed gabapentin perioperatively. Those patients were statistically more likely to experience delirium, receive a new prescription for an antipsychotic drug, and develop pneumonia than gabapentin non-users. In persons using gabapentin, the risk of delirium was higher with chronic kidney disease and a high burden of comorbidities. An accompanying commentary pointed out that the study results "are consistent with what is now a growing body of literature suggesting that gabapentin may not be the windfall medication for perioperative pain management that surgeons hoped it might be for decreasing opioid use, " particularly in older adults:

We need to unwind the automaticity of gabapentin use in the perioperative period. For example, in this study, 80% of gabapentin users received gabapentin on the day of surgery, suggesting that it was started prior to any patient report of pain, representing an opportunity to de-escalate gabapentin use for some patients. Second, engaging patients and caregivers in their care could allow us to better manage expectations for pain control in the perioperative period. A multimodal approach needs to be patient centered and flexible. Finally, aside from swapping out one potentially problematic medication for another, nonpharmacological techniques that might be used to treat pain should be considered.

### Pregabalin for neuropathic pain in adults [^18f1e21e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled "Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults", and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment. Postherpetic neuralgia: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (50% vs 25%; RR 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 2.6); NNTB 3.9 (3.0 to 5.6); 3 studies, 589 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (32% vs 13%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.4); NNTB 5.3 (3.9 to 8.1); 4 studies, 713 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (62% vs 24%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2); NNTB 2.7 (2.2 to 3.7); 3 studies, 537 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 15%; RR 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.5); NNTB 3.9 (3.1 to 5.5); 4 studies, 732 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 16% versus 5.5%, 600 mg 25% versus 5.8%; dizziness 300 mg 29% versus 8.1%, 600 mg 35% versus 8.8%. Painful diabetic neuropathy: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (47% vs 42%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.2); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 8 studies, 2320 participants, moderate-quality evidence), more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (31% vs 24%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 11 studies, 2931 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had PGIC much or very much improved (51% vs 30%; RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0); NNTB 4.9 (3.8 to 6.9); 5 studies, 1050 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (63% vs 52%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.4); NNTB 9.6 (5.5 to 41); 2 studies, 611 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 28%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7); NNTB 7.8 (5.4 to 14); 5 studies, 1015 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 11% versus 3.1%, 600 mg 15% versus 4.5%; dizziness 300 mg 13% versus 3.8%, 600 mg 22% versus 4.4%. Mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (48% vs 36%; RR 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4); NNTB 8.2 (5.7 to 15); 4 studies, 1367 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (34% vs 20%; RR 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9); NNTB 7.2 (5.4 to 11); 4 studies, 1367 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence (12% vs 3.9%) and dizziness (23% vs 6.2%) were more common with pregabalin. Central neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (44% vs 28%; RR 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0); NNTB 5.9 (4.1 to 11); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence) and at least 50% pain intensity reduction (26% vs 15%; RR 1.7 (1.2 to 2.3); NNTB 9.8 (6.0 to 28); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence (32% vs 11%) and dizziness (23% vs 8.6%) were more common with pregabalin. Other neuropathic pain conditions: Studies show no evidence of benefit for 600 mg pregabalin in HIV neuropathy (2 studies, 674 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and limited evidence of benefit in neuropathic back pain or sciatica, neuropathic cancer pain, or polyneuropathy. Serious adverse events, all conditions: Serious adverse events were no more common with placebo than with pregabalin 300 mg (3.1% vs 2.6%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 17 studies, 4112 participants, high-quality evidence) or pregabalin 600 mg (3.4% vs 3.4%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.5); 16 studies, 3995 participants, high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of lamotrigine in combination with other medications for neuropathic pain [^de9718c0]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine added to gabapentin, a tricyclic antidepressant, or a nonopioid analgesic in patients whose neuropathic pain was inadequately controlled with these medications. Patients with neuropathic pain from diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, traumatic/surgical nerve injury, incomplete spinal cord injury, trigeminal neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, or HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy, who had a mean weekly pain score ≥ 4 on an 11-point numerical rating scale, were randomized to receive a flexible dose of lamotrigine 200, 300, or 400mg daily (n = 111) or placebo (n = 109) for up to 14 weeks (including eight weeks of dose escalation) in addition to their prestudy regimen of gabapentin, a tricyclic antidepressant, or a nonopioid analgesic. No statistically significant difference in the mean change in pain-intensity score from baseline to Week 14 (primary endpoint) was detected between lamotrigine and placebo (P = 0.67). Differences between lamotrigine and placebo were not statistically significant for secondary efficacy assessments, including mean changes from baseline in the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Neuropathic Pain Scale, rescue medication use, and the percentages of patients rated as much improved or very much improved at the end of treatment on the Clinician Global Impression of Change scale and the Patient Global Impression of Change scale. Lamotrigine was generally well tolerated. Lamotrigine (up to 400 mg/day) added to gabapentin, a tricyclic antidepressant, or a nonopioid analgesic did not demonstrate efficacy as an adjunctive treatment of neuropathic pain but was generally safe and well tolerated.

### Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults [^ece73155]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is a recently developed antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of pregabalin in acute and chronic pain.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL to May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers and on-line clinical trial databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double blind trials reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the patient as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse events and study withdrawals.

Main Results

There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis. Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia. With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo. Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin has proven efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions and fibromyalgia. A minority of patients will have substantial benefit with pregabalin, and more will have moderate benefit. Many will have no or trivial benefit, or will discontinue because of adverse events. Individualisation of treatment is needed to maximise pain relief and minimise adverse events. There is no evidence to support the use of pregabalin in acute pain scenarios.

### Nonopioid analgesics discovery and the valley of death: EMA401 from concept to clinical trial [^0298816f]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1. Proof-of-concept clinical trial of EMA401 in patients with postherpetic neuralgia

This POC trial (ACTRN12611000822987) was designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of twice-daily oral doses (100 mg) of either EMA401 or placebo in 183 informed, consenting patients with PHN of at least 6-month duration.EMA401 and placebo were administered for a 4-week period in accordance with recommendations for POC study designs for novel analgesics. This trial was conducted at 29 study sites across 6 countries with 92 patients randomized to EMA401 and 91 patients randomized to placebo. Randomization was according to a centralised randomization schedule and blocked by site to increase assay sensitivity. There were 87 and 84 completers in the EMA401 and placebo groups, respectively. The primary efficacy end point was change in mean pain intensity between baseline and the final (fourth) dosing week measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale. Encouragingly, EMA401 provided superior relief of PHN relative to placebo at the end of 28 days of treatment with significant differences between the 2 groups evident by day 21 of treatment (Fig. 5). Importantly, there were no serious adverse events in the EMA401 group. Based on these data, the number needed to treat to obtain ≥ 50% pain relief for EMA401 was estimated at 6.7, which was comparable to pregabalin 300 mg/day (5.2), pregabalin 600 mg/day (4.0), gabapentin ≥ 1200 mg/day (7.7), and topical capsaicin 8% (7.1). In 2015, Spinifex Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Novartis.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^745df37c]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

This was the first large phase 3, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of pregabalin in PTNP for registration purposes in the United States. The conduct of this trial indicates that a large, multinational, phase 3 trial of pregabalin in PTNP is feasible. The significant effect of pregabalin on a number of secondary endpoints, including second measure of pain intensity (BPI-sf) raises the possibility that the absence of a statistically significant difference on the primary endpoint may be partly attributed to additional factors individually or in aggregate including (1) the study design, (2) dose titration, (3) adequacy of dose achieved, (4) duration of the fixed dose period, (5) the number and wide geographical location of study sites needed to conduct the study, (6) the level of refractoriness of the study population, and (7) differential response to study treatments over time in study, particularly the placebo response. A review of randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials in neuropathic pain found that the magnitude of the placebo response accrues slowly and continually, whereas pain reduction in response to active treatments manifests more rapidly, before leveling off. Such a pattern of placebo response occurred over the course of the present study and possibly explains why pregabalin demonstrated a significant treatment effect on mean pain intensity in earlier weeks, but not in the primary analysis at week 15. Moreover, the efficacy of pregabalin observed in the earlier weeks of this trial is consistent with the results from a prior, shorter trial with an 8-week double-blind period. Although subjects in this study by Van Seventer et al. had an equally diverse set of etiologic mechanisms associated with chronic neuropathic pain, it should also be noted that the duration of the syndromes was nearly 50% shorter (4.4 vs 8 years in this study) and, therefore, the studies may not be strictly comparable.

### A clinical overview of off-label use of gabapentinoid drugs [^c69f3984]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

The gabapentinoid drugs gabapentin and pregabalin were originally developed as antiseizure drugs but now are prescribed mainly for treatment of pain. For gabapentin, the only pain-related indication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is postherpetic neuralgia. For pregabalin, FDA-approved indications related to pain are limited to postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy or spinal cord injury, and fibromyalgia. Despite these limited indications, gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed off-label for various other pain syndromes. Such use is growing, possibly because clinicians are searching increasingly for alternatives to opioids.

Observations

This report summarizes the limited published evidence to support off-label gabapentinoid uses, describes clinical cases in which off-label use is problematic, and notes how review articles and guidelines tend to overstate gabapentinoid effectiveness.

Conclusions

Clinicians who prescribe gabapentinoids off-label for pain should be aware of the limited evidence and should acknowledge to patients that potential benefits are uncertain for most off-label uses.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^53521009]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Each neuropathic symptom or sign, mapped separately, was submitted to a team of independent neurologists (contracted by Analgesic Solutions, Natick, MA, USA) who determined the plausibility of matching a PTNP syndrome with respect to the history, anatomic distribution of reported pain, and associated signs identified on neurologic examination in the corresponding body region.

Exclusion criteria included NeP due to PHN, DPN, complex regional pain syndrome, and other conditions; other sources of pain that might confound assessment of PTNP; disallowed concomitant medications; nonpharmacologic treatments for PTNP; severe or acute medical or psychiatric conditions; or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. Patients scoring ≥ 15 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) at screening or who were at risk based on Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating (C-SSRS) responses were recommended for evaluation by a mental health professional prior to randomization. Prohibited medications included opioids, local anesthetics, topical and intraspinal steroids, antiepileptics, and antipsychotics. Allowed medications included stable regimens of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), non-opioid analgesics, antidepressants [including serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)], tramadol and triptans, and/or sleep medications; acetaminophen ≤ 3 g/day was allowed as rescue medication.

Study design and procedures

Eligible patients were randomized at 101 centers in 11 countries (Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, South Africa, South Korea, and the United States). Following a single-blind screening period, the 15-week double-blind treatment period comprised 3 weeks of dose titration/optimization and 12 weeks of maintenance treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). After randomization, clinic visits occurred every 3 weeks.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to pregabalin or matching placebo. The pregabalin dose was individually optimized via telephone contact to 150, 300, 450, or 600 mg/day over the titration period, with 4 days at each dose before titration to the next level. Dose adjustments were not allowed during the maintenance period, except for a single dose reduction if the investigator judged it necessary for tolerability.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^34a9e76a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of pain modulators

Pain modulators include the gabapentanoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCI; eg, amitriptyline) and serotonin noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRI; eg, duloxetine). Some indications that may be helpful to guide initial choice of therapy are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Relative indications for choosing a specific pain modulator

Practical approach:
Amitriptyline: Start with 10 mg at night and if necessary escalate the dose weekly by 10–25 mg/day, up to a maximum dose of 50–150 mg/day. The usual dose for pain relief is 25–50 mg/day. Since the analgesic effect is independent of the mood-altering effect, the dose used for pain is lower than the antidepressant dose (100–300 mg).–
Pregabalin: Start low and titrate slowly according to tolerability, initially 25 mg at night, increasing by 25 mg increments every 3 days. Dosing is initially nocté, followed by higher doses, to a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, administered in two divided doses. Some patients prefer to take only a night-time dose.
Gabapentin: Start with a low dose (100–300 mg at bedtime or 100–300 mg three times daily). Because it has nonlinear pharmacokinetics, it requires slow and careful titration, increasing the dose by 100–300 mg three times daily every 1–7 days as tolerated. The maximum dose is 3600 mg per day in divided doses (1200 mg three times daily).
Duloxetine: Start with 30 mg and increase to 60 mg after 1 week. The dose may be increased to 120 mg/day (60 mg twice daily).

Patients with chronic pain have often been taking one of these medications in the past. Lack of efficacy may be consequent to inappropriate dosing or use of monotherapy. Dosing should be optimized and patients generally require combination therapy, which, in comparison with monotherapy, may be more effective and permit lower doses, with improvement in tolerability. However, the potential for additive adverse effects, increased risk of drug interactions and reduced adherence due to increasing complexity of dosing are also important considerations. Once the dose of a single agent has been stabilized at a therapeutic level, if response is not adequate after 2–4 weeks (and treatment is tolerable), then combination therapy may be considered, using any of the other classes of pain modulators.

Compliance should be assessed by asking the patient to bring all of their medications with them to each consultation.

Gabapentinoids

Gabapentanoids include gabapentin and pregabalin. They are a group of anticonvulsant medications that act by blocking presynaptic alpha-2-delta calcium channels in the dorsal horn, inhibiting neurotransmitter release. They are considered firstline agents in the treatment of neuropathic pain by multiple international societies. Gabapentin and pregabalin both have been shown to be effective in post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Pregabalin also has been shown to be superior to placebo in the treatment of spinal cord injury.

A Cochrane review of gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults confirmed that gabapentin is associated with greater rates of pain relief compared with placebo in post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but it concluded that evidence for other neuropathic pain conditions was weak. Finnerup and colleagues' systematic review of pharmacologic management of chronic neuropathic pain calculated that the combined NNT 1 of 14 RCTs of gabapentin was 6.3 (5.0–8.3). Similarly, the combined NNT from six RCTs of gabapentin extended-release/encarbil was 8.3 (6.2–13). The NNH 2 for gabapentin for all etiologies combined was 25.6 (15.3–78.6).

Finnerup et al. also assessed the efficacy of pregabalin. The combined NNT of 25 RCTs was 7.7 (6.5–9.4), and the NNH was 13.9 (11.6–17.4). Unlike gabapentin, they also reported a dose response, with a greater response being seen in those taking 600 mg daily than in those taking 300 mg. Pregabalin has also been shown to decrease health care and non–health care costs compared with gabapentin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Gabapentanoids should be trialed for a four- to six-week period with two weeks at the maximum tolerated dose. Poorly tolerated side effects or inadequate pain relief should prompt dosage adjustment, cessation of the medication, progression to other firstline agents, or a trial of combination therapy. The most common adverse effects include somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, and lower extremity edema.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was pain rated in a diary completed by telephone each evening between 7and midnight. Patients were asked to select the number that best described their NeP during the past 24 h on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("worst possible pain"). During this call, patients were also asked to select the number that best described how NeP had interfered with their sleep during the past 24 h, on an NRS from 0 ("pain does not interfere with sleep") to 10 ("pain completely interferes with sleep [unable to sleep due to pain]").

Secondary outcome measures at randomization and endpoint included the patient-reported Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS), Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf), European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), Healthcare Utilization Economic Assessment, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP). Patients completed the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) using a 7-point scale from "very much worse" to "very much improved". At endpoint, only the BPI-sf was summarized for the pain severity index score (average of 4 individual pain scores) and pain interference index score (average of 7 individual interference scores).

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of GRALISE for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. This study enrolled patients between the age of 21 to 89 with postherpetic neuralgia persisting for at least 6 months following healing of herpes zoster rash and a minimum baseline pain intensity score of at least 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

This 11-week study compared GRALISE 1,800 mg once daily with placebo. A total of 221 and 231 patients were treated with GRALISE or placebo, respectively. The study treatment including titration for all patients comprised a 10-week treatment period followed by 1-week of dose tapering. Double-blind treatment began with titration starting at 300 mg/day and titrated up to a total daily dose of 1,800 mg over 2 weeks, followed by 8 weeks fixed dosing at 1,800 mg once daily, and then 1 week of dose tapering. During the 8-week stable dosing period, patients took 3 active or placebo tablets each night with the evening meal. During baseline and treatment, patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale. The mean baseline pain score was 6.6 and 6.5 for GRALISE and placebo-treated patients, respectively.

Treatment with GRALISE statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain score from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement.

### The use of gabapentin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^1b019208]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox and can reemerge later in life to cause herpes zoster or shingles. One of the most common and disabling complications of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Objectives

This article reviews the current primary literature about the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin for the treatment of PHN. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics and drug interactions are also reviewed.

Methods

A literature search in the English language was conducted using OVID Web, which contained the following databases: MEDLINE (1966-present), EMBASE (1980–2002), Current Contents/Clinical Medicine (1999–2002), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1898-present), Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (fourth quarter, 2002), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–2002). Search terms used were postherpetic neuralgia; zoster; gabapentin; neuropathic pain; pain; pharmacoeconomic; cost; controlled clinical trial; randomized, controlled trial; postherpetic neuralgia and gabapentin; gabapentin and pain; treatment and postherpetic neuralgia; gabapentin and age; gabapentin and gender; gabapentin and ethnicity; and gabapentin and pharmacokinetics.

Results

Gabapentin displays nonlinear absorption kinetics, is minimally protein bound (< 3%), has a high mean (SD) volume of distribution (50.4 [8.0] L), and is excreted via the kidneys as unchanged drug. Two randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of gabapentin at doses of up to 3600 mg/d to significantly reduce pain (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001), improve sleep (P < 0.01), and improve some parameters on the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (P < 0.05). Dizziness and somnolence were the most common side effects leading to withdrawal from the trials. The recommended dosage in adults is 300 mg at bedtime on day 1,300 mg BID on day 2, and 300 mg TID on day 3, titrating up as needed to 2400 to 3600 mg/d. To reduce adverse events in patients with renal impairment, the dose should be adjusted based on the patient's creatinine clearance.

Conclusions

Gabapentin appears to be effective and well tolerated for the short-term treatment of PHN. However, future controlled studies are needed to determine whether the effectiveness of gabapentin for PHN is maintained for > 2 months, to establish the optimal dose of gabapentin for PHN, and to compare the efficacy of gabapentin with that of other pharmacologic agents used for the treatment of PHN.

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults [^4f369531]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This review updates parts of two earlier Cochrane reviews investigating effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). Antiepileptic drugs are used to manage pain, predominantly for chronic neuropathic pain, especially when the pain is lancinating or burning.

Objectives

To evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and adverse effects of gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain management.

Search Strategy

We identified randomised trials of gabapentin in acute, chronic or cancer pain from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. We obtained clinical trial reports and synopses of published and unpublished studies from Internet sources. The date of the most recent search was January 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind studies reporting the analgesic and adverse effects of gabapentin in neuropathic pain with assessment of pain intensity and/or pain relief, using validated scales. Participants were adults aged 18 and over.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. We calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTs), concentrating on IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) definitions of at least moderate and substantial benefit, and to harm (NNH) for adverse effects and withdrawal. Meta-analysis was undertaken using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Twenty-nine studies (3571 participants), studied gabapentin at daily doses of 1200 mg or more in 12 chronic pain conditions; 78% of participants were in studies of postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy or mixed neuropathic pain. Using the IMMPACT definition of at least moderate benefit, gabapentin was superior to placebo in 14 studies with 2831 participants, 43% improving with gabapentin and 26% with placebo; the NNT was 5.8 (4.8 to 7.2). Using the IMMPACT definition of substantial benefit, gabapentin was superior to placebo in 13 studies with 2627 participants, 31% improving with gabapentin and 17% with placebo; the NNT was 6.8 (5.6 to 8.7). These estimates of efficacy are more conservative than those reported in a previous review. Data from few studies and participants were available for other painful conditions. Adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Persons taking gabapentin can expect to have at least one adverse event (66%), withdraw because of an adverse event (12%), suffer dizziness (21%), somnolence (16%), peripheral oedema (8%), and gait disturbance (9%). Serious adverse events (4%) were no more common than with placebo. There were insufficient data for comparisons with other active treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin provides pain relief of a high level in about a third of people who take if for painful neuropathic pain. Adverse events are frequent, but mostly tolerable. More conservative estimates of efficacy resulted from using better definitions of efficacy outcome at higher, clinically important, levels, combined with a considerable increase in the numbers of studies and participants available for analysis.

14.2 Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) 12-Week Study

The efficacy of HORIZANT for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12- week study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and dose response of 3 maintenance doses of HORIZANT (1,200, 2,400, and 3,600 mg/day, with 107, 82, and 87 patients in each dosing group, respectively). Patients greater than 18 years of age with a documented medical diagnosis of PHN of at least three months duration were enrolled. To ensure that patients had significant pain, randomized patients were required to have a minimum baseline 24-hour average Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) intensity score of at least 4.0 on the 11-point numerical PI-NRS, ranging from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("pain as bad as you can imagine"). In this study, a total of 276 patients received HORIZANT while 95 patients received placebo. Following a 1-week baseline period during which patients were screened for eligibility, patients began a 1-week up-titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance treatment period, and then a 1-week down-titration period. Treatment with HORIZANT statistically significantly improved the mean pain score and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain score from baseline at all doses tested. A benefit over placebo was observed for all 3 doses of HORIZANT as early as Week 1 and maintained to the end of treatment. Additional benefit of using doses of greater than 1,200 mg a day was not demonstrated. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to end of maintenance treatment, Figure 2 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement.

3 TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN

3.1 Medications

Several medications from a wide range of pharmaceutical classes have been used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Summary of pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) are anti‐epileptic medications and are frequently used for treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. They work by inhibiting alpha 2‐delta subunits of voltage‐gated calcium channels. Gabapentin has a strong recommendation as a first line choice in peripheral neuropathic pain at doses of 1200 mg‐3600 mg daily divided into three different doses, or two different doses for an extended‐release formulation. Pregabalin is also a first line agent, dosed at 300–600 mg divided into two doses daily. Gabapentin and pregabalin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for post‐herpetic neuralgia, with pregabalin also being approved for diabetic neuropathy and spinal cord injury pain. Additionally, both medications have evidence that endorses their benefits for use in peripheral diabetic neuropathy. The study of off label use for gabapentinoids has shown they provide little to no improvement in treating other etiologies of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as radiculopathy and HIV associated neuropathy. Common side effects of gabapentinoids include dizziness and sedation. Gabapentin has become subject to abuse in recent years with people taking it in large doses to induce euphoria.

Pharmacological Management

Medications form the basis of first- and second-line therapy for neuropathic pain (Table 1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentanoids, tramadol, lidocaine, and capsaicin are the most effective options. Most of these first- and second-line options come with considerable potential for side effects. Depending on the medication, a three- to eight-week trial is recommended with review midway and at the end of the trial to assess effectiveness. If the patient does not receive significant relief or has adverse effects from a medication, then dosing should be adjusted, an alternative medication or combination therapy should be tried, or the patient should be considered for a trial of neurostimulation.

Table 1
First- and second-line medications for neuropathic pain

Tricyclic Antidepressants. TCAs are one of the most studied antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Their use as a firstline therapy is supported across multiple guidelines. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain post–spinal cord injury and of limited effect in radiculopathy, HIV, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

Anticonvulsants

Gabapentin, a first-line agent for neuropathic pain, exerts its effect by inhibiting the α 2 δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels, thereby reducing neuronal excitability. However, studies evaluating gabapentin's role in CRPS are limited. Van de Vusse et al conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 58 patients with CRPS I. They found that gabapentin produced mild pain relief and significantly improved sensory deficits in the affected limb. In a prospective study by Tan et al, 22 patients with CRPS received an initial gabapentin dose of 600 mg/day, which was titrated until adequate pain control was achieved. The results confirmed gabapentin's efficacy in pain reduction, although it did not affect other CRPS symptoms. Pregabalin, sharing a mechanism similar to gabapentin, is widely used in clinical settings; however, its effectiveness in CRPS is supported only by case reports.

Carbamazepine, a first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels to prevent repetitive neuronal firing. In an RCT by Harke et al, 22 patients with CRPS I who had previously responded to spinal cord stimulation were administered 600 mg/day of carbamazepine for 8 days while stimulation was paused. The results suggested modest analgesic benefits. Oxcarbazepine, a derivative of carbamazepine with a similar mechanism but fewer adverse effects, has not yet been evaluated in patients with CRPS.

Clinical evidence supporting the use of anticonvulsants in CRPS remains limited, underscoring the need for further robust research to establish their efficacy.

Drugs Enhancing Descending Inhibitory Activity

Antidepressants, including TCAs and SNRIs, enhance descending inhibitory pain pathways by inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake at the presynaptic membrane. However, research on their effectiveness in CRPS is limited. Brown et al conducted an RCT including 34 patients aged 7–18 years with CRPS I or neuropathic pain, randomly assigning them to receive either 10 mg amitriptyline or 300 mg gabapentin. Both drugs significantly reduced pain intensity and improved sleep, with no significant difference between them in pain relief or sleep outcomes.TCAs and SNRIs are established agents in neuropathic pain management. Moreover, antidepressants can offer dual benefits in CRPS, as psychiatric comorbidities are common in these patients. The α2-adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine, enhance descending inhibition by stimulating presynaptic α2-receptors in the central nervous system. This inhibitory action reduces excitatory neurotransmitter release and attenuates pain signal transmission at the spinal cord level.

Introduction

Pain control in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) continues to be a challenge, with many patients receiving unsatisfactory treatment. The efficacy of many currently available medications is unsatisfactory owing to their limited effect size and the low responder rate (< 50%). After diagnosis of PNP, a treatment focusing on the underlying disease could be a first step (eg glucose control for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy [DPN] or interruption of chemotherapy when chemotherapy-induced neuropathy occurs), although this does not often lead to a successful reversal of the neuropathic pain.PNP is difficult to treat and often does not respond to conventional pain therapies because of the heterogeneity and complexity of the mechanisms underlying peripheral pain conditions, as well as the co-existence of psychological and emotional aspects of chronic pain.

Treatment of pain requires a multimodal and individualized approach. In the absence of clear predictors of treatment response, a stepwise approach is taken to identify which drugs or drug combinations offer the greatest pain relief with the fewest adverse effects. Pharmacotherapy is typically the first step and treatment classes often trialed include antidepressants (ie tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs/SNRIs]), antiarrhythmic medications, alpha-2-delta subunit ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, sodium channel inhibitors, and synthetic opioids. Pregabalin (Lyrica ®; Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) is an orally administered calcium channel alpha-2-delta subunit ligand. It was one of the first pharmacotherapies introduced for the treatment of PNP (in 2004) and is approved in the USA and Europe for the treatment of pain from DPN and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults. Pregabalin was developed in follow-up to gabapentin. While both have shown efficacy in neuropathic pain disorders, pregabalin has some pharmacological advantages, including more rapid absorption, linear pharmacokinetics, and greater bioavailability (≥ 90%) compared with gabapentin. It is approximately 2.5-times more potent than gabapentin based on plasma concentrations. In a study from Sweden, the first prescription in 2220 patients with neuropathy was pregabalin in 25% of patients, gabapentin in 29%, and amitriptyline in 36%. Nevertheless, a recent Cochrane review concluded that "some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment".

### What is new in neuropathic pain? [^6a9fdfc5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain occurs in 1% of the population and is difficult to manage. Responses to single drugs are limited in benefit. Thirty percent will fail to respond altogether. This is a review of newer drugs and treatment paradigms.

Methods

A literature review was performed pertinent to new drugs and treatment algorithms in the management of neuropathic pain.

Results

New information on opioids (tramadol and buprenorphine) suggests benefits in the management of neuropathic pain and has increased interest in their use earlier in the course of illness. Newer antidepressants, selective noradrenaline, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have evidence for benefit and reduced toxicity without an economic disadvantage compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Treatment paradigms are shifting from sequential single drug trials to multiple drug therapies. Evidence is needed to justify this change in treatment approach.

Conclusion

Drug choices are now based not only on efficacy but also toxicity and drug interactions. For this reason, SNRIs and gabapentin/pregabalin have become popular though efficacy is not better than TCAs. Multiple drug therapies becoming an emergent treatment paradigm research in multiple drug therapy are needed.

### A phase 2a, randomized, crossover trial of gabapentin enacarbil for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in gabapentin inadequate responders [^b787c971]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of high-dose (3,600mg/day) vs low-dose (1,200mg/day) oral gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) on pain intensity in adults with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and a history of inadequate response to ≥ 1,800mg/day gabapentin.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study (NCT00617461).

Setting

Thirty-five outpatient centers in Germany and the United States.

Subjects

Subjects aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of PHN.

Methods

During a 2-week baseline period, subjects received open-label treatment with 1,800mg/day gabapentin. Subjects who had a mean 24-hour average pain intensity score ≥ 4 during the last 7 days of the baseline period were randomized to receive GEn (1,200 or 3,600mg/day) for treatment period 1 (28 days), followed by GEn 2,400mg/day (4 days), and the alternate GEn dose for treatment period 2 (28 days).

Results

There was a modest but significant improvement in pain intensity scores with GEn 3,600mg vs 1,200mg (adjusted mean [90% confidence interval] treatment difference, -0.29 [-0.48 to -0.10]; P = 0.013). The difference in efficacy between doses was observed primarily in subjects who received the higher dose during treatment period 2; certain aspects of the study design may have contributed to this outcome. Plasma steady-state gabapentin exposure during GEn treatment was as expected and consistent between treatment periods. No new safety signals or adverse event trends relating to GEn exposure were identified.

Conclusions

While the overall results demonstrated efficacy in a PHN population, the differences between treatment periods confound the interpretation. These findings could provide insight into future trial designs.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^8251d968]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) — nonopioid pharmacological recommendations include early initiation of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (strong, low). Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line oral pharmacological treatment (strong, moderate), with a typical adult regimen that will titrate to 2400 mg per day in divided doses; somnolence was reported by 80% of patients who received gabapentin. If patients have an inadequate response to gabapentin, clinicians might consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors based on their effectiveness in the general population (weak, moderate), a trial of tricyclic antidepressants (weak, moderate), or a trial of pregabalin for patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (weak, moderate). Capsaicin is recommended as a topical treatment for chronic HIV-associated peripheral neuropathic pain (strong, high), with a single 30-minute application of an 8% dermal patch or cream at the site of pain providing pain relief for at least 12 weeks; erythema and pain are common side effects for which a 60-minute application of 4% lidocaine can be applied and wiped off before applying capsaicin. Medical cannabis may be an effective treatment in appropriate patients (weak, moderate), and values and preferences place a relatively high value on symptom reduction and a relatively low value on the legal implication of medical cannabis possession; current evidence suggests medical cannabis may be more effective for patients with a history of prior cannabis use.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia [^afaa06e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster and its sequela post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) are conditions with significant morbidity. PHN is a chronic, debilitating neuropathic pain that can persist long beyond resolution of visible cutaneous manifestations. This paper provides practical guidelines for management of herpes zoster and PHN. For herpes zoster, antivirals should be started, preferably within 72 h of onset, to reduce the severity and duration of the eruptive phase and to reduce the intensity of acute pain. PHN can be treated with either topical or systemic agents. Topical lidocaine and capsaicin are effective. For patients with more severe pain, the following systemic agents can be considered (in decreasing order of recommendation): the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine, and, lastly, the opioid analgesics tramadol, morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. For patients at high risk of developing PHN, early initiation of gabapentin or amitriptyline after the onset of herpes zoster is suggested. The new zoster vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of herpes zoster and PHN.

### Efficacy of gabapentin enacarbil vs placebo in patients with postherpetic neuralgia and a pharmacokinetic comparison with oral gabapentin [^23ddda2c]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of gabapentin in some patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) may be limited by suboptimal drug exposure from unpredictable and saturable absorption. Gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) was designed for absorption by high-capacity transporters expressed throughout the intestine and undergoes rapid postabsorption hydrolysis to gabapentin. GEn extended-release tablets provide sustained, dose-proportional gabapentin exposure. This study assessed the efficacy of GEn vs placebo and compared the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin after oral dosing of GEn or gabapentin in patients with PHN.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized study, 115 patients with PHN completed a 7-day baseline period and 11-day gabapentin run-in period. Eligible patients were randomized and 101 received double-blind GEn 1,200 mg (624 mg-equivalents gabapentin) (n = 47) or placebo (n = 54), twice daily for 14 days. We evaluated patient-reported pain, sleep, mood, global improvement, and adverse events, plus gabapentin pharmacokinetics.

Results

The improvement in mean weekly pain scores from baseline to the end of treatment (primary endpoint) was significantly greater for GEn (-2.1) vs placebo (-1.2), P = 0.0321. Significant improvements from GEn vs placebo were also seen in sleep, mood, and patient global assessment (P < 0.05). With a 31% lower daily dose of gabapentin equivalents, GEn tablets provided a significant increase in average steady state gabapentin concentrations vs gabapentin capsules in the same patients (n = 42; P = 0.0050).

Conclusions

GEn was effective in providing PHN pain relief, improved gabapentin exposure compared with gabapentin capsules, and was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with PHN.

### Effect of gabapentin vs pregabalin on pain intensity in adults with chronic sciatica: a randomized clinical trial [^3deb6a39]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Optimal pharmacologic treatment for chronic sciatica (CS) is currently unclear. While gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) are both used to treat CS, equipoise exists. Nevertheless, pharmaceutical regulation authorities typically subsidize one drug over the other. This hinders interchange wherever the favored drug is either ineffective or ill-tolerated.

Objective

To assess GBP vs PGB head to head for the treatment of CS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A preplanned interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy crossover trial of PGB vs GBP for management of CS at half the estimated final sample size was performed in a single-center, tertiary referral public hospital. A total of20 patients underwent randomization from March 2016 to March 2018, and2 were excluded with 1 lost to follow-up and the other requiring urgent surgery unrelated to the study. Patients attending a specialist neurosurgery clinic with unilateral CS were considered for trial recruitment. Chronic sciatica was defined as pain lasting for at least 3 months radiating into 1 leg only to, at, or below the knee level. Imaging (magnetic resonance imaging with or without computed tomography) corroborating a root-level lesion concordant with symptoms and/or signs was determined by the trial clinician. Inclusion criteria included patients who had not used GBP and PGB and were 18 years or older. Analyses were intention to treat and began February 2018.

Interventions

Randomly assigned participants received GBP (400 mg to 800 mg 3 times a day) then PGB (150 mg to 300 mg twice daily) or vice versa, each taken for 8 weeks. Crossover followed a 1-week washout.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was pain intensity (10-point visual analog scale) at baseline and 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included disability (using the Oswestry Disability Index) and severity/frequency of adverse events.

Results

The total trial population (N = 18) consisted mostly of men (11 [61%]) with a mean (SD) age of 57 (16.5) years. A third of the cohort were smokers (5 [28%]), and more than half consumed alcohol (12 [67%]). Gabapentin was superior to PGB, with fewer and less severe adverse events. Both GBP (mean [SD], 7.54[1.39] to 5.82[1.72]; P < .001) and PGB (mean [SD], 7.33[1.30] to 6.38[1.88]; P = 0.002) displayed significant visual analog pain intensity scale reduction and Oswestry Disability Index reduction (mean [SD], 59.22[16.88] to 48.54[15.52]; P < .001 for both). Head to head, GBP showed superior visual analog pain intensity scale reduction (mean [SD], GBP: 1.72[1.17] vs PGB: 0.94[1.09]; P = 0.035) irrespective of sequence order; however, Oswestry Disability Index reduction was unchanged. Adverse events for PGB were more frequent (PGB, 31 [81%] vs GBP, 7 [19%]; P = 0.002) especially when PGB was taken first.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pregabalin and GBP were both significantly efficacious. However, GBP was superior with fewer and less severe adverse events. Gabapentin should be commenced before PGB to permit optimal crossover of medicines.

### Pain relief and functional improvement in patients with neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury: an exploratory analysis of pregabalin clinical trials [^124c9706]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Data were derived from Siddall et aland Cardenas et al, two clinical trials of pregabalin in patients with SCI-associated NeP, for which details of methodology and key results of the effects of pregabalin on pain relief have been previously published. Both studies, which received approval from the appropriate Institutional Review Boards or Independent Ethics Committees, employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design that evaluated flexible dosing of pregabalin 150–600 mg/d compared with placebo taken twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients in both studies were ≥ 18 years of age, with SCI and central NeP of at least moderate severity; 57.7% and 42.3% of patients in Siddall et alwere paraplegic and tetraplegic, respectively, and the majority of patients in Cardenas et alwere of either American Spinal Injury Association classification A (48.4%) or D (28.8%). In Siddall et al, pregabalin was initiated at 150 mg/d for the first week and then increased to 300 mg/d with the potential for further increase to 600 mg/d after the second week; doses could be reduced from 300 mg/d to 150 mg/d at the end of the second week and from 600 mg/d to 300 mg/d at the end of the third week if not tolerated. Cardenas et alinitiated pregabalin at 150 mg/d for 7 days, with increases based on tolerability to 300 mg/d on day 8, 450 mg/d on day 15, and 600 mg/d on day 22, followed by a 12-week maintenance period of optimized dose with allowance of a single-level dose reduction if needed.

### Efficacy and safety of crisugabalin (HSK16149) in adults with postherpetic neuralgia: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^7e4e9aa9]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

China carries a heavy burden of postherpetic neuralgia, with an unmet need for novel drugs with greater efficacy and less prominent neurotoxic effects than existing calcium channel ligands.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of crisugabalin, an oral calcium channel α2δ-1 subunit ligand, for postherpetic neuralgia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial, carried out between November 9, 2021, and January 5, 2023, at 48 tertiary care centers across China had 2 parts. Part 1 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisting of a 2-week screening period, a 7-day run-in period, and a 12-week double-blind treatment period. Part 2 was a 14-week open-label extension study. Investigators, statisticians, trial clinicians, and patients were blinded to trial group assignments. Participants included adults with postherpetic neuralgia with an average daily pain score (ADPS) of at least 4 on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the preceding week, with the exclusion of patients with pain not controlled by prior therapy with pregabalin (≥ 300 mg/d) or gabapentin (≥ 1200 mg/d).

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive crisugabalin, 20 mg twice daily (ie, 40 mg/d), and crisugabalin, 40 mg twice daily (ie, 80 mg/d), or placebo for 12 weeks. Eligible patients received crisugabalin, 40 mg, twice daily during extension.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in ADPS at week 12.

Results

The study enrolled 366 patients (121 patients receiving crisugabalin, 40 mg/d; 121 patients receiving crisugabalin, 80 mg/d; 124 patients receiving placebo; median [IQR] age, 63.0 [56.0–69.0] years; 193 men [52.7%]). At week 12, the least squares mean (SD) change from baseline in ADPS was -2.2 (0.2) for crisugabalin, 40 mg/d, and -2.6 (0.2) for crisugabalin, 80 mg/d, vs -1.1 (0.2) for placebo, with a least squares mean difference of -1.1 (95% CI, -1.6 to -0.7; P < .001) and -1.5 (-95% CI, -2.0 to -1.0; P < .001) vs placebo, respectively. No new safety concerns emerged.

Conclusions and Relevance

Crisugabalin, 40 mg/d, or crisugabalin, 80 mg/d, was well tolerated and demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ADPS over placebo.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^51385a62]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain, defined as "pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system"is a common chronic pain condition. The condition represents a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems, and can be challenging to diagnose and effectively treat. Despite the availability of a number of effective pharmacological treatment options, many patients with neuropathic pain, particularly those with more severe conditions, may be untreated or undertreated.

Pregabalin (Pfizer, New York, USA), an α 2 δ ligand, is indicated in the USA for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), peripheral herpetic neuralgia (PHN), and spinal cord injury, and in Europe for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain. It is recommended as a first-line treatment for diverse neuropathic pain conditions (including DPN, PHN, and central pain) by the European Federation of Neurological Societies, the International Association for the Study of Pain, and the American Academy of Neurology. While pregabalin is not effective in every patient with neuropathic pain, its efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical trials and meta-analyses. Cumulatively, it is estimated that there have now been over 34 million patient-years of exposure to pregabalin.

A meta-analysis of clinical trials of different treatments for the neuropathic pain condition DPN concluded that pregabalin at doses ≥ 300 mg/day was more effective in improving pain than pregabalin at doses ≤ 150 mg/day; although many patients do respond to treatment with pregabalin at lower doses (≤ 300 mg/day). As a consequence, it is recommended that in clinical practice, pregabalin should be carefully escalated to the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects. Despite this, some physicians may not attempt a higher dose of pregabalin in patients who do not respond at an initial low dose and many patients receive doses ≤ 150 mg/day.

New evidence showing that there are patients who do not respond to a low dose of pregabalin but who do subsequently respond when the dose is increased may help to provide clearer guidance to physicians and more effective treatment to patients. This analysis pooled individual patient-level data from 6 randomized, placebo-controlled studies of flexible-dose pregabalin in neuropathic pain with the aim of assessing how patients who do not initially respond to pregabalin at lower doses react to increasing doses.

### Algorithm for neuropathic pain treatment: an evidence based proposal [^93d078b6]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

New studies of the treatment of neuropathic pain have increased the need for an updated review of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to support an evidence based algorithm to treat neuropathic pain conditions. Available studies were identified using a MEDLINE and EMBASE search. One hundred and five studies were included. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) were used to compare efficacy and safety of the treatments in different neuropathic pain syndromes. The quality of each trial was assessed. Tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin were the most frequently studied drug classes. In peripheral neuropathic pain, the lowest NNT was for tricyclic antidepressants, followed by opioids and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. For central neuropathic pain there is limited data. NNT and NNH are currently the best way to assess relative efficacy and safety, but the need for dichotomous data, which may have to be estimated retrospectively for old trials, and the methodological complexity of pooling data from small cross-over and large parallel group trials, remain as limitations.

### Pregabalin in patients with central neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a flexible-dose regimen [^65768bb1]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

The effective treatment of patients suffering from central neuropathic pain remains a clinical challenge, despite a standard pharmacological approach in combination with anticonvulsants and antidepressants. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effects of pregabalin on pain relief, tolerability, health status, and quality of life in patients with central neuropathic pain caused by brain or spinal cord injuries. At baseline and 4 weeks after the start of treatment subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: pain intensity measured by visual analog scale, health status (Pain Disability Index and EQ-5D) and quality of life (SF-36). Forty patients received escalating doses of either pregabalin (150, 300, and 600mg/day) or matching placebo capsules. In both groups, patients started with 1 capsule per day (either 150mg of pregabalin or placebo). If pain relief was insufficient, patients were titrated to a higher dose. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean pain score at endpoint for pregabalin treatment, compared with placebo (P = 0.016). Follow-up observation showed no significant difference in Pain Disability Index scores between the two groups. The pregabalin group, however, showed a statistically significant improvement for the EQ-5D. Pregabalin treatment led to a significant improvement in the bodily pain domain of the SF36. In the other domains, more favorable scores were reported without reaching statistical significance. Pregabalin, in a flexible-dose regime, produced clinically significant reductions in pain, as well as improvements in health status in patients suffering from severe central neuropathic pain.

First-line treatments

First-line treatments have a high GRADE of evidence and a strong recommendation from the panel.

New recommendations

No new first-line treatment recommendations were proposed.

Existing recommendations

2016 clinical considerations

Pregabalin is recommended as the first choice of first-line medications, as it has the strongest evidence of any treatment modality in below-level NP: all studies demonstrate a significant reduction in pain intensity. Pregabalin studies used larger sample sizes than most treatment studies for SCI-related NP and rigorous methodology. Two high-quality randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) and one moderate-quality placebo-controlled RCT, which was downgraded based on wide confidence intervals around numbers needed to treat, comprise the evidence base for pregabalin. When defining successful treatment of individual patients as a 50% reduction in pain level, the NNT for these 3 trials was 7.1, 7.0, and 3.3. All studies focused on NP and measured pain intensity. One trial studied a mixed population that included stroke patients (n = 19), but a subgroup analysis was performed for the group with SCI. A pharmaceutical company funded two pregabalin RCTs. Pregabalin studies used flexible dosing between 150 and 600 mg/day. Adverse effects include somnolence, dizziness, and edema which were usually of mild-to-moderate intensity and transient.

### Gabapentin in neuropathic pain syndromes: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^81bbd6ba]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 8-week study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain, using doses up to 2400 mg/day. The study used a novel design that was symptom- rather than syndrome-based; an approach that aimed to reflect the realities of clinical practice. Participants had a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes, with at least two of the following symptoms: allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, or hyperalgesia. Patients were randomised to gabapentin (n = 153) or placebo (n = 152). Gabapentin was given in three divided doses, initially titrated to 900 mg/day over 3 days, followed by two further increases, to a maximum of 2400 mg/day if required by the end of week 5. The primary outcome measure was changed in average daily pain diary score (baseline versus final week). Over the 8 week study, this score decreased (i.e. improved) by 1.5 (21%) in gabapentin treated patients and by 1.0 (14%) in placebo treated patients (P = 0.048, rank-based analysis of covariance). Significant differences were shown in favour of gabapentin (P < 0.05) for the Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change, and some domains of the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire. Improvements were also shown in patient-reported outcomes in quality of life, as seen by significant differences in favour of gabapentin in several domains of the Short-Form-36 Health Survey. Gabapentin was well tolerated and the majority of patients completed the study (79 versus 73% for placebo). The most common adverse events were mild to moderate dizziness and somnolence, most of which were transient and occurred during the titration phase. This study shows that gabapentin reduces pain and improves some quality-of-life measures in patients with a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes.
