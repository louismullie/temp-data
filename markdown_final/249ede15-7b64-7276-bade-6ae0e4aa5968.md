## Question

What are the most common symptoms of bronchitis in seniors?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common symptoms of bronchitis in seniors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing acute bronchitis from chronic bronchitis and how age modifies presentation. Then, I should verify the core symptom set and how it differs in older adults. Next, I will examine age-specific modifiers such as blunted fever, atypical features, and comorbidity overlap. After that, I should review the differential diagnoses that commonly mimic bronchitis in seniors and how to exclude them. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized list of the most common symptoms in seniors and note red flags that warrant escalation, anchoring to high-quality guidelines and reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Acute bronchitis is an acute lower respiratory infection with cough lasting up to 3 weeks, with or without sputum, and no evidence of pneumonia or alternative explanations, whereas chronic bronchitis is defined by cough with sputum on most days for at least 3 months per year for 2 consecutive years, often in the context of COPD, and both are common in older adults, which shapes how symptoms present and are interpreted [^113TnNEJ] [^114VGSCJ] [^111VEuCv].

> I will now examine the universal symptom core. Across ages, cough is the predominant symptom of acute bronchitis, typically with or without sputum, and often accompanied by chest discomfort, wheeze, and systemic features such as fatigue, mild headache, myalgia, and occasionally low-grade fever; this constellation is well-described in contemporary reviews and public health guidance and aligns with guideline definitions of acute bronchitis [^111RmxLK] [^115JpTfU] [^113TnNEJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fever and systemic signs in seniors. I initially thought fever and chills would be common, but wait, let me verify the geriatric pattern. In older adults, the febrile response is frequently blunted, so seniors may present with minimal or no fever despite significant infection, and dyspnea may be more prominent due to reduced cardiopulmonary reserve and comorbidities; this age-related attenuation of fever and heightened dyspnea perception is repeatedly emphasized in geriatric respiratory care summaries and observational data in the elderly [^116fxbud] [^116QYRoL].

> Next, I should review how chronic bronchitis and COPD modify the picture in seniors. Many older adults with chronic bronchitis have COPD, where chronic cough with sputum, dyspnea, wheeze, chest tightness, and activity limitation are characteristic, and exacerbations can present with increased sputum volume or purulence and worsening dyspnea; importantly, the chronic bronchitis phenotype is associated with more frequent exacerbations and poorer quality of life, which can dominate the clinical narrative in seniors with underlying COPD [^111Ltura] [^111VEuCv] [^117EMKJa].

> Let me consider the differential and mimics that are especially common in seniors. I need to ensure we exclude pneumonia, heart failure, asthma or COPD exacerbations, pertussis, and upper airway cough syndrome, because these can masquerade as "bronchitis" and are more prevalent or consequential in older adults; guidelines emphasize ruling out pneumonia clinically and radiographically when indicated, and considering pertussis in prolonged cough with paroxysms, which is particularly relevant when vaccination history is remote or waning [^116zSTZN] [^112fAS6d] [^1154DeX8].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach in seniors with suspected acute bronchitis. Routine labs and imaging are not recommended initially, but in older adults with severe symptoms, abnormal vitals, focal lung findings, or high suspicion for pneumonia, chest radiography should be considered; this age-tailored threshold reflects the higher pretest probability of pneumonia and the blunted clinical signs in the elderly, and it is explicitly recommended in primary care guidance for older patients [^116zSTZN] [^112Nmytv].

> Now, synthesizing the most common symptoms in seniors with bronchitis, I need to prioritize by frequency and clinical salience. The most common symptom is cough, usually with sputum but sometimes dry, followed by dyspnea, which is more prominent in older adults, then chest discomfort or tightness, wheeze, and fatigue or malaise; sputum production is frequent and may be purulent, though purulence alone is not reliable for bacterial infection, and low-grade fever may be present but is often absent or overlooked in seniors [^111Ltura] [^115JpTfU] [^1132kc9R] [^116fxbud].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or atypical features emerge. I should confirm red flags that warrant escalation: hemoptysis, severe dyspnea or respiratory distress, confusion or altered mental status, persistent cough beyond 3 weeks, recurrent episodes, or systemic instability; these features push toward pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, malignancy, or other serious disease and should trigger targeted investigations and reassessment rather than attributing everything to "bronchitis" [^115JpTfU] [^112cKeqV].

> In summary, after verifying the evidence and correcting my initial assumption about fever, the most common symptoms of bronchitis in seniors are cough with or without sputum, dyspnea, chest discomfort or tightness, wheeze, and fatigue or malaise, with the caveat that fever may be minimal or absent and dyspnea may be disproportionately prominent due to age and comorbidity; this profile is grounded in contemporary bronchitis definitions, public health summaries, and geriatric respiratory care principles, and it should be interpreted in the context of a careful exclusion of pneumonia and other serious mimics in older adults [^113TnNEJ] [^111Ltura] [^115JpTfU] [^116fxbud].

---

The most common symptoms of bronchitis in seniors are **cough with sputum** [^113TnNEJ] and **shortness of breath** [^113VjNCk], often with wheezing and chest discomfort [^111Ltura]. Fever is less common and may be absent or mild due to blunted immune responses in older adults [^116fxbud]. Seniors may also experience fatigue, confusion, or a decline in functional status, and symptoms can persist longer than in younger adults [^116fxbud]. Because older adults have higher risks of complications, clinicians should maintain a **low threshold to evaluate for pneumonia** [^116zSTZN] or other serious conditions [^112cKeqV].

## Common symptoms of bronchitis in seniors

### Cough with sputum production

Cough is the **hallmark symptom** of bronchitis [^113TnNEJ], typically producing clear or white sputum; yellow or green sputum is common and does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection [^1132kc9R]. Chronic bronchitis is defined by cough and sputum on most days for at least 3 months per year for 2 consecutive years [^117TRMVk].

---

### Shortness of breath (dyspnea)

Dyspnea is common in seniors with bronchitis, particularly those with underlying COPD or other chronic respiratory conditions [^113VjNCk]. It may be **exertional or present at rest**, reflecting airway obstruction and inflammation [^notfound].

---

### Wheezing and chest discomfort

Wheezing results from airway narrowing and inflammation, and chest discomfort or tightness often accompanies cough and wheeze [^111Ltura]. These symptoms are especially **pronounced in seniors with pre-existing respiratory disease** [^notfound].

---

### Fatigue and malaise

Seniors frequently report fatigue, generalized malaise, and reduced energy levels, often reflecting the **interaction of bronchitis with age-related comorbidities** and diminished physiological reserves [^notfound].

---

### Less common or atypical symptoms in seniors

- **Fever**: Less common in seniors due to blunted immune responses; when present, it is usually mild [^notfound].
- **Confusion or altered mental status**: May occur, particularly in seniors with underlying cognitive impairment or systemic illness [^notfound].
- **Functional decline**: Seniors may experience worsening mobility, appetite loss, or difficulty performing daily activities [^notfound].

---

## Differences in symptom presentation compared to younger adults

| **Symptom** | **Seniors** | **Younger adults** |
|-|-|-|
| Fever | Less common, milder | More common, higher |
| Dyspnea | More pronounced, frequent | Less pronounced |
| Confusion | More common | Rare |
| Functional decline | Common | Rare |
| Complications (e.g. pneumonia) | Higher risk | Lower risk |

---

## Complications and risks associated with bronchitis in seniors

Seniors with bronchitis face **higher risks of complications**, including:

- **Pneumonia**: Higher incidence and mortality in older adults [^notfound].
- **Respiratory failure**: Increased risk due to reduced lung function and comorbidities [^notfound].
- **Exacerbation of chronic diseases**: Worsening of COPD, heart failure, or other chronic conditions [^notfound].
- **Prolonged recovery**: Symptoms may persist longer, increasing morbidity and healthcare utilization [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

Given the **atypical presentation and higher risk of complications**, clinicians should:

- **Maintain a low threshold for evaluation**: Consider chest radiography [^116zSTZN], pulse oximetry, and laboratory tests to exclude pneumonia or other serious conditions [^1124oGih].
- **Monitor closely**: Frequent follow-up to assess for deterioration or complications [^112cKeqV].
- **Individualize treatment**: Tailor management to comorbidities, functional status, and patient preferences [^1164yLqt].
- **Educate patients and caregivers**: Emphasize symptom monitoring, hydration, and when to seek medical attention [^115JpTfU].

---

The most common symptoms of bronchitis in seniors are **cough with sputum** and **shortness of breath**, often with wheezing and chest discomfort; fever may be absent or mild. Seniors are at higher risk of complications, so clinicians should maintain a low threshold for evaluation and monitor closely.

### Resistant pathogens in respiratory tract infections in older people [^111zXdUw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia are the most common respiratory tract infections observed in older people and are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality associated with infection. Accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in older people is problematic because of the lack of clear symptoms and signs that are usually seen in younger patients. In addition, the increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapy highlights the importance of appropriate therapy. The following review examines the issues associated with the accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections, optimal therapy for older patients, and the mechanisms of emerging bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapy.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^111rREmW]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) causes significant impairment in quality of life, and effective treatment strategies are needed. We conducted a systematic review on the management of chronic cough due to CB to update the recommendations and suggestions of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on this topic.

Methods

This systematic review asked three questions: (1) What are the clinical features of the history that suggest a patient's cough-phlegm syndrome is due to CB? (2) Can treatment of stable CB improve or eliminate chronic cough? (3) Can therapy that targets chronic cough due to CB prevent or reduce the occurrence of acute CB exacerbations? Studies of adult patients with CB were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on by using the CHEST organization methodology.

Results

The search strategy used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify studies of chronic cough due to CB.

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the management of chronic cough due to CB is limited overall and of low quality. This article provides guidance on treatment by presenting suggestions based on the best currently available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research.

New definition

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, cough, expectoration and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction (FEV₁/FVC < 0.7). This definition aims at: (1) recognizing that COPD is heterogeneous; and (2) describing explicitly what are the main structural, functional, and clinical manifestations of the disease.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, although it is a preventable and treatable disease. Awareness of COPD heterogeneity is necessary for patient-tailored treatment. There have been wide accepted phenotypes including chronic bronchitis (CB), emphysema, asthma-COPD overlap (ACO), frequent/rare exacerbator and rapid decliner. Of the known phenotypes, CB is the most well-understood. It is associated with typical symptoms, poor health-related quality of life, reduced lung function, frequent exacerbation, and high mortality. Furthermore, the economic burden of CB is substantial.

Patients with CB frequently have chronic cough and sputum, but the diverse disease definitions complicate outcome assessments. In 1978, the American Thoracic Society defined CB based on the presence of frequent cough and sputum production for 3 months per year over 2 consecutive years; however, there were some limitations using in both clinical and research field. A recent approach to the assessment of CB is the use of sub-questionnaires from the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). In the eight sub-questionnaires, the scores range from 0 to 5 points. CAT1 and CAT2 evaluate the severities of cough and sputum, respectively; the combination of their scores is a valid approach to CB diagnosis. The CAT score also allows symptoms to be ranked based on a score of 0–5. By defining different CB cut-off levels, disease stratification according to severity may be possible, but this has not yet been attempted.

The aim of this study was to identify the characteristics that distinguish CB from non-CB within a group of COPD patients, based on baseline characteristics, symptoms, exercise capacity, lung function, and exacerbation rates. In addition, distinct CAT1 and CAT2 cut-off scores were used to stratify patients with mild CB versus severe CB. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) trajectories during a 3-year follow-up period were compared among non-CB, mild CB, and severe CB patients.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem that is projected to rank fifth worldwide in terms of disease burden and third in terms of mortality. Chronic bronchitis is associated with multiple clinical consequences, including hastening lung function decline, increasing risk of exacerbations, reducing health-related quality of life, and possibly raising all-cause mortality. Recent data suggest greater elucidation on the risk factors, radiologic characteristics, and treatment regimens. Our goal was to review the literature on chronic bronchitis that has been published in the past few years.

Recent Findings

A growing body of literature that more carefully describes environmental risk factors, epidemiology, and genetics associated with chronic bronchitis. In addition, as computed tomography technology continues to improve, the radiologic phenotype associated with chronic bronchitis is better understood.

Summary

With these new data, the clinician can recognize the newly described risk factors and the associated phenotype for chronic bronchitis and entertain new treatment options for this high-risk population.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^116AouQL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects more than 40 in 1000 adults per year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 420 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 306 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 245 studies and the further review of 61 full publications. Of the 61 full articles evaluated, three updated systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we categorised the efficacy for six intervention-comparison combinations, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, beta2 agonists (inhaled), and expectorants/mucolytics.

Exacerbations are a characteristic feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and contribute significantly to associated morbidity and mortality. Renewed interest in this common clinical problem and research using new investigative tools has enhanced substantially the understanding of the pathogenesis of exacerbations. Results of recent clinical trials and observational studies have allowed refinements in treatment of exacerbations that should im-prove patient outcomes. This article discusses a rational, stratified approach to the use of antibiotics for this condition based on these recent studies.

### Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis [^112hWrZf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the top 10 conditions for which patients seek medical care. Physicians show considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary to its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics. These drugs have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to prescription of an antibiotic.

### The diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis [^112Bv8zM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of chronic bronchitis (CB), bronchiectasis, emphysema, and reversible airway disease that combine uniquely in an individual patient. Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components — emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^111Ltura]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bronchitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bronchitis is a transient inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree in response to infection without a history of chronic pulmonary disease or evidence of pneumonia or sinusitis.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common cause of acute bronchitis are viruses (90%) including adenovirus, influenza, measles, respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza, and HSV. Nonvirus (10%) causes include bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae) and inhaled lung irritants.
- **Disease course**: Inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree results in acute bronchitis, which causes clinical manifestations of cough (dry or productive), chest tightness, burning with or without wheezing, headache, low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, and myalgia.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute bronchitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Impact of bronchitis variability on outcomes of COPD [^115dSeXJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a significant public health challenge globally, and it ranks as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitations, COPD not only diminishes the quality of life, but also imposes substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems. Among the various clinical phenotypes of COPD, chronic bronchitis (CB) is particularly detrimental. Defined by the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in two consecutive years, CB is associated with poor quality of life and more severe disease and leads to more frequent exacerbations and an accelerated decline in lung function. Due to the challenges associated with this diagnostic criterion, assessments often incorporate COPD Assessment Test (CAT) or St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores to define CB.

While the clinical significance of the CB phenotype in COPD is well documented, a key issue is the variability in patient symptoms. Some individuals may develop additional respiratory symptoms despite previously having fewer or none, while others may experience an improvement in their condition. Smoking is a well-known factor influencing these variations, along with several other causes. However, the understanding of how these fluctuations affect clinical outcomes is limited. When using available scoring systems such as the CAT or SGRQ scores, recall bias is mitigated by not depending on patient memory. However, these tools also have limitations; for example, they may not fully capture the long-term status of symptoms as they predominantly assess the condition in a relatively short-term context around the time of recording.

Among the available definitions of CB, we selected the CAT-based definition due to its simplicity, strong predictive validity and clinical applicability. The classical definition is complex and susceptible to recall bias, particularly in older Korean patients who often struggle to comprehend terms such as 'two consecutive years'. While the SGRQ-based definition is validated and widely used, it is not routinely implemented in clinical practice and may be less practical in real-world settings. Furthermore, a recent Korean study demonstrated that the CAT-based definition more accurately predicted COPD exacerbations than the SGRQ-based approach. Given these advantages, we adopted the CAT-based definition as the primary method for classifying CB status in this study.

### Airway obstructive diseases in older adults: from detection to treatment [^1164yLqt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occur commonly and may overlap among older adults. Smoking, air pollution, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are the main risk factors. The treatment of these diseases in older adults does not differ from the available guidelines but may be complicated by the presence of comorbidities. Smoking cessation is essential for smokers, and pulmonary rehabilitation must be considered regardless of the age of the patient.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^1152zHys]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician — patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1154DeX8]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis — exclusion of mimics and outcome assessment emphasizes that patients with conditions that may mimic acute bronchitis such as cough variant asthma, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis, bacterial sinusitis, and the common cold should be excluded. Until these exclusionary conditions are considered and ruled out, the true frequency of acute bronchitis as a distinct clinical entity will not be known. Additionally, there is a need for studies to routinely use reliable and valid cough outcome measures to assess resolution of episodes of cough due to suspected acute bronchitis.

### Chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113NPRZt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic bronchitis (CB) is a common but variable phenomenon in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has numerous clinical consequences, including an accelerated decline in lung function, greater risk of the development of airflow obstruction in smokers, a predisposition to lower respiratory tract infection, higher exacerbation frequency, and worse overall mortality. CB is caused by overproduction and hypersecretion of mucus by goblet cells, which leads to worsening airflow obstruction by luminal obstruction of small airways, epithelial remodeling, and alteration of airway surface tension predisposing to collapse. Despite its clinical sequelae, little is known about the pathophysiology of CB and goblet cell hyperplasia in COPD, and treatment options are limited. In addition, it is becoming increasingly apparent that in the classic COPD spectrum, with emphysema on one end and CB on the other, most patients lie somewhere in the middle. It is known now that many patients with severe emphysema can develop CB, and small airway pathology has been linked to worse clinical outcomes, such as increased mortality and lesser improvement in lung function after lung volume reduction surgery. However, in recent years, a greater understanding of the importance of CB as a phenotype to identify patients with a beneficial response to therapy has been described. Herein we review the epidemiology of CB, the evidence behind its clinical consequences, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of goblet cell hyperplasia in COPD, and current therapies for CB.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^117WmX5o]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) is addressed by a CHEST Expert Panel through a systematic review focusing on adult patients, key diagnostic and treatment questions, and development of guideline suggestions. Chronic cough due to CB is described as causing significant impairment in quality of life, and the review examined whether features of the history suggest cough‑phlegm syndrome is due to CB, whether treatment of stable CB can improve or eliminate chronic cough, and whether therapy targeting cough due to CB can prevent or reduce acute CB exacerbations. Studies of adult CB populations were included and assessed for relevance and quality, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on using CHEST methodology, and the search strategy used varied descriptors and assessments to identify studies. The conclusions state that the evidence supporting management of chronic cough due to CB is limited overall and of low quality, and that the article provides guidance by presenting suggestions based on currently available evidence while identifying gaps and areas for future research. The report is endorsed by the American Association for Respiratory Care.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^113ptkgp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated.3. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112cKeqV]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of Cough: part 2. demographic and clinical considerations: CHEST expert panel report [^1148Zbhq]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough characteristics vary between patients, and this can impact clinical diagnosis and care. The purpose of part two of this state-of-the-art review is to update the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on global physiology and pathophysiology of cough.

Study Design and Methods

A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019 using prespecified search terms.

Results

We describe the demographics of typical patients with cough in the clinical setting, including how cough characteristics change across age. We summarize the effect of common clinical conditions impacting cough mechanics and the physical properties of mucus on airway clearance.

Interpretation

This is the second of a two-part update to the 2006 CHEST cough guideline; it complements part one on basic phenomenology of cough by providing an extended clinical picture of cough along with the factors that alter cough mechanics and efficiency in patients. A greater understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of cough will improve clinical management.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^117PueHE]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^116uRvT4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

New Definition of COPD

The definition of a disease should only include the characteristics that distinguish it from other diseases. Accordingly, GOLD 2023 proposes a new definition of COPD that, at variance with previous documents, focuses exclusively on these characteristics, separately from its epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria that are discussed on their own.

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111VEuCv]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic bronchitis in COPD — using the classic description, chronic bronchitis (CB) is defined as chronic cough and sputum production for at least 3 months per year for two consecutive years, in the absence of other conditions that can explain these symptoms, and with this definition the prevalence of CB ranges from 27–35% in large observational studies in patients with COPD. Factors associated with increased prevalence of CB in COPD include male sex, younger age, greater pack-years of smoking, more severe airflow obstruction, rural location and increased occupational exposures, and although smoking is the primary risk, 4–22% of CB is found in never smokers. Additional exposures that may be important include dusts, biomass fuels, chemical fumes or domestic heating and cooking fuels, and gastroesophageal reflux is also associated with an increased incidence of CB.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1128uXE6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis background and prior evidence indicate that currently, the diagnosis is clinical with emphasis on excluding differential diagnoses, and the CHEST 2006 guidelines recommended that acute bronchitis be diagnosed only if there was no evidence of pneumonia, the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD. Previous retrospective cohort studies found that at initial presentation just over one-third would also meet criteria for asthma, and that 3 years after diagnosis 34% fulfilled criteria for either asthma or chronic bronchitis; in a retrospective study of 46 patients with at least two similar physician-diagnosed episodes of acute bronchitis, 65% episodes were found to have mild asthma. It is not known whether routine ordering of investigations such as chest x-rays, sputum cultures, or serum inflammatory markers at initial presentation adds value, and although acute bronchitis is considered self-limiting, there remains data to suggest that practitioners frequently prescribe both antibiotics and other medication.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^115ZLpNh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1146M1eL]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — definition, evidence, and panel suggestions are as follows: Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria, and this study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo, while no eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner, and if the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Respiratory symptoms and obstructive pulmonary disease in a population aged over 70 years [^116QYRoL]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Question

What is the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and obstructive pulmonary disease by age, sex, and smoking history in a population aged 70 years and older? What is the association between selected comorbidities and obstructive pulmonary disease?

Patients and Methods

A questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and disease, selected comorbidities, and smoking history was mailed to a cross-sectional, sex- and age-stratified, random sample of the population 70 years and older of Bergen, Norway.

Results

About 11% of these elderly persons reported having at least one current obstructive pulmonary disease, 8% reported daily wheezing, and 12% reported significant dyspnea. The only respiratory symptom or disorder to show any clear age-related pattern was dyspnea, which increased through age 89 before declining. Dyspnea, current asthma, and current chronic bronchitis were about half as likely in males as females, after adjusting for smoking pack-years. Persons with obstructive pulmonary disease reported problems with walking, heart disease, and muscle/joint disease more frequently than those without.

Conclusions

The prevalence of respiratory symptoms and obstructive pulmonary disease has been estimated. Only dyspnea was associated with age in this elderly population. Female sex was a predictor of dyspnea, current asthma, and current chronic bronchitis.

### Is co-morbidity taken into account in the antibiotic management of elderly patients with acute bronchitis and COPD exacerbations? [^114By5hM]. Family Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on acute lower respiratory tract infections recommend restrictive use of antibiotics, however, in patients with relevant co-morbid conditions treatment with antibiotics should be considered. Presently, it is unknown whether GPs adhere to these guidelines and target antibiotic treatment more often at patients with risk-elevating conditions.

Objectives

We assessed whether in elderly primary care patients with acute bronchitis or exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease (COPD), antibiotics are more often prescribed to patients with risk-elevating co-morbid conditions.

Methods

Using the Utrecht GP research database, we analysed 2643 episodes in patients of 65 years of age or older with a GP-diagnosed acute bronchitis or exacerbation of COPD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to determine independent determinants of antibiotic use.

Results

Antibiotic prescribing rates were high in both acute bronchitis (84%) and in exacerbations of COPD (53%). In acute bronchitis, only age was an independent determinant of antibiotic use [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003–1.048], whereas in exacerbations of COPD antibiotics were more often prescribed to male patients (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.5), patients with diabetes (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.4) and heart failure (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.7).

Conclusion

Dutch GPs prescribe antibiotics in the majority of elderly patients with acute bronchitis and in half of the episodes of exacerbations of COPD. Tailoring their antibiotic treatment according to the presence or absence of high-risk co-morbid conditions could help GPs in improving antibiotic use in patients with respiratory tract infections in primary care.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^112FbK2C]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory infections in primary care, and in more than 90% of the cases antibiotics are prescribed, mainly when purulent expectoration is present. However, this process is usually viral in origin and the benefits of antibiotic treatment are marginal. On the other hand, in recent years bronchitis has been considered more as an inflammatory than an infectious process. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a schedule of an oral anti-inflammatory compared with an antibiotic regimen and another group assigned to receive a placebo.

Methods and Design

A total of 420 patients from 15 to 70 years of age with no associated comorbidity, presenting respiratory tract infection of at least one week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptom, the presence of purulent expectoration and at least one other symptom of the respiratory tract (dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort or pain), with no alternative explanation such as pneumonia, will be included in a prospective, randomised and controlled, clinical trial with placebo. The patients will be randomised to receive one of three treatments: ibuprofen, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid or placebo for 10 days. The main outcome measure is the number of days with frequent cough defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more.

Discussion

This trial is designed to evaluate the number of days with frequent cough with anti-inflammatory treatment compared with antimicrobial treatment and placebo in previously healthy patients with a clinical picture of acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration. It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory treatment is more effective than antibiotic treatment to reduce cough, which is the most disturbing symptom for patients with this infection.

### Characteristics and phenotypes of a COPD cohort from referral hospital clinics in Uganda [^114CtDej]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterised by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, cough, expectoration and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.COPD is the third leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, with 90% of these deaths occurring in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2019, 3.3 million deaths and 74.4 million DALYs were attributed to COPD. Furthermore, the COPD burden is projected to keep increasing due to increased ageing of the population and continued exposure to risk factors.COPD is a complex syndrome with numerous pulmonary and extrapulmonary components. It is not yet clearly known how different patterns of exposures affect the clinical presentation, physiology, imaging, response to therapy, lung function decline and survival. Recent research in COPD has been aimed at better understanding the heterogeneity across different groups of patient with COPD and phenotyping patients with COPD for better understanding of this condition. These phenotypes are also aimed at categorising those with similar clinical characteristics and their response to treatments, to better guide management approaches.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Is C-reactive protein testing useful to predict outcome in patients with acute bronchitis? [^112CV6vC]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A recent clinical trial could not find differences between anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics and placebo in shortening the duration of symptoms in acute bronchitis.

Objectives

To investigate if C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at presentation are predictive of symptom resolution in these patients.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of the data from a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial carried out in primary care. Patients from 18 to 70 years of age presenting a respiratory tract infection of < 1 week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptom and the presence of discoloured expectoration, were enrolled in the study. On the baseline visit, CRP was determined in capillary blood and a five-item symptom diary was given. Patients were followed up to 30 days. The main outcome measure was the number of days with persistent cough.

Results

A total of 312 subjects fulfilled all the criteria for the efficacy analysis and had undergone the CRP test; of these, 56.4% presented a CRP value < 8 mg/l and 76% presented < 20 mg/l. There were no significant differences in the median duration of cough: 10 days among patients with CRP concentrations < 8 mg/l [95% confidence interval (CI): 8–11 days], 11 days among those with concentrations ranging from 8 to 19 mg/l (95% CI: 8–16) and 11 days in those with CRP > 20 mg/l (95% CI: 9–12) (P = 0.337).

Conclusion

Among patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum, the CRP concentrations at presentation are not helpful for predicting symptom resolution.

### Uncommon causes of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113kTWMT]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the uncommon causes of cough.

Design/Methodology

An English language literature search by MEDLINE citations from 1975 through 2004 was used to identify publications on uncommon pulmonary and nonpulmonary disorders in which cough was present as the major or presenting symptom in > 50% of those persons affected by the uncommon diseases.

Results

A substantial number of uncommon or rare pulmonary and nonpulmonary disorders were identified. The uncommon occurrence of these diseases made it difficult to develop a meaningful evidence-based guideline to the diagnosis and therapy of many of the uncommon causes of cough. As cough was the major or presenting symptom, it was usually initially attributed to common respiratory diseases (eg, asthma or bronchitis). As a result, a substantial time lag existed from the onset of cough to the diagnosis of the etiologic entity. Diagnostic tests limited to the respiratory system did not always provide clues to the diagnosis of uncommon causes of cough.

Conclusions

Cough is the major or presenting symptom in many uncommon pulmonary and nonpulmonary disorders. A strong index of suspicion is essential to consider and diagnose the uncommon causes of cough. The diagnosis and management of cough in patients with uncommon causes of cough is dependent on the underlying etiology.

### Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review [^114hV1Pb]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Assessment of exacerbation risk: what do guidelines say?

COPD guidelines have historically just used lung function to grade the severity of disease, and guide treatment strategies. A more complex approach has been adopted recently, incorporating other clinical features to define clinical phenotypes. A phenotype is defined as "a single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death)". The aim of phenotyping is to enable identification of patient groups that have distinctive prognostic or therapeutic characteristics, thereby enabling a personalized approach to treatment.

The definition of the "frequent exacerbator" phenotype, based on findings from the ECLIPSE study, has been incorporated into many COPD guidelines. Current GOLD strategy advocates assessment of exacerbation risk by: (i) GOLD spirometric classification, with GOLD 3 and 4 indicating high risk; or (ii) a history of exacerbations, with ≥ 2 exacerbations (or ≥ 1 exacerbation leading to hospitalization) in the previous year indicating high risk. GOLD subdivides patients into four categories, A, B, C or D, on the basis of symptoms and risk, with the aim of using this clinical assessment to make treatment decisions. Guidelines differ in how the risk of future exacerbations is assessed (see Additional file 1: Table S2), with a previous history of exacerbations being a common feature of many, but other characteristics such as FEV₁ included in some, but not all, guidelines, e.g. Spanish GesEPOC and the Saudi Thoracic Society. In fact, the Spanish (GesEPOC) guidelines have adopted a different approach to other national guidelines. Four clinical phenotypes are defined: non-exacerbators (< 2 exacerbations/year), an asthma-COPD overlap syndrome phenotype (ACOS), and two groups of frequent exacerbators (≥ 2 exacerbations/year), specifically exacerbators with emphysema and exacerbators with chronic bronchitis. Importantly, patients with ACOS experience more frequent and severe exacerbations, as well as worse disease-related quality of life, compared with patients having COPD.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical term which implies a self-limiting infection of the large airways and is characterized by clinical manifestations of cough without pneumonia. This process affects approximately 5% of adults annually with a greater incidence in the winter. It accounts for 9.4% of the infections attended by family physicians. Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsies have never demonstrated bacterial invasion. In some cases atypical germs may be involved including Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia.

It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response to infections of the epithelium of the bronchi. Microscopic examination demonstrates a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These pathological findings are consistent with publications of proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography. During the first days of infection, the symptoms of upper respiratory infections cannot be clinically distinguished from the symptoms of acute bronchitis. However, in acute bronchitis cough lasts more than five days and during this prolonged period of symptoms, the results of functional respiratory tests are usually abnormal. Forty per cent of the patients present significant reductions in forced espiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) with values of less than 80% over the theoretical value, or bronchial hyper-reactivity with improvement during the following 5–6 weeks. Cough may persist from 10 to 20 days in acute bronchitis, but it may sometimes last up to 4 weeks or more. In a recent study on the efficacy of the acellular pertussis vaccine including 2,781 healthy adults, the mean duration of cough in acute bronchitis by all causes was 18 days, with a median of 24 days. Moreover, almost half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent expectoration. Peroxidase released by the leukocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Indeed, in healthy adults, the positive predictive value of purulent sputum for the presence of alveolar disease is low, being of approximately 10%.

Bronchitis has shown to reduce the quality of life of patients. One study on the quality of life of patients with infections of the upper respiratory tract, some of which were labelled acute bronchitis, showed a reduction in seven subscales of the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey, including vital and social function, although this decrease was transitory. Furthermore, up to twenty per cent of the patients return to their physician within the first month for the persistence of symptoms.

### How accurate is the self-reported diagnosis of chronic bronchitis? [^1119rHez]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although it is defined as cough and sputum production for at least 3 months per year for at least 2 consecutive years, difficulties exist in the use of the term chronic bronchitis for clinical diagnosis. In particular, the relationship between diagnosis and symptoms has been difficult to ascertain.

Study Objectives

To determine, in a large epidemiologic study, the degree to which a new self-reported diagnosis of chronic bronchitis (NCBR) satisfies the symptom criteria for that diagnosis, and to determine the relationship between self-reported physician-confirmed diagnoses and symptom criteria.

Methods

We analyzed data obtained from the Tucson Epidemiologic Study of Obstructive Lung Diseases. Using responses to standardized respiratory questionnaires administered to 4,034 subjects, those with NCBRs were selected and assessed as to whether they met symptom criteria for that diagnosis. Descriptive statistics pertaining to gender, age, and smoking status were obtained. Furthermore, we determined how often symptom criteria were met among a subset of subjects with physician-confirmed self-reported diagnoses.

Results

Of 481 subjects with NCBRs, only 56 subjects (11.6%) met the required symptom criteria. Men compared with women and current smokers compared with ex-smokers or neversmokers were more likely to meet symptom criteria. Four hundred fifteen of 481 subjects with NCBRs had physician-confirmed self-reported diagnoses. Of these, only 52 subjects (12.5%) met symptom criteria. Within the subgroup of subjects who met symptom criteria, higher percentages were observed in the older age groups, but this was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Only a minority of subjects with NCBRs satisfy the symptom criteria of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months per year for at least 2 consecutive years. This relationship holds true even among those with physician-confirmed self-reported diagnoses.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^113wvMtz]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis implies a self limiting infection of the large airways and is characterised by cough without pneumonia. It is a prevalent disease and one of the most common reasons for visits in primary care. Patients often return to their doctor or seek other medical help as symptoms may persist for two or three weeks, mainly cough, which may be bothersome for some patients and could last for up to four weeks or more.

Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsy samples have never shown bacterial invasion. It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response of the epithelium of the bronchi to infections. Microscopic examination shows a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These findings are consistent with proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography.

### Chest cold (acute bronchitis) basics… [^115JpTfU]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cough keeping you up at night. Soreness in your chest and feeling tired. You could have a chest cold, often called acute bronchitis.
- A virus usually causes chest colds.
- Antibiotics will not help you get better if you have a chest cold.
- If you're healthy without heart or lung problems or a weakened immune system, this information is for you. Overview
- A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include:

- Soreness in the chest
- Feeling tired
- Mild headache
- Mild body aches
- Sore throat. When to seek medical care
- Temperature of 100. 4 °F or higher.
- Cough with bloody mucus.
- Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.
- Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks.
- Repeated episodes of bronchitis. This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. Talk to a healthcare provider right away. Treatment Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own — without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death. How to feel better
- Get plenty of rest.
- Drink plenty of fluids.
- Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.
- Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose.
- For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus.
- Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower.
- Use throat lozenges or cough drops.

Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age.
- Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Kxyq1]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis" for acute bronchitis.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this common respiratory condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby guiding appropriate treatment and management strategies.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis are based on four key components. The first component is the presence of symptoms indicative of an acute respiratory infection, predominantly cough, with or without sputum production. The second component is the duration of these symptoms, which should be less than three weeks. The third component involves ruling out pneumonia, both clinically and radiographically, as the cause of the cough. The final component requires the exclusion of other potential causes of the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered likely if all four components are met. Conversely, if these criteria are not fully met, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the clinical assessment of patients presenting with cough and other symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection, helping to distinguish acute bronchitis from other respiratory conditions.

The diagnostic criteria for determining the likelihood of acute bronchitis involve assessing four key factors. The diagnostic tool articulates these factors as follows:

- Symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, specifically a cough, with or without sputum production.
- Symptoms persisting for less than 3 weeks.
- Exclusion of pneumonia as the cause of the cough, established through clinical evaluation and radiographic evidence.
- Elimination of other potential causes for the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

For evaluating the likelihood of acute bronchitis, the diagnostic process simplifies to checking each of these criteria. If all four criteria are confirmed as true, it suggests that acute bronchitis is likely. Conversely, if any of these criteria are not met, the likelihood of acute bronchitis is considered improbable.

This structured approach aids in distinguishing acute bronchitis from other conditions that might present similar respiratory symptoms, providing a clear pathway for diagnosis based on clinical markers and exclusions.

### Classification and approach to bronchiolar diseases [^113tSexM]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchiolar abnormalities are relatively common and occur in a variety of clinical contexts. There have been an increasing number of terms, some of which are redundant, used in referring to various forms of bronchiolar disorders. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated classification scheme to facilitate the clinical approach to patients with suspected bronchiolar disease.

Recent Findings

The spectrum of bronchiolar disorders is broader and more heterogeneous than previously recognized. In deciphering the potential significance of bronchiolar abnormalities, it is useful to distinguish those disorders in which the bronchiolar involvement is the dominant pathologic process, that is, primary bronchiolar disorders, from parenchymal or large airway diseases in which the bronchioles may become secondarily involved. Primary bronchiolar disorders include respiratory bronchiolitis, acute bronchiolitis, constrictive bronchiolitis, follicular bronchiolitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, mineral dust airway disease, and a few other variants. Interstitial lung diseases with a prominent bronchiolar involvement include smoking-related interstitial lung diseases, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Bronchiolitis can also be seen in large airway diseases such as chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and asthma.

Summary

In the clinical approach to a patient with bronchiolar disease, primary bronchiolar disorders should be distinguished from predominantly parenchymal or large airway processes with bronchiolar involvement. The number of patterns of bronchiolar response to injury is limited and these patterns are generally non-specific in regard to cause. Appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with bronchiolar disorders depend on judicious correlation of clinical, physiologic, and morphologic manifestations.

### Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113t7aCp]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchi that is manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, this is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "chronic bronchitis", and "COPD".

Results

The most effective way to reduce or eliminate cough in patients with chronic bronchitis and persistent exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards is avoidance. Therapy with a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral theophylline, and a combined regimen of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid may improve cough in patients with chronic bronchitis, but there is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, expectorants, postural drainage, or chest physiotherapy. For the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids (or in severe cases IV corticosteroids) are useful, but their effects on cough have not been systematically evaluated. Therapy with expectorants, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy, and theophylline is not recommended. Central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing.

Conclusions

Chronic bronchitis due to cigarette smoking or other exposures to inhaled noxious agents is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in the general population. The most effective way to eliminate cough is the avoidance of all respiratory irritants. When cough persists despite the removal of these inciting agents, there are effective agents to reduce or eliminate cough.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1156nhgo]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

### Eosinophilic bronchitis: clinical manifestations and implications for treatment [^111jcJAW]. Thorax (2002). Low credibility.

Airway inflammation with eosinophils is now reported to occur not only in asthma but in other airway diseases such as cough variant asthma, chronic cough, atopic cough, episodic symptoms without asthma, allergic rhinitis, and COPD. Although the prevalence of eosinophilic bronchitis (EB) is less than in asthma, the causes, mechanisms and treatment of EB in these conditions appears to be similar to asthma where allergen induced IL-5 secretion and symptoms are readily responsive to inhaled corticosteroids. The prognosis of EB without asthma is not known but it may be a precursor for asthma and, if so, recognition of this syndrome may permit effective treatment and reduction in the rising prevalence of asthma. Induced sputum analysis allows recognition of EB in clinical practice. The place of the asthma treatment paradigm with early and sustained corticosteroid treatment needs to be defined in EB without asthma. Airway wall remodelling can occur in rhinitis, COPD, and cough variant asthma with EB. The mechanisms and long term implications of this complication in EB without asthma need to be clarified.

### Prospective study of the incidence, aetiology and outcome of adult lower respiratory tract illness in the community [^115ZktcZ]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lower respiratory tract illness in previously well adults is usually labelled as acute bronchitis and treated with antibiotics without establishing the aetiology. Viral infection is thought to be the cause in most cases. We have investigated the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of this condition.

Methods

Previously well adults from a stable suburban population consulting over one year with a lower respiratory tract illness were studied. For the first six months detailed investigations identified predetermined direct and indirect markers of infection. Evidence of infection was assessed in relation to presenting clinical features, indirect markers of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome.

Results

Consultations were very common, particularly in younger women (70/1000 per year in previously well women aged 16–39 years), mainly in the winter months; 638 patients consulted, of whom 316 were investigated. Pathogens were identified in 173 (55%) cases: bacteria in 82 (Streptococcus pneumoniae 54, Haemophilus influenzae 31, Moraxella catarrhalis 7), atypical organisms in 75 (Chlamydia pneumoniae 55, Mycoplasma pneumoniae 23), and viruses in 61 (influenza 23). Seventy nine (24%) had indirect evidence of infection. Bacterial and atypical infection correlated with changes in the chest radiograph and high levels of C reactive protein but not with (a) the GP's clinical assessment of whether infection was present, (b) clinical features other than focal chest signs, and (c) outcome, whether or not appropriate antibiotics were prescribed.

Conclusions

Over 50% of patients have direct and/or indirect evidence of infection, most commonly bacterial and atypical pathogens, but the outcome is unrelated to the identified pathogens. Many patients improve without antibiotics and investigations do not help in the management of these patients. GPs can reassure patients of the causes and usual outcome of this self-limiting condition.

### Mortality in GOLD stages of COPD and its dependence on symptoms of chronic bronchitis [^115TNrJw]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Diseases (GOLD) guidelines were published in 2001, and revised in 2004 with the aim of increasing awareness of COPD and of decreasing morbidity and mortality from the disease. The GOLD staging system for COPD introduces a stage 0 (at risk), defined as the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms such as productive cough in individuals with preserved normal pulmonary function. The importance of the "at risk" stage, especially the effect of productive cough on morbidity and mortality, is an issue under debate. To assess prognosis in patients with established COPD, the BODE-index for prediction of mortality (based on degree of airflow limitation, dyspnea, 6 min walking distance and body mass index) has been developed. The BODE index is probably less helpful in the early stages of COPD when individuals may have no symptoms or symptoms of chronic bronchitis only ("smoker's cough"), regarded by most individuals (and physicians) as innocent symptoms. Contrary to this view, some previous studies have shown an increased mortality risk associated with symptoms of chronic bronchitis.

We hypothesized that chronic productive cough (symptoms of chronic bronchitis) could predict an increased mortality risk. The aims of this study were firstly to investigate all-cause mortality risks in relation to GOLD stages 0–4 with special focus on stage 0. Secondly, the effect of symptoms of chronic bronchitis on mortality risks in GOLD stages 1–4 was also assessed.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics between chronic bronchitis and non-chronic bronchitis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112cGNLt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study compared clinical characteristics between non-CB patients and CB patients. Consistent with previous studies, we found that CB patients had poorer respiratory, exercise capacity, and psychological scores; reduced lung function; and more frequent exacerbations. Regression analysis showed that CB patients had more frequent moderate-to-severe exacerbations than did non-CB patients, based on a 1-year follow-up assessment. Using different CAT score cut-off scores, we distinguished mild CB from severe CB, then compared the clinical features of these two groups. Patients with severe CB had higher respiratory, exercise capacity, and psychological scores. At the 1-year follow-up assessment, patients with severe CB had more frequent severe exacerbations, as determined in a regression model. These results highlight the need for physicians to carefully monitor patients with severe symptoms.

### Impact of bronchitis variability on outcomes of COPD [^115mZTSa]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

In our analysis, changes in bronchitis status did not significantly correlate with the rate of decline in lung function as measured by FEV₁ and FVC. This lack of significant correlation is in contrast to the findings of several previous studies supporting a more pronounced impact of CB on lung function deterioration. The discrepancy between these findings and ours may be attributable to various factors, including differences in the study population, duration of follow-up or methodological approaches. While previous studies have often focused on populations with severe COPD or longer durations to capture more pronounced effects of CB on lung function, our study enrolled a broader COPD population over a shorter interval, which may not have been sufficient to detect more subtle or long-term changes.

Our study additionally shows that bronchitis status in COPD patients may fluctuate, and those with IB are at greater risk of exacerbations compared with those with NB. Regular monitoring of respiratory symptoms, including cough and sputum, is crucial to identify patients at high risk and in need of close monitoring and intervention.

There are several limitations to consider. First, the KOCOSS cohort mainly includes patients who were evaluated and treated at tertiary hospitals, which might limit the accurate representation of the overall COPD population. Second, the CAT-based definition of CB has only been validated in the Asian population, so additional research is required to establish its generalisability. Nevertheless, the CAT questionnaire is widely recognised as a universal tool for assessing quality of life in patients with COPD. Third, the duration of our study may not have been sufficient to detect longer-term trends in lung function decline or the full impact of bronchitis status changes. Finally, most patients in the KOCOSS cohort were male, and the results may be influenced by the sex distribution. Despite these limitations, we identified the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with varying bronchitis symptoms over 1 year, which has not been broadly reported. Another strength of this study is that we tracked bronchitis status as assessed by CAT score throughout the study period.

In conclusion, this study analysed the clinical implications of IB status in patients with COPD. Our analysis revealed that patients with CB exhibited the worst baseline symptoms and lung function and the highest rates of moderate-to-severe exacerbations, while those with IB showed worse outcomes compared with patients with NB. Although we found no significant differences in lung function decline rates across the groups, the increased risk of exacerbations in patients with IB emphasises the importance of close monitoring and intervention in this subgroup.

### Childhood' bronchitis' and respiratory outcomes in middle-age: a prospective cohort study from age 7 to 53 years [^115PsNC2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our findings suggest associations between childhood 'bronchitis' and doctor-diagnosed pneumonia and asthma in adulthood, especially evident for the recurrent-protracted subgroup, with trends across the spectrum of cough severity. The elevation of lung gas transfer in middle-age for this recurrent-protracted group is interesting and may be explained by asthma, chronic vascular changes and/or mild bronchiectasis; where possible, replication in other similar cohorts and further research to establish its clinical significance is warranted. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the potential natural history of severe bronchitis in children. Importantly, they support initiatives to enhance awareness among primary care physicians to promote the timely diagnosis and management of protracted episodes of cough in children with close monitoring for subsequent development of asthma and other complications such as bronchiectasis.

### Beyond bronchitis: a review of the congenital and acquired abnormalities of the bronchus [^111xTiVo]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

Bronchial disorders are both congenital and acquired in aetiology. Acquired bronchial disorders can often be subdivided into one of three categories based on imaging findings: wall thickening, dilatation/bronchiectasis, and obstruction/stenosis. It is the role of the radiologist to recognise these imaging patterns and provide an accurate differential diagnosis tailored to a patient's clinical situation to assist the ordering physician in patient management.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1124oGih]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — diagnostic testing suggestions state that for immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, "we suggest no routine investigation with chest x-ray, spirometry, peak flow measurement, sputum for microbial culture, respiratory tract samples for viral PCR, serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement)". For persistent or worsening cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, "we suggest that the patient is advised to seek reassessment and targeted investigation(s) be considered (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement)", with remarks noting targeted investigations could include chest x-ray, sputum for microbial culture, peak expiratory flow rate(s), complete blood count, and inflammatory markers such as CRP.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^116yCD45]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — summary of suggestions indicates that for cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine investigation with chest x-ray, spirometry, peak flow measurement, sputum for microbial culture, respiratory tract samples for viral PCR, serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, we suggest that the patient is advised to seek reassessment and targeted investigation(s) be considered (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and suggested targeted investigations could include chest x-ray, sputum for microbial culture, peak expiratory flow rate recording(s), complete blood count and inflammatory markers such as CRP. For cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and differential diagnoses such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Beyond bronchitis: a review of the congenital and acquired abnormalities of the bronchus [^11248PQN]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The bronchi are the main branching components of the conduction zone in the respiratory system serving as the anatomical bridge between the trachea and the bronchioles. Anomalies of the bronchus can be both congenital and acquired. While congenital bronchial abnormalities are often secondary to anatomic variation, acquired bronchial disorders as well as some congenital conditions can typically be divided into three broad categories based on imaging findings: bronchial wall thickening, dilatation/bronchiectasis, and obstruction/stenosis. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, the clinical presentation of bronchial disease tends to be non-specific with complaints typically including cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Patients with both acute and long-standing symptoms of bronchial disease often undergo diagnostic imaging for further evaluation, making awareness of this topic critical. In addition, some forms of bronchial pathology are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and are discovered incidentally on imaging performed for other indications. A schematic review of bronchial pathology is presented in Fig. 1.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — definition and distinguishing features: COPD comprises a combination of chronic and slowly progressive respiratory disorders including emphysema, small airway disease, and chronic bronchitis, is described clinically as persistent respiratory symptoms with significant airflow limitation as measured by reduced maximal expiratory flow during forced exhalation, and is characterized by incomplete reversibility of airway obstruction, which may differ from asthma where airway obstruction is commonly reversible with bronchodilators.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and antibiotics: what studies are still needed? [^114k3YFH]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) remains the subject of controversy despite considerable medical and socioeconomic implications. First, the contribution of bacterial infection to AECBs is difficult to assess in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are chronically colonized with respiratory pathogens. In addition, several studies suggest a major role of viral infections in AECBs. Secondly, it is unlikely that all COPD patients will benefit from antibiotics during AECBs. In particular, the benefit in mild COPD remains uncertain. Unfortunately, the number of studies complying with evidence-based medicine requirements is too small for definite recommendations in AECBs to be drawn up. Considering the impact of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, as well as the community, and the impact of antibiotic therapy on the development of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for the design of appropriate multicentric studies to define the usefulness of this type of treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

### Variability of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease key epidemiological data in Europe: systematic review [^117Sqxbm]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Surveys based on symptoms (cough and expectoration on most days for as much as three months per year and for at least two successive years) were used to estimate the prevalence of chronic bronchitis (initial stage of COPD). This prevalence ranged from 2.6% to 9.5% in adults under 44 years of age. Major variability was noted across European countries, with prevalence rates ranging from 0.7% to 9.7% (median, 2.6%) in a study covering 16 countries. There were also significant regional differences within a given country. The prevalence of chronic bronchitis is reported to be significantly lower among women than among men in all countries (2.8% versus 3.7%; P < 0.001). The prevalence increased gradually from nonsmokers to "moderate-heavy" smokers (≥ 15 packs-yrs) and from higher socioeconomic classes to the unemployed and blue-collar workers.

### Mortality in GOLD stages of COPD and its dependence on symptoms of chronic bronchitis [^116Zwv2i]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Implications of our findings

We believe that symptoms of chronic bronchitis should be regarded as a marker for an increased all-cause mortality risk. Our data show that among middle-aged smokers, symptoms of chronic bronchitis might represent an independent risk factor for an early mortality equal to that of having moderate COPD.

It is however uncertain from previous studies whether symptoms of chronic bronchitis really are related to the development and progression of COPD. An increased risk of COPD mortality associated with chronic mucus hyper secretion among individuals with established COPD has been shown previously. In our study, symptoms of chronic bronchitis increased the risk of all cause mortality and mortality in cancer, lung cancer and other causes in smoking individuals with normal lung function (stage 0) and the risk of total mortality in individuals with GOLD stage 1 and 2. Our findings indicate that symptoms of chronic bronchitis might be an independent pulmonary disorder that may or may not be associated with COPD. It is therefore questionable whether GOLD stage 0 should be used as an "at risk" stage for COPD development in future COPD classifications.

Finally, GOLD stage 0 indicates a group of individuals with a very unfavourable prognosis similar to that of individuals with GOLD stage 2. Among smokers, symptoms of chronic bronchitis contributed to an adverse prognosis not only in individuals "at risk", but also in those with early stages of COPD with GOLD 1 and 2.
