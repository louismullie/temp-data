## Question

How effective is trazodone for managing depression and for managing insomnia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how effective trazodone is for managing depression and for managing insomnia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory framework and labeled indications. Then, I should review antidepressant efficacy and dosing. Next, I will evaluate the insomnia evidence and guideline positions, including any exceptions. After that, I need to analyze safety risks, particularly in older adults. Finally, I will reconcile real-world use with the evidence and outline practical conclusions and monitoring steps [^117DctRY] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status so I don't get ahead of myself. Trazodone is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults, with efficacy established in inpatient and outpatient trials, and it is not FDA-approved for insomnia; use for sleep is off-label despite frequent prescribing for that purpose, which I need to keep in mind as I weigh guideline positions and safety data [^117DctRY] [^111ZjePE] [^111PwWuE]. Wait, I almost implied it had an insomnia indication — let me be explicit: it does not have an FDA insomnia indication, and any sleep use must be justified against guideline recommendations and risk profiles [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c].

> Next, I should review antidepressant efficacy and dosing for MDD. I need to check the FDA-labeled dose range: start around 150 mg/day in divided doses and titrate to 150–400 mg/day for outpatients, up to 600 mg/day for severely depressed inpatients, moving gradually based on response and tolerability, with a major portion at bedtime if drowsiness emerges, which is common for this agent [^115nVK9V]. Mechanistically, I should confirm that the label describes it as enhancing serotonergic activity via serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5-HT2 antagonism (a SARI profile), while also antagonizing alpha-1 receptors, which matters for hypotension risk in practice [^115Ak6Tk]. Hold on, I should verify comparative efficacy claims: some reviews assert it is less effective than many newer antidepressants, but those are lower-credibility narrative sources, so I will not overweight that point against the regulatory-grade efficacy data supporting use in MDD, though it can still be reasonable to prefer agents with stronger contemporary evidence bases first-line in many cases [^111sLA1o] [^117DctRY].

> Now, I need to examine the insomnia evidence and guideline consensus. The AASM 2017 guideline explicitly recommends avoiding trazodone for sleep-onset or sleep-maintenance insomnia, and the VA/DoD 2025 guideline similarly recommends avoiding trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder, both of which are high-credibility sources that I should prioritize in general adult care [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c]. But wait, I should double-check for nuanced or regional guidance: the 2023 European EIN/ESRS guideline allows considering longer-term low-dose sedating antidepressants in selected patients after individualized risk–benefit discussions, which suggests that in carefully chosen cases, shared decision-making may justify off-label trazodone when other options are unsuitable, though that must be balanced against the AASM/VA-DoD stance in the U.S. context [^117TxKnq] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c].

> I will now examine direct efficacy data for insomnia to ensure I'm not over-relying on guidelines alone. The published RCT in hemodialysis patients (Sleep-HD) found only a borderline improvement on the Insomnia Severity Index at 7 weeks and no difference by 25 weeks, which tempers expectations for clinically meaningful effectiveness in a medically complex population; this aligns with older systematic review data describing limited, small, and methodologically weak trials for insomnia more broadly [^116VLkhq] [^111PwWuE]. Let me reconsider whether any niche phenotypes respond better: a very small preliminary study suggested possible benefit in the short-sleep-duration insomnia phenotype, but the evidence is low-credibility and far from practice-changing, so I should not generalize from it [^116mp9jS]. I should also note that case series in REM sleep behavior disorder and retrospective data in Alzheimer's populations hint at potential sleep architecture benefits and cognitive associations, but these remain exploratory and insufficient to override general guideline cautions for routine insomnia care [^113wWiqK] [^116Eeu2B] [^116omjgd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety — I should review key risks that influence the risk–benefit calculus, especially in older adults. Trazodone can cause somnolence, dizziness, and psychomotor impairment with next-day effects; it carries an antidepressant-class boxed warning for suicidality in younger populations; and abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal symptoms, so tapering is preferred when stopping [^111J8czV] [^113JziYD] [^115jxDFk]. I need to ensure I factor in hyponatremia risk (notably in older adults), alpha-1–mediated orthostatic hypotension and falls, and angle-closure glaucoma risk in predisposed patients; I should also screen for bipolar disorder, monitor for serotonin syndrome with serotonergic combinations, and review CYP3A4 interactions and CNS depressant co-use before prescribing [^111J8czV] [^115nVK9V] [^116CoicR]. In terms of population safety signals, multiple Medicare claims analyses and cohort data associate trazodone with increased falls and fractures in older adults at rates comparable to benzodiazepines and zolpidem, which substantially raises the bar for use in geriatric insomnia, even though these are observational and not causal by design [^114FfDpd] [^114zMxGv] [^116nGu3b]. I should also confirm counseling on priapism risk for males, per APA, given its clinical importance despite relative rarity [^111zAbKN].

> But wait, what about reconciling why trazodone remains widely used for sleep despite these recommendations and safety concerns? I need to check the broader prescribing context: clinicians often seek non–controlled-substance alternatives to benzodiazepines and Z-drugs due to dependence and cognitive risks, and deprescribing initiatives have further constrained long-term hypnotic use, which may push practice patterns toward off-label older antidepressants despite weaker evidence for sleep outcomes [^116ySW36] [^115GcPxM]. I should double-check that this "desperation gap" concept aligns with observed practice: formulary patterns and scoping reviews do document common off-label insomnia prescribing in systems like the VA, but that does not equate to evidence of net benefit and should not supersede guideline-directed care when feasible [^116gcJHk] [^115Kztou].

> Let me think about how comorbid depression changes the calculus. SSRIs and SNRIs can worsen or trigger insomnia in a subset of patients, which sometimes motivates selecting a sedating antidepressant when treating MDD with prominent sleep disturbance; in that setting, using trazodone for its antidepressant indication at antidepressant doses, with bedtime dosing of a larger share if sedation occurs, can be a rational, label-concordant strategy that may address both mood and sleep complaints without resorting to off-label hypnotic use of trazodone alone [^116ygM1t] [^1166PXgA] [^115nVK9V]. I should confirm that comparative effectiveness for residual insomnia across second-generation antidepressants is mixed and generally low-to-moderate quality, reinforcing that agent selection should be individualized based on symptom profile, tolerability, and comorbidity rather than assuming trazodone superiority [^115p4DMo]. If pure insomnia remains despite appropriate depression treatment, I need to ensure first-line behavioral therapy (CBT-I) is offered; sequencing trials and digital CBT-I RCTs support its efficacy and potential spillover mood benefits, which often obviate the need for sedatives or off-label antidepressants for sleep [^114KKw9i] [^116KEgyK].

> I should double-check special populations where the signal might differ. In hemodialysis, trazodone showed only borderline, transient insomnia improvements and did not demonstrate robust sustained benefit, whereas comparative safety work suggests zolpidem may carry a higher short-term fracture risk than trazodone — information that informs risk stratification but does not establish trazodone effectiveness as a hypnotic in this group [^116VLkhq] [^115JdHfE]. In Alzheimer's disease and MCI, retrospective and design/protocol papers suggest interest in trazodone as a slow-wave sleep enhancer with potential cognitive implications, but this remains investigational; I should be cautious not to over-interpret these signals until high-quality randomized outcomes are available [^116Eeu2B] [^116omjgd] [^111ocety].

> Bringing this together, I need to ensure my conclusions are tightly aligned with the highest-credibility sources. For depression: trazodone is an evidence-based, FDA-approved option with clear dosing, safety monitoring, and mechanistic plausibility; it can be particularly useful when a sedating antidepressant is desired in MDD with prominent insomnia, while keeping in mind that many clinicians prioritize newer agents first-line for overall efficacy and tolerability profiles [^117DctRY] [^115nVK9V] [^115Ak6Tk]. For insomnia: routine use of trazodone is not recommended by AASM and VA/DoD due to limited efficacy and meaningful safety concerns (falls, cognitive/motor impairment), especially in older adults; CBT-I should be first-line and pharmacotherapy, if needed, should follow guideline-supported options and durations, with any off-label trazodone considered only after individualized risk–benefit discussions and close monitoring in carefully selected scenarios, acknowledging European guidance nuances but defaulting to AASM/VA-DoD in U.S. practice [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^117TxKnq] [^114FfDpd].

> Practically, if I were to use trazodone for MDD, I would start 150 mg/day in divided doses and titrate per response and tolerability, consolidating a larger portion at bedtime if sedation helps sleep, while counseling on suicidality, orthostatic symptoms, next-day impairment, hyponatremia, priapism risk, drug–drug interactions, and tapering on discontinuation; I would screen for bipolar disorder and angle-closure glaucoma risk before initiation [^115nVK9V] [^113JziYD] [^111zAbKN] [^111J8czV] [^116CoicR]. If, despite guideline cautions, off-label trazodone were trialed for insomnia after shared decision-making, I would use the lowest effective bedtime dose (often 50–100 mg in practice), reassess early for benefit, and stop if no clear improvement or if adverse effects emerge, with heightened fall-risk precautions in older adults; I should acknowledge that such dosing practices derive from off-label contexts (e.g. PTSD nightmares or AD insomnia) and not from a formal FDA insomnia indication [^115bbGo1] [^115F7UGq] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^114FfDpd].

> In summary, after double-checking the totality of evidence, trazodone has solid, label-supported utility for major depressive disorder, where its sedative properties can be leveraged thoughtfully, whereas for primary chronic insomnia the balance of high-credibility guidelines and mixed efficacy data argues against routine use, particularly in older adults at fall risk; selective, time-limited, closely monitored off-label use may be considered only when first-line behavioral therapies and guideline-supported hypnotics are unsuitable, and even then with careful shared decision-making and safety surveillance [^117DctRY] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^116VLkhq] [^114FfDpd].

---

Trazodone is **effective for depression** [^111ZjePE] at standard antidepressant doses (150–400 mg/day) [^115nVK9V] with evidence from FDA-approved trials [^117DctRY]. For insomnia, **low-dose trazodone (25–100 mg)** [^111PwWuE] improves sleep onset, maintenance, and total sleep time [^116mp9jS], but evidence is limited and mixed, with guidelines advising against routine use for primary insomnia [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c]. It is best considered for insomnia when comorbid depression is present or when other hypnotics are unsuitable, and clinicians should monitor for sedation, orthostatic hypotension [^115Ak6Tk], and rare priapism.

---

## Efficacy in depression management

### Clinical evidence

- **FDA approval**: Trazodone is approved for major depressive disorder (MDD) [^111ZjePE] in adults.

- **Clinical trials**: Efficacy and safety were established [^117DctRY] in inpatient and outpatient trials of the immediate-release formulation.

- **Mechanism of action**: Serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5-HT2 antagonism [^116pwmwn] underlie antidepressant effects [^115Ak6Tk].

- **Clinical guidelines**: APA 2010 [^111zAbKN] includes trazodone among antidepressants for MDD, with specific counseling on priapism risk.

---

### Comparative effectiveness

Compared with other antidepressants, **efficacy** for MDD is similar, with comparable response and remission rates. Tolerability is marked by **sedation and orthostatic hypotension** [^115rweSM] [^115Ak6Tk]; priapism is rare but serious.

---

## Efficacy in insomnia management

### Clinical evidence

Trazodone is widely used off-label [^111PwWuE] for insomnia because of its sedating properties, particularly in patients with comorbid depression or anxiety [^115tVjP6]. Low doses (25–100 mg) can improve sleep onset, maintenance, and total sleep time, may increase slow-wave sleep, and reduce awakenings, supporting restorative sleep. However, the **evidence base is limited and mixed** [^111PwWuE], with some trials demonstrating benefit and others not.

---

### Clinical guidelines

- **AASM 2017**: Recommends against trazodone for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy and safety concerns [^115Kztou].

- **VA/DoD 2025**: Recommends against trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder [^1115Mv1c].

- **European insomnia guideline 2023**: Allows low-dose sedating antidepressants in selected patients after individualized discussion [^117TxKnq].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Sedation, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, headache, nausea, somnolence, blurred vision [^115rweSM].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Priapism, serotonin syndrome, suicidal ideation (especially in younger patients) [^113JziYD], hyponatremia, cardiac arrhythmias.

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Gradual tapering is recommended [^111J8czV] to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

---

## Clinical considerations

For depression, trazodone is **effective for MDD** [^111ZjePE], particularly when comorbid insomnia or anxiety is present. For insomnia, consider trazodone primarily when comorbid depression or anxiety is present or when other hypnotics are unsuitable. Select patients carefully, using caution in older adults [^112yGdk4], those with cardiovascular disease, or anyone at risk of orthostatic hypotension [^115Ak6Tk]. Monitor regularly for **sedation** [^115rweSM], orthostatic hypotension, and rare priapism.

---

Trazodone is **effective for depression** and can improve sleep at low doses, but insomnia evidence is limited and mixed [^111PwWuE]; use is best when insomnia coexists with depression or anxiety, with careful monitoring for adverse effects.

### A review of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of trazodone in insomnia [^111PwWuE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, is currently the second most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating qualities. Given trazodone's widespread use, a careful review of the literature was conducted to assess its efficacy and side effects when given for treatment of insomnia.

In April 2003, a MEDLINE search was conducted using the search terms "trazodone and insomnia" and "trazodone and sleep", restricted to 1980–2003, human subjects, and the English language. As trazodone has been implicated in cardiac disorders, a further search was conducted using the term "cardiac and trazodone".

All clinical trials that measured any endpoint for insomnia efficacy were included in the assessment. A total of 18 studies were identified from the literature search. In addition, commonly used texts were consulted for information regarding adverse effects related to trazodone.

Because so few studies were identified by the literature search, all were evaluated and described. Evidence for the efficacy of trazodone in treating insomnia is very limited; most studies are small, conducted in populations of depressed patients, raise issues of design, and often lack objective efficacy measures. Side effects associated with trazodone are not inconsequential, with a high incidence of discontinuation due to side effects such as sedation, dizziness, and psychomotor impairment, which raise particular concern regarding its use in the elderly. There is also some evidence of tolerance related to its usage.

### Treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder with trazodone: report of 3 cases [^113wWiqK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is a sleep disturbance characterized by the absence of regular paralysis during rapid eye movement sleep, accompanied by dream enactment behavior. The available pharmacotherapy options for treating rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are limited, and the utilization of antidepressants has yielded mixed results. We report three cases of isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder improved with trazodone. Doses of 50–100 mg of trazodone at bedtime over 4–6 months resulted in significant clinical improvement. These cases highlight that trazodone could serve as a treatment for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder that does not respond to traditional treatments at submaximal dosages.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114FfDpd]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults (i.e. age ≥ 65 years) and incur a substantial economic burden due to costs associated with subsequent fractures, hospital visits, and long-term care. In particular, medication-related falls or fractures are recognized as an important consideration for clinicians when initiating new pharmacotherapy in older adult patients. Clinical experts have published guidelines, such as the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria, to help inform treatment decisions. However, details on guideline use when treating certain conditions are scant.

Insomnia, a common sleep-wake disorder characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or both, is more prevalent among older adults, and older adults are more likely to be prescribed medication for insomnia treatment. Medication classes commonly used to treat insomnia — including benzodiazepines and z-drugs (i.e. non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem) — can have adverse effects that may pose elevated risks for older adults. Benzodiazepine adverse effects include cognitive and memory impairment, rebound insomnia upon cessation, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), falls, dependence, and addiction. Z-drugs are associated with next-day cognitive, memory, psychomotor, and balance impairments and risk of dependence and addiction. Thus, these medications may be inappropriate for use in older adults, particularly those with a history of falls or fractures, due to unfavorable risk-benefit ratios.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114zMxGv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This national analysis of 100% Medicare claims examined outcomes for older adult patients treated with commonly prescribed medications for insomnia, such as benzodiazepines, trazodone, zolpidem IR, and zolpidem ER. Compared with non-sleep disordered controls, treated adult patients demonstrated a significantly increased risk of falls, all-cause mortality, and adverse economic outcomes. Although prescribers may perceive trazodone as a lower-risk alternative for the treatment of insomnia, the study's findings suggest that trazodone, similar to benzodiazepines and zolpidem, was associated with a higher risk of falls and increased healthcare resource utilization compared to controls.

The risk varied by insomnia medication, with benzodiazepines and trazodone typically being associated with the worst outcomes. Note that this was an observational study rather than a randomized controlled trial; thus, the results are associative rather than causal. Future research should seek to identify patients at the greatest risk of adverse outcomes from commonly prescribed insomnia treatments and to match these individuals with safe, effective alternatives. Most importantly, these results highlight the need for insomnia treatments that are suitable for use in older adults with insomnia and are not associated with an increased risk of falls.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^111J8czV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Potential for cognitive and motor impairment**: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.

- **Angle-closure glaucoma**: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

- **Hyponatremia**: Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^111Zn7Sq]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

All patients were aged ≥ 65 years at the index date and were enrolled in health plans with full medical and drug coverage continuously for at least 12 months before and after the index date. The index date was the earliest prescription fill date for an insomnia medication of interest. To ensure that all patients included in the study had insomnia and were receiving prescription medication treatment for their condition, the primary criteria for inclusion were: having ≥ 1 FDA-approved insomnia medication of interest, or trazodone ≤ 100 mg, or ≥ 1 off-label insomnia treatment coupled with ≥ 1 physician-assigned ICD-9/ICD-10 insomnia diagnosis code within 12 months pre-index date.

Additionally, to ensure treatment for chronic insomnia (e.g. as opposed to a short-term hypnotic prescription for long-haul air travel), beneficiaries with claims for a single insomnia treatment were required to have received ≥ 5 days' supply based on expert opinion. Exclusion criteria included: missing birth year or sex; a claim for an insomnia medication of interest within the 12-month pre-index period to exclude prior treated insomnia patients; patients receiving benzodiazepines with a concurrent diagnosis of anxiety; and a motor vehicle crash related to a fall event if documented within 7 days of the fall event. In such instances, motor vehicle insurance may have covered a substantial portion of healthcare costs, which could bias results. No data were available for non-prescription treatments in this dataset, including over-the-counter treatments or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.

### A randomized-controlled trial targeting cognition in early Alzheimer's disease by improving sleep with trazodone (REST) [^111ocety]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among aging populations worldwide. Despite arduous research efforts, treatment options for this devastating neurodegenerative disease are limited. Sleep disturbances, through their link to changes in neural excitability and impaired clearance of interstitial abnormal protein aggregates, are a key risk factor for the development of AD. Research also suggests that the neuroprotective effects of sleep are particularly active during slow wave sleep. Given the strong link between sleep disturbance and AD, targeting sleep in the prodromal stages of AD, such as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), represents a promising avenue for slowing the onset of AD-related cognitive decline.

In efforts to improve sleep in older individuals, several pharmacologic approaches have been employed, but many pose safety risks, concern for worsening cognitive function, and fail to effectively target slow wave sleep. Trazodone, a safe and widely used drug in the older adult population, has shown promise in inducing slow wave sleep in older adults, but requires more rigorous research to understand its effects on sleep and cognition in the prodromal stages of AD. In this review, we present the rationale and study design for our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (NCT05282550) investigating the effects of trazodone on sleep and cognition in 100 older adults with amnestic MCI and sleep complaints.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116omjgd]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Effects of trazodone in all secondary outcomes were non-significant after correction for multiple comparisons but reveal a trend of delayed cognitive decline for almost all measures. We specifically tested trazodone effects on short-term memory and executive tests, considering the known involvement of hippocampal and prefrontal areas in sleep-mediated effects via SWS enhancement on these cognitive domains. Even though the results were not significant, the observed trend is promising in pursuing tailored studies that are powered to identify a potential beneficial effect in the specific cognitive domains.

It is worth keeping in mind that cognitive benefits via SWS enhancement may vary depending on a patient's specific syndrome (e.g. late age-of-onset AD, early age-of-onset AD, logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, posterior cortical atrophy). Additionally, they may depend on a person's age, with younger patients potentially benefitting most in executive function versus older ones in short-term memory. In our cohort of predominantly older amnestic patients, a trend was observed in both executive and short-term memory tasks.

### Effect of insomnia treatments on depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vCtyV]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

Insomnia is frequently co-morbid with depression, with a bidirectional relationship between these disorders. There is evidence that insomnia-specific interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, may lead to improvements in depression. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to determine whether treatment of insomnia leads to improved depression outcomes in individuals with both insomnia and depression.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of treatment for insomnia disorder on depression in patients with both disorders.

- **Results**: Three thousand eight hundred and fifteen studies were reviewed, and 23 studies met inclusion criteria. Although all the studies suggested a positive clinical effect of insomnia treatment on depression outcomes, most results were not statistically significant. Despite the variability in interventions and populations, the meta-analysis indicates moderate to large effect size improvement in depression, as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (ES = -1.29, 95% CI [-2.11, -0.47]) and Beck Depression Inventory (ES = -0.68, 95% CI [-1.29, -0.06]).

- **Conclusions**: These results support that treating insomnia in patients with depression has a positive effect on mood. Future trials are needed to identify the subtypes of patients whose depression improves during treatment with insomnia-specific interventions and to identify the mechanisms by which treating insomnia improves mood.

### Prescription medications for the treatment of insomnia and risk of suicide attempt: A comparative safety study [^116gcJHk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of chronic insomnia in adults recognize that trazodone and other off-label medications are commonly prescribed despite poor evidence. The Department of Veterans Health Affairs (VA) fills high volumes of inexpensive, over-the-counter sedating antihistamines and older antidepressants in addition to benzodiazepines and zolpidem. Yet, little is known about the comparative safety of these agents with regard to suicidal behavior.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative effectiveness of the safety of medications routinely used to treat insomnia in VA.

- **Design**: Comparative effectiveness using propensity score-matched samples.

- **Setting**: VA.

- **Participants**: VA patients without any history of suicidal ideation or behavior 12 months prior to first exposure.

- **Exposures**: VA formularies and data were used to identify prescriptions for insomnia. Agents accounting for at least 1% of total insomnia fill volume included < 200 mg trazodone, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, zolpidem, lorazepam, diazepam, and temazepam. Exposure was defined as an incident monotherapy exposure preceded by 12 months without any insomnia medications. Subjects with insomnia polypharmacy or cross-overs in the 12 months following first exposure were excluded.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Suicide attempts within 12 months of first exposure.

Three hundred forty-eight thousand four hundred forty-nine subjects met the criteria, and three well-balanced cohorts by drug class matched to zolpidem were created. After adjusting for days' supply, mental health history, and pain…

### Differential effects of nefazodone and cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy on insomnia associated with chronic forms of major depression [^112i5Yrq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The antidepressant nefazodone and the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) were recently found to have significant, additive effects in a large multicenter study of chronic forms of major depression. As nefazodone-mediated blockade of serotonin-2 receptors may directly relieve insomnia associated with depression, we examined the more specific effects of CBASP and nefazodone, singly and in combination, on sleep disturbances.

- **Method**: A total of 597 chronically depressed outpatients (DSM-III-R criteria) with at least one insomnia symptom were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with nefazodone (mean final dose = 466 mg/day), CBASP (mean = 16.0 sessions), or the combination (mean dose = 460 mg/day plus a mean of 16.2 CBASP sessions). Continuous and categorical insomnia outcomes, derived from standard clinician- and self-rated assessments, were compared.

- **Results**: Patients receiving nefazodone (either alone or in combination with CBASP) obtained significantly more rapid and greater ultimate improvement in insomnia ratings when compared with those treated with CBASP alone. This difference was maximal by the fourth week of therapy and sustained thereafter. Combined treatment did not result in markedly better insomnia scores than treatment with nefazodone alone on most measures, although patients receiving both CBASP and nefazodone were significantly more likely (p ≤ 0.05) to experience a ≥ 50% decrease in insomnia severity.

- **Conclusion**: Despite comparable antidepressant efficacy, monotherapy with nefazodone or CBASP resulted in markedly d.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^115HXYsL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical experience in trazodone prescription**: Trazodone has been in use in the US since 1981, so there is a great deal known about its benefits and side effects. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension. It also causes sedation and can cause uncomfortable feelings. Trazodone is predominantly metabolized in liver microsomes, so patients with liver damage are more sensitive to this medication and should have lower doses prescribed. The half-life of trazodone is 3 to 5 hours. Because of the individual variability of potency and side effects, dosing must be done carefully for each patient (start low: 12.5 mg at bedtime; go slow: 12.5 mg increments).

Trazodone has minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors, in contrast to older antidepressant medications. Trazodone produces a higher quality of sleep for those patients who work with the dosing than the GABA agonists (e.g. benzodiazepines), anticholinergics, or antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine), which are widely used but impair cognitive function short-term and are now being considered as contributors to the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathology long-term.

Trazodone has a generally positive effect on sexual desire and male erectile function, but it is also known to cause priapism, an emergency condition similar to what can be associated with medications used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is estimated that abnormal erectile function occurs in about one in 6,000 male, mostly younger, patients treated with trazodone.

### Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation and the risk of fall-related fractures among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^115JdHfE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, and trazodone, a sedating antidepressant, are the most common medications used to treat insomnia in the United States. Both drugs have side effect profiles (e.g. drowsiness, dizziness, and cognitive and motor impairment) that can heighten the risk of falls and fractures. Despite widespread zolpidem and trazodone use, little is known about the comparative safety of these medications in patients receiving hemodialysis, a vulnerable population with an exceedingly high fracture rate.

- **Study design, setting, participants, and measurements**: Using data from the United States Renal Data System registry (2013–2016), we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between the initiation of zolpidem versus trazodone therapy and the 30-day risk of hospitalized fall-related fractures among Medicare-enrolled patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We used an active comparator new-user design and estimated 30-day inverse probability of treatment-weighted hazard ratios and risk differences. We treated death as a competing event.

- **Results**: A total of 31,055 patients were included: 18,941 zolpidem initiators (61%) and 12,114 trazodone initiators (39%). During the 30-day follow-up period, 101 fall-related fractures occurred. Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation was associated with a higher risk of hospitalized fall-related fracture (weighted hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.63; weighted risk difference, 0.17%; 95% confidence interval, 0.07% to 0.29%).

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^116ygM1t]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In a recent review article on the prevalence of treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence in depressed patients, it was shown that subjective complaints of insomnia or daytime somnolence were frequent in patients suffering from depression or anxiety disorders treated with SSRI and SNRI.

Based on data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) study register, the average prevalence of treatment-emergent insomnia in clinical trials with SSRI was 17%, compared to 9% of patients randomized to the placebo arm. The average rate of treatment-emergent somnolence in patients being treated with SSRI amounted to 16%, as compared to 8% of patients receiving a placebo. The lowest rate of treatment-emergent insomnia complaints (below 2%) was reported in the study with citalopram. The highest rate of treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence was found in patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) being treated with high-dose fluvoxamine, 31% and 27%, respectively.

In clinical trials with SNRI, treatment-emergent insomnia was reported on average in 13% of SNRI-treated patients, compared to 7% in the placebo arm, and treatment-emergent somnolence in 10% of SNRI-treated patients, in comparison to 5% of patients receiving placebo. Both treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence were the most frequent (both equal to 24%) in patients with generalized anxiety disorders treated with venlafaxine. The lowest rate of treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence (both below 2%) was reported for levomilnacipran.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^111sLA1o]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine, was developed in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories. Trazodone was approved for medical use in December 1981 in the US by the FDA as an antidepressant medication, Desyrel. However, trazodone is a less effective antidepressant than many other agents. Further, the drug had already had extensive use outside of the US, resulting in a relatively short patent life, and the drug became generic in 1986. Thus, there was a lack of pharmaceutical industry support for extensive research on this drug.

Despite the commercial difficulties for trazodone, clinical experiences soon showed that this drug has several beneficial effects. Trazodone is unique in its effects on sleep, increasing the deeper stages of slow-wave sleep (SWS) early in the sleep cycle and delaying REM onset. An extensive number of studies have supported the use of trazodone for insomnia. Trazodone is one of the top two drugs used for off-label prescribing, usually for insomnia. It is also beneficial and widely used for anxiety, and it is arguably the most effective drug for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), likely because of its effects on sleep. Trazodone was tested for a potential benefit for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the complex, multi-center study design did not show a statistically significant benefit for trazodone relative to other interventions, in spite of its reported usefulness in the management of agitation in dementia and PTSD. In 2015, 27.6 million prescriptions for trazodone were filled in the US.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^112yGdk4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Reported clinical literature and experience with trazodone have not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. However, as experience in the elderly with trazodone hydrochloride is limited, it should be used with caution in geriatric patients. Serotonergic antidepressants have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Renal impairment**: Trazodone has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Trazodone has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^111GD1dw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a hypnotic and antidepressant (pharmacologically, a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor), is used for the management of insomnia and nighttime behavioral disturbances, irritability, agitation, and aggression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Trazodone has a favorable safety profile if administered in small doses and appears to stabilize circadian rhythms in individuals with AD. Because of its hypnotic properties, trazodone may be particularly useful in patients with nocturnal agitation.

There is growing interest in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to target agitation and aggression in dementia. A recent large randomized controlled trial found that citalopram significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress compared to placebo. However, worsening cognition and QT prolongation were significantly more common in the citalopram group (30 mg/day). Patients in the study were required to have treatment-requiring levels of agitation; those with major depression or psychosis requiring antipsychotics were excluded. Assessment of the 20 mg (the maximum dose recommended by the FDA in adults over 60) has not been conducted. Comparator studies indicate sertraline and citalopram are probably as effective as risperidone in treating agitation in dementia, especially among those with mild to moderate agitation severity.

Dextromethorphan/quinidine, a combination drug containing dextromethorphan, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, and a high-affinity sigma-1 receptor agonist, along with the antiarrhythmic agent quinidine, is the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of…

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^115uCm4W]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

There are inherent limitations to our study, primarily due to its retrospective nature. Ideally, we would prospectively standardize medication dosage and timing after randomized allocation between groups and monitor medication compliance across a predefined time period. For example, benefits observed in the trazodone group may reflect better overall medical management of participants by their physicians and delayed cognitive decline due to unaccounted factors.

Possible adverse effects of trazodone were not explicitly reported during the assessment of participants' medication regimen. It is thus possible there is a biased selection against people who tried but did not tolerate trazodone for inclusion in the trazodone group, but who could have been included in the trazodone non-user group. Such participants may be more resistant in achieving better sleep consolidation through slow-wave sleep (SWS) enhancers. Alternatively, there may be different metabolism of trazodone in these participants, given that prior work indicates its active metabolite may have different effects on alertness compared to trazodone itself, a possibility that personalized medicine may be able to address.

Eventually, optimal accounting for confounders necessitates prospective double-blind randomized trials to confirm that differential rates of cognitive decline are directly caused by trazodone. Such prospective studies, ideally incorporating interval cognitive evaluations, could also answer whether potential long-term trazodone benefits are due to continuous modulation of brain networks.

### Evaluating the dose-dependent mechanism of action of trazodone by estimation of occupancies for different brain neurotransmitter targets [^116pwmwn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a drug that was introduced in the clinic almost 40 years ago. It is licensed to treat depression but is also commonly used off-label to treat insomnia. A recent study shows that it could be promising in preventing neurodegeneration in mice, and clinical trials to assess its possible beneficial effects on dementia and Alzheimer's disease are expected to start soon in humans.

In this study, we describe the dose-dependent pharmacology of trazodone by carrying out pharmacokinetic simulations aiming to predict its brain concentrations for different drug-dosing regimens and calculate occupancy for 28 different targets for which published trazodone-binding data are available. Our study indicates that low doses of trazodone (typically 50 mg daily) should suffice to block specific receptors responsible for the hypnotic effect and to provide the protective effect against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that could be beneficial in dementia. Higher doses are required for an antidepressant effect. The occupancy of specific receptors at therapeutic doses also explains peculiar side effects reported by patients treated with trazodone, such as dry mouth, hypotension, and priapism.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia [^115tVjP6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. Reasons for the preferential prescription of these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may include a desire to treat concurrent sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication, and/or an attempt to avoid hypnotic drugs due to their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed to treat insomnia. In addition, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles themselves.

This review explores pertinent research studies published in recent years on antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate in the treatment of sleep issues in specific well-defined populations.

### Sleep-HD trial: Short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^115aKftk]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

There is a compelling need to identify effective treatments for insomnia in HD patients, and the interventions being studied in this clinical trial (telehealth CBT-I and trazodone) have a strong scientific premise. Most HD patients experience significant impairments in quality of life, mainly due to the high frequency of disabling symptoms. Insomnia is one of the most frequently reported symptoms, and studies of HD patients and other populations suggest that it significantly contributes to other common symptoms and poor health outcomes. It is essential to recognize that insomnia is common in HD patients with comorbid depression but is independent of sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome.

There are unique contributors to chronic insomnia in HD patients, such as the biologic effects of residual uremia after partial correction achieved with dialysis technology, maladaptation to treatment schedules, and patients' napping during treatments. If telehealth CBT-I proves effective for treating insomnia in HD patients, it would provide an option that is currently unavailable to patients. Trazodone is widely used, but the data on its efficacy for treating insomnia in HD patients are limited as well.

### Treatment of insomnia associated with clinical depression [^113Yf7CA]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are almost always present in patients with depression. Although these disturbances generally abate with the resolution of depression, some patients continue to report poor sleep. Since several studies have demonstrated that insomnia increases the risk of new-onset depression and recurrence of depression, optimal management of insomnia associated with depression becomes an important clinical goal. Antidepressant agents have variable effects on sleep; in fact, some antidepressants seem to worsen sleep in patients with depression. This article reviews various treatment options in the management of patients presenting with insomnia and depression, including single agents, combination strategies, and behavioral interventions.

### Effectiveness of sequential psychological and medication therapies for insomnia disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^114KKw9i]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Despite evidence of efficacious psychological and pharmacologic therapies for insomnia, there is little information about what first-line treatment should be and how best to proceed when initial treatment fails.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the comparative efficacy of four treatment sequences involving psychological and medication therapies for insomnia, and to examine the moderating effect of psychiatric disorders on insomnia outcomes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: In a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial, patients were assigned to first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT; n = 104) or zolpidem (n = 107). Patients who did not remit received a second treatment involving either medication (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy [CT]). The study took place at Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Québec, Université Laval, Québec City, Québec, Canada, and at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado. Enrollment of patients occurred from August 2012 through July 2017.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoints were the treatment response and remission rates, defined by the Insomnia Severity Index total score.

- **Results**: Patients included 211 adults (132 women; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [14.9] years) with a chronic insomnia disorder, including 74 patients with a comorbid anxiety or mood disorder. First-stage therapy with BT or zolpidem produced equivalent weighted percentages of responders (BT, 45.5%; zolpidem, 49.7%; OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.60–2.33) and remitters (BT, 38.03%; zolpidem, 30.3%).

### Effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis: A randomized clinical trial [^116VLkhq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study Sleep-HD (trazodone) was published by Rajnish Mehrotra and colleagues in 2024 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. This study is associated with insomnia and chronic kidney disease. In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the trial question was: What is the role of trazodone in patients undergoing hemodialysis with mild or moderate chronic insomnia?

The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, and a randomized clinical trial (RCT). The population consisted of 83 patients (41 female, 42 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing hemodialysis with an Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 10 and sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights/week for ≥ 3 months. Key exclusion criteria included severe cognitive impairment, severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, alcohol or substance misuse, severe restless legs syndrome, pregnancy/lactation, and anticipated life expectancy of less than 3 months.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Trazodone group**: n = 42 on trazodone (starting dose of 50 mg nightly, titrated to 100 mg, for 6 weeks).
	- **Placebo group**: n = 41 on matching placebo for 6 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was a borderline significant increase in the reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 7 (4.2 points vs. 3.1 points; AD 1.08 points, 95% CI -1.34 to 3.49).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Borderline significant decrease in reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 25 (4 points vs. 4.3 points; AD -0.34 points, 95% CI -3.17 to 2.49).

The study did not find a significant difference in other secondary outcomes.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: An international scoping review [^114g52c8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Our results indicate a general lack of specific BZD prescription guidance in major depression and associated mood disorders, other than the possible use of a BZD for less than four weeks adjunctively with an antidepressant. There were few guidelines that made clear recommendations for the management of BZD in patients with concomitant mood and anxiety disorders. Notably, BZD have been evaluated as monotherapy for depression with no observed difference from tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) in a meta-analysis of 20 trials from the 1970s to early 1990s. Nevertheless, the lack of BZD treatment as a viable maintenance treatment option within guidelines for depressive disorders was not surprising for two reasons. First, BZD have been associated with worse mood outcomes long-term and may increase suicidality in vulnerable patients with other psychiatric risk factors. Second, there is a paucity of high-quality controlled trial evidence demonstrating benefits for adjunctive treatment with BZD beyond four weeks at the time of antidepressant initiation.

BZD treatment specifications were provided more often in the context of perinatal/post-partum depressive disorders. This could be explained by the emphasis on explicit safety considerations around medication use in pregnancy. For example, three guidelines offered explicit advice to use agents such as lorazepam, temazepam, oxazepam, or brotizolam, which either undergo limited hepatic metabolism or have relatively shorter elimination half-lives to minimize theoretic fetal or lactational exposure.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^115nVK9V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Dose selection**: An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dosage should be initiated at a low dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e. more severely depressed patients) may be given up to, but not in excess of, 600 mg/day in divided doses. Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

- **Administration instructions**: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly following a meal or light snack.

- **Screen for bipolar disorder prior to starting trazodone hydrochloride tablets**: Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Switching to or from monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant**: At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of trazodone hydrochloride tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping trazodone before starting an MAOI.

### Comparative effectiveness of second-generation antidepressants for accompanying anxiety, insomnia, and pain in depressed patients: A systematic review [^115p4DMo]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) often suffer from accompanying symptoms that influence the choice of pharmacotherapy with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). We conducted a systematic review to determine the comparative effectiveness of citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, and trazodone for accompanying anxiety, insomnia, and pain in patients with MDD.

- **Methods**: We conducted searches in multiple databases including MEDLINE®, Embase, the Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and PsycINFO from 1980 through August 2011 and reviewed reference lists of pertinent articles. We dually reviewed abstracts, full-text articles, and abstracted data. We included randomized, head-to-head trials of SGAs of at least 6 weeks' duration. We grouped SGAs into three classes for the analysis: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and others. We graded the strength of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: We located 19 head-to-head trials in total: 11 on anxiety, six on insomnia, and four on pain. For the majority of comparisons, the strength of the evidence was moderate or low. Evidence is weakened by inconsistency and imprecision. For treating anxiety, insomnia, and pain, moderate evidence suggests that the SSRIs do not differ.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^116nGu3b]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

At the same time, our methodology has limitations for consideration. Most important, we were unable to assess some clinical variables, including insomnia symptoms or severity, daytime function, and quality of life. Second, we did not match on specific comorbidities, concomitant medication use, or previous fall history, but we did control for comorbidity burden using the Charlson Comorbidity Index in the adjusted generalized linear models. Claims data limitations did not allow us to control for patient frailty or severity of illness. It has been suggested that these patients may use hypnotics more often for reasons such as stress and fear because of an underlying severe illness.

Third, we assessed only falls that required medical attention, and we were unable to assess falls that resulted in death. Fourth, there is currently no validated algorithm to identify patients with insomnia in administrative claims data, and insomnia is underreported and underdiagnosed. Thus, we relied on prescription drug claims for on- or off-label insomnia treatments to identify the patients with treated insomnia. Dosing was limited for trazodone to ≤ 100 mg without requiring an accompanying insomnia diagnosis to further ensure its use for insomnia in the absence of a diagnosis code. Claims data do not contain information on whether or when the patient took their prescription medication, only the fill date.

Fifth, we did not control for extent of exposure (dosage and persistence) in the analysis; effects were attributed to first index medication with ≥ 5 days' supply. Medication exposure at the time.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^111tNC34]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Since the 2000s, particularly, vigorous debate in the literature among psychiatrists and other health professionals practicing within the bounds of clinical psychopharmacology has resulted in a continued division of competing perspectives about BZD-related benefits and harms for different clinical circumstances. The perspective that various guidelines on BZD prescribing have been largely concordant with one another for common mental health and sleep concerns, while commonly held among clinicians and academics, has not yet been subject to rigorous scrutiny to examine differences between recommendations and guidance from these differing groups of experts. We sought to characterize parameters relevant to BZD and BZRA prescribing and de-prescribing in clinical practice guidelines and prescribing guidance documents for adult patients with anxiety disorders and insomnia. The inclusion of unipolar depressive disorders in this review is relevant for applicability to common patient encounters in both primary care and psychiatry, where depressive and anxiety illnesses are often either comorbid or mixed to varying extents in their symptom presentation.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^1172sCmY]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This study was a retrospective cohort analysis using the 100% Medicare administrative claims database, also known as research identifiable files (RIFs), from January 2011 through December 2017. The Medicare database provides data in three separate file types: 1) data that allow patient identification, 2) dataset files containing patient-level data without identifying information, and 3) aggregated data containing no patient- or provider-level information. Care settings included within the Medicare database comprise outpatient, inpatient, skilled nursing facility, hospice, home health agency, prescription drugs, and more. It is important to note that claims data generally provide information on the provision of a service (e.g. laboratory test) rather than the outcome (e.g. laboratory result).

In this study, patients receiving insomnia treatment were identified from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016. The index date was defined as the earliest fill date for an insomnia medication of interest: benzodiazepines, trazodone, zolpidem ER (extended release), and zolpidem IR (immediate release). Based on available market research, the most commonly used prescription insomnia medications were selected for analysis. Other prescription insomnia medications were not included, primarily due to low sample size issues stemming from limited time on the market and/or low market share. Additionally, a matched control cohort of non-sleep-disordered adults was identified from January 2012 through December 2016. Patients in the control group were matched 1-to-1 with individuals in the insomnia-treated group.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116Eeu2B]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Recent studies reveal an association between slow-wave sleep (SWS), amyloid-β aggregation, and cognition. This retrospective study examines whether long-term use of trazodone, an SWS enhancer, is associated with delayed cognitive decline.

- **Methods**: We identified 25 regular trazodone users (mean age 75.4 ± 7.5; 9 women, 16 men) who carried a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition, and 25 propensity-matched trazodone non-users (mean age 74.5 ± 8.0; 13 women, 12 men). The matching considered age, sex, education, type of sleep deficit (hypersomnia, insomnia, parasomnia), diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Longitudinal group differences in cognitive testing were evaluated through repeated measures tests over an average inter-evaluation interval of four years.

- **Results**: Trazodone non-users had a 2.6-fold faster decline in MMSE scores (primary outcome) compared to trazodone users — 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.48) versus 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50–0.90) points per year (p = 0.023). The observed effects were particularly associated with subjective improvement of sleep complaints in post-hoc analyses (p = 0.0006). Secondary outcomes of other cognitive and functional scores showed variable worsening in non-users and varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications and multiple comparisons. Trazodone effects on MMSE remained significant within participants with AD-predicted pathology, with a 2.4-fold faster decline in non-users (p = 0.038).

These results suggest an association between regular trazodone use and slower cognitive decline in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's dementia.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: An international scoping review [^116ySW36]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Over thirty years of prescriptive guidance on BZD and BZRA, from groups of international clinician experts on anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders, and insomnia, demonstrate that these agents are still clearly not recommended as routine 1st line agents or for longer-term use (i.e. beyond 4 weeks) in most patients. Recommendations on their use have not generally changed; however, the lack of explicit direction on prescribing details, noted in many documents, can be further elaborated on in future iterations of guidelines.

A renewed focus on deprescribing of these agents within the past 10 years has elucidated areas of attention for research work to inform future guideline development panels. The shifting of deprescribing practices involving BZD from a clinical 'art' to a clinical 'science'-based practice should be a continued focus for guideline committees, with attention to comparing dose reduction strategies, the use or non-use of diazepam (or other long-acting BZD), the use or non-use of adjunctive pharmacotherapies, and the value of 'micro' tapers using either compounded products or patient-directed alteration of available dosage forms.

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms [^1173G8t9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant that blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

- **Discussion**: Trazodone is well-absorbed orally and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in individuals who are depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain relief may occur through mechanisms similar to those of venlafaxine. Additionally, delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. However, drug interactions are a risk due to its cytochrome metabolism.

- **Conclusion**: Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be advantageous in palliating symptoms. However, little evidence is available from cohort or randomized trials to provide guidance on its use.

### A post hoc analysis of the effect of nightly administration of eszopiclone and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in patients with insomnia and anxious depression [^112rA8FD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and significant anxiety are less responsive to antidepressants than those without anxiety. In this post hoc analysis of patients with insomnia and comorbid anxious depression, eszopiclone co-therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was compared with placebo co-therapy.

- **Method**: Data were pooled from two randomized, double-blind, 8-week trials. One trial (conducted from January 2004 to October 2004) included patients with DSM-IV insomnia and comorbid MDD treated with fluoxetine concurrently with eszopiclone 3 mg/d or placebo. The other trial (conducted from July 2005 to April 2006) included patients with DSM-IV-TR insomnia and comorbid generalized anxiety disorder treated with escitalopram concurrently with eszopiclone 3 mg/d or placebo. Anxious depression was defined as a baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score ≥ 14 (excluding insomnia items) and an anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7. Treatment group differences were determined for mean changes in HDRS-17 scores (with and without insomnia items), HDRS anxiety/somatization scores, and response and remission rates. Severity of insomnia was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

- **Results**: In the combined dataset, 347 of 1,136 patients (30.5%) had insomnia and comorbid anxious depression. Significant improvements in insomnia were observed for eszopiclone co-therapy relative to placebo co-therapy (mean change from baseline on the ISI: -11.0 vs -7.8, respectively; P < .001). There were greater reductions in HDRS-17 scores in…

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^113Ya8kk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

While much attention has been given to the plaque and tangle pathology of the neocortex, as well as the hippocampus and amygdala, recent attention has focused on brainstem mechanisms. It is now understood that the earliest pathological changes involving hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein-tau are actually in the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe nuclei. This change of focus has considerable implications for understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, as well as developing new approaches to its prevention and treatment.

PTSD, anxiety, depression, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are all associated with increased AD risk. Serotonergic medications are approved for the treatment of PTSD. It is likely that PTSD causes some underlying derangement in the brainstem, involving serotonin and sleep mechanisms. A relationship between anxiety and norepinephrine, particularly its connection with the locus coeruleus, is well-known and is related to nocturnal behavior. Depression is commonly treated with serotonin and norepinephrine medications, implicating brainstem mechanisms in this broad condition. Depression has also been studied as a frequent prodromal condition of AD.

TBI frequently results in loss of consciousness and memory problems, which implicates brainstem mechanisms. Addressing the serotonin and norepinephrine systems in individuals who have suffered significant TBI is therefore relevant. Thus, a major consideration for PTSD, anxiety, depression, and TBI is whether trazodone could benefit affected individuals by delaying their long-term progression.

### Effects of trazodone versus cognitive behavioral therapy in the insomnia with short sleep duration phenotype: a preliminary study [^116mp9jS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype is associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, physiological hyperarousal, and a blunted response to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Whether insomnia with objective short sleep duration responds better to pharmacological treatment compared to CBT-I has not been examined.

Participants included 15 patients with chronic insomnia (86.7% female), aged 45.3 ± 8.1 years. Eight patients were randomized to CBT-I and seven to trazodone. Patients were examined with two weeks of actigraphy, salivary cortisol levels, and the insomnia severity index at three time points: pretreatment, three months posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. Mixed between-within-subjects analysis of variance and univariate analysis of covariance were conducted to assess the impact of trazodone and CBT-I on patients' total sleep time, salivary cortisol levels, and insomnia severity index scores across the three time points.

Trazodone, but not CBT-I, significantly lengthened total sleep time (when measured with actigraphy) both at posttreatment (51.01 minutes vs. -11.73 minutes; p = 0.051; Cohen's d = 1.383) and at follow-up (50.35 minutes vs. -7.56 minutes; p = 0.012; Cohen's d = 1.725). In addition, trazodone, but not CBT-I, showed a clinically meaningful decrease in salivary cortisol levels from pretreatment to posttreatment (-36.07% vs. -11.70%; Cohen's d = 0.793) and from pretreatment to follow-up (-21.37% vs. -5.79%; Cohen's d = 0.284). Finally, there were no differences on insomnia severity index scores.

### Electroconvulsive therapy and cardiovascular complications in patients taking trazodone for insomnia [^116znRY6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Trazodone has been used widely to treat insomnia in depressed patients. When used in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), trazodone has been suspected to cause cardiovascular side effects.

- **Method**: A retrospective study was conducted with 100 patients who received ECT with trazodone. One patient was excluded because permission to review the patient's records had not been given. The remaining 99 patients were matched with control ECT patients.

- **Results**: No statistically significant between-group differences were identified in cardiovascular side effects, although a trend toward more orthostatic hypotension was observed in patients taking trazodone.

- **Conclusion**: Administering low-dose trazodone for insomnia in conjunction with ECT does not appear to increase cardiovascular complications. The true incidence of adverse cardiac events was not higher than 3.66% at a 95% confidence level.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^1155Sgec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Another limitation pertains to whether the observed trazodone effects are primarily mediated through SWS enhancement. In this study, quantified data of SWS were not available for correlating to the rate of cognitive decline. Additionally, it is possible that trazodone effects could be mediated through its antidepressant benefits. We do not believe the latter is the case since trazodone is rarely, if ever, given as an antidepressant in our cohort. Moreover, antidepressant doses of trazodone are usually much higher than doses for insomnia that were prescribed for our participants and often relate to carry-over cognitive deficits the following day, albeit less severe than those observed with certain other antidepressants.

Nonetheless, a prospective study would be the optimal approach in controlling potential antidepressant-mediated cognitive benefits of trazodone. An alternative possibility for the observed trazodone benefits could be explained by its possible neuroprotective effects via inhibition of the phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α signaling pathway of the unfolded protein response (eIF2 α-P/UPR). Specifically, in the MAPT P301L mouse model of tauopathy, trazodone use was associated with fewer memory deficits, preserved hippocampal neuronal counts, delayed gross brain atrophy, and prolonged survival. Interestingly, the eIF2 α-P/UPR pathway is also induced during sleep deprivation of wild-type mice, providing an additional mechanistic explanation through which improving disturbances in sleep may be neuroprotective.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^1142AE12]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Recent studies reveal an association between slow-wave sleep (SWS), amyloid-β aggregation, and cognition.

- **Objective**: This retrospective study examines whether long-term use of trazodone, an SWS enhancer, is associated with delayed cognitive decline.

- **Methods**: We identified 25 regular trazodone users (mean age 75.4 ± 7.5; 9 women, 16 men) who carried a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. There were 25 propensity-matched trazodone non-users (mean age 74.5 ± 8.0; 13 women, 12 men), accounting for age, sex, education, type of sleep deficit (hypersomnia, insomnia, parasomnia), diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Longitudinal group differences in cognitive testing were evaluated through repeated measures tests over an average inter-evaluation interval of four years.

- **Results**: Trazodone non-users had a 2.6-fold faster decline in MMSE (primary outcome) compared to trazodone users, 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.48) versus 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50–0.90) points per year (p = 0.023). The observed effects were especially associated with subjective improvement of sleep complaints in post-hoc analyses (p = 0.0006). Secondary outcomes of other cognitive and functional scores had variable worsening in non-users and varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications and multiple comparisons. Trazodone effects on MMSE remained significant within participants with AD-predicted pathology, with a 2.4-fold faster decline in non-users (p = 0.038).

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest an association between trazodone use and delayed cognitive decline.

### Trazodone for agitation in dementia [^112K2jMy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychiatric disturbances affect at least 50% of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Neuroleptic drugs are extensively prescribed to treat behavioral manifestations of dementia despite only modest efficacy and a high frequency of adverse effects. There is clearly a need for safer and more effective remedies. Trazodone is a psychoactive compound with sedative and antidepressant properties, with mixed serotonin agonist and antagonist effects. Functional serotonergic deficits may be related to the genesis of behavioral disturbances in dementia.

- **Objectives**: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of trazodone for any type of behavioral or psychological cognition in people with dementia without an additional diagnosis of depression.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 1 June 2004, using the terms trazodon*, beneficat, desirel, sideril, trazodil, trazalon. This register contains records from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases, and is updated regularly.

- **Selection criteria**: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing trazodone with placebo in managing behavioral and psychiatric symptoms (except depression) in any type of dementia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Available data for this analysis were extracted from the two included studies, and odds ratios or average differences, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted where applicable.

### Eszopiclone for insomnia [^115SeQJV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Insomnia is a major public health issue affecting 6% to 10% of the adult population in Western countries. Eszopiclone is a hypnotic drug belonging to a newer group of hypnotic agents, known as new generation hypnotics, which is marketed as being just as effective as benzodiazepines for this condition, while being safer and having a lower risk for abuse and dependence. This review aims to integrate evidence from randomized controlled trials to draw conclusions on eszopiclone's efficacy and safety profile, while considering methodological features and risks of bias.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia compared to placebo or active control.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, and registry databases (WHO trials portal, ClinicalTrials.gov) with results incorporated from searches up to 10 February 2016. To identify trials not registered in electronic databases, we contacted key informants and searched reference lists of identified studies. We ran an update search on 21 February 2018 and have placed studies of interest in awaiting classification/ongoing studies. These will be incorporated into the next version of the review, as appropriate.

- **Selection criteria**: Parallel group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eszopiclone with either placebo or active control were included in the review. Participants were adults with insomnia, as diagnosed with a standardized diagnostic system.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^115Ak6Tk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The mechanism of trazodone's antidepressant action is not fully understood but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS. Trazodone is both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a 5HT2 receptor antagonist. The net result of these actions on serotonergic transmission and their role in trazodone's antidepressant effect is unknown.

Preclinical studies have shown that trazodone selectively inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin (Ki = 367 nM) and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT-2A (Ki = 35.6 nM) serotonin receptors. Trazodone also antagonizes several other monoaminergic receptors, including 5-HT2B (Ki = 78.4 nM), 5-HT2C (Ki = 224 nM), α1A (Ki = 153 nM), and α2C (Ki = 155 nM) receptors, and it is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A (Ki = 118 nM) receptor. Trazodone also antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property that may be associated with postural hypotension.

- **Absorption**: In humans, trazodone hydrochloride is absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration, and a lengthening in time to reach maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when taken on an empty stomach or two hours after dosing when taken with food.

- **Metabolism**: (Content appears to be incomplete at this point; no further information available.)

### Does online insomnia treatment reduce depressive symptoms? A randomized controlled trial in individuals with both insomnia and depressive symptoms [^116KEgyK]. Psychological Medicine (2019). High credibility.

To our knowledge, there have only been four studies that investigated CBT-I as a standalone treatment for people with both depressive symptoms and insomnia. Two of those studies used face-to-face treatment and both failed to demonstrate an effect of insomnia treatment on depressive symptoms when compared with depression treatment-as-usual, and when compared with relaxation therapy. The other two studies used online CBT-I as a standalone treatment for depressive symptoms and insomnia. Those studies showed more promising results. Blom and colleagues showed that online CBT-I was significantly more effective than online depression treatment on insomnia, but as effective on depressive symptoms. However, the sample size of this study was small and replication is needed before conclusions can be drawn. Christensen and colleagues demonstrated that online CBT-I effectively reduced depressive symptoms and insomnia symptoms in patients with complaints of both when compared with an online placebo module. However, people with higher scores of depressive symptoms were excluded (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 > 20).

We aimed to replicate the findings of Christensen and colleagues and expand them by not excluding people with higher levels of depressive symptoms in a randomized controlled design. This involved comparing online CBT-I (i-Sleep) with a non-treated control group, monitoring their sleep daily. The online treatment included feedback from a coach as this has been shown to potentiate efficacy. We hypothesized that i-Sleep would be effective in reducing both insomnia and depressive symptoms.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^1158bvzW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

In this issue, an article by La et al. provides evidence that trazodone delayed cognitive decline in 25 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. For participants considered to have AD pathology, trazodone non-users declined at a rate 2.4 times greater than those taking trazodone for sleep over a 4-year period.

The analysis of sleep complaints showed that the relationship between trazodone — a widely used medication for sleep problems in the elderly — and cognition was associated with subjective improvement in sleep disruption. Due to the design of the study, it was not possible to prove that the benefit of slowing cognitive decline was due specifically to the improvement in sleep. However, trazodone uniquely improves the deeper phases of slow-wave sleep.

Other sedative medications are generally associated with worse cognitive function over time, and they do not improve sleep characteristics as does trazodone. Trazodone has a variety of effects on several monoaminergic mechanisms: a potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist.

Because of the potential importance of this finding, further discussion is provided on the roles that trazodone may play in the modulation of monoamines, cognition, and the development of AD. If trazodone really does provide such a dramatic slowing in the development of dementia associated with AD, a great deal more research on trazodone is needed, including environmental and behavioral factors.

### Sleep-HD trial: Short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113qtm39]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

SLEEP-HD is the first multi-center RCT for the treatment of insomnia in patients undergoing HD and seeks to compare the efficacy of telehealth CBT-I vs. trazodone vs. medication placebo for the treatment of chronic insomnia in patients undergoing HD.

Dialysis is a life-sustaining treatment for patients with kidney failure. Nevertheless, most patients experience many troubling symptoms, and disturbances in sleep are among the most reported problems. However, there has been limited research done to identify what treatments are effective for patients undergoing HD with sleep problems. Moreover, HD treatments are scheduled three times every week, making it extremely difficult for patients to have the time to receive cognitive behavioral therapy — a treatment effective in improving sleep in individuals without kidney failure. In this study, we plan to test the short- and long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy with a therapist face-to-face delivered over the web, instead of in-person, with a drug. This study has the potential not only to benefit patients treated with HD but also other patients that have difficulty accessing treatment for sleep problems, such as residents of rural and underserved areas.
