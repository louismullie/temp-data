## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Indonesia's disease burden and health system context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching epidemiological transition and life expectancy gains. Then, I should verify the double burden of disease and leading causes of DALYs. Next, I will examine subnational disparities and their policy implications. After that, I need to assess the health system and universal coverage trajectory. I will then review key risk factors and modifiable drivers, followed by infectious disease priorities and antimicrobial resistance. Finally, I should consider maternal and child health, non-communicable diseases, and conclude with evidence-based policy recommendations and research gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by high-quality sources and that I double-check any uncertain figures before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiological transition and life expectancy trends. Indonesia has experienced substantial gains in life expectancy at birth, rising by about 8.0 years from 63.6 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2016, with larger gains among females than males, reflecting broad improvements in communicable disease control and maternal and child health, though gains have slowed in recent years and remain uneven across provinces [^115YVSTM] [^1148ETWS]. Wait, let me verify the more recent provincial estimates; yes, from 1990 to 2019, male life expectancy increased from 62.5 to 69.4 years and female from 65.7 to 73.5 years, confirming continued but unequal progress across the archipelago [^1148ETWS].

> I need to check the double burden of disease assertion carefully. The Global Burden of Disease analyses consistently show a classic epidemiologic transition in Indonesia: communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) DALYs declined by 58.6% from 1990 to 2016, while non-communicable disease (NCD) burden rose, with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes emerging as the top three causes of DALYs by 2016, indicating a persistent and evolving double burden that strains the health system [^112Xt3Xw] [^112Q4W4J]. Hold on, I should verify the timing of the crossover; yes, all-age CMNN DALYs fell below NCD DALYs around 1996, reinforcing the shift while underscoring that CMNN diseases remain substantial in absolute terms and in certain regions [^114M5Cq3].

> Next, I should review subnational disparities and their magnitude. There are striking provincial differences in life expectancy, with a gap of roughly 9.9 years for males and 13.7 years for females between the highest- and lowest-performing provinces in 2019, and western provinces generally outperforming eastern regions on health development indices, including Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) scores, which are consistently above the national mean in the west and below in the east [^1148ETWS] [^113Niofr]. Let me consider healthy life expectancy as well. HALE differences of about 8.5 years between top and bottom provinces further illustrate the depth of inequity and the need for geographically targeted interventions [^113Niofr].

> I will now examine the health system and universal health coverage context. Indonesia introduced Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) in 2014 and achieved approximately 84% population coverage by 2021, with ongoing expansion toward universal coverage, yet persistent gaps in access, quality, and financial protection remain, particularly in remote and poorer provinces [^116yso7H]. Wait, I should double-check the current coverage estimate; some sources note around 90% coverage more recently, but given variability in definitions and data lags, I will conservatively cite the 84% figure from 2021 and acknowledge uncertainty while emphasizing the need to strengthen primary care, referral systems, and quality assurance mechanisms [^116yso7H].

> Let me think about leading risk factors and modifiable drivers. High systolic blood pressure, tobacco use, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high BMI are the top five contributors to DALYs nationally, with tobacco remaining a major driver of premature mortality and disability, especially among males, and dietary risks accounting for a substantial share of NCD burden [^1148ETWS]. I should confirm tobacco epidemic phase; Indonesia's male smoking prevalence remains in an earlier epidemic phase compared with several ASEAN peers, and youth exposure remains high, indicating that tobacco control policies have not yet reversed the trajectory despite some local efforts [^116KQdbX] [^116CXemR].

> Now, I need to assess infectious disease priorities and antimicrobial resistance. Tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, and lower respiratory infections remain leading sources of DALYs, and Indonesia exhibits high and increasing ratios of observed to expected YLLs for TB and diarrheal disease relative to its Socio-demographic Index, signaling underperformance and persistent transmission dynamics [^1148ETWS] [^111Me8V7]. Hold on, I should verify AMR; yes, Indonesia has among the highest regional AMR prevalence estimates for common gram-negative pathogens, and antibiotic consumption has risen markedly, with weak regulation and limited surveillance undermining rational use and resistance containment efforts [^111foDxu] [^116yso7H].

> Let me consider maternal and child health next. The maternal mortality ratio declined by about 45% from 1990 to 2020, but Indonesia still has one of the highest MMRs in Southeast Asia, with large regional disparities and a shifting cause pattern toward hypertensive disorders and non-obstetric comorbidities, reflecting the epidemiologic transition and the need for strengthened maternal death surveillance and response systems [^1115BdLE]. I should confirm neonatal and infant outcomes; very preterm infant mortality remains high, and ROP incidence estimates are likely underestimates due to high early mortality and incomplete screening, highlighting gaps in neonatal intensive care and ophthalmology coverage [^115NJUNS].

> I will now examine non-communicable diseases and their system-level implications. Cardiovascular diseases dominate mortality and morbidity, with Indonesia showing some of the highest age-standardized CVD prevalence rates in ASEAN and relatively small sex disparities compared with neighbors, likely reflecting high metabolic risk across both sexes, including hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia [^113xE7T4]. But wait, what if diabetes care quality is the bottleneck; indeed, diagnosis, treatment, and control rates for diabetes remain low, and hypertension care pathways show poor continuity, with low probabilities of moving from detection to sustained control, indicating that expanding coverage alone will not suffice without quality-focused redesign and adherence support [^111SK4uz] [^1173nuJ4].

> Next, I should review injury burden and health technology access. Road injuries remain a leading cause of DALYs, and Indonesia records the highest absolute number of injury cases and deaths in ASEAN, underscoring the need for comprehensive road safety, drowning prevention, and occupational health programs tailored to local contexts [^111Me8V7] [^114WJRTu]. I need to check cardiovascular procedural access; catheterization laboratory distribution remains highly unequal, with a Gini index around 0.48 and several provinces lacking any lab, constraining timely access to PCI for acute coronary syndromes and exacerbating geographic inequities in outcomes [^117A1veQ].

> Let me synthesize policy implications and evidence-based recommendations. First, prioritize subnational equity by reallocating resources and building capacity in underperforming eastern provinces, including targeted recruitment of health workers, infrastructure development, and decentralized planning supported by granular burden-of-disease data [^1148ETWS] [^116ccgDL]. Second, intensify NCD prevention and early detection through population-level interventions on diet, physical activity, and tobacco, and strengthen primary care for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk management with adherence support and simplified treatment protocols [^112Xt3Xw] [^1173nuJ4]. Third, accelerate AMR containment via surveillance expansion, antibiotic stewardship, and infection prevention, while addressing drivers such as poor water and sanitation and limited vaccine coverage [^111foDxu] [^116yso7H]. Fourth, enhance maternal and neonatal health by expanding skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care, and neonatal services, and institutionalize maternal death surveillance and response with provincial action plans [^1115BdLE]. Fifth, improve injury prevention with multisectoral road safety legislation, drowning prevention, and occupational safety programs, and reduce geographic barriers to time-sensitive care such as PCI through strategic cath lab placement and telemedicine-enabled networks [^114WJRTu] [^117A1veQ].

> Hold on, I should verify research and data gaps that could undermine precision policy. Indonesia still lacks sufficiently granular, high-quality AMR surveillance, district-level burden estimates, and longitudinal evaluations of health system interventions, and existing HTA processes have been inconsistently adopted despite recent guideline revisions, limiting the effective translation of evidence into coverage and pricing decisions [^111foDxu] [^114nHNqy]. Let me reconsider the role of GBD. While GBD 2019 provides robust provincial baselines, finer geospatial resolution and real-time data linkages are needed to guide district-level planning and rapid response, especially as climate change and demographic shifts reshape disease patterns [^1148ETWS] [^113Niofr].

> In conclusion, Indonesia has achieved notable life expectancy gains amid a pronounced epidemiologic transition, but faces a persistent double burden with deep subnational inequities, fragmented health system performance, and rising NCDs that threaten sustainability of universal coverage ambitions. Addressing these challenges requires equity-focused resource allocation, quality-improvement in primary care, stronger public health regulation, and sustained investment in data systems and local capacity to deliver preventive and curative services equitably across the archipelago [^112Xt3Xw] [^1148ETWS] [^116yso7H].

Indonesia faces a **double burden of disease** [^1148ETWS] with persistent communicable diseases (tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, hepatitis B/C) [^1148ETWS] [^111LpqVp] [^113pumAG] [^116p32th] and rising non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, COPD) [^112Q4W4J] [^1148ETWS]. Life expectancy has improved [^115YVSTM], but **large regional disparities** remain [^1148ETWS], with eastern provinces lagging behind western regions [^113Niofr]. Key risk factors include tobacco use [^116KQdbX], hypertension, obesity, and dietary risks [^1148ETWS]; maternal mortality remains high [^1115BdLE], and antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat [^111foDxu]. The healthcare system is expanding [^116yso7H] under JKN [^116yso7H], yet access and quality vary, especially in remote areas [^113Niofr].

## Communicable diseases

Key characteristics of tuberculosis and malaria:

| **Aspect** | **Tuberculosis (TB)** | **Malaria** |
|-|-|-|
| Burden | TB remains a major public health concern, with Indonesia having one of the highest burdens globally [^1148ETWS]. | Malaria is endemic in many regions, particularly in eastern Indonesia [^113cnRPB]. |
| Trends | Incidence and mortality have declined, but multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses significant challenges [^notfound]. | Incidence has declined significantly due to control efforts, but Plasmodium vivax remains a major challenge due to its relapsing nature and chloroquine resistance [^113cnRPB]. |
| Regional disparities | Higher incidence in eastern provinces, particularly Papua and West Papua [^notfound]. | Higher incidence in eastern provinces, including Papua, West Papua, and East Nusa Tenggara [^111LpqVp]. |

---

### Dengue fever

Dengue is endemic nationwide, with **cyclical outbreaks** every 3–4 years [^113pumAG]. Incidence fluctuates with climate and urbanization, and case fatality has declined with improved clinical management. Urban areas — especially Java and Bali — experience higher incidence [^notfound].

---

### Hepatitis B and C

Hepatitis B and C are major causes of liver disease, including **hepatocellular carcinoma** [^notfound]. Chronic **hepatitis B** prevalence is high, and **hepatitis C** is a growing concern [^notfound]. Both are significant nationwide, with higher prevalence in certain high-risk populations [^notfound].

---

## Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)

### Cardiovascular diseases (CVD)

- **Burden**: CVDs, including ischemic heart disease and stroke, are the leading causes of death and disability in Indonesia [^112Xt3Xw].
- **Trends**: Increasing burden due to lifestyle changes, urbanization, and aging population [^116xS2B6] [^117A1veQ].
- **Risk factors**: Hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity are major contributors [^notfound].

---

### Diabetes mellitus

- **Burden**: Diabetes is a rapidly growing public health issue, with prevalence increasing significantly over the past decades [^111SK4uz].
- **Trends**: Rising incidence linked to obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and dietary changes [^114qaiek].
- **Complications**: High rates of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular complications [^111qqpW9].

---

### Cancer

Common cancers include **breast, cervical, lung, colorectal, and liver cancer** [^notfound]. Incidence is rising, **particularly for breast and colorectal cancers**, due to lifestyle changes and aging. Urban areas generally have **higher incidence than rural regions** [^notfound].

---

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

COPD prevalence is significant, driven largely by **tobacco smoking** and air pollution [^111965R9]. The burden is increasing, particularly among men and in urban areas [^111965R9].

---

## Maternal and child health

### Maternal mortality

The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has declined but remains **among the highest in Southeast Asia** [^1115BdLE]. Hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and indirect causes such as anemia and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of maternal death [^1115BdLE]. MMR is significantly higher in eastern provinces compared to Java and Bali [^1115BdLE].

---

### Infant and child mortality

Infant and child mortality rates have declined significantly, but **neonatal mortality remains high** [^112Xt3Xw]. Prematurity, birth asphyxia, and congenital anomalies are major causes of infant mortality. Higher mortality rates are observed in eastern provinces and remote areas [^113Niofr].

---

## Regional disparities

Significant **regional disparities** exist in health outcomes, with western provinces (Java, Bali) generally performing better than eastern provinces (Papua, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara) [^113Niofr]. These disparities reflect differences in socioeconomic development, healthcare infrastructure, and access to services [^116BbeXs].

---

## Risk factors

- **Tobacco smoking**: High prevalence among males, contributing significantly to NCDs [^116KQdbX].
- **Hypertension and obesity**: Increasing prevalence, particularly in urban areas [^notfound].
- **Dietary risks**: Poor diet quality, high salt intake, and low fruit and vegetable consumption [^notfound].
- **Physical inactivity**: Sedentary lifestyle increasingly common, particularly in urban settings [^notfound].

---

## Healthcare system and infrastructure

- **Universal health coverage**: The Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) program has expanded access to healthcare services, but challenges remain in quality and equity [^112Xt3Xw] [^116yso7H].
- **Healthcare workforce**: Shortages of healthcare professionals, particularly in rural and remote areas [^notfound].
- **Infrastructure**: Significant disparities in healthcare infrastructure, with better facilities concentrated in urban and western regions [^117A1veQ].

---

## Emerging health threats

- **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**: Increasing prevalence of resistant pathogens, posing a significant threat to public health [^116yso7H].
- **Climate change**: Expected to exacerbate infectious diseases, malnutrition, and other health issues [^113yma54].
- **Non-communicable diseases**: Rapidly increasing burden due to lifestyle changes and aging population [^116xS2B6].

---

Indonesia faces a complex disease burden characterized by a **double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases**, significant regional disparities, and evolving risk factors. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive strategies, including strengthening healthcare infrastructure, improving access and quality of care, and implementing effective public health interventions.

### The epidemiology and burden of cardiovascular diseases in countries of the association of southeast Asian nations (ASEAN), 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^113mThkR]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Consistent with the global trends, male individuals in ASEAN bore a disproportionate share of the cardiovascular disease burden. Males are more prone to harmful behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and poor dietary habits compared with female individuals. Conversely, sex-specific protective factors, such as endogenous oestrogens, might explain the lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in females. The largest sex disparities were observed in Singapore and Viet Nam. In Singapore, overweight and obesity were 1.3 times more common in males than in females. In Viet Nam, males had faster increases in systolic blood pressure and BMI than females, along with widespread alcohol consumption issues. In Indonesia, cardiovascular disease prevalence gaps between males and females were narrower, despite higher male smoking rates, possibly due to a greater burden of metabolic syndrome in female individuals. However, the higher prevalence and burden in males should not be construed as cardiovascular diseases being less important in females. In fact, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity among females in ASEAN. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive reforms that extend beyond guaranteeing health coverage to tackle entrenched gender inequities.

### The state of health in Indonesia's provinces, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^116BbeXs]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

GBD 2019 can serve as a baseline for tracking future health trends as Indonesia continues to battle COVID-19. Indonesia has been a regional epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic in southeast Asia. Vaccine production and vaccination continue as authorities try to meet the benchmarks set by the ambitious plan rolled out by the central government. The government has responded to the economic fallout from the virus through a series of reform bills and stimulus programmes. The long-term health consequences of the pandemic are not yet known. From immunisations to preventive services, the pandemic will have a significant impact on Indonesia's health-care system, and GBD 2019 allows us to track these developments over time. Future GBD data will enable health officials at all levels of administration to evaluate the performance of health systems in Indonesia before the onset of the pandemic and after.

Given the scope of our analysis, this study has several limitations. The overall limitations of the GBD methods as noted in other publications apply to this Indonesia analysis. The accuracy of the estimates depends on the availability of data by period. Second, it is challenging to separate measurement error from variation in disease occurrence. GBD corrects for known bias from non-reference methods or case definitions, but often must rely on sparse data to make those adjustments. Third, GBD includes risk–outcome pairs that meet the World Cancer Research Fund criteria of causality. However, some risk–outcome pairs might not meet criteria that developed as evidence from new studies are published. Fourth, some of the data used in the analyses has a lower quality and consistency across sex and age groups. GBD 2019 reports 95% UIs to provide the effect of this limitation on the estimates.

The study revealed large disparities in the burden of disease among provinces in Indonesia. Although some of these disparities are expected because of differences in socioeconomic status, resources, and geography of the provinces, the variable rates of health gains and losses for many provinces is a concern. Our findings contribute to the development and implementation of provincial health plans for future planning cycles to address the leading challenges and ensure health equity during the current pandemic and beyond. Empirical studies in several health and scientific fields will complement GBD and help shore up the evidence base for health experts and policy decision makers.

### Dengue viruses circulating in Indonesia: a systematic review and phylogenetic analysis of data from five decades [^113pumAG]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although epidemiological and molecular epidemiological (serotype, genotype, and lineage information) data are available for several major cities in Indonesia, there is yet to be a comprehensive national study of dengue in Indonesia over time. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive epidemiology of circulating dengue viruses (DENV) in Indonesia between 1973 and 2016. This was conducted through a systematic review of the literature and phylogenetic analysis of available DENV sequences. Available data from National Disease Surveillance System have indicated an increasing trend of dengue incidence in Indonesia over the past 50 years. Incidence rates appear to be cyclic, peaking approximately every 6 to 8 years. In contrast, the case fatality rate has decreased approximately by half with each decade since 1980. Over this 50-year time span, serotype shifts, genotype displacement within DENV-1 and DENV-2, and introduction of DENV-1 and DENV-3 genotype from other countries occurred. These events were associated with increased incidence of dengue cases. Our study also provides a valuable national snapshot of DENV genetic diversity in Indonesia that may contribute to development of more effective dengue vaccine compositions for the region.

Summary

Background

Analysing trends and levels of the burden of disease at the national level can mask inequalities in health-related progress in lower administrative units such as provinces and districts. We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to analyse health patterns in Indonesia at the provincial level between 1990 and 2019. Long-term analyses of disease burden provide insights on Indonesia's advance to universal health coverage and its ability to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Methods

We analysed GBD 2019 estimated cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, and risk factors for 286 causes of death, 369 causes of non-fatal health loss, and 87 risk factors by year, age, and sex for Indonesia and its 34 provinces from 1990 to 2019. To generate estimates for Indonesia at the national level, we used 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators, 317 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death, 689 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes, 250 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors, and 1641 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. For subnational estimates, we used the following source counts: 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators; 5848 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death; 1534 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes; 650 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors; and 16 016 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. We generated our GBD 2019 estimates for Indonesia by including 1 915 207 total source metadata rows, and we used 821 total citations.

Findings

Life expectancy for males across Indonesia increased from 62.5 years (95% uncertainty interval 61.3–63.7) to 69.4 years (67.2–71.6) between 1990 and 2019, a positive change of 6.9 years. For females during the same period, life expectancy increased from 65.7 years (64.5–66.8) to 73.5 years (71.6–75.6), an increase of 7.8 years. There were large disparities in health outcomes among provinces. In 2019, Bali had the highest life expectancy at birth for males (74.4 years, 70.90–77.9) and North Kalimantan had the highest life expectancy at birth for females (77.7 years, 74.7–81.2), whereas Papua had the lowest life expectancy at birth for males (64.5 years, 60.9–68.2) and North Maluku had the lowest life expectancy at birth for females (64.0 years, 60.7–67.3). The difference in life expectancy for males between the highest-ranked and lowest-ranked provinces was 9.9 years and the difference in life expectacy for females between the highest-ranked and lowest-ranked provinces was 13.7 years. Age-standardised death, YLL, and YLD rates also varied widely among the provinces in 2019. High systolic blood pressure, tobacco, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high BMI were the five leading risks contributing to health loss measured as DALYs in 2019.

Interpretation

Our findings highlight that Indonesia faces a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases that varies across provinces. From 1990 to 2019, Indonesia witnessed a decline in the infectious disease burden, although communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections have remained a main source of DALYs in Indonesia. During that same period, however, all-ages death and disability rates from non-communicable diseases and exposure to their risk factors accounted for larger shares of health loss. The differences in health outcomes between the highest-performing and lowest-performing provinces have also widened since 1990. Our findings support a comprehensive process to revisit current health policies, examine the root causes of variation in the burden of disease among provinces, and strengthen programmes and policies aimed at reducing disparities across the country.

### Trends and causes of maternal mortality in Indonesia: a systematic review [^1115BdLE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Indonesia is among the highest in Southeast Asia. We aim to describe trends in the MMR and causes of maternal deaths in Indonesia over the past decades, regionally and nationally.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and conducted a search using PubMed, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Cochrane, Portal Garuda, and Google Scholar from the inception of the database to April 2023. We included all studies on the incidence and/or the causes of maternal deaths in Indonesia. The MMR was defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal death causes were assessed and reclassified according to the WHO International Classification of Disease Maternal Mortality (ICD-MM).

Results

We included 63 studies that reported the MMR (54 studies) and/or the causes of maternal deaths (44 studies) in Indonesia from 1970 to 2022, with a total of 254,796 maternal deaths. The national MMR declined from 450 to 249 (45%) between 1990 and 2020. Great differences in MMR exist across the country, with the lowest in Java-Bali and the highest (more than twice the national MMR) in Sulawesi and Eastern Indonesia. Between 1990 and 2022, the proportion of deaths due to hemorrhage and sepsis decreased, respectively from 48 to 18% and 15–5%, while the share of deaths due to hypertensive disorders and non-obstetric causes increased, respectively from 8 to 19% and 10–49%.

Conclusion

Despite the steady decline of maternal deaths in Indonesia, it remains one of the highest in Southeast Asia, with enormous disparities within the country. Hypertensive disorders and non-communicable diseases make up a growing share of maternal deaths, making maternal death reduction strategies increasingly challenging. National Maternal Death Surveillance and Response needs to be prioritized to eliminate preventable maternal deaths in Indonesia.

### Historical epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in select countries-volume 3 [^116p32th]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2015). Low credibility.

Detailed, country-specific epidemiological data are needed to characterize the burden of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection around the world. With new treatment options available, policy makers and public health officials must reconsider national strategies for infection control. In this study of 15 countries, published and unpublished data on HCV prevalence, viraemia, genotype, age and gender distribution, liver transplants and diagnosis and treatment rates were gathered from the literature and validated by expert consensus in each country. Viraemic prevalence in this study ranged from 0.2% in Iran and Lebanon to 4.2% in Pakistan. The largest viraemic populations were in Pakistan (7 001 000 cases) and Indonesia (3 187 000 cases). Injection drug use (IDU) and a historically unsafe blood supply were major risk factors in most countries. Diagnosis, treatment and liver transplant rates varied widely between countries. However, comparison across countries was difficult as the number of cases changes over time. Access to reliable data on measures such as these is critical for the development of future strategies to manage the disease burden.

### The α-fetoprotein serum is still reliable as a biomarker for the surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma in Indonesia [^113QH1WU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide with an inferior prognosis. In Indonesia, the average life expectancy is less than 5months, with most patients being in an advanced stage wherein the survival rate is very low. Early detection through surveillance program is very crucial. HCC guidelines worldwide have provided surveillance recommendation through the examination of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound for patients at risk in developing HCC. However, there have been some controversies regarding the usage of AFP concerning its low sensitivity and specificity in detecting HCC. Therefore, the effectiveness of AFP in the surveillance of HCC patients and identifying the parameters most associated with the increase of AFP ≥ 10ng/ml in Indonesia should be evaluated.

Methods

We analyzed medical records of HCC patients and those at high risk of developing HCC through cross-sectional study, including patients with cirrhosis and hepatitis B and C, from 2015 to 2017 who underwent treatment at the Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital and Dharmais National Cancer Hospital, Indonesia.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of AFP in the surveillance of HCC in Indonesia with a cut-off of 10ng/ml were 82.6 and 71.2%, respectively. The parameters most associated with the increase of AFP ≥ 10ng/ml according to multivariate analysis were the etiology of hepatitis B, the stage of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B and C, and the presence of cirrhosis, respectively.

Conclusion

AFP can still be used in the surveillance of HCC in Indonesia for its high sensitivity value.

### The epidemiology and burden of smoking in countries of the association of southeast Asian nations (ASEAN), 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^116KQdbX]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we leveraged the systematic analysis from GBD 2021 to offer a longitudinal perspective on smoking prevalence and its resulting disease burden across the ASEAN region. Our findings revealed an intricate landscape of the progress and setbacks in battling the smoking epidemic in the region between 1990 and 2021. Although some countries have made commendable progress in curbing smoking prevalence, others struggled. Overall, smoking prevalence remains high across the ASEAN region. As of 2021, there were 137 million current smokers aged 15 years and older, with age-standardised prevalence of 48.4% among males and 4.47% among females. Most countries observed a decline in smoking prevalence among males; however, in Laos, no substantial change was observed, and in Indonesia, a substantial increase was found. Although six of the ten member states have achieved substantial declines in female smoking prevalence over the time period studied, no substantial change was observed in the other countries.

Based on the historical trend of smoking prevalence, the tobacco epidemic in each of the ASEAN countries can be categorised into a specific phase. As proposed by Dai and colleagues, the tobacco epidemic can be roughly delineated into four distinct phases: the incipient phase, characterised by low prevalence; a second phase marked by increasing prevalence without noticeable decline; a third phase in which signs of decline emerge, yet prevalence remains high; and a fourth phase in which prevalence has decreased to relatively low levels. ASEAN member countries are found at varied stages of this tobacco epidemic. For male smoking prevalence, Indonesia is in the second phase, trailing behind the majority. Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam have advanced to the third phase. Only Singapore has reached the fourth phase of the tobacco epidemic among males. For females, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam remain in the incipient stage; Brunei, Cambodia, and Laos are positioned in the second phase; and Myanmar, the Philippines, and Singapore have advanced to the fourth phase of the epidemic.

### Trends and causes of maternal mortality in Indonesia: a systematic review [^115HNMhB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration principles and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines (PRISMA) (see supplementary file 1). We registered the study protocol in PROSPERO [CRD42022320213] on May 25th, 2022.

Setting

Indonesia is an ethnically, culturally, and economically diverse country with a population of more than 270 million people, broadly dispersed over 16,000 islands. For this review, we divided Indonesia into five regions: Java and Bali, Sumatera, Sulawesi, the Eastern part of Indonesia, and Kalimantan, each with several provinces (Fig. 2).

The population density differs across the regions, as well as the density of health facilities and services, with the most health facilities in Java and Bali and the least in Sulawesi and the Eastern part of Indonesia. Per 100,000 people, there are 2–7 primary health centers (hereafter referred to as Puskesmas), one hospital, 50–60 doctors, two gynecologists, and 70–160 midwives. The number of health services per number of inhabitants in Java and Bali is similar to that of other regions in the country. Yet, the density of health facilities per square kilometer (km), and thus the distance and time people must travel to a health center, is significantly different. The average distance to a primary health center is 3 km, and to a hospital is 12 km (0.5 km in Java and Bali, 29 km in Sulawesi).

Indonesia has national health coverage, currently covering 90% of the total population. The remaining 10% have private health insurance or no insurance. People with a high-middle income pay a monthly fee, while poor people are fully subsidized. Insurance covers almost all health services, including antenatal care and delivery.

Health care in Indonesia is based on a primary health care concept, where Puskesmas are the basic health care facilities, supported by hospitals and other community-based health facilities, from village to national level. Puskesmas offer antenatal care (ANC) and assistance with uncomplicated births and refer patients with complications to the hospital. All maternal deaths in the community and in health facilities are registered at the district health office and sent to the provincial office, and finally to the national office. No data is available on the proportion of births and maternal deaths in the Puskesmas specifically.

### Impact of coming demographic changes on the number of adults in need of care for hypertension in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa [^111Pwrqi]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the coming decades, middle-income countries are expected to undergo substantial demographic changes. We estimated the consequences of these changes on the number of adults in need of hypertension care between 2015 and 2050 using nationally representative household-survey data collected in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa (N = 770121). To reflect unmet need for healthcare, we defined hypertension as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg regardless of treatment status. Using a mathematical disease projection equation, we calculated the change in the number of individuals in need of hypertension care in each country that was due to changes in population size, age composition, and age-specific prevalence under various epidemiological scenarios. If the current age-specific prevalence schedule of hypertension remains unchanged until 2050, demographic changes alone will increase the number of adults in need of hypertension care by 319.7 million individuals, ranging from a relative growth of 55% in China to 151% in Mexico. Even if the age-specific prevalence of hypertension is reduced by 25% by 2050 among adults aged ≥ 40 years, the number of individuals in need of hypertension care will still increase by 145.9 million individuals, with relative increases ranging from 16% in China to 88% in Mexico. Overall, our results suggest that coming demographic changes in middle-income countries will overpower even ideal prevention efforts. Middle-income countries will need to massively expand healthcare services for aging-related diseases, such as hypertension, if they are to meet the virtually inevitable future increase in care needs for these conditions.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of low-sodium potassium-rich salt substitutes in Indonesia: an equity modelling study [^116SKvLh]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Policy implementation costs included program costs and incremental reformulation costs (switching from regular salt to LSSS). We used the WHO NCD Costing Tool to estimate program costs. This included policy development, monitoring and evaluation, human resources for law enforcement and program management, mass media and promotion, office capacity supplies and administration. To estimate reformulation costs, we used official 2019 data on salt production, importation, and consumption in Indonesia to estimate the cost of regular salt currently consumed. Using the price ratio of manufacturing salt substitutes in the east Asia region, we calculated the incremental reformulation costs to LSSS alternatives.

Healthcare costs are based on data from the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional) program managed by the Indonesian Social Security Agency for Health (Badan Penyelengara Jaminan Sosial–BPJS Kesehatan). We estimated the sex-specific and age-specific average healthcare costs for treating each prevalent case of CVD and CKD per year. Data on overall health expenditure was obtained from the Indonesian National Health Accounts 2019. To account for the extra healthcare costs accrued to people living longer due to the LSSS intervention, we subtracted the age-group and sex-specific healthcare costs for the modelled cardiovascular and renal diseases from the total age- and sex-specific health expenditure estimates. These were then applied to the population alive in the lifetable to estimate the future costs for other unrelated diseases (details on input data in Supplementary File).

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Routinely collected health statistics from Indonesia have informed previous Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies, which, in 2016, estimated health loss for 333 causes of death and disability and 84 risk factors in 195 locations from 1990 to 2016. Since 1990, Indonesia has completed many nationally representative surveys and censuses; the GBD studies include these and other data subjected to rigorous inclusion criteria in the estimation process. Yet, outside of the GBD studies, health data in Indonesia are infrequently aggregated in a systematic manner, and the full range of diseases, injuries, and risk factors is not consistently captured. Because of the country's size, diversity, and widespread socioeconomic disparities, the comprehensive analytic framework of the GBD studies can yield improved population health measurement.

Added value of this study

This analysis represents the largest systematic effort to date to quantify levels and long-term trends in mortality, disability, and risk-attributable burden of diseases and injuries in Indonesia. The GBD 2016 study allows for comprehensive comparisons across time and between comparator countries, providing new insights into health trends and identifying areas meriting heightened policy attention. GBD 2016 made substantial methodological improvements from GBD 2015, and included estimates for an additional 21 causes of death and disability. Our study comes at a crucial time for benchmarking and priority setting for health spending and programme development in Indonesia, as the country moves towards implementing universal health care by 2019.

Implications of all the available evidence

Health in Indonesia has substantially improved since 1990. However, these improvements have not been homogeneous and a double burden of communicable and non-communicable disease is placing increasing strain on the nation's health system and consequently its ambitious efforts to achieve universal health care. Data reflecting regional differences are needed to target improvements to specific areas that are lagging behind or have distinctive challenges. In tandem with more integrated models of service delivery, an emphasis on the early detection and prevention of non-communicable diseases and risk factors might help to alter the course of Indonesia's growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases and related disability. In particular, high levels of tobacco smoking threaten to undermine progress and increase already high rates of tobacco-related death and disability.

### The prevalence, genetic complexity and population-specific founder effects of human autosomal recessive disorders [^113rahuc]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Autosomal recessive (AR) disorders pose a significant burden for public health. However, despite their clinical importance, epidemiology and molecular genetics of many AR diseases remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed the genetic variability of 508 genes associated with AR disorders based on sequencing data from 141,456 individuals across seven ethnogeographic groups by integrating variants with documented pathogenicity from ClinVar, with stringent functionality predictions for variants with unknown pathogenicity. We first validated our model using 85 diseases for which population-specific prevalence data were available and found that our estimates strongly correlated with the respective clinically observed disease frequencies (r = 0.68; p < 0.0001). We found striking differences in population-specific disease prevalence with 101 AR diseases (27%) being limited to specific populations, while an additional 305 diseases (68%) differed more than tenfold across major ethnogeographic groups. Furthermore, by analyzing genetic AR disease complexity, we confirm founder effects for cystic fibrosis and Stargardt disease, and provide strong evidences for > 25 additional population-specific founder mutations. The presented analyses reveal the molecular genetics of AR diseases with unprecedented resolution and provide insights into epidemiology, complexity, and population-specific founder effects. These data can serve as a powerful resource for clinical geneticists to inform population-adjusted genetic screening programs, particularly in otherwise understudied ethnogeographic groups.

### On the road to universal health care in Indonesia, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^112Q4W4J]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Non-communicable diseases comprised six of the leading ten causes of DALYs in 2016, compared with three in 1990 (figure 3). Ischaemic heart disease became the leading cause in 2006, with the total number of DALYs increasing by 57.3% (95% UI 44.5 to 70.0) between 1990 (3.76 million [95% UI 3.41 to 4.20]) and 2006 (5.90 million [5.63 to 6.22]). It remained the leading cause in 2016, having increased an additional 10.5% (5.43 to 16.3) between 2006 and 2016 to 6.52 million (6.18 to 6.88). DALYs from cerebrovascular disease also increased substantially between 1990 and 2006 (by 55.4% [46.3 to 66.3], from 2.56 million [2.37 to 2.75] to 3.98 million [3.80 to 4.17]) and 2006 and 2016 (by 30.2% [24.3 to 36.1], to 5.18 million [4.89 to 5.49]), rising from the eighth leading cause in 1990 to the second in 2016. Despite large increases in total DALYs, age-standardised rates for these conditions have remained stable; from 2006 to 2016, age-standardised rates of cerebrovascular disease increased by just 1.2% (−3.4 to 5.8) from 2.75 thousand (2.61 to 2.90) to 2.78 thousand (2.62 to 2.96), whereas age-standardised rates of ischaemic heart disease dropped by 14.8% (10.3 to 18.7), from 4.03 thousand (3.83 to 4.25) to 3.43 thousand (3.24 to 3.62). The exception to this pattern is diabetes, for which the number of DALYs increased between 2006 and 2016 by 54.9% (48.8 to 61.0), from 2.16 million (1.93 to 2.44) to 3.35 million (2.97 to 3.80), and age-standardised rates increased by 17.6% (12.8 to 22.4), from 1.35 thousand (1.21 to 1.50) to 1.58 thousand (1.41 to 1.77), making it the third leading cause of DALYs in 2016.

Methods

Overview

For this analysis, Indonesia-specific estimates of life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and related risk factors are reported along with national estimates from seven comparator countries to facilitate comparison and benchmarking between 1990 and 2016. Brazil, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam were chosen as comparator countries on the basis of their geographical proximity, similar sociodemographic levels, or the presence of Muslim majority in the population.

This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting, shown in the appendix (pp 2–6). Additional information on all data sources used in GBD 2016 can be found on the. GBD 2016 results for all years and locations can be explored further with.

Mortality

Cause-specific mortality was estimated for each age, sex, location, and year. Data were evaluated for completeness and misclassification, and cleaned, disaggregated, and mapped to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Deaths with non-specific or impossible codes, termed garbage codes, were redistributed to appropriate ICD codes by level in the GBD hierarchy prior to modelling. A complete list of data used to generate mortality estimates for Indonesia can be found in the appendix (pp 7–15). The most commonly used estimation method for cause-specific mortality was cause of death ensemble modelling using the GBD cause of death database. This process is explained in more detail in the appendix (p 16). YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of deaths in each age group by a reference life expectancy from analyses of all-cause mortality.

Morbidity

For each combination of age, sex, year, and location, most prevalence and incidence estimates were generated using Bayesian meta-regression methods (DisMod-MR 2.1, as described in the appendix, p 16), with cause-specific exceptions outlined in other publications.YLDs were subsequently calculated by taking into account disease severity, exclusivity, and comorbidity; further details on the calculation can be found in the appendix (p 16).

### The state of health in Indonesia's provinces, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^114BhDQs]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Combined health loss and healthy life expectancy

The sum of YLLsand YLDsfor each location, year, age group, sex, and cause is equal to DALYs, a measure of overall health loss. DALYs combine both mortality and morbidity metrics to provide a standard metric to compare different causes of health loss. We used the Sullivan method to calculate HALE. Detailed methods of DALYs and HALE are available elsewhere.

Risk factors

GBD risk factors were organised hierarchically into three broad categories comprising behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational risk factors. The disaggregation of these three types of risk factor into more refined categories allowed for comparisons at a lower level of abstraction. We used the GBD comparative risk assessment framework to estimate exposure to risk factors and deaths, as well as DALYs, by age, sex, location, and year. Additionally, for each risk, we produced a summary exposure value (SEV): a risk-weighted prevalence of an exposure. SEVs range from 0% to 100%, in which 0% reflected no risk exposure in a population and 100% indicated that an entire population was exposed to the maximum possible level for that risk. A detailed methodology on risk factors computation was previously published.

Decomposition of change

By adapting a method from Das Gupta, we decomposed the number of deaths by cause from 1990 to 2019 using population growth figures, age-based population changes, and shifts in cause-specific mortality rates. We used counterfactual scenarios to calculate the fraction of change in deaths by cause for each of the three components by changing the level of one component at a time and keeping the other two inputs constant during the entire period of study.

Uncertainty analysis

We applied the technique for propagating uncertainty used for GBD 2019. We used 1000 draws by age, sex, location, and year in every step of the computation process to calculate the uncertainty interval (UI). To generate a 95% UI, we used the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Calculations of point estimates used the means of the draws. A posterior probability of change of at least 95% defined statistically significant trends over time.

### The state of health in Indonesia's provinces, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^113Niofr]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Our analysis reveals substantial health inequalities across provinces. Western provinces have higher ranks overall in health development indices compared to eastern regions. North Kalimantan, Bali, Jakarta, and other western provinces ranked consistently high on all indicators, whereas eastern provinces, including Papua and North Maluku, tended to appear near the bottom in most categories. For example, according to Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index estimates, the 14 provinces that had an HAQ Index higher than the national mean value of Indonesia were largely in the western part of the country, whereas the remaining 20 provinces that had HAQ Index values lower than the national estimate are mostly concentrated in the east (appendix 2 p 9).HALE for male and female sexes in the two highest-performing provinces, Bali and North Kalimantan, was 65.8 and 64.9 years, respectively. HALE in the two lowest-performing provinces, Papua and North Maluku, was 57.3 and 58.5, respectively — a difference of 8.5 years between Bali and North Kalimantan and 6.4 years between Papua and North Maluku. Likewise, average life expectancy for the three highest-ranking provinces (Bali, North Kalimantan, and Jakarta) was 74.26 — or 8.02 more years of life expectancy than the three lowest-ranking provinces (Papua, North Maluku, and West Sulawesi), which have an average life expectancy of 66.24 years. The accuracy and usefulness of estimates of health and health loss for each province in Indonesia could be enhanced by generating evidence at the district and municipal levels. A look at health variations within a province at finer geospatial levels is necessary to identify hot spots for targeted interventions.

### Description of the cross-cultural process adopted in the STRiDE (STrengthening responses to dementia in DEveloping countries) program: a methodological overview [^1167nD1q]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 The STRiDE toolkit

Few low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) have data on dementia prevalence obtained directly from their own populations. One element of the STRiDE programme aims to fill this gap by generating new prevalence evidence in two (South Africa and Indonesia) of the seven STRiDE countries (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Mexico, and South Africa).

We have reported information about STRiDE and the choice of countries elsewhereand, following this review process, South Africa and Indonesia were selected to capture novel data on the prevalence, costs, and impact of dementia. Both countries were identified as having a need for high‐quality prevalence data. Preliminary evidence from local studies suggest that 352,000 people have dementia in South Africa, and over 1.1 million in Indonesia, highlighting the estimated size of the problem within the countries. Based on the proposed fieldwork methodology, we selected the following settings and languages:
Semi‐rural Limpopo, South Africa — Sepedi
Metropolitan Western Cape, South Africa — Afrikaans, isiXhosa, English
Metropolitan Jakarta, Indonesia — Bahasa Indonesia
Urban and rural North Sumatra, Indonesia — Bahasa Indonesia

The STRiDE toolkit was developed using a systematic, transparent, and iterative process. This process involved regular iterative meetings and is summarized below:
Key outcome domains selected.
Summary of candidate measures presented (including their validity and previous use).
Identification of country‐specific measures from Indonesia and South Africa teams.
Shortlisting and review of hypothetical timings to ensure a fit within an estimated 90‐minute time budget.
Two additional meetings to consolidate and refine measures. Cognitive ability measures were compared to existing healthy cognitive aging studies.
Consultation with the chief investigator of Alzheimer's Disease International's 10/66 research group.

2.2 Ethics

We obtained ethical approvals through London School of Economics and Political Science, alongside approvals from the University of Cape Town and Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia.

### Medication adherence contributes to an improved quality of life in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a cross-sectional study [^1123WuY6]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with a high prevalence world wide. This disease has also been reported to affect the quality of life (QOL) of the patient and their family due to its chronic nature and multi organ involvement. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between adherence to prescribed diabetes medication and diabetes-specific QOL in patients attending Secondary Health Care Facility in Bandung City, Indonesia.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Secondary Health Care Facility in Bandung City, Indonesia. Data were collected between February and April 2014 using consecutive sampling. Adherence was assessed using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale while diabetes-specific-QOL was assessed using the Diabetes 39 instrument.

Results

The results showed that among the patients, 49.4% exhibited low adherence, 29.7% exhibited medium adherence, and 20.9% exhibited high adherence to diabetes medication. Diabetes-specific QOL proved to be highly affected in the sexual functioning domain. Social-burden domain scores were better than overall QOL scores. There was a significant association between adherence and diabetes-specific QOL (p = 0.009) using The Kruskall-Wallis test of significance. The results of the post hoc Mann-Whitney tests (high vs medium adherence, p = 0.084; medium vs low adherence, p = 0.86; and high vs low adherence, p = 0.001) indicated that higher adherence to prescribed diabetes medication contributed to an improved QOL. Multiple regression analysis showed that the predictors of diabetes-specific QOL were adherence and patient income.

Conclusions

Adherence to prescribed medication showed a positive effect on diabetes-specific QOL in patients. Patients with a high adherence to medication had an improved QOL. This result is important not only in developing intervention programs for patients but also in improving their QOL through sustainable health promotion.

### The impact of climate change on child nutrition in Indonesia: a conceptual framework and scoping review of the available evidence [^113yma54]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Background

Climate change is expected to significantly impact child nutrition, worsening global health inequities. Indonesia, a country highly vulnerable to climate change, also faces substantial child malnutrition challenges. However, comprehensive knowledge on climate change's impacts on child nutrition in Indonesia is limited. This study addresses this gap through a scoping review of the scientific evidence on the effects of climate change on child nutrition in Indonesia.

Methods

We developed a conceptual framework based on global literature to guide our systematic search, linking climate change to child nutrition and its determinants in Indonesia. Systematic searches were conducted in English and Indonesian on Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed, supplemented by Google Scholar and citation screening. We included peer-reviewed, Scopus-indexed studies focused on Indonesia, examining either direct or indirect impacts of climate change on child nutrition. A narrative synthesis was performed, structured around outcomes identified in our framework: (1) nutrition-associated conditions, (2) diets and disease, (3) social dynamics and (4) food system shocks.

Results

From 3025 records, 134 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were either multicountry including Indonesia (23%, n = 31), Indonesia-specific across multiple regions (26%, n = 35) or region-specific, mainly focused on Java (22%, n = 29), Sumatra (11%, n = 14), Kalimantan (7%, n = 9) and Sulawesi (7%, n = 9). Other regions were under-represented (5%, n = 7). Most studies used quantitative methods (87%, n = 116). Few studies assessed direct links between climate change and nutritional outcomes (n = 5), food security or dietary quality (n = 7); more focused on indirect pathways such as disease (n = 49), social dynamics (n = 18) and food system disruptions (n = 55).

Conclusions

Evidence suggests significant impacts of climate change on child nutrition in Indonesia, highlighting the need for urgent action. Further localised studies that consider contextual factors, and actions focused on strengthening health and nutrition systems, are critical, especially in regions most vulnerable to both climate change and child malnutrition.

### Hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype in relation to diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases in the Indonesian and Korean populations: evidence from two national surveys [^116Nxi45]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Mean BMI was identical (24.0 kg/m²) and the prevalence of overall obesity was similar in the two countries (37% in Indonesians; 35% in Koreans). Abdominal obesity was also comparable (38% and 36%), although sex discrepancy occurred as more women (56%) than men (21%) had abdominal obesity in Indonesia, whereas the opposite was true for the Korean population (men: 41%, women: 32%).

When examining the lipid profiles, Indonesians had higher serum triglyceride levels [133.2 ± 97.3 mg/dL] than Koreans [121.8 ± 93.8 mg/dL], along with a greater prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (Indonesia: 28%; Korea: 24%). Indonesians also had a higher proportion of individuals with low HDL cholesterol (Indonesia: 41%, Korea: 29%), although elevated total cholesterol was more prevalent in Koreans (Indonesia: 30%, Korea: 39%). The prevalence of the HTGW phenotype was similar in both populations (Indonesia: 14%; Korea: 12%) (Figure 1).

Meanwhile, whereas fasting plasma glucose levels were comparable, the prevalence of DM was slightly higher in Korea (17%) than in Indonesia (13%). Regarding hypertension, the Indonesian population had higher mean systolic [133.4 ± 24.3 mmHg] and diastolic [85.0 ± 13.0 mmHg] blood pressures, as well as a higher prevalence of hypertension (Indonesia 44%; Korea 35%). Self-reported CVD history was slightly lower in Indonesia (4%) than in Korea (6%) (Table 1).

Falciparum OR Unknown Malaria Species from Chloroquine-Sensitive Region (See Comments for Link to Resistance Map), chloroquine phosphate is dosed as: 16.6 mg/kg body weight (10 mg/kg body weight chloroquine base) (maximum 1,000 mg) by mouth once, then 8.3 mg/kg body weight (maximum 500 mg) by mouth at 6, 24, and 48 hours (total dose = 41.6 mg/kg body weight chloroquine phosphate [maximum 2,500 mg] = 25 mg/kg body weight chloroquine base). For P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi (All Areas Except Papua New Guinea, Indonesia; See Comments) Initial Therapy (Followed by Anti-Relapse Therapy for P. ovale and P. vivax), chloroquine phosphate 16.6 mg/kg body weight (10 mg/kg body weight chloroquine base) (maximum 1,000 mg) by mouth once, then 8.3 mg/kg body weight (maximum 500 mg) by mouth at 6, 24, and 48 hours (total dose = 41.6 mg/kg body weight chloroquine phosphate [maximum 2,500 mg] = 25 mg/kg body weight chloroquine base) is listed. Because high treatment failure rates due to chloroquine-resistant P. vivax have been documented in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, "treatment should be selected from one of the three following options": atovaquone-proguanil plus primaquine phosphate; quinine sulfate plus either doxycycline or tetracycline plus primaquine phosphate (this regimen cannot be used in children aged < 8 years); or mefloquine plus primaquine phosphate.

### Emergence of melioidosis in Indonesia [^116Mufex]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Melioidosis is known to be highly endemic in parts of southeast Asia and northern Australia; however, cases are rarely reported in Indonesia. Here we report three cases of melioidosis in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia occurring between 2013 and 2014. Two patients died and the other was lost to follow-up. Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates from all three cases were identified by the VITEK2 Compact installed in the hospital in 2012. None of the three patients reported received antimicrobials recommended for melioidosis because of the delayed recognition of the organism. We reviewed the literature and found only seven reports of melioidosis in Indonesia. Five were reported before 1960. We suggest that melioidosis is endemic throughout Indonesia but currently under-recognized. Training on how to identify B. pseudomallei accurately and safely in all available microbiological facilities should be provided, and consideration should be given to making melioidosis a notifiable disease in Indonesia.

Methods

Overview

GBD 2019 estimated disease burden for 286 causes of death, 369 non-fatal causes of disability, and 87 risk factors for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. To generate estimates for Indonesia at the national level, we used 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators, 317 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death, 689 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes, 250 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors, and 1641 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. For the subnational level, we used 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators, 5848 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death, 1534 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes, 650 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors, and 16 016 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. GBD 2019 estimates for Indonesia included 1 915 207 total source metadata rows, and we used 821 total citations. Estimates of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy (HALE), and related risk factors are reported between 1990 and 2019. Indonesian national estimates are equal to the sum of all subnational values. GBD 2019 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. All data sources used in the study are available on theand a.

Indonesian geographical units

We applied the standard GBD subnational estimation process to estimate all metrics by province of Indonesia from 1990 to 2019. To make accurate comparisons, data were adjusted to fit provincial and national boundaries for 2019 for the entire period. We modified the estimation process to account for changes to the national political map that occurred between 1990 and 2019. The former Indonesian province East Timor, which became the sovereign state of Timor-Leste in 2002, was excluded throughout the estimation process (appendix 2 pp 4–5).

### Progress toward measles and rubella elimination-Indonesia, 2013–2022 [^111tPqVQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In 2019, Indonesia and the other countries in the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region adopted the goal of measles and rubella elimination by 2023. This report describes Indonesia's progress toward measles and rubella elimination during 2013–2022. During this period, coverage with a first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) decreased from 87% to 84%, and coverage with a second MCV dose decreased from 76% to 67%. After rubella vaccine was introduced in 2017, coverage with the first dose of rubella-containing vaccine increased approximately fivefold, from 15% in 2017 to 84% in 2022. During 2013–2021, annual reported measles incidence decreased by 95%, from 33.2 to 1.4 cases per million population; reported rubella incidence decreased 89%, from 9.3 to 1.0 cases per million population. However, a large surge in measles and rubella cases occurred in 2022, with a reported measles incidence of 29 cases per million and a reported rubella incidence of 3 per million, primarily related to disruption in immunization services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, approximately 26 million children (an estimated 73% of the target population) received a combined measles- and rubella-containing vaccine during supplementary immunization activities completed in 32 provinces. Progress toward measles and rubella elimination in Indonesia has been made; however, continued and urgent efforts are needed to restore routine immunization services that were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and close immunity gaps to accelerate progress toward measles and rubella elimination.

Implications of all the available evidence

The burden of disease profiles of Indonesia's 34 provinces present complex, granular pictures of subnational health of the fourth-most populous country in the world. Provincial health estimates provide valuable information to tackle the challenges of health policy and governance in the context of a global pandemic. Authority over health and development programmes has been devolved gradually by the central government to provincial and local administrations, which increases the need for estimates of health loss at the subnational level. Providing estimates of the burden of disease at the provincial level enables health professionals, policy makers, and stakeholders to address the leading causes of diseases, injuries, and deaths and to monitor progress on the country's path to UHC and meeting its SDG benchmarks.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a comprehensive overview of health conditions in Indonesia immediately before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Estimates from before COVID-19 create important baselines of disease burden in Indonesia at the national and subnational levels. Setting prepandemic baselines sheds light on the efficacy of policies implemented in Indonesia since 1990 that might otherwise go undetected because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, GBD 2019 provides insights on the uneven development across Indonesian provinces, and the varied successes of governmental programmes and schemes to improve health outcomes throughout 2019. Insights from this and previous GBD studies illuminate the double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases that created the perfect conditions for COVID-19 in Indonesia. Many non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, and their associated risk factors are comorbidities for COVID-19; excess mortality caused by COVID-19 has also been vastly underestimated during the pandemic. The persistence of eradicable infectious diseases in Indonesia, including malaria and tuberculosis, places further stress on the country's health-care system during the crisis. Infectious diseases in Indonesia continue to have a disparate impact on the health of Indonesians compared to many other low-income and middle-income countries. In the previous two decades, the government launched programmes to control tuberculosis, malaria, and other communicable diseases. Addressing the burden of non-communicable diseases, especially stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes, has likewise become prioritised by policy makers and civil society organisations. GBD 2019 estimates can be used to evaluate the overall impact of Indonesian health policy since 1990, and to set future directions for Indonesia and its provinces as the pandemic continues to unfold.

Results

Figs. 1 a and b, and 2 a, b, illustrate various studies from the SA and SEA regions describing the DBM using WHO reference dataset. Prevalence of stunting and obesity ranges from 33.6% to 47.9% and 1.3–7.6% in SA region with the exception of one Sri Lankan study which reports lower prevalence of stunting (17.0%). The prevalence of stunting in SEA ranged from 8.9% in Malaysia to 46.0% in Timor-Leste while the prevalence of obesity varied from 1.9% in Cambodia to 25.6% in Vietnam. The prevalence of stunting was lower by local anthropometric reference datasets of SA and SEA regions as compared to international references like WHO or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Table 2). Also, the prevalence of overweight/obesity was higher in SA and SEA regions by local anthropometric references except for one study each from Thailand (4.3% vs 3.0%) and Pakistan (14.2% vs 13.9%).

Age-standardised prevalence rates, mortality rates, and DALY rates per 100 000 people for cardiovascular diseases from 1990 to 2021

ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations. DALY = disability-adjusted life-years.

Age-standardised prevalence rates were higher in males than in females across ASEAN, except for the Philippines, where the age-standardised cardiovascular disease prevalence rate was higher in females than in males in 2021 (appendix p 34). The largest sex-specific disparities were observed in Singapore and Viet Nam, where age-standardised cardiovascular disease prevalence rates in males were over 1.2 times higher than those in females. In contrast, Indonesia observed the smallest disparities, but both sexes had some of the highest prevalence rates in ASEAN, with estimates of 6107.9 (95% UI 5655.5–6557.4) per 100 000 people in males and 6048.5 (5636.0–6434.9) per 100 000 in females. Age-standardised mortality and DALY rates attributed to cardiovascular diseases were also higher in males than females across ASEAN (appendix pp 35, 36). Singapore and Viet Nam had the largest sex-related disparities in age-standardised mortality (appendix p 35) and DALY rates attributable to cardiovascular diseases (appendix pp 36).

Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi (all areas except Papua New Guinea and Indonesia) initial therapy is chloroquine phosphate 16.6 mg/kg body weight (10 mg/kg body weight chloroquine base) (maximum 1000 mg) by mouth once, then 8.3 mg/kg body weight (maximum 500 mg) by mouth at 6, 24, and 48 hours (total dose = 41.6 mg/kg body weight chloroquine phosphate [maximum 2500 mg] = 25 mg/kg body weight chloroquine base), followed by anti-relapse therapy for P. ovale and P. vivax with primaquine 0.5 mg base/kg body weight (max 30 mg base) by mouth once daily for 14 days; before primaquine is given, G6PD status must be verified, and primaquine may be given in combination with chloroquine when the G6PD status is known and negative, otherwise give after chloroquine (when G6PD status is available). In Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, where high chloroquine-resistant P. vivax treatment failure rates have been documented, treatment should be selected from the following options: atovaquone-proguanil plus primaquine phosphate; quinine sulfate plus EITHER doxycycline OR tetracycline PLUS primaquine phosphate (this regimen cannot be used in children aged < 8 years); or mefloquine plus primaquine phosphate.

### Distribution of catheterisation laboratories in Indonesia 2017–2022: a nationwide survey [^117A1veQ]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Background

Geographical terrains of Indonesia pose a major hindrance to transportation. The difficulty of transportation affects the provision of acute time-dependent therapy such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Also, Indonesia's aging population would have a significant impact on the prevalence of acute coronary syndrome in the next decade. Therefore, the analysis and enhancement of cardiovascular care are crucial. The catheterisation laboratory performs PCI procedures. In the current study, we mapped the number and distribution of catheterisation laboratories in Indonesia.

Methods

A direct survey was used to collect data related to catheterisation laboratory locations in July 2022. The population data was sourced from the Ministry of Home Affairs. The recent growth of catheterisation laboratories was examined and evaluated based on geographical areas. The main instruments for comparing regions and changes throughout time are the ratio of catheterisation laboratories per 100,000 population and the Gini index (a measure of economic and healthcare inequality. Gini index ranges from 0 to 1, with greater values indicating more significant levels of inequality). Regression analysis was carried out to see how the number of catheterisation laboratories was affected by health demand (prevalence) and economic capacity (Gross Domestic Regional Product [GDRP] per Capita).

Findings

The number of catheterisation laboratories in Indonesia significantly increased from 181 to 310 during 2017–2022, with 44 of the 119 new labs built in an area that did not have one. Java has the most catheterisation laboratories (208, 67%). The catheterisation laboratory ratio in the provinces of Indonesia ranges from 0.0 in West Papua and Maluku to 4.46 in Jakarta; the median is 1.09 (IQR 0.71–1.18). The distribution remains a problem, as shown by the high catheterisation laboratory Gini index (0.48). Regression shows that distribution of catheterisation laboratories was significantly affected by GDRP and the prevalence of heart disease.

Interpretation

The number of catheterisation laboratories in Indonesia has increased significantly recently, however, maldistribution remains a concern. To improve Indonesia's cardiovascular emergency services, future development of catheterisation laboratories must be better planned considering the facility's accessibility and density.

Social burden of COPD — disability-adjusted life years (DALY): The DALY for a specific condition is the sum of years lost because of premature mortality and years of life lived with disability, adjusted for the severity of disability. The GBD Study found that from 1990 to 2019, COPD was the primary driver of increased DALY worldwide, especially in LMICs, with the global health burden caused by COPD increasing by 25.7% from 59.2 million DALY in 1990 to 74.4 DALY in 2019, with largest increases in South East Asia, India, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. In 2005 COPD was the eighth leading cause of DALY lost across the world but by 2013 COPD was ranked as the fifth leading cause of DALY lost, and in the United States, COPD is the second leading cause of reduced DALY, trailing only ischemic heart disease. Data from GBD 2017 estimated that the DALY rate was 1068.02/100,000 for COPD.

### Navigating HTA implementation: a review of Indonesia's revised HTA guideline [^114nHNqy]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Indonesia issued the 2017 health technology assessment (HTA) guideline to facilitate researchers conducting economic evaluations based on standardised principles. However, our evaluation revealed no significant differences in adherence to its recommendation between HTA studies conducted before and after the guideline was disseminated (except for outcome choice), and most recommendations were not adopted. We reflected that the guideline was hard to follow, inconsistent, and offered limited justification. Thus, we suggested improving the 2017 HTA guideline, at least in these areas. On December 2022, in response to the rapid development of health technology, the revised guideline was issued with the support of multiple international development agencies.

Here we highlight key items of the revised guideline, outline the potential impact on Indonesia's HTA landscape, and propose suggestions for Indonesia and other countries developing HTA guidelines.

### Accuracy of herdsmen reporting versus serologic testing for estimating foot-and-mouth disease prevalence [^117Bk9ma]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Herdsman-reported disease prevalence is widely used in veterinary epidemiologic studies, especially for diseases with visible external lesions; however, the accuracy of such reports is rarely validated. Thus, we used latent class analysis in a Bayesian framework to compare sensitivity and specificity of herdsman reporting with virus neutralization testing and use of 3 nonstructural protein ELISAs for estimates of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) prevalence on the Adamawa plateau of Cameroon in 2000. Herdsman-reported estimates in this FMD-endemic area were comparable to those obtained from serologic testing. To harness to this cost-effective resource of monitoring emerging infectious diseases, we suggest that estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of herdsmen reporting should be done in parallel with serologic surveys of other animal diseases.

### On the road to universal health care in Indonesia, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^111Me8V7]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Road injuries moved from the ninth leading cause of DALYs in 1990 and 2006 to the eighth in 2016 (figure 3). Although the total number of DALYs from road injuries decreased over both time periods, they remain a leading cause of death and disability. Of the top causes of DALYs in 2016, road injuries and falls were the only injury-related causes to make the list.

When ranking risk factors by the number of age-standardised DALYs they contribute to in Indonesia and comparator countries in 2016, we found that the leading four risk factors in Indonesia also tended to be in the top three or four positions in comparator countries, showing a similar profile of health challenges (figure 4). The leading risk factor in Indonesia, high systolic blood pressure, ranks among the leading three causes in all comparator countries except India and Thailand (figure 4). Dietary risks are among the top five risk factors for all comparators, whereas high fasting plasma glucose is ranked higher in Indonesia than in the rest of the comparators (figure 4). Although tobacco is the fourth leading risk factor in Indonesia, it is among the top three risks in all comparators except Brazil and India (figure 4). Child and maternal malnutrition is ranked fifth in Indonesia, higher than in all the other comparator countries except India (figure 4).

Figure 4
Ranking of age-standardised DALYs attributable to Level 2 risk factors in Indonesia and comparator countries in 2016

DALYs = disability-adjusted life-years.

The ratio of observed YLLs and the number of YLLs that would be expected on the basis of SDI alone increased in Indonesia between 1990 and 2016 for six of the ten leading causes of death (figure 5). The ratio for most leading causes of mortality in Indonesia was between 0.5 and 4.0, with the notable exceptions of diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis (figure 5). Three ratios decreased from 1990 to 2016: neonatal preterm birth complications, lower respiratory infections, and road injuries (figure 5). Similar patterns were seen among comparator countries: all comparators except Thailand and Turkey experienced an increase in the ratio for tuberculosis, although none resulting in a 2016 ratio as high as that of Indonesia (the closest being the Philippines; figure 5). Indonesia also had notably high and increasing ratios for diarrhoeal disease (figure 5).

Research in context

Evidence before this study

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 is a comprehensive analysis of health loss across the globe. Included in GBD 2019 is a quantification of health loss for Indonesia and its provinces from 1990 to 2019. The analysis contains estimates of deaths, years of life lost because of premature mortality, years of life lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years attributable to metabolic, environmental, and occupational and behavioural risk factors at the national and subnational levels. National estimates were published on the basis of previous GBD releases. GBD estimates have been used by the Indonesian government, particularly the Ministry of Health, to examine national-level health performance and progress and to plan, develop, and implement programmes to improve health and eliminate disparities. No previous estimates of total health and health loss in Indonesia at the subnational level have been published.

Added value of this study

Presenting the burden of disease and its trends in Indonesia from 1990 to 2019 at the subnational level provides valuable information for stakeholders to improve health, shape policy, design interventions, and set funding priorities in pursuit of these goals. This is the first study to provide a comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease at the provincial level in Indonesia. Building on the success of previous GBD iterations being used by the Ministry of Health and other governmental agencies in Indonesia, a study of the burden of disease at the provincial level offers decision makers access to more resolved estimates to increase the specificity of policy effects. Since many health policy and management decisions are made at the district level in Indonesia, subnational estimates can better inform resource allocation and policy implementation. Indonesia started a decentralisation process in 1999. Responsibility for many fields of governance, including health, was devolved by the central government to provinces, districts, and municipalities. The latest transfer of power to local authorities came in 2018, when a government regulation vested provincial governors with greater responsibility for health and development programmes. Provincial officials will require reliable health data to make evidence-based decisions about policies and resource allocations that will reduce burden and help the country meet its universal health coverage (UHC) and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets. Moreover, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the value of this GBD benchmarking is enhanced because it provides prepandemic historical context of health at the provincial level in Indonesia.

The overall prevalence of Aspergillus -specific IgG positivity was 30% (64 of 216) at baseline. All (n = 12) patients from the CPA group had positive levels of Aspergillus -specific IgG. In the non-CPA group, 52 (26%) patients showed positive Aspergillus -specific IgG. There was a statistical significance between positive Aspergillus -specific IgG across CPA and non-CPA groups (p < 0.001, median 15.4 (CPA) vs 8.3 (non-CPA)) (table 2).

Nine (4%) patients died before the end of their TB therapy appointment. Eight of them (90%) had extensive infiltrates and/or cavitation in both lungs. Immulite Aspergillus -specific IgG level was positive in four (44%) of these patients. Chronic kidney diseases (n = 3, 33%) and diabetes mellitus (n = 1, 11%) were linked to mortality. One patient with possible CPA with multicavitary TB disease died with no other underlying disease. There were no deaths in patients with proven and probable CPA.

### On the road to universal health care in Indonesia, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^116xS2B6]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, Indonesia has increased life expectancy at birth by 8 years since 1990, primarily through reductions in CMNN diseases. The archipelago is experiencing a double burden of disease at the national level: although changing lifestyles have rapidly increased prevalence of NCDs, there is still a large burden from CMNN diseases. The cost of health-care provision has risen sharply, and with it the cost and difficulty of reaching universal health care. This baseline study provides a better understanding of what risks remain to be targeted and the available opportunities for improvement. Given Indonesia's geographical and socioeconomic diversity, we will probably continue to see very diverse patterns of health and burden of disease across the country. Subnational estimates of the burden of disease will be particularly valuable in tailoring health priorities and programmes to the needs of specific provinces. The political commitment to the ongoing subnational GBD exercise is prudent and will increase the value of these metrics for both public health planning and assessment of progress over time.

Summary

Background

Injuries are among the top causes of mortality and disability in southeast Asia. Although injury prevention is a key health priority in the Post-2015 Health Development Agenda of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the focus was placed solely on road injuries. The absence of a broader recognition of injury burden and trends hinders future intervention efforts. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the burden and epidemiological trends of all injuries across ASEAN countries.

In this analysis of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, we estimated incidence, cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age, sex, location, and year for ten ASEAN member states (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam) from 1990 to 2021. Incidence and non-fatal disease burden were estimated using disease model Bayesian meta-regression (DisMod-MR) 2.1. Mortality was derived from the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble model. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals where appropriate.

Findings

In 2021, an estimated 35.5 million (95% UI 33.5–37.7) injury incident cases were reported in ASEAN, resulting in approximately 317 000 deaths (286 000–350 000). Substantial variation was observed across the region, with the age-standardised mortality ranging from 13.4 per 100 000 people (12.7–14.1) in Singapore to 68.5 per 100 000 (54.4–81.9) in Viet Nam. Road injury was the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in most ASEAN countries, with the highest age-standardised DALY rates in Thailand and Malaysia. Self-harm was the leading cause of mortality in Singapore, whereas interpersonal violence was the leading cause of injury deaths in the Philippines. From 1990 to 2021, the region's age-standardised injury incidence rate declined by 23.0% (21.8–24.1). Age-standardised DALY rates decreased substantially for drowning (60.6% [53.2–66.7]) and road injuries (39.6% [32.1–46.4]), whereas falls saw a smaller and more heterogeneous decline of 12.3% (2.6–21.0) over the past 31 years.

Interpretation

The injury epidemiological landscape in ASEAN is complex, with substantial geographical variations and emerging challenges triggered by the rapid sociodemographic transition in the region. Progress has been uneven. Effective burden reduction across different causes of injury requires strategies addressing the wide range of socioenvironmental determinants and system shortfalls. Prevention programmes need to be customised to each country's unique context and development.

### On the road to universal health care in Indonesia, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^114M5Cq3]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

For the same period, life expectancy at birth increased across the comparator countries on average by 6.6 years for both sexes, ranging from 9.6 years (95% UI 8.8–10.3) in India (from 59.0 years [58.5–59.4] to 68.6 years [67.9–69.1]) to 3.1 years (1.6–4.6) in the Philippines (from 67.0 years [66.4–67.7] to 70.1 years [68.7–71.5]).

Between 1990 and 2016, Indonesia experienced a substantial decline in diseases due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes: total CMNN DALYs declined by 58.6% (95% UI 55.6–61.6) from 43.8 million (95% UI 41.4–46.5) to 18.1 million (16.8–19.6). All-age rates and total CMNN DALYs dipped below those of NCDs in 1996, whereas total NCD DALYs rose substantially (figure 2). Age-standardised rates for CMNN DALYs also decreased substantially (by 65.9% [63.2–68.4]) from 1990 to 2016 (from 22.7 thousand [21.2–24.3] to 7.74 thousand [7.15–8.36]), whereas age-standardised rates for NCD DALYs remained stable across most of the study period but declined slightly from 2010 to 2016 (by 4.4% [2.6–6.2], from 24.1 thousand [21.7–26.6] to 23.1 thousand [20.7–25.6]). Total DALYs from injuries remained fairly stable across the study period, with the exception of the spike in 2004 corresponding to the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. A substantial reduction was observed in crude rates (32.5% [23.5–39.0], from 3.33 thousand [2.94–3.70] to 2.25 thousand [2.04–2.50]), and in age-standardised rates (31.4% [23.4–37.2], from 3.40 thousand [3.01–3.75] to 2.33 thousand [2.12–2.59]).

### Low-grade intestinal metaplasia in Indonesia: insights into the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during Helicobacter pylori infection and unique east-Asian cagA characteristics [^116S4JY2]. Cytokine (2023). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is a major cause of intestinal metaplasia. In this study, we aimed to understand the reason underlying the low grade and incidence of intestinal metaplasia in Indonesia, based on the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines in gastric biopsy specimens. The possible reasons for the lesser virulence of the East-Asian-type CagA in Indonesia than that of the Western-type CagA, which is not common in other countries, were also investigated. The mRNA expression of cytokines was evaluated using real-time PCR. CagA characteristics were analyzed using in silico analysis. The expression of cytokines was typically not robust, among H. pylori-infected subjects in Indonesia, despite them predominantly demonstrating the East-Asian-type CagA. This might partially be explained by the characteristics of the East-Asian-type CagA in Indonesia, which showed a higher instability index and required higher energy to interact with proteins related to the cytokine induction pathway compared with the other types (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Taken together, besides the low prevalence of H. pylori, the low inflammatory response of the host and low CagA virulence, even among populations with high infection rates, may play an essential role in the low grade and low incidence of intestinal metaplasia in Indonesia. We believe that these findings would be relevant for better understanding of intestinal metaplasia, which is closely associated with the development of gastric cancer.

### Influenza virus samples, international law, and global health diplomacy [^116SdCtk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Indonesia's Decision to Withhold Influenza A Virus (H5N1) Samples

This controversy began toward the end of 2006, when Indonesia decided not to share influenza A virus (H5N1) samples with WHO for risk assessment (e.g. surveillance) or risk management (e.g. vaccine development) purposes. Indonesia's decision reportedly stemmed from its reaction to an Australian company's development of an avian influenza vaccine derived from a virus strain that Indonesia provided to WHO. WHO's acknowledgment that patents had been sought on modified versions of influenza (H5N1) samples shared through the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) without the consent of the countries that supplied the samples reinforced Indonesia's discontent. Indonesia argued that this incident exposed inequities in the global influenza surveillance system. Developing countries provided information and virus samples to the WHO-operated system; pharmaceutical companies in industrialized countries then obtained free access to such samples, exploited them, and patented the resulting products, which the developing countries could not afford. Avian influenza's spread and fears about pandemic influenza heightened this perceived inequity; experts argued that developing countries would have little access to vaccine for pandemic influenza without major changes in global vaccine production.

Indonesia's action alarmed the global health community. Indonesia has been hit hard by avian influenza, so its cooperation in tracking the influenza virus (H5N1) was critical. Without access to Indonesia's influenza strains, global surveillance was jeopardized, as was the refinement of diagnostic reagents and the development of intervention strategies, which depend on the information surveillance provides.

Regaining access to Indonesia's samples motivated WHO to try to find a solution to the problem that Indonesia highlighted. In essence, Indonesia was making sample sharing for risk assessment dependent on action taken by WHO and industrialized countries to increase Indonesia's access to influenza vaccines derived from samples it provided. Restarting sample sharing and improving vaccine access proved difficult and contentious. Before the WHA meeting in May 2007, negotiations between Indonesia and WHO did not produce agreement. For example, neither the Joint Statement issued by Indonesia and WHO in February 2007 nor subsequent attempts to end the impasse succeeded. Independent efforts to increase vaccines access, such as the agreement of the United States and Japan in March 2007 to provide $18 million to 6 developing countries (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam) to facilitate the building of vaccine-manufacturing capacity and of a vaccine stockpile, did not alter the stand-off.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^111qqpW9]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) — Among U.S. adults with diabetes aged 40 years and older, DR prevalence is 28.5% (4.2 million people) and vision-threatening DR (VTDR) is 4.4% (0.7 million people); worldwide, DR is 34.6% (93 million people) and VTDR is 10.2% (28 million people). In 2019, 11.8% of adults with diagnosed diabetes reported severe vision difficulty or blindness, and 2021 survey data reported 26.43% DR among people with diabetes and an estimated 1.84 million living with VTDR with a prevalence rate of 5.06%. A global review and meta-analysis reported prevalence of 22.3% for DR, 6.2% for VTDR, and 4.1% for clinically significant macular edema (CSME), with 2020 counts of 103.12 million with DR, 28.54 million with VTDR, and 18.83 million with CSME, increasing by 2045 to 160.50 million, 44.82 million, and 28.61 million, respectively. Regional estimates indicated highest DR prevalence in Africa (35.9%), North America and the Caribbean (33.3%), and the Middle East and North Africa (32.9%), and lowest in South and Central America (13.4%); among patients with diabetes, Hispanic (odds ratio [OR], 2.92) and Middle Eastern (OR, 2.44) individuals had increased DR prevalence compared with Asian individuals. More than 50% of worldwide visual impairment or blindness from DR is estimated to exist in the Asia Pacific region, including 51% of blindness due to DR globally (n = 424,400) and 56% of visual impairment, and prevalence rates among patients with diabetes range from 10% in India to 43% in Indonesia. In the United States, youths with diabetes are projected to increase from 213,000 in 2017 (95% confidence interval [CI] 209,000–218,000) to 239,000 in 2060 (95% CI, 209,000–282,000).

### On the road to universal health care in Indonesia, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^112Xt3Xw]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

As Indonesia moves to provide health coverage for all citizens, understanding patterns of morbidity and mortality is important to allocate resources and address inequality. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 study (GBD 2016) estimates sources of early death and disability, which can inform policies to improve health care.

Methods

We used GBD 2016 results for cause-specific deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, and risk factors for 333 causes in Indonesia and in seven comparator countries. Estimates were produced by location, year, age, and sex using methods outlined in GBD 2016. Using the Socio-demographic Index, we generated expected values for each metric and compared these against observed results.

Findings

In Indonesia between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy increased by 8.0 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 7.3–8.8) to 71.7 years (71.0–72.3): the increase was 7.4 years (6.4–8.6) for males and 8.7 years (7.8–9.5) for females. Total DALYs due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes decreased by 58.6% (95% UI 55.6–61.6), from 43.8 million (95% UI 41.4–46.5) to 18.1 million (16.8–19.6), whereas total DALYs from non-communicable diseases rose. DALYs due to injuries decreased, both in crude rates and in age-standardised rates. The three leading causes of DALYs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary risks were a leading contributor to the DALY burden, accounting for 13.6% (11.8–15.4) of DALYs in 2016.

Interpretation

Over the past 27 years, health across many indicators has improved in Indonesia. Improvements are partly offset by rising deaths and a growing burden of non-communicable diseases. To maintain and increase health gains, further work is needed to identify successful interventions and improve health equity.

### Cardiovascular consequences of childhood secondhand tobacco smoke exposure: prevailing evidence, burden, and racial and socioeconomic disparities: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111HKLNP]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Childhood secondhand smoke exposure — trends and global burden — In US adolescents, a national sample of nonsmoking middle school– and high school–aged adolescents with self-reported exposure to SHS revealed declines in SHS from 59% to 34% between 2000 and 2009, yet the prevalence remains strikingly high, with ≈1 in 3 children in the United States still exposed to SHS. Internationally, a study in rural China identified that 68% of children were exposed to SHS at home, the prevalence of adult SHS exposure is ≈35% in Shanghai but was higher in households with children < 18 years of age, and World Health Organization Global Youth Tobacco Survey data reported home SHS exposure exceeding 70% in 6 sites in India, 69% in Indonesia, and a median of 49% across all surveys. Updated nationwide data showed India in 2009 at 22% and Indonesia in 2014 at 57%, and although public smoke-free bans were instituted in 2007 in Hong Kong and in 2011 in China, evidence from Hong Kong indicates that smoking bans have displaced smoking from public to private spaces, including the home, increasing home SHS exposure in children.

COVID-19 symptomatic population — modeled performance of repeat antigen testing versus standard NAAT: There was no direct evidence comparing consecutive Ag testing vs standard NAAT with a third reference standard, so modeling analysis was performed using a repeat testing algorithm and compared with standard NAAT diagnostic accuracy; for all comparisons, 5%, 20%, and 50% were used for the prevalence of SARS-COV-2 infection in the symptomatic population. Within the first 5 days of symptoms, the modeled sensitivity and specificity for Ag testing and repeat Ag testing (total of 2 Ag tests) were estimated as 98% (95% CI: 97% to 99%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively; standard NAAT pooled data yielded a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%), and comparing the 2 testing strategies estimated 0 to 5 fewer false-negative results with repeat Ag testing compared with standard NAAT, depending on the disease prevalence. For first Ag testing within the first 7 days of symptom onset and repeat testing after 7 days of symptom onset, modeled sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI: 89% to 96%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively, with 2 to 20 more false-negative results per 1000 persons tested with repeat Ag testing compared with standard NAAT, depending on the prevalence of disease. After the first 5 days of symptom onset, sensitivity and specificity for Ag testing and repeat Ag testing were 75% (95% CI: 69% to 86%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively, with 11 to 110 more false-negative results per 1000 persons tested with repeat Ag testing compared with standard NAAT, depending on the prevalence of COVID-19; the certainty was very low for sensitivity and specificity due to indirectness and inconsistency.

### Change in clinical knowledge of diabetes among primary healthcare providers in Indonesia: repeated cross-sectional survey of 5105 primary healthcare facilities [^111SK4uz]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

The focus of our study is Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world. Indonesia is undergoing a rapid transition from acute infectious to chronic NCDs. Among the over 11 million adults thought to have diabetes in Indonesia in 2014, only an estimated 21% of people with diabetes in Indonesia were diagnosed; 20% were treated; and 7% had controlled diabetes. The demand for diabetes care is also likely to grow in Indonesia due to a rapid increase in the number of people suffering from the condition and because of country-wide expansions of social health insurance coverage.

In the context of these health burden and systems transitions, the primary aim of our study was to investigate provider knowledge of diabetes care in Indonesia to better inform efforts to improve NCD care throughout the country. Specifically, using large-scale data from two rounds of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), this study aimed to (1) determine the level of diabetes knowledge and its variation by provider cadre (including doctors, nurses, midwives, and paramedics) and province in Indonesia, and (2) establish how diabetes knowledge changed between 2007 and 2014/2015.

### Female genital mutilation in children presenting to Australian paediatricians [^111VU2BJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

One child in our study who had FGM/C in Indonesia was born in Australia, suggesting that she was taken to Indonesia for FGM/C. This is consistent with the UK study, which reported three children who had been taken overseas for FGM/C, which is illegal in many countries including Australia. A report by UNICEF in 2016 identified for the first time that Indonesia has a high prevalence (∼50%) of FGM/C in girls aged < 14 years. Despite Australia's proximity to Indonesia and immigration from Indonesia, only one child who had FGM/C in Indonesia was reported in our study. This might reflect lack of recognition by paediatricians of Indonesia as a country where FGM/C is prevalent, and that types I and IV which are difficult to detect are common in Indonesia. Families from Indonesia are typically not refugees and do not access refugee health clinics where girls might be screened.

The majority of children with FGM/C in the UK study were < 10 years old when they underwent FGM/C. Most of the children in our study were aged over 10 years when FGM/C was detected by paediatricians, but we did not ask at what age FGM/C was performed. A report from one refugee health service demonstrates that FGM/C in Australian children was performed from infancy to mid-childhood.

Complications of FGM/C were reported in eight children; one of whom was referred for psychological counselling. This is consistent with the UK study in which three children had post-traumatic stress symptoms. Despite psychological distress being recognised by the WHO and UNICEF as an important complication of FGM/C, few studies report this outcome. Complications reported in our study are consistent with the literature, but the number of complications is higher compared with the UK study, possibly because there was a higher proportion of children with types II and III, and we reported only children presenting to specialist paediatric services who are likely to have more severe problems.

Results

Between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy at birth in Indonesia increased by 8.0 years (95% UI 7.3–8.8), from 63.6 years (63.2–64.0) to 71.7 years (71.0–72.3; figure 1). Life expectancy at birth for males increased by 7.4 years (6.4–8.6), from 62.4 years (61.8–62.9) to 69.8 years (68.8–70.7), whereas life expectancy at birth for females increased by 8.7 years (7.8–9.5), from 64.9 years (64.3–65.4) to 73.6 years (73.0–74.1; figure 1).

Figure 1
Attribution of changes in life expectancy at birth to changes in major groups of causes of death for Indonesia and comparator countries, 1990–2016, by sex

Changes are shown for Indonesia and comparator countries for both sexes, males, and females. Locations are ordered by life expectancy at birth in 2016, from highest to lowest. Purple lines show life expectancy at birth in 1990, and black lines show life expectancy at birth in 2016; for all countries except the Philippines, these lie at the beginning and end of each bar, respectively. *In the Philippines, the increase in life expectancy attributable to changes in injuries and communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes was countered by a decrease in life expectancy attributable to non-communicable diseases, leading to a smaller net increase in life expectancy than the overall change.

### The state of health in Indonesia's provinces, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^1144kMP3]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Analysing trends and levels of the burden of disease at the national level can mask inequalities in health-related progress in lower administrative units such as provinces and districts. We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to analyse health patterns in Indonesia at the provincial level between 1990 and 2019. Long-term analyses of disease burden provide insights on Indonesia's advance to universal health coverage and its ability to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Methods

We analysed GBD 2019 estimated cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, and risk factors for 286 causes of death, 369 causes of non-fatal health loss, and 87 risk factors by year, age, and sex for Indonesia and its 34 provinces from 1990 to 2019. To generate estimates for Indonesia at the national level, we used 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators, 317 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death, 689 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes, 250 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors, and 1641 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. For subnational estimates, we used the following source counts: 138 location-years of data to estimate Indonesia-specific demographic indicators; 5848 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific causes of death; 1534 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific non-fatal outcomes; 650 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific risk factors; and 16016 location-years of data for Indonesia-specific covariates. We generated our GBD 2019 estimates for Indonesia by including 1915207 total source metadata rows, and we used 821 total citations.

Findings

Life expectancy for males across Indonesia increased from 62.5 years (95% uncertainty interval 61.3–63.7) to 69.4 years (67.2–71.6) between 1990 and 2019, a positive change of 6.9 years. For females during the same period, life expectancy increased from 65.7 years (64.5–66.8) to 73.5 years (71.6–75.6), an increase of 7.8 years. There were large disparities in health outcomes among provinces. In 2019, Bali had the highest life expectancy at birth for males (74.4 years, 70.90–77.9) and North Kalimantan had the highest life expectancy at birth for females (77.7 years, 74.7–81.2), whereas Papua had the lowest life expectancy at birth for males (64.5 years, 60.9–68.2) and North Maluku had the lowest life expectancy at birth for females (64.0 years, 60.7–67.3). The difference in life expectancy for males between the highest-ranked and lowest-ranked provinces was 9.9 years and the difference in life expectacy for females between the highest-ranked and lowest-ranked provinces was 13.7 years. Age-standardised death, YLL, and YLD rates also varied widely among the provinces in 2019. High systolic blood pressure, tobacco, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high BMI were the five leading risks contributing to health loss measured as DALYs in 2019.

Interpretation

Our findings highlight that Indonesia faces a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases that varies across provinces. From 1990 to 2019, Indonesia witnessed a decline in the infectious disease burden, although communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections have remained a main source of DALYs in Indonesia. During that same period, however, all-ages death and disability rates from non-communicable diseases and exposure to their risk factors accounted for larger shares of health loss. The differences in health outcomes between the highest-performing and lowest-performing provinces have also widened since 1990. Our findings support a comprehensive process to revisit current health policies, examine the root causes of variation in the burden of disease among provinces, and strengthen programmes and policies aimed at reducing disparities across the country.

### Multicentre survey of retinopathy of prematurity in Indonesia [^115NJUNS]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

It is difficult to compare the incidence of ROP in Indonesia with the incidence reported in HIC. A recent study from Greece showed an incidence of any stage ROP in infants < 32 weeks of 19.7% and severe ROP 7.4%. The EXPRESS Study from Sweden found an incidence of any stage ROP in infants < 31 weeks of 31.9% and severe ROP 5.7%. There is a marked difference, however, between Indonesia and HIC in the type of infants cared for and their survival. In Indonesia, almost no infants born after a gestational age of 26 weeks or less will survive. Mortality among infants of 26–28 weeks is much higher than in HIC. In our survey, we found that 67% of infants born < 28 weeks died. Recent data from Sweden, England, France, the Netherlands, Canada and the USA show a survival rate for infants born between 26 and 28 weeks of 80%–90%. In Indonesia, only the healthier very preterm infants will survive. The incidence of ROP may be lower in these infants than in the very sick newborns who died. The same may be true of infants born after 28–32 weeks. In Indonesia, we found that 24% of these infants died. In HIC, that figure is less than 5%. The present data on the incidence of ROP in Indonesia could be an underestimation caused by the higher death rate in Indonesia. There are more reasons why our data might be an underestimation of the real incidence of ROP in Indonesia. Not all hospitals in Indonesia have an ophthalmologist, and therefore not all preterm infants are screened. Screening might not be according to the recommended schedule in all infants so that ROP can be missed even in screened infants. Infants might be too sick to be screened, and infants might not be screened after discharge.

### Longitudinal evidence on treatment discontinuation, adherence, and loss of hypertension control in four middle-income countries [^1173nuJ4]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Managing hypertension is a highly dynamic process, yet current evidence on hypertension control in middle-income countries (MICs) is largely based on cross-sectional data. Using multiple waves of population-based cohort data from four MICs (China, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa), we undertook a longitudinal investigation into how individuals with hypertension move through care over time. We classified adults aged 40 years and over (N = 8527) into care stages at both baseline and follow-up waves and estimated the probability of transitioning between stages using Poisson regression models. Over a 5- to 9-year follow-up period, only around 30% of undiagnosed individuals became diagnosed [Mexico, 27% (95% confidence interval: 23%, 31%); China, 30% (26%, 33%); Indonesia, 30% (28%, 32%); and South Africa, 36% (31%, 41%)], and one in four untreated individuals became treated [Indonesia, 11% (10%, 12%); Mexico, 24% (20%, 28%); China, 26% (23%, 29%); and South Africa, 33% (29%, 38%)]. The probability of reaching blood pressure (BP) control was lower [Indonesia, 2% (1%, 2%); China, 9% (7%, 11%); Mexico, 12% (9%, 14%); and South Africa, 24% (20%, 28%)] regardless of treatment status. A substantial proportion of individuals discontinued treatment [Indonesia, 70% (67%, 73%); China, 36% (32%, 40%); Mexico, 34% (29%, 39%); and South Africa, 20% (15%, 25%)], and most individuals lost BP control by follow-up [Indonesia, 92% (89%, 96%); Mexico, 77% (71%, 83%); China, 76% (69%, 83%); and South Africa 45% (36%, 54%)]. Our results highlight that policies solely aimed at improving diagnosis or initiating treatment may not lead to long-term hypertension control improvements in MICs.

### Towards responsive policy and actions to address non-communicable disease risks amongst adolescents in Indonesia: insights from key stakeholders [^111ckUtk]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore stakeholders' perspectives on NCD prevention in Indonesia. Indonesia was selected by the UNICEF East Asia and Pacific regional office due to the increasing burden of NCDs, planned investments to address NCDs, and the identified need to understand how young people can be involved in these efforts.

We engaged young people in this research in three ways: we engaged an Indonesian young person as a co-researcher within the research team from the beginning of the project (ANT) to ensure the overall project and data collection was appropriately framed and 'youth friendly'; we purposively sampled a diverse range of young people during the enquiry phase and aimed to have half of participants aged 18–25 years; and we invited young people to an additional forum to discuss the findings and co-define key recommendations.

Development of semi-structured interviews

We developed a question guide for semi-structured interviews based on the research aims. It was then translated to Bahasa Indonesia for Bahasa language interviews (interview overview in Table 1, see full interview guide, Appendix 2). Following the first three pilot interviews (two in Bahasa, one in English), the interviewee's responses were reviewed by two interviewers to check for consistency in comprehension across languages; no major changes were required.

### Tuberculosis and other causes of uveitis in Indonesia [^116TkuoW]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

PurposeThe purpose of this study is to assess the causes of uveitis in Indonesia and determine the importance of tuberculosis (TB) as a cause of uveitis. Patients and methodsProspective cohort study examining 146 consecutive new human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with active uveitis between June 2014 and May 2015. We assessed the anatomic locations and specific causes of uveitis, as well as associations with infectious and non-infectious systemic diseases. We determined the prevalence of positive QuantiFERON Tb Gold test (QFT) results in Indonesian patients with uveitis and calculated the number of patients with active systemic TB. ResultsPosterior and panuveitis were the most common anatomic entities (38% each). Infections represented the most frequent cause of uveitis (33%); the most prevalent were toxoplasmosis (19%) and active systemic TB (8%). The majority of patients were QFT positive (61%). A specific diagnosis could not be established in 45% of the patients. At first presentation to the ophthalmologist, the majority of patients (66%) had a visual acuity of less than finger counting at 3m and already exhibited various complications of uveitis. When classifying the QFT-positive patients with unexplained uveitis into a TB-related group, the percentage of 'TB-associated' uveitis cases increased from 8–48%. Highly elevated QFT levels were observed in patients with uveitis of unknown cause and no signs of active systemic TB. ConclusionsIn Indonesia, infectious uveitis was the most common type of uveitis and the leading causes consisted of toxoplasmosis and TB. The association observed between highly elevated QFT results and uveitis of otherwise unexplained origins indicates that a link exists between the latent TB infection and the development of uveitis.

### Epidemiology of plasmodium vivax in Indonesia [^113cnRPB]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Endemic malaria occurs across much of the vast Indonesian archipelago. All five species of Plasmodium known to naturally infect humans occur here, along with 20 species of Anopheles mosquitoes confirmed as carriers of malaria. Two species of plasmodia cause the overwhelming majority and virtually equal shares of malaria infections in Indonesia: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax The challenge posed by P. vivax is especially steep in Indonesia because chloroquine-resistant strains predominate, along with Chesson-like strains that relapse quickly and multiple times at short intervals in almost all patients. Indonesia's hugely diverse human population carries many variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, most of them exhibiting severely impaired enzyme activity. Therefore, the patients most likely to benefit from primaquine therapy by preventing aggressive relapse, may also be most likely to suffer harm without G6PD deficiency screening. Indonesia faces the challenge of controlling and eventually eliminating malaria across > 13,500 islands stretching > 5,000 km and an enormous diversity of ecological, ethnographic, and socioeconomic settings, and extensive human migrations. This article describes the occurrence of P. vivax in Indonesia and the obstacles faced in eliminating its transmission.

### Antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens in Indonesia: a systematic review [^111foDxu]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, AMR prevalence estimates in common and medically important gram-negative bacteria in Indonesia are among the highest reported in the Southeast Asian region. More representative, granular, high-quality and standardised AMR data are required to construct accurate AMR estimates for all GLASS-specific pathogens, geographic areas, across the national, province, district and health facility levels. This information can inform locally relevant empiric treatment guidelines and effective public health policies and interventions, and guide priorities for the National Action Plan on AMR.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Malaria — adjunct considerations include age limits for tetracyclines, clindamycin dosing, primaquine use, and regional resistance notes: For quinine-based regimens, doxycycline or tetracycline should be used only in children aged ≥ 8 years. An alternative for children aged ≥ 8 years is clindamycin 7 mg/kg body weight per dose by mouth given every 8 hours, and clindamycin should be used for children aged < 8 years. Before primaquine is given, G6PD status must be verified; primaquine may be given in combination with chloroquine if the G6PD status is known and negative, otherwise give after chloroquine (when G6PD status is available). High treatment failure rates due to chloroquine-resistant P. vivax have been documented in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.

### Linking global youth tobacco survey (GYTS) data to the WHO framework convention on tobacco control: the case for Indonesia [^116CXemR]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Indonesia has the fifth highest rate of annual cigarette consumption per person of all countries worldwide. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) was developed to provide data on youth tobacco use to countries for their development of youth-based tobacco control programs. Data in this report can be used as baseline measures for future evaluation of the tobacco control program implemented by Indonesia's Ministry of Health.

Methods

The 2006 Indonesia GYTS is a school-based survey that included separate samples for Java and Sumatera, representing more than 84% of the population of Indonesia. Each sample used a two-stage cluster sample design that produced representative samples of students in secondary grades 1–3, which are associated with ages 13–15 years.

Results

This report shows that more than 1 in 10 students (12.6%) currently smoked cigarettes, with the prevalence among boys (24.5%) significantly higher than among girls (2.3%). Of the students who currently smoked, more than 7 in 10 (75.9%) reported that they desired to stop smoking now. Regarding secondhand smoke exposure, more than 6 in 10 students (64.2%) reported that they were exposed to smoke from other people in their home during the week before the survey. More than 9 in 10 students (92.9%) had seen a lot of advertisements for cigarettes on billboards during the past month and more than 8 in 10 (82.8%) had seen a lot of advertisements for cigarettes in newspapers or in magazines.

Conclusions

Tobacco control in Indonesia will likely not move forward until the government evaluates and strengthens existing laws, considers passing new strong laws, and develops protocols for enforcing all laws. The Indonesian government also should strongly consider accession to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

### The global burden of disease attributable to alcohol and drug use in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^111euFxx]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Disability weights

We used disability weights to quantify the severity of the health loss associated with a particular disease or injury, and disability weights for each injury or disease were applied to the prevalence of that condition.

In this study, we used disability weights generated by the general public, on the basis of the argument that their views are relevant in comparative assessments that inform public policy.

In GBD 2016, disability weights were obtained from population surveys in various different countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Peru, Tanzania, USA, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, and the Netherlands) and from an open-access survey available in multiple languages in which lay participants were presented with pairs of short non-clinical descriptions of the health states of two hypothetical individuals and asked to rate which they considered healthier. Participant responses were scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 1 (0 = no loss of health; 1 = loss equivalent to death) using a series of questions comparing the benefits of lifesaving and disease-prevention programmes for a number of health states. The pair-wise comparisons showed the relative position of health states to each other, and this additional step in the analysis was necessary to anchor those relative positions as values on a 0 to 1 scale. Disability weights were generated for all sequelae of diseases and injuries included in GBD. Further details regarding the calculation of disability weights have been published previously. Each country-specific, age-specific, sex-specific, and year-specific prevalence derived by DisMod-MR 2.1 was multiplied by a disorder-specific disability weight to estimate YLDs.

For each substance use disorder, we estimated the proportion of cases that were asymptomatic using data from the US National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) for the time periods 2000–01 and 2004–05, and the Australian Comorbidity and Trauma Study (CATS) for opioid dependence (2005–08). These proportions were used to calculate a mean disability weight for each disorder across the different levels of severity in which asymptomatic cases were assigned a disability weight of 0. For all substance use disorders in GBD 2016, we removed the proportion of diagnosed individuals who reported no additional disability at the time of the survey. The remaining proportion of individuals represented so-called asymptomatic cases (ie, people with substance use disorders who experienced no disability due to their disorder).

### Optimizing antibiotic use in Indonesia: a systematic review and evidence synthesis to inform opportunities for intervention [^116yso7H]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The global rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest public health threats, with a disproportionate impact in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A recent global analysis estimated that AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million deaths and played a part in 4.95 million deaths in 2019 worldwide, including 97 000 and 369 000, respectively, in the Southeast Asian region. One of the major drivers of AMR is antibiotic use, including their overuse and misuse. In low-resource settings, lack of access to quality healthcare, vaccination, safe water and sanitation, leave many people vulnerable to infection and dependent on antibiotics for treatment, with their use largely unregulated. Globally, during the past decade concerted efforts have been made to develop strategies to preserve the effectiveness of existing antibiotic agents.

Indonesia is a lower-middle-income country in Southeast Asia with the world's fourth largest population (274 million), and socio-economic conditions and health indicators vary widely across the archipelago. More than 55% of the population is concentrated on Java Island, which has the best developed health infrastructure. Indonesia has a decentralised public healthcare system, in which provincial or district-level governments have the authority over most public hospitals, and a substantial private health sector. In 2020, Indonesia had a total of 2985 hospitals, 21 550 primary health centres, and an estimated 135 000 drug outlets in the community selling over-the-counter drugs, of which only 29% were officially licensed pharmacies and drug stores. To achieve the goal of universal healthcare coverage, in 2014 the Government introduced national health insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional), which had reached 84% of the population by 2021. Based on an analysis of pharmaceutical sales data in 76 countries between 2000 and 2015, Indonesia ranks among the greatest risers in antibiotic consumption (29th). A range of complex factors, including variable access to quality health care, persistently high infectious disease burdens, and weakly enforced antibiotic policies, render Indonesia particularly vulnerable to AMR. The implementation of the National Action Plan for AMR since 2017, has been hindered due to, among other factors, a limited evidence base of AMR epidemiology, antibiotic utilisation and rational prescribing practices. To our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive countrywide analysis to date of the magnitude and key drivers of AMR and antibiotic use, which is critical to generate evidence and highlight gaps that can help guide priorities of the National Action Plan for AMR.

### Hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype in relation to diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases in the Indonesian and Korean populations: evidence from two national surveys [^114qaiek]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Asian populations are at increased risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) phenotype, a proxy for visceral adiposity, is a recognized marker of cardiometabolic dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and determinants of the HTGW phenotype, as well as its association with DM and CVD in the Indonesian and Korean populations — two Asian cohorts with distinct sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics.

Methods

This cross-sectional study analyzed national health survey data from Indonesia (n = 34,256) and Korea (n = 33,536). HTGW was defined as the coexistence of abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 90 cm in men; ≥ 80 cm in women) and elevated serum triglycerides (≥ 150 mg/dL). Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed lifestyle determinants of HTGW phenotype and its associations with DM and CVD.

Results

HTGW prevalence was comparable in Indonesia (13%) and Korea (12%), although sex-specific patterns differed: more women in Indonesia (16%) but more men in Korea (17%) exhibited the phenotype. Smoking and alcohol consumption increased the odds of HTGW phenotype [adjusted prevalence odds ratio (aPOR) (95%CI): 1.07 (0.94–1.22) and 1.46 (1.04–2.03) in Indonesians; 1.67 (1.52–1.85) and 1.31 (1.20–1.43) in Koreans, respectively], whereas physical activity lowered the odds [0.83 (0.75–0.91) in Indonesians; 0.53 (0.49–0.58) in Koreans]. Compared to individuals without the phenotype, those with HTGW had higher odds of DM [2.42 (2.13–2.74) in Indonesians; 1.96 (1.76–2.18) in Koreans] and CVD including hypertension [1.78 (1.60–1.98) in Indonesians; 1.95 (1.76–2.15) in Koreans], with stronger associations observed among women in both populations.

Conclusions

HTGW prevalence was comparable in Indonesia and Korea, but sex-specific differences suggest distinct underlying mechanisms and the need for tailored interventions. Smoking and alcohol use were key contributors, whereas physical activity was protective, underscoring modifiable lifestyle factors in phenotype expression. HTGW was consistently associated with DM and CVD across both populations, reinforcing its value as a marker of cardiometabolic risk.

### Diagnosing metabolic syndrome in a multi-ethnic country: is an ethnic-specific cut-off point of waist circumference needed? [^114Ehdk8]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS), a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is increasing and is currently affecting around one quarter of the world population. In Indonesia, a country with more than quarter billion population and diverse ethnicities, over the past few decades, there has been an enormous increase in the prevalence MS. Prevalence of obesity (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m²) and central obesity (waist circumference (WC) ≥ 90 for men and ≥ 80 for women) were 23.1% and 28%, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of MS in elderly increased from 21.6% in 2008 to 23.3% in 2019 (refs. with the prevalence of MS in overall population was 21.6%.

Several clinical definitions of MS have been proposed and widely used over past decade, including World Health Organisation (WHO), National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI). The main difference concerns the measure for central obesity. The new definition of MShas proposed ethnic-specific cut-off values for WC, namely 90 and 80 cm for Asian men and women, respectively, which are currently used in Indonesia. However, even in Asian ethnicity, there are also differences in the cut-off points used in different Asian countries, such as China and Japan. Thus, ethnic differences in Asian countries might also lead to a different cut-off values for central obesity.

As a multi-ethnic country of more than a quarter billion people and more than 600 ethnicities, it will be important for Indonesia to have a country-specific or even an ethnic-specific WC cut-off points applied for the Indonesian population. Our study aims to assess the optimal WC cut-off points for the detection of MS in three different areas with different ethnicities in Indonesia. We hypothesized that each ethnic group would have each own specific WC cut-off points.

### Multicentre survey of retinopathy of prematurity in Indonesia [^112jQ73Q]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Background

The incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is higher in Indonesia than in high-income countries. In order to reduce the incidence of the disease, a protocol on preventing, screening and treating ROP was published in Indonesia in 2010. To assist the practical implementation of the protocol, meetings were held in all Indonesia regions, calling attention to the high incidence of ROP and the methods to reduce it. In addition, national health insurance was introduced in 2014, making ROP screening and treatment accessible to more infants.

Objective

To evaluate whether the introduction of both the guideline drawing attention to the high incidence of ROP and national health insurance may have influenced the incidence of the disease in Indonesia.

Setting

Data were collected from 34 hospitals with different levels of care: national referral centres, university-based hospitals, and public and private hospitals.

Methods

A survey was administered with questions on admission numbers, mortality rates, ROP incidence, and its stages for 2016–2017 in relation to gestational age and birth weight.

Results

We identified 12115 eligible infants with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks. Mortality was 24% and any stage ROP 6.7%. The mortality in infants aged less than 28 weeks was 67%, the incidence of all-stage ROP 18% and severe ROP 4%. In the group aged 28–32weeks, the mortality was 24%, all-stage ROP 7% and severe ROP 4%-5%. Both mortality and the incidence of ROP were highest in university-based hospitals.

Conclusions

In the 2016–2017 period, the infant mortality rate before 32 weeks of age was higher in Indonesia than in high-income countries, but the incidence of ROP was comparable. This incidence is likely an underestimation due to the high mortality rate. The ROP incidence in 2016–2017 is lower than in surveys conducted before 2015. This decline is likely due to a higher practitioner awareness about ROP and national health insurance implementation in Indonesia.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of low-sodium potassium-rich salt substitutes in Indonesia: an equity modelling study [^112vp6hm]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Overview of the conceptual modelling framework. LSSS: low-sodium potassium-rich salt substitutes; BP: blood pressure; CVD: cardiovascular disease; CKD: chronic kidney disease; PIF: potential impact fraction method.

Data on baseline BP distribution were from the 2018 Indonesian Basic Health Research Survey (RISKESDAS 2018). This nationally representative survey used multistage sampling to recruit 1,017,290 participants, for which objective BP measurements were obtained from 658,201 respondents aged 18 years and above from 34 provinces. For this analysis, only data for those aged 20 years and above were used to derive baseline BP distributions in the model. This age cut-off was applied in our modelling because there is limited evidence on the causal link between BP and CVD events in younger people. To estimate background trends in blood pressure, we used Indonesia-specific data from the Non-communicable Disease Risk factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) for the years 2000–2016. Generalized linear models were fitted to derive sex-specific and age-specific regression coefficients of the estimated annual change in BP. These were applied in the model to predict the future trends in BP, which were assumed to continue for the first ten years and held constant thereafter. We modelled the effect of the LSSS policy on seven BP-related diseases (ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, hypertensive heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease). Baseline incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates for these conditions, estimates of disease risk relative to change in BP from meta-analyses of cohort studies, population size and all-cause mortality rates were derived from the Global Burden of Disease study. We used the DISMOD-II software to estimate corresponding case fatality rates using available data while imposing consistency in the overall disease epidemiology.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^116M2JAV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) molecular COVID-19 diagnostic testing guideline — Because EUA submissions require analytical but not clinical performance data, the panel identified few studies reporting clinical performance and based most recommendations on diagnostic test accuracy. Accuracy metrics include sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are essential; calculating predictive values requires prevalence or pre-test probability, yet true community prevalence may be ill-defined or underestimated when testing is limited or results are not reported. Accordingly, the panel varied estimates of prevalence/pre-test probability and assay sensitivity and specificity in analyses using available literature and public dashboards to mirror what may be encountered in clinical practice.

### The epidemiology and burden of injury in countries of the association of southeast Asian nations (ASEAN), 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^114WJRTu]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Considerable variations exist within the region (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3). The highest number of injury cases and deaths in 2021 was observed in Indonesia, with an estimated 12.3 million incident cases (95% UI 11.5–13.2) and 92 500 deaths (79 000–111 000). Viet Nam followed, with an estimated 6.16 million incident cases (5.83–6.50) and 65 800 deaths (53 100–79 300). The lowest number of injury cases was observed in Brunei, with an estimated 64 000 cases (59 500–68 400) and 122 deaths (109–135). Injuries accounted for a considerable proportion of all-cause disease burden in Viet Nam, where more than 9.4% (8.1–10.4) of all-cause mortality and 11.6% (10.5–12.7) of total DALYs were attributable to injuries. In Thailand, injuries were associated with 8.1% (7.2–8.9) of all-cause mortality and 11.3% (10.2–12.3) of total DALYs. In Cambodia, injuries constituted 7.3% (6.3–8.2) of all-cause mortality, with more than 9% of total DALYs. Although injuries accounted for a relatively small proportion of all-cause mortality in Singapore, at 3.9% (3.7–4.1), the proportion of total DALYs was 7.9% (7.1–9.0), slightly lower than Laos but higher than in the Philippines and Indonesia (see table 3).
