## Question

Cat bite treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of cat bites, including initial assessment and immediate wound care priorities, evaluation of infection risk and indications for antibiotics, rabies and tetanus post-exposure management, wound closure strategy, surgical referral triggers, and considerations for special populations such as children and immunocompromised patients. Additionally, they are interested in cat-scratch disease and rare pathogens, a summary of antibiotic regimens and durations, and recommendations for follow-up and counseling.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: establish a clear history of timing, provocation, animal vaccination status, comorbidities, and allergies. Inspect for puncture wounds, hand involvement, edema, or deep-structure penetration. And then perform copious high-pressure irrigation with saline and mechanical debridement to reduce bacterial load and infection risk, documenting neurovascular status and joint range of motion, as meticulous irrigation and debridement are among the most critical modifiable factors influencing outcomes [^113Xs2eU] [^111ZTZw7] [^112mVfHi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about infection risk — cat bites have higher infection rates than dog bites due to deep puncture mechanics and polymicrobial oral flora. Reported infection rates range from roughly 30–50% in cat bites, so I should maintain a low threshold for proactive therapy in high-risk wounds while recognizing that some guidelines caution against routine prophylaxis in all comers [^111ECh8k] [^114UcFAC] [^114nrpNG].

> I need to check the microbiology to guide empiric therapy: Pasteurella multocida predominates in cat bites with rapid onset, Capnocytophaga canimorsus can cause fulminant infection in susceptible hosts, and mixed aerobes and anaerobes are common. This polymicrobial pattern underpins amoxicillin–clavulanate as first-line for most patients [^113iLkpN] [^114gfxEA].

> Wait, let me verify antibiotic indications across sources: multiple guidelines converge on providing preemptive therapy for high-risk wounds, particularly to the hand or face, puncture wounds, immunocompromised hosts, delayed presentation beyond roughly 24 hours, and those with preexisting edema or possible joint/bone involvement. Some high-credibility sources emphasize that routine prophylaxis is not universally indicated and should be individualized, while others, including AAFP, support prophylaxis for increased infection risk scenarios such as cat bites, which often meet high-risk criteria by mechanism [^114UcFAC] [^1151yZdu] [^114nrpNG].

> Let me think about the optimal agent and duration: amoxicillin–clavulanate is the preferred first-line oral agent for 3–5 days in adults (e.g., 875/125 mg twice daily) and 22.5 mg/kg twice daily for 3–7 days in children, extending to 7–10 days if infection persists or host risk is higher. For penicillin allergy, I should pair clindamycin with TMP-SMX to cover Pasteurella and anaerobes, and for severe disease or deep infection, use IV ampicillin–sulbactam or piperacillin–tazobactam, with early culture when feasible to narrow therapy [^116yS9D3] [^112WtvQo] [^114gfxEA] [^113iLkpN].

> I should double-check a common misconception: some labels or sources list ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg twice daily for 3–5 days as an option. However, fluoroquinolone monotherapy lacks reliable anaerobic coverage for bite wounds, so if a fluoroquinolone is chosen, it should be combined with metronidazole or clindamycin unless using an agent with anaerobic activity like moxifloxacin, and tetracyclines can be reasonable alternatives with careful attention to coverage gaps [^1112mtHu] [^111uLr8V].

> Next, I should review rabies risk and post-exposure prophylaxis: all cat bites warrant a structured rabies assessment of the animal's health, availability for observation, and local epidemiology. PEP is indicated when the animal is unavailable for 10-day observation, shows signs of illness, or when local public health guidance advises based on risk, with cost-effectiveness and NNT varying dramatically by exposure scenario, so coordination with public health is essential [^111b3yDd] [^1131EUni] [^113NDaPA].

> I will now examine tetanus: assess last dose and wound class. Give a booster if more than 10 years for clean wounds or more than 5 years for dirty wounds, and ensure completion of a primary series if never immunized, with Tdap preferred if not previously administered [^116Me3WA] [^1139FDEz].

> Let me consider wound closure strategy carefully: for low-risk facial wounds, primary closure after thorough irrigation and debridement is generally supported for cosmetic reasons, whereas hand wounds, puncture wounds, and delayed presentations are better managed open with delayed primary closure or secondary intention to mitigate infection risk. If primary closure is chosen, ensure meticulous source control and consider preemptive antibiotics in higher-risk scenarios [^111smVvu] [^111uNx3y] [^114wZCqa].

> But wait, what if there is suspected deep-structure injury or progressive infection? I should obtain radiographs for retained teeth, foreign bodies, or suspected fractures, and arrange surgical consultation for injuries involving tendons, joints, or bone, or for evolving cellulitis or abscess. Cat bites to the hand have a high risk of deep infection and often require operative irrigation and debridement, sometimes repeatedly, so early hand surgery involvement is prudent [^112mVfHi] [^111u23cW] [^114HTnXm].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations: in children, prompt irrigation and debridement are key, and antibiotics are indicated for hand or face wounds, puncture injuries, or delayed presentations. In immunocompromised patients, preemptive therapy is recommended for essentially all cat bites given the risk of rapid progression and atypical pathogens, and close follow-up is mandatory [^114UcFAC] [^111CjnYD].

> Let me reconsider Bartonella henselae considerations: cat scratches or bites can transmit cat-scratch disease, typically presenting with regional lymphadenopathy. Azithromycin is first-line therapy and shortens symptom duration when treatment is indicated, with doxycycline as an alternative in selected contexts. In HIV or advanced immunosuppression, treatment may be prolonged and complications such as bacillary angiomatosis require extended macrolide or doxycycline therapy [^111sf6kj] [^1122ALq3] [^116bEYUr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought moxifloxacin would reliably cover anaerobes in cat bites, but I should confirm spectrum nuances: moxifloxacin has broader anaerobic activity than ciprofloxacin and can be used as monotherapy in some settings, yet local resistance patterns and the need for reliable Pasteurella and anaerobic coverage still favor amoxicillin–clavulanate as default unless contraindicated, with regimen selection tailored to allergy, severity, and culture data when available [^114gfxEA] [^111uLr8V].

> I need to ensure follow-up and patient education are explicit: arrange wound recheck within 24–48 hours to reassess for evolving infection, reinforce signs of concern such as increasing pain, erythema, swelling, drainage, fever, or red streaking, and counsel on animal handling and bite prevention. In many jurisdictions, animal bites are reportable, so I should comply with local reporting requirements [^11243jjZ] [^111CjnYD].

> To synthesize, let me verify the practical algorithm: assess risk and history, irrigate and debride meticulously, provide preemptive antibiotics for high-risk wounds or hosts using amoxicillin–clavulanate or an appropriate alternative, evaluate for rabies and tetanus and treat accordingly, close facial wounds selectively with careful technique, leave hand or puncture wounds open or use delayed closure, obtain imaging when deep injury is suspected, involve surgery early for hand bites or evolving infection, and schedule close follow-up with clear return precautions, adjusting therapy to culture results when available [^114UcFAC] [^1151yZdu] [^112mVfHi].

Cat bites require **prompt wound care** [^111ZTZw7] with copious irrigation, thorough debridement, and exploration for foreign bodies or deep-structure injury [^112mVfHi]. Because cat bites carry a **high infection risk** (30–50%) [^116TuMqa], **amoxicillin-clavulanate is first-line** for prophylaxis or treatment (875/125 mg PO BID for 5–7 days) [^111uLr8V]; in penicillin allergy, use doxycycline plus metronidazole or clindamycin plus TMP-SMX [^111uLr8V] [^116yS9D3]. Primary closure is avoided in hand or puncture wounds; **facial wounds may be closed after irrigation and debridement** [^111smVvu]. Assess for rabies and tetanus, and give PEP or boosters as indicated [^111b3yDd] [^116MHbsi]. Arrange close follow-up within 24–48 hours to monitor for infection or complications [^11243jjZ].

---

## Clinical assessment and initial management

### Clinical assessment

- **History**: Document time since injury, animal vaccination status, patient comorbidities, and immunization history [^notfound].

- **Physical examination**: Assess for puncture wounds, erythema, swelling, tenderness, purulence, lymphangitis, and systemic signs (fever, malaise) [^116RCQKs].

- **Exploration**: Probe for foreign bodies (tooth fragments, debris) and assess tendon, joint, or bone involvement [^112mVfHi].

---

### Initial wound care

Initial wound care emphasizes **copious irrigation** with sterile saline using high-pressure syringe or catheter to remove contaminants and reduce infection risk [^111ZTZw7]. Thorough debridement removes devitalized tissue, and the wound is explored for tendon, joint, or bone involvement; obtain radiographs if deep-structure injury or a foreign body is suspected [^113Xs2eU].

---

## Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment

### Indications for prophylactic antibiotics

Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated for **cat bites** given their high infection risk (30–50%) [^116TuMqa]. They are also indicated for puncture wounds, hand or face injuries, immunocompromised patients, or when presentation is delayed beyond 24 hours [^113NDaPA] [^114UcFAC].

---

### Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | First-line for prophylaxis and treatment |
| Doxycycline + metronidazole | 100 mg PO BID + 500 mg PO TID | Penicillin allergy alternative |
| Clindamycin + TMP-SMX | 300–450 mg PO TID + 1–2 DS tablets PO BID | Penicillin allergy alternative |
| Ciprofloxacin + clindamycin | 500–750 mg PO BID + 300–450 mg PO TID | Severe penicillin allergy alternative |

---

Note: macrolides (e.g. azithromycin) are **not recommended** due to resistance in Pasteurella species [^111uLr8V].

---

## Wound closure techniques

Primary closure is appropriate for **facial wounds after irrigation and debridement** to optimize cosmesis, but is generally avoided for hand wounds, puncture wounds, or infected wounds. Leave wounds to heal by secondary intention when the risk of infection is high [^111smVvu] [^114wZCqa].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is indicated for **deep-structure involvement** — tendon, joint, or bone — and for abscess or necrotizing infection. It is also indicated for failure of medical management with persistent or worsening infection despite antibiotics, as well as for extensive tissue damage requiring debridement or reconstruction [^114HTnXm].

---

## Management of complications

### Local infections

For local infections, initiate **empiric antibiotics** targeting Pasteurella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobes, then tailor to culture results [^113xR7bA]. If an abscess is present, perform incision and drainage, and consider hospitalization for severe infections, immunocompromised patients, or when there is failure of outpatient therapy [^notfound].

---

### Systemic infections

For systemic infections, **admit for IV antibiotics** (e.g. ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam) and monitor for sepsis and complications [^111uLr8V].

---

## Rabies and tetanus prophylaxis

Assess rabies risk and administer **post-exposure prophylaxis** if the animal is unavailable, unknown, or symptomatic [^111b3yDd] [^115sd8Wd]. Evaluate tetanus status and administer a booster if the last dose was more than 5 years ago for dirty wounds or more than 10 years for clean wounds [^116Me3WA].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Emphasize wound care, including keeping the wound clean and dry, and **recognizing signs of infection** — erythema, swelling, pain, fever, or drainage. Arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours to assess healing and detect complications early, and counsel on animal safety and bite prevention [^11243jjZ].

---

Cat bites carry a **high infection risk** [^116TuMqa]; prioritize irrigation and debridement, use amoxicillin-clavulanate as first-line therapy, avoid primary closure in high-risk wounds, and ensure close follow-up to prevent complications [^111ZTZw7] [^111uLr8V].

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111uLr8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Camel bites: a case study with a summary of current epidemiology, injury patterns, and treatment modalities [^115S4bVS]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Animal bites are a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, the majority of animal bites come from domestic pets, including dogs, cats, and rodents. Camel bites, on the other hand, are exceedingly rare in the United States and are poorly described in the western medical literature. Special considerations must be made when camel bite injuries occur, as they may be therapeutically challenging. Although some clinical features of camel bites resemble those of the more common animal bite injuries, the camel's unique dentition and bite force must be taken into account when managing these wounds.

### Human and animal bites [^116LQ74i]. Pediatrics in Review (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, nearly 56% of households owned a pet in 2011 according to the 2012 U.S. Pet Ownership &amp; Demographics Sourcebook by the American Veterinary Medical Association. The survey also reports that approximately 70 million dogs and 74 million cats lived in households in the United States during the same year. (1)Human and animal bites are a frequent cause of primary care and emergency department visits for children. It is estimated that 250,000 human bites, 400,000 cat bites, and 4.5 million dog bites occur in the United States each year in both adults and children. (2) In the United States, approximately 10% of all human bites will become infected in a child with a bite wound. The infection rate of dog bites in children is 20%. Cat bite infection rates in children vary but can be up to 50%. Each type of bite wound has a predisposition for sex and/or age. Infected bite wounds manifest with swelling, erythema, and tenderness with or without drainage of the affected site and can lead to serious complications. Most animal bite wounds are polymicrobial in nature. Pasteurella species (spp.) is the most common organism isolated from both cat and dog bites. The microbiology of human bites consists of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Basic medical management of bite wounds includes thorough cleansing and debridement. Irrigation, closure, and need to obtain culture depend on the type of bite wound, the appearance of the wound, the and timing of medical evaluation after the initial injury. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis and empirical therapy for children who are not allergic to penicillin. With most animal bites being preventable injuries, healthcare providers caring for children have an important role discussing pet safety with the child and the family.

### CAT BITE antibiotic prophylaxis for the hand / forearm (CATBITE… [^113veX8X]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

The average cat bite wound culture yields five types of bacterial isolates. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are observed in 60% of cases. Pasteurella multocida is the is the most common organism isolated from the mouths of cats that can cause infections after a bite. Pasteurella species are isolated from 75% of cat bite wounds, and the incubation period for Pasteurella infection is one to three days. Adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor significantly increases the effectiveness of these antibiotics, and amoxicillin-clavulanate is the oral antibiotic of choice for human, dog, and cat bites. Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875–125mg twice daily for 3–5 days or ciprofloxacin 500–750mg BID + clindamycin 300–450mg three times daily if a participant has a penicillin allergy.

However, only one randomized controlled clinical trial has been performed to date to assess the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics following cat bites. Adult participants with uninfected full-thickness wounds presenting within 24 hours of injury to the emergency department were considered. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oxacillin 500mg four times daily for five days or identically appearing placebo. Four of six participants receiving placebo, but none of the five participants receiving oxacillin, developed a wound infection. Immunocompetent adult participants presenting within 24 hours of a cat bite without any signs or symptoms of infection may benefit from advances in wound care alone or only need a maximum of 24 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis.

Furthermore, a Cochrane review aggregating data from clinical trials from the literature concluded, "There is no evidence that the use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective for cat or dog bites". The investigators' hypothesis is that administration of 5 days of prophylactic antibiotics will not reduce the incidence of infection in participants evaluated and treated within 24 hours of cat bite injury, who do not exhibit signs of an active infection.

### Seroconversion after three doses of intramuscular rabies vaccine as a post-exposure treatment [^111dTTAi]. Virus Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Rabies is still threatening half of the world's population with the global burden of canine rabies being estimated as 59,000 human deaths, annually. With no cure existing for clinical rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the only certain means to save lives of the exposed people. In Iran, bite incidences exceed 180,000 per year, where all victims receive 5 vaccine doses for PEP, conforming to the Essen regimen. More than two-thirds of the exposed individuals stop receiving treatments after day 7, for the reason of being exposed to a non-rabid dog or cat. According to the national standard protocols, these individuals should re-start a complete 5-dose PEP course upon the re-exposure. New WHO recommendations based on scientific data is encouraging revisions to the existing prophylaxis programs. In order to know if an incomplete Essen regimen can provide adequate immunity, in the present study, 5 groups of individuals who had only received 3 first doses of the Essen regimen within the previous 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were examined for immunity against rabies. Our results indicated sufficient anti-rabies neutralizing antibody in all individuals, before and after receiving two standard booster doses (i.e. days 0 and 3). This might also suggest the adequacy of the 3 first doses of vaccination, as a one-week long post-exposure vaccination program.

Special considerations

Contamination

When choosing an antibiotic regimen, one must take into account special circumstances regarding the type of contamination involved such as salt water/freshwater, clostridial species, or pet/human bites. Water contamination requires coverage for Vibrio, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, and other species. Trauma involving salt water should be treated with doxycycline and ceftazidime, or a fluoroquinolone. Freshwater wounds should be managed with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or a third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporin. Potential clostridial contamination, such as farm-related injuries, requires high-dose penicillin irrespective of the fracture type.

A full review of the treatment of bite injuries is beyond the scope of this document, but wounds caused by human, cat, and dog bites (the most common bite wounds encountered) are often treated with antibiotics due to the high load of more variable pathogens found in the oral cavity and the wound mechanism, with punctures that make both natural movement of the bacteria and adequate irrigation difficult. A course of 3–5 days of amoxicillin-clavulanate is a suggested regimen, with clindamycin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole two times per day as an alternative for patients with a penicillin allergy. While there is increasing question in the literature about the benefit of treating bite injuries with empiric antibiotics, there seems to be general consensus that injuries in high-risk locations (specifically hands, and over cartilage) and in high-risk patients should be treated. Rabies treatment should also be considered and addressed with any mammalian bite wounds (table 1).

### The management of bite wounds in children – a retrospective analysis at a level I trauma centre [^112dxrPz]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Animal bite wounds are a significant problem, which have caused several preventable child deaths in clinical practice in the past. The majority of bite wounds is caused by dogs and cats, and also humans have to be considered to lead to those extreme complicated diagnosis in the paediatric patient population. Early estimation of infection risk, adequate antibiotic therapy and, if indicated, surgical treatment, are cornerstones of successful cures of bite wounds. However, antibiotic prophylaxis and wound management are discussed controversially in the current literature. In our study, we retrospectively investigated the bite source, infection risk and treatment options of paediatric bite wounds.

Methods

A total of 1592 paediatric trauma patients were analysed over a period of 19 years in this retrospective study at a level I trauma centre, Department of Trauma Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Data for this study were obtained from our electronic patient records and follow-up visits. In our database, all paediatric patients triaged to our major urban trauma centre have been entered retrospectively.

Results

During the 19-year study period, 1592 paediatric trauma patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 7.7 years (range 0–18.9), 878 (55.2%) were males and 714 (44.8%) were females. In our study population, a total of 698 dog bites (43.8%), 694 human bites (43.6%), 138 other bites (8.7%) and 62 cat bites (3.9%) have been observed. A total of 171 wounds (10.7%) have been infected. Surgical intervention was done in 27 wounds (1.7%).

Conclusion

Gender-related incidence in bite wounds for dog and cat could be detected. Second, our findings for originator of bite wounds reflect the findings in the published literature. Total infection rate reached 10.7%, primary antibiotic therapy was administered in 221 cases (13.9%) and secondary antibiotic therapy in 20 (1.3%) cases. Observed infection rate of punctured wounds and wounds greater than 3 cm was 3 times higher than for all other wounds. Our findings need to be proven in further prospective clinical trials.

### Dog and cat bites: rapid evidence review [^112mVfHi]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Animal bites are a significant burden to health care systems worldwide. In the United States, dog bites account for an average of 337,000 emergency visits and generate medical costs of up to $2 billion per year. Most animal bites in adults and children are from a dog, and most bite patients are children who have been bitten by animals known to them. Dog bites may cause crush and soft-tissue avulsion, whereas cat bites usually cause deeper puncture-type wounds. Children most often present with dog bites on the head and neck, and adolescents and adults usually present with dog bites on the extremities and hands. Bite wounds should be examined, cleaned, and irrigated with warm water or normal saline solution, and any foreign bodies and devitalized tissue should be removed. Neurovascular function (e.g., pulses, sensation) and range and movement of adjacent joints should be examined and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line choice, should be considered for all bites, particularly for those at increased risk of infection. Imaging and laboratory studies are usually not required unless there is suspicion of a retained foreign body, damage to underlying structures, infection, or extensive injury. Primary closure of bite wounds may be performed if there is low risk of infection. The need for tetanus vaccination and rabies postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated for each patient; bites that do not break the skin generally do not require rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

Infections

The infection rates in Essen were 14.5%, which is lower than the rates observed in other studies, for example, in comparison to the USA. In the USA, infection rates of 20–25% for dog bites, 50% for cat bites, and 10% for human bites have been reported. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is insurance coverage, which may prompt patients to seek care in emergency rooms proactively, even before the onset of clinical infection. The relationship between health insurance coverage and healthcare-seeking behaviors, both of which serve as indicators of healthcare access, has been demonstrated in the context of other infection prevalence rates. Other studies have demonstrated that bacterial contamination from saliva is present in over 85% of bite wounds. The occurrence of wound infections is contingent on the causative animal, the localization and extent of the injury, and the time elapsed since the trauma. These infections typically manifest between the first and fifth day after the injury, and are caused by an atypical, species-dependent mixed flora. A recently published review by Cunningham et al on the surgical management of pediatric dog bites recommends the avoidance of prophylactic antibiotics for low-risk dog bite wounds with immediate treatment. This refers to wounds without involvement of neurovascular structures, bone, tendons or joints, and adequate cleaning, irrigation, and vigorous debulking within 8 hours of the injury. Given the microbiological diversity of bite wounds, the treatment of choice is frequently a composite of a beta-lactam antibiotic and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. At our clinic, the predominant antibiotic administered is Amoclav (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid), and Unacid (sultamicillin) also being used.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: management of mammalian bites in children-from local wound care to prophylactic antibiotics [^115xyGQz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2024). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bites are a common reason for emergency consultation, especially in children. The most common complication of bite wounds is local infection. Systemic infections are much rarer. The key in reducing the risk of infection after a mammalian bite is local wound management with either primary or delayed closure. The benefit of administering prophylactic antibiotics is controversial. In this review, we provide a summary of the current evidence for the management of mammalian bites in children, including recommendations for appropriate investigations, wound management, administration of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics and the prevention of systemic infections.

Summary

Bite injuries are a prevalent form of injury globally, with the potential to result in a range of complications at the site of the wound. It is therefore essential that they receive time-critical and individualized care. Children are a high-risk demographic, with the head and neck region being particularly susceptible to injury. In addition to the common dog, cat, and human bites, there are regional differences in the species of domestic and wild animals that may inflict bites. Infection rates also exhibit regional variation, which is likely attributable to differences in the rates of presentation or injury severity.

### Primary closure and prophylactic antibiotics for treatment of traumatic wounds caused by mammals, a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LNzNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic injury caused by mammals is a common and significant public health issue around the world, especially injury caused by stray/domestic dogs and cats account for approximately 95% of this kind of injury. Nearly 100 million people worldwide are bitten by dogs every year. In China, there are 40 million cases of traumatic injury caused by mammals per year, among which more than 10 million cases present to hospitals to receive postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and treatment. It is estimated that 4.5–4.7 million mammalian bites occur annually in USA, accounting for 2% of all visits to emergency room (ER), furthermore 20% of these cases need PEP and treatment. The standardized PEP and treatment include surgical management of wounds, and prophylaxis method of rabies/tetanus. The surgical management of wounds is a vital part of the whole process of PEP and treatment, which includes wounds irrigation, disinfection, anesthesia (if necessary), debridement, tissue repair (if necessary), wounds closure, drainage and prophylactic use of antibiotics. Most cases of traumatic injury caused by mammals can be treated at outpatient, some severe cases require admission in hospital, such as injury of important tissues (vessels, nerve, bone and tendon, etc.), severe tissue defect or infection. Sometimes wounds may need to be performed plastic surgery to achieve better cosmesis effect.

### Bites (mammalian) [^1112RfdJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mammalian bites are usually caused by dogs, cats, or humans, and are more prevalent in children (especially boys) than in adults. Animal bites are usually caused by the person's pet and, in children, frequently involve the face. Human bites tend to occur in children as a result of playing or fighting, while in adults they are usually the result of physical or sexual abuse. Mixed aerobe and anaerobe infection is the most common type of infection, and can occur in up to half of human bites.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent complications of mammalian bites? What are the effects of treatments for infected mammalian bites? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found five systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotic prophylaxis (human bites, non-human bites), antibiotics, debridement, decontamination, irrigation, primary wound closure, and tetanus vaccination (after mammalian bites).

Management of Bite Wounds Even apparently minor bite wounds should be thoroughly investigated, because external features may not reliably indicate the extent of internal damage. High-pressure irrigation is recommended to clean bite wounds and ensure removal of contaminants. This may be achieved using a 30- to 35-mL syringe equipped with an 18- to 20-gauge plastic catheter or needle. The tip of the syringe should be placed approximately 2 cm above the wound. At least 200 mL of saline is required to irrigate small bite wounds. Goggles and protective shields should be used by physicians to avoid self-contamination from splashing debris. Devitalized tissue should be excised; however, blunt probing of wounds is discouraged because this can damage tissue and increase the risk of infection.

Rabies and tetanus prophylaxis should be considered on an individual basis, depending on the type of animal involved, local risk factors and patient status. Secondary closure may reduce the risk of infection and provide better long-term cosmetic results than primary closure in most patients. Primary closure is most frequently used in recent, low-risk, uninfected wounds. The use of prophylactic antibiotics depends on the extent of tissue damage and the circumstances of the bite. Dog and cat bites are most likely to cause infection by a mixture of organisms, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is the antibiotic of choice. Bite wounds should be evaluated within 48 hours to assess for signs of infection and to reevaluate wounds that were initially left open. Good evidence supports restricting saturated fat to less than 10 percent of caloric intake.

Depending on comorbidities and complications, patients may also benefit from advice to lower their intake of salt and cholesterol, and to increase consumption of dietary fiber and specific micronutrients, such as magnesium and antioxidants, that may be significant in preventing microvascular and other complications. The condition has spontaneous remissions and relapses for several years, but eventually resolves. The differential diagnosis includes several serious conditions such as infection with human immunodeficiency virus or cytomegalovirus, states of vitamin deficiency and inflammatory bowel diseases. Treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis is often unsatisfactory, but patients may benefit from the use of antiseptic mouthwashes and scrupulous oral/dental hygiene, tetracycline mouth rinses, topical steroids and topical anesthetics. Systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants are occasionally indicated.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111ECh8k]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of infections developing in damaged skin (burn wounds, animal and human bites, and pressure ulcers)?

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in the prevention of infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended (recommendation 1C).

For patients with systemic signs of infection, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic, and anaerobic organisms is always required (recommendation 1C).

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group that includes bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds, and pressure ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft-tissue infections.

Soft-tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound. In general, 10–20% of bite wounds become infected, including 30–50% of cat bites, 5–25% of dog bites, and 20–25% of human bites, respectively.

The predominant pathogens in these wounds are part of the normal oral flora of the biting animal, along with human skin organisms and occasional secondary invaders (e.g. S. aureus and GAS). Along with Staphylococcus ssp. (including MRSA) and Streptococcus ssp. (including S. pyogenes), the commonly isolated pathogens include Pasteurella spp. (Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis), Capnocytophagia canimorsus, anaerobes (Fusobacterium spp. Prevotella spp. Bacteroides spp. Porphyromonas spp.), and others. Streptococci can be isolated from 50% of human bite wounds, S. aureus from 40%, and Eikenella corrodens (a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus) from 30%. Human bites can transmit HBV, HCV, and HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in every case.

### Human pasteurellosis health risk for elderly persons living with companion animals [^113j1Saf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Pets, including dogs and cats, are frequently recommended to patients with chronic illness because animal therapy might provide a potential health benefit. Elderly patients may also own companion animals to combat loneliness; however, pets may be the potential source of various infections or injuries. Our retrospective survey showed that the rate of human pasteurellosis over a 13-year study period in Hungary increased from year to year and with advanced age, and the number of Pasteurella infections was higher than it was in earlier studies. We observed that Pasteurella patients with cat- and dog-associated injuries were frequently hospitalized. In cases of invasive infections, the source of Pasteurella infection was frequently unknown. In spite of the adequate treatment on the basis of medical chart review and antimicrobial drug susceptibility of the isolated strain, the death rate from these infections was 27.1% in our study. We also found that complications after localized infections were detected frequently, and certain complications, such as lymphangitis, are associated only with injuries caused by cat bites; this connection was not described in earlier publications. We think that the rate of pasteurellosis is much higher than estimated because many patients with smaller injuries do not seek medical advice, and in many cases, general practice physicians try to treat smaller injuries and do not perform sample collection or order microbiological investigations. Our results, as well as international results, show that education about the possible health hazards associated with pet ownership should be provided, and the increased risks for infection in elderly and immunocompromised patients should be emphasized.

### Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Pasteurella dagmatis, Germany [^113hiry2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

We continued to administer antibiogram-appropriate penicillin G therapy for a total of 6 weeks after the initial negative blood culture results. We administered levofloxacin, which we selected over an aminoglycoside antibiotic because of its superior abscess penetration, for the first 20 days as a combined therapy. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit on the 21st day after surgery, exhibiting full consciousness and only mild focal neurologic deficits (dysphagia). He was discharged from the hospital shortly afterward and began rehabilitation treatment.

The choice of treatment in this case was complicated by the paucity of evidence regarding IE caused by P. dagmatis. Gump and Holden reported IE caused by a new species of Pasteurella bacteria in 1972. In 1994, Sorbello et al. reported another case, complicated by vertebral osteomyelitis. In 2001, Rosenbach et al. reported prosthetic valve IE caused by P. dagmatis. A more recent case was reported in 2012 by Strahm et al. (Appendix Table). Four of the 5 reported cases (including the case we describe) resulted from domestic cat bites, and all definitive therapies included either penicillin G or ceftriaxone. All patients survived infection. Antimicrobial therapy for P. multocida infection is similar to the course we describe, and penicillin has been recommended in all specimens that tested susceptible to it.

Empiric antibiotic therapy for animal wounds varies by severity (ranging from amoxicillin/clavulanate to piperacillin/tazobactam) and also needs to target other potential pathogens. Cat bites can be easily underestimated and justify careful therapy and follow-up. Animal contact could have been missed in this case because the wound had healed fully before the first symptoms of IE. Obtaining the patient's history greatly helped in the diagnosis.

Dogs are the animal most frequently implicated in causing bite injuries to the human face. Dog bite injuries are most prevalent in younger patients. Pasteurella species are commensals of the oral microbiome of dogs and cats and are frequently implicated in infections resulting from dog and cat bite injuries. HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C need to be considered in bites inflicted by humans. All animal bite wounds should be washed out. Most animal bite injuries can be managed in an outpatient setting. Given the cosmetically sensitive nature of the face, bite wounds generally merit suturing, even in delayed presentations.

Abstract

Background

Bite injuries are a common occurrence and may result in significant morbidity. The aim of the study was to investigate bite injuries, their treatment, and consequences in the urban milieu of a European industrialized nation.

Methods

A retrospective, monocentric analysis was conducted on data of bite injuries during the study period from 2010 to 2020. Factors such as age, sex, vaccination status, injury pattern, injury location, the duration of treatment in outpatient, inpatient, or intensive care settings were investigated together with radiological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters, as well as the therapies employed.

Results

The majority of the included 442 patients were between the ages of 20 and 50, with a mean age of 37.2 ± 18.4 years (0.7–91). The female sex was more frequently affected (59%). Most bite injuries were caused by dogs (49.9%), followed by cats (36.1%) and humans (9.8%) and were often caused by domestic animals (78%). The hand was the most common site of bites (n = 251), followed by the forearms (n = 75) and lower legs (n = 43). In children under the age of 10, the head was the most common site of bites. In only 5% of patients, injuries extended to deeper structures. Wound infection was observed in 14.7% of the bite wounds. The mean number of treatment days for patients with infected bite wounds was significantly higher than that for patients with non-infected wounds, regardless of whether they were outpatients, inpatients, or intensive care patients (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusions

In accordance with the severity of the injury, a prompt examination, imaging, laboratory diagnostics, and individualized therapy are required. The implementation of an early therapeutic regimen comprising debridement and irrigation, calculated antibiotic therapy, and immobilization can effectively mitigate the risk of developing a fulminant wound infection. Similarly, bite wounds caused by exotic species are to be treated with haste and precision.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^1124KyqS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Timely post-exposure prophylaxis prevents the fatal onset of rabies, which causes an estimated 60 000 human deaths each year, mostly in Africa and Asia and among children. Domestic dogs are responsible for 99% of human cases. Although mass dog vaccination is required for elimination of dog-mediated rabies, the disease burden could be substantially reduced through improved access to post-exposure prophylaxis.

WHO recommendations for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis have been updated in line with new evidence. Procedures depend on the type of contact with the suspect rabid animal, with administration of rabies immunoglobulin recommended for high-risk exposures. Intradermal multisite vaccination regimens have been developed, which are more economical than intramuscular administration because they use reduced vaccine volumes. While the use of post-exposure prophylaxis at current levels saves many lives, access to post-exposure prophylaxis is poor in many parts of the world, particularly rural areas where most rabies exposures occur. Even if people who have been bitten get to a treatment centre and post-exposure prophylaxis is available, its cost is often unaffordable.

Bacillary angiomatosis and cat scratch disease — antibiotic therapy and dosing are specified as follows: Azithromycin is recommended for cat scratch disease according to the following dosing protocol, with patients > 45 kg receiving 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg for 4 additional days and patients < 45 kg receiving 10 mg/kg on day 1 and 5 mg/kg for 4 more days (strong, moderate). For bacillary angiomatosis, erythromycin 500 mg qid or doxycycline 100 mg bid for 2 weeks to 2 months is recommended (strong, moderate), with evidence noting that cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis therapy has not been systematically examined, either erythromycin (500 mg qid) or doxycycline (100 mg bid) appears effective, the duration of initial therapy should be for 2 weeks to 2 months, relapse may warrant prolonged therapy (months) until immunocompetence returns, and HIV-infected patients may require lifelong treatment; trial data report a single, double-blind placebo-controlled study of 29 patients, 14 of whom received azithromycin, in which lymph node size regressed by 80% at 30 days more commonly in the azithromycin-treated patients (P = 0.02).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114UcFAC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bite wounds — preemptive antimicrobial therapy and rabies prophylaxis: Preemptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3–5 days is recommended for patients who (a) are immunocompromised, (b) are asplenic, (c) have advanced liver disease, (d) have preexisting or resultant edema of the affected area, (e) have moderate to severe injuries, especially to the hand or face, or (f) have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule (strong, low). Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies may be indicated; consultation with local health officials is recommended to determine if rabies prophylaxis should be initiated (strong, low). Numerous studies have failed to definitively determine who should receive early, preemptive therapy, so the decision to give "prophylactic" antibiotics should be based on wound severity and host immune competence. Prophylactic or early preemptive therapy seems to provide marginal benefit for patients with dog bites who present within 12–24 hours after injury, particularly in low-risk wounds. A meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials of dog bite wounds found a cumulative incidence of infection of 16%, with a relative risk of infection in patients treated with antibiotics compared with controls to be 0.56. Amoxicillin-clavulanate administered in one study to patients with full-thickness animal bites presenting > 9 hours after the bite resulted in a lower infection rate. A Cochrane review supported limiting prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites to hand injuries and human bites, but the 8 studies had limitations including small numbers (range, 12–190), failure to perform intention-to-treat analysis (4 of 8 studies), and unspecified method of randomization (4 of 8 studies).

### Cost-effectiveness evaluation of a novel integrated bite case management program for the control of human rabies, Haiti 2014–2015 [^1165TxMT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Model.

HARSP implementation began in 2013 in Pétionville and was fully operational in all three communes by 2014. Using epidemiological and cost data from 2014 to 2015, we estimated the annual costs and effectiveness of HARSP from a governmental perspective. We developed a user-friendly spreadsheet, where further details about calculations are provided. We estimated the costs and effectiveness of four alternative ways of implementing human rabies prevention programs (Table 1). The four scenarios assessed were 1) No bite case management (NBCM), that is, the medical treatment of dog bite victims that report to the health system with suspected rabies exposures (the situation in Haiti before the implementation of HARSP); 2) HARSP intervention, including animal rabies surveillance, bite investigations, and medical treatment of bite victims that report to the health system, including those potential victims advised to seek PEP during community bite investigations; 3) HARSP recommended (HARSPr), the hypothetical situation in which recommendations for rabies prevention and PEP treatment by HARSP are fully adhered; and 4) World Health Organization recommended (WHOr), the hypothetical situation in which all bite victims that seek medical treatment receive PEP according to the WHO recommendations. The latter two scenarios represent the potential for improvement of HARSP and NBCM, respectively, because they illustrate the results of rabies prevention and control if people strictly followed recommended guidelines. We considered the same self-directed bite victims' health-care-seeking behavior in the four scenarios; however, in the HARSP scenarios, we also added the proportion of bite victims that did not present to the health-care system initially but were encouraged to seek treatment as a result of dog bite investigations in their communities. We compared all four scenarios based on the number of rabies exposed persons (n 2014 = 837; n 2015 = 1,373), as assessed by HARSP during 2014 and 2015.

### Antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis for snake-bitten patients [^112KYRtc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

To improve management, empiric antibiotics should be directed toward patients at particular risk or suspected of snakebite-related infection. Houcke et al. demonstrated that tissue necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, and thrombocytopenia can predict secondary infection after snakebite. Local envenoming signs should not be confused with infectious manifestations. However, snakebite-related infection can be suspected in the case of frank local inflammatory symptoms, and this presentation justifies empiric antibiotic prescription. A definite diagnosis of infection can only be made and targeted treatment provided when the responsible microorganism is isolated.

International consortiums recommend amoxicillin–clavulanate (AMC) to prevent infection after an animal bite. These recommendations are based on studies involving dog, cat, and human bites, but not snakes. Indeed, snake oral microbiota differ from those of other animals, making AMC ineffective against the involved bacteria most of the time. Studies on the oral microbiota of snakesand causal bacteria of snakebite-related infection, including the new report from Bonilla-Aldana et al.show that isolated microorganisms are mostly Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Morganella morganii, nonfermentative bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila, or Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These bacteria usually originate from the snakes' mouth, contaminated by the fecal flora of prey, which may defecate while being ingested, or from the environment (e.g. A. hydrophila, especially in wet areas). In most cases, the pathogenic bacteria are naturally resistant to AMC. In addition, in a well-designed study by Sachet et al.in the Amazon region, AMC showed poor efficacy in preventing secondary infection from snakebites. Accordingly, first-line AMC is not an appropriate option to treat snake-bitten patients, except when guided by microbiological results. Unfortunately, prophylactic AMC is still largely prescribed in this context.

Medical advice for first treatment

Treatment recommendations for bite wounds:

Immediate presentation and treatment of the bite wound.
Debridement and irrigation with isotonic electrolyte solution.
X-ray to exclude fractures or foreign bodies.
Preferably open wound treatment, but loose-fitting sutures for large defects.
Immobilization in a plaster cast or splint.
If the epidermis is not intact, general broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Consider tetanus vaccination.
Consider rabies vaccination if travel history or risk area is positive.
Contact the poison control center in case of venomous snakebite and obtain antidote if necessary.
Medical wound check via general practitioner.

If the bite wound is infected:

Early surgical treatment of hand or foot phlegmons.
Thorough surgical debridement.
Second-look surgery for severe findings.
Cast immobilization.
Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and later adjustment to the resistogram.
Laboratory tests need not be abnormal.
Daily medical check-ups until infection-free, conducted by hospital doctors or general practitioners.
Occupational therapy and physiotherapy for hand phlegmon after the infection has subsided.

### Human and other mammalian bite injuries of the hand: evaluation and management [^111qxQys]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

The hand is the most common site for bite injuries. Because of specific characteristics of hand anatomy, bite mechanics, and organisms found in human and animal saliva, even small wounds can lead to aggressive infections. Failure to recognize and treat hand bites can result in significant morbidity. Human and animal bites most commonly lead to polymicrobial bacterial infections with a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Pasteurella species are commonly found in dog and cat bite wounds, and Eikenella is characteristic of human wounds. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobic bacterial species are common to all mammals. Although public health measures in developed countries have been highly effective at reducing rabies transmission, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies infection worldwide. Human bites can transmit HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, especially when contaminated blood is exposed to an open wound. Appropriate management of any mammal bite requires recognition, early wound cleansing, evaluation of injured structures, and infection prophylaxis. Structural repair is performed as indicated by the severity and contamination of the injury, and wounds may require delayed closure. Wound infections typically require débridement, empiric antibiotics, and delayed repair or reconstruction.

Periocular trauma — eyelid lacerations: Falls, branches, rocks, and animal bites are among many causes of eyelid lacerations in the wilderness, with simple lid lacerations often horizontal, partial thickness, and not involving the lid margin, which can be managed with irrigation and wound care and has an excellent prognosis. For complex eyelid lacerations that are full thickness and involve the lid margin or medial/lateral end of the palpebral fissures, we recommend evacuation and emergent ophthalmologic evaluation and repair, ideally within 36 h; immediate treatment consists of prompt irrigation and antibiotic ointment with shielding as evacuation continues, but if a ruptured globe is suspected there should be no further examination, manipulation, or irrigation and treatment should follow the ruptured globe section. Wound care and ophthalmologic antibiotic ointment carry Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence ratings, an eye shield carries a Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence rating, and emergent evacuation if complex eyelid laceration is a Strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence.

Bartonella — Preventing exposure in HIV-infected patients: HIV-infected patients, specifically those who are severely immunocompromised (CD4 counts < 100 cells/ mm3), are at high risk of severe disease when infected by B. quintana and B. henselae. The major risk factors for acquisition of B. henselae are contact with cats infested with fleas and receiving cat scratches, and immunocompromised individuals should consider the potential risks of cat ownership (AIII). Patients who want cats should acquire animals that are older than age 1 year and in good health (BII), avoid rough play with cats and situations in which scratches are likely (AII), avoid contact with flea feces and wash any cat-associated wound promptly with soap and water (BIII), and include a comprehensive, ongoing flea-control program under the supervision of a veterinarian (BIII). No evidence indicates any benefits to cats or their owners from routine culture or serologic testing of the pet for Bartonella infection or from antibiotic treatment of healthy, serologically positive cats (BII). The major risk factor for B. quintana infection is body lice infestation, and patients who are homeless or in marginal housing should be informed that body louse infestation can be associated with serious illness and provided with appropriate measures to eradicate body lice, if present (AII).

### Bite injuries at a level 1 trauma center in Germany [^117T2vGB]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bite injuries are a common occurrence and may result in significant morbidity. The aim of the study was to investigate bite injuries, their treatment, and consequences in the urban milieu of a European industrialized nation.

Methods

A retrospective, monocentric analysis was conducted on data of bite injuries during the study period from 2010 to 2020. Factors such as age, sex, vaccination status, injury pattern, injury location, the duration of treatment in outpatient, inpatient, or intensive care settings were investigated together with radiological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters, as well as the therapies employed.

Results

The majority of the included 442 patients were between the ages of 20 and 50, with a mean age of 37.2 ± 18.4 years (0.7–91). The female sex was more frequently affected (59%). Most bite injuries were caused by dogs (49.9%), followed by cats (36.1%) and humans (9.8%) and were often caused by domestic animals (78%). The hand was the most common site of bites (n = 251), followed by the forearms (n = 75) and lower legs (n = 43). In children under the age of 10, the head was the most common site of bites. In only 5% of patients, injuries extended to deeper structures. Wound infection was observed in 14.7% of the bite wounds. The mean number of treatment days for patients with infected bite wounds was significantly higher than that for patients with non-infected wounds, regardless of whether they were outpatients, inpatients, or intensive care patients (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusions

In accordance with the severity of the injury, a prompt examination, imaging, laboratory diagnostics, and individualized therapy are required. The implementation of an early therapeutic regimen comprising debridement and irrigation, calculated antibiotic therapy, and immobilization can effectively mitigate the risk of developing a fulminant wound infection. Similarly, bite wounds caused by exotic species are to be treated with haste and precision.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113Fz7Vd]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bartonella infection prevention in adults and adolescents with HIV — risk awareness, pet exposure, and lice control — states that major risk factors for acquisition of B. henselae are contact with cats infected with fleas and receiving cat scratches; immunocompromised individuals should consider the potential risks of cat ownership (AIII); people with HIV who want cats should acquire animals that are older than 1 year of age and in good health (BII), from a known environment with documented health history and free of fleas; stray or flea-infested cats should be avoided; declawing is not advised, but individuals with HIV should avoid rough play and situations in which scratches are likely (AII); people with HIV should avoid contact with flea feces and wash any cat-associated wound promptly with soap and water (BIII); cat care should include a comprehensive, ongoing flea-control program under veterinarian supervision (BIII); no evidence indicates benefits from routine culture/serologic testing of pets for Bartonella or from antibiotic treatment of healthy, serologically positive cats (BII); the major risk factor for B. quintana infection is body lice infestation, and people with HIV who are experiencing homelessness or in marginal housing should be informed and provided measures to eradicate body lice, if present (AII); primary chemoprophylaxis for Bartonella-associated disease is not recommended (BIII); and regardless of CD4 count, people with HIV and solid organ transplantation may be at risk of more severe Bartonella infections.

### Cat bite infections of the hand: assessment of morbidity and predictors of severe infection [^111u23cW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the overall morbidity of cat bites to the hand and identify risk factors for hospitalization after such an injury.

Methods

All patients recently treated at our institution for cat bite injuries to the hand were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 193 patients in a 3-year period between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011. Patient demographics, medical history, physical examination findings, laboratory values, and long-term follow-up data were collected. Univariate and multivariate statistical regression were used to analyze the data.

Results

Thirty percent (n = 57) of patients with cat bites to the hand were hospitalized. The average length of stay for these patients was 3.2 days. Of the hospitalized patients, 67% (n = 38) underwent irrigation and debridement, with 8 patients requiring more than 1 operation. Complications were common among these patients. Risk factors associated with hospitalization included smoking, immunocompromised state, and location of bite over a joint or tendon sheath. Physical examination findings of erythema and swelling at presentation were also associated with increased risk of hospitalization. Time from bite to presentation, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein values at presentation were not associated with hospitalization.

Conclusions

Cat bite injuries to the hand can progress to serious infection. The treatment of such infections often requires hospitalization, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and operative treatment. Clinical findings suggestive of the need for hospitalization include location of the bite over a joint or tendon sheath, erythema, pain, and swelling. These findings should increase concern for a severe infection and warrant hospitalization and urgent consultation with a hand surgeon.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^1117wTGV]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness wound infection prophylaxis and prevention — whether or not prophylactic antibiotics are given, wounds should be monitored closely because complications can develop rapidly or in an indolent manner. With the exception of certain specific wound categories, there is scant evidence to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis against wound infection, with a notable exception of an open fracture in which acute antibiotic administration significantly lowers the rate of infection. Virtually all open wounds are colonized with microorganisms, but this is usually without clinical consequences, and the presence of colonizing bacteria does not constitute infection. A systematic review of mammalian bites showed a statistically significant reduction in infection with prophylactic antibiotics after bites by humans but not after bites by cats or dogs, except bites of the hand; there was also a statistically significant reduction in infection after mammalian bites to the hand. Although dated, there is evidence to support the use of topical antibiotics to promote wound healing and decrease infection.

Infections developing in damaged skin

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group including bite wounds (animal and human bites), pressure ulcers and burn wounds.

Bite wounds (animal and human bites)

Human bite microbiology generally includes Streptococcus spp, S. aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp and Eikinella spp.

Dog bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella multocida, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and S. aureus.

Cat bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella spp, Capnocytophaga spp, Bartonella henselae (Cat-scratch diseases should be treated with azithromycin 500 mg day 1, 250 mg/day for the next 4 days), S. aureus, Bacteroides spp and Fusobacterium spp.

If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated SSTIs.

Treatment
Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue
Antibiotic prophylaxis as principle is not recommended. It is recommended in selected patients.
Antibiotic therapy in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.
Tetanus prophylaxis in bite wounds

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in preventing infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Primary wound closure is not recommended for wounds, with the exception of those to the face, which should be managed with copious irrigation, cautious debridement, and pre-emptive antibiotics.

The comprehensive meta-analyses of Medeiros et al. in the Cochrane Database demonstrated no evidential basis for reducing the infection rate by prophylactic antibiotics, except for selected cases. Despite the poor state of the evidence wounds that are moderate to severe, have associated crush injury, have associated edema (either preexisting or subsequent), that are on the hands or in proximity to a bone or a joint, or that are in compromised hosts should receive 3–5 days of antibiotic therapy.

A broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is required, if systemic signs of infection or severe cellulitis arise.

Human bites that have broken the skin and drawn blood can theoretically transmit hepatitis B, C, and HIV. A patient who has sustained a bite should always confirm that their tetanus booster is up to date.

### Risk of rabies and implications for postexposure prophylaxis administration in the US [^1131EUni]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Number Needed to Treat

The NNT for all estimates of Pr(death|exposure) and the PEP cost per death averted is shown in Figure 4. For high estimates of Pr(death|exposure), few people need to be treated to prevent 1 death. For example, the NNT for multiple bites to the head by a skunk in Georgia that was unprovoked and ill or acting strangely is 1 / 0.54 = 1.85. This value is lower than the estimated NNT of rapid defibrillation for cardiac arrest, a common emergency medical intervention for which 2.5 people need to be treated to prevent 1 death. In contrast, many people need to be treated to prevent 1 death from a low-risk exposure: a single bite to the arm from a vaccinated cat in Michigan that was ill and provoked has an NNT of 1/0.000007 = 143 000. Public health interventions with comparably high NNTs are generally not available due to lack of data (large, randomized controlled trials are needed).

Figure 4.
Number Needed to Treat (NNT) to Prevent 1 Rabies Death and Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Cost per Death Averted by the Probability of Death Given Human Exposure to a Suspect Rabid Animal, Pr(death|exposure)

Examples of low- and high-risk exposures are shown by the dashed lines. The low-risk exposure corresponds to a single bite to the arm from a vaccinated cat in Michigan that was ill and provoked, while the high-risk exposure corresponds to multiple bites to the head by a skunk in Georgia that was unprovoked and ill or acting strangely.

### Dog and cat bites to the hand: treatment and cost assessment [^116ShkzW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the demographic patterns, clinical morbidity, and treatment costs associated with domestic animal bites to the hand.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed on 111 patients who suffered either a dog or cat bite to the hand. Demographic data were collected for both the patient and the animal involved.

Results

The patient population had suffered 71 dog bites and 40 cat bites. Two scenarios were identified that increased the likelihood of a bite: (1) attempting to separate fighting animals and (2) attempting to aid an injured animal. More than half of the victims (61 of 111) were bitten by an animal with which they were familiar. Bite injuries ranged from relatively minor wounds to major injuries that included open fractures, persistent deep infection including osteomyelitis, nerve laceration, tendon laceration, or tissue loss. Approximately two thirds of patients required hospital admission at least for intravenous antibiotics. Approximately one third of animal bite victims required at least 1 surgical procedure. Thirteen patients required long-term intravenous antibiotics and/or multiple surgeries and incurred medical expenses in excess of dollar 77,000.

Conclusions

Domestic animal bites to the hand are common injuries that can produce considerable morbidity. Stray animals did not account for the majority of incidents. Bite prevention strategies should focus on careful handling of animals that are fighting or injured. Animal bite wounds often require intravenous antibiotics and hospitalization and the cost of care for deep infections can be enormous. Our patient population was selected from a small geographic area over a relatively short collection period, suggesting that domestic animal bite injuries may represent a major public health issue.

### Management of simple insect bites: where's the evidence? [^116ua1Mf]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Many insects bite in order to obtain a blood meal and, in the process, inject the victim with saliva that may contain a number of substances, some of which can be immunogenic. The consequences of insect bites include local reactions, immune (allergic) reactions including anaphylaxis, and secondary bacterial infections (e.g. impetigo, cellulitis). Although insect bites are perceived to be common in the UK, the exact incidence is difficult to estimate since most are likely to go unreported: only those causing the more serious reactions are seen in primary care settings. Simple insect bites are those that are not accompanied or followed by anaphylactic shock or systemic infection. Many preparations for the treatment of insect bites, including antihistamines and topical corticosteroids, are available for purchase over the counter (OTC) in the UK. However, there is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of these treatments and, in general, recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion and clinical experience. This article reviews the evidence for the management of simple bites by insects commonly encountered in the UK, but excludes ticks, mites and lice.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^1113EffU]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Occupational health — pathogen-specific management in laboratory and animal settings includes maintaining a registry of pathogens in use and awareness that laboratory exposures may entail greater inoculum and different clinical presentations than naturally acquired infections. Select agents are defined as biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health, and possession and handling of these pathogens are strictly regulated by federal law (Bioterrorism Preparedness Act). Nonhuman primates, particularly macaque species, can be asymptomatic carriers of B virus, a herpesvirus with > 70% mortality in untreated humans, and all macaque exposure incidents should have targeted training, decontamination, and treatment protocols meeting national guidelines. Rabies researchers/staff dealing with wild or feral animals should have pre-exposure immunization and sero-monitoring, poxvirus researchers should be offered Vaccinia vaccination as well as counseling specific to poxvirus risk factors such as atopic dermatitis, and bite injuries from cats, dogs, primates, and large mammals should receive prophylactic antibiotics in many cases. Q fever, carried by cattle, sheep, and goats, is notable for infection after very small inoculums; exposed staff should be closely monitored for early treatment to prevent endocarditis and other sequelae. Toxoplasmosis is extremely dangerous to pregnant and immune-compromised patients; post-exposure prophylaxis regimens are available but toxic, and serial serologic monitoring may be useful for management decisions.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites [^1145Cuy8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bites by mammals are a common problem and they account for up to 1% of all visits to hospital emergency rooms. Dog and cat bites are the most common and people are usually bitten by their own pets or by an animal known to them. School-age children make up almost a half of those bitten. Prevention of tetanus, rabies and wound infection are the priorities for staff in emergency rooms. The use of antibiotics may be useful to reduce the risk of developing a wound infection.

Objectives

To determine if the use of prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites is effective in preventing bite wound infection.

Search Strategy

Relevant RCTs were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases in November 2000.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials which studied patients with bites from all mammals. Comparisons were made between antibiotics and placebo or no intervention. The outcome of interest was the number of infections at the site of bite.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted the data independently. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method.

Main Results

Eight studies were included. The use of prophylactic antibiotics was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection after bites by humans. Prophylactic antibiotics did not appear to reduce the rate of infection after bites by cats or dogs. Wound type, e.g. laceration or puncture, did not appear to influence the effectiveness of the prophylactic antibiotic. Prophylactic antibiotics were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection in hand bites (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86; NNT = 4, 95% CI 2 to 50).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is evidence from one trial that prophylactic antibiotics reduces the risk of infection after human bites but confirmatory research is required. There is no evidence that the use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective for cat or dog bites. There is evidence that the use of antibiotic prophylactic after bites of the hand reduces infection but confirmatory research is required.

### Surgical management of pediatric dog bites: a systematic review and treatment guideline [^115sd8Wd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dog bites are a unique and unusual injury in children, associated with atypical bacterial species, high infection rates, and controversial surgical treatment. Expert recommendations currently guide management and no surgical evidence-based guidelines exist. We conducted a systematic review to answer three management questions: (1) What are the best practices for wound management? (2) In what circumstances should prophylactic antibiotics be administered? (3) In what circumstances should rabies prophylaxis be given?

Methods

A structured review was performed using a keyword search querying "pediatric" "dog bite" "management". Results were reported according to the PRISMA methodology. The quality of nonrandomized studies was evaluated according to Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS). Qualitative analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 803 studies were identified and 53 studies were included in the final analysis. Current literature suggests that primary closure of bites which are well irrigated and sharply debrided within 8 h of injury, is not associated with increased infection. While dog bites are associated with an overall high rate of infection (6–25%), routine antibiotic prophylaxis in low-risk wounds does not lower that risk. Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies is indicated for all dog bites where the rabies status of the dog cannot be determined, or the animal cannot be quarantined for 10 days.

Conclusion

High-quality evidence regarding the surgical management of pediatric dog bites is limited. Trial data have demonstrated improved outcomes in wound healing and infection rates with a focus on copious irrigation and diligent wound debridement, although independent validation is needed.

### Infection control: avoiding the inevitable [^1178v1SN]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Infection, while a major cause of morbidity, should not be considered an inevitable consequence of injury. Good aseptic technique, compulsive attention to detail, and thorough understanding of the points addressed in the following list of critical points are the best guarantee that infection will not add avoidable morbidity to misfortune. Critical points regarding infectious problems in care of the injured child: 1. Polymicrobial infection is the rule with 50% of isolates being mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. 2. It is a misnomer to consider antibiotic use in a pediatric trauma victim as prophylactic. Antimicrobials used in this setting are best considered adjunctive. 3. The major indication for anti-infective therapy in pediatric trauma is an injury with a high probability of infection. 4. Antibiotics do not sterilize the wound or body cavity; they limit bacterial proliferation, thereby supplementing effective immune control. 5. Available studies suggest that 24 hours is as efficacious as a longer treatment duration in a purely adjunctive mode. 6. In bites inflicted by dogs and cats, Pasturella species are frequent. 7. Human bites may result in infection by Eikenella corrodens. 8. Based on this bacteriology, adjunctive intravenous ampicillin sulbactam or oral amoxicillin clavulanate are recommended for human and animal bites. 9. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in all significant soft tissue injuries. 10. Risk of osteomyelitis correlates directly with the extent of the associated soft tissue injury and vascular compromise. 11. The majority of infectious complications in the injured child are not a consequence of the injury itself, but rather in the treatment thereof. 12. In the injured child the most common nosocomial infection is lower respiratory followed by primary blood stream and the urinary tract. 13. The management of nosocomial pneumonia in the injured child is based on the time of diagnoses. Early evidence of pulmonary infection requires treatment with a third generation cephalosporin with or without an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Late pneumonia is treated with an aminoglycoside with or without an antipseudomonal added. 14. Catheter related infection is, in the injured child, overwhelmingly gram positive with coagulase negative staphlococcal species accounting for 30–60% of isolates. Staphlococcus aureus is responsible for an additional 15–20%. 15. The role of antibiotics in the prevention of catheter related meningitis is controversial. Recent adult studies suggest no advantage to their routine use. If utilized, they should only be employed prophylactically and not continued throughout the monitoring period. 16. Lack of response to treatment of sepsis may represent an inappropriate antimicrobial agent, improper dosage, inability to achieve adequate levels at the site of infection. (eg, CSF) fungal pathogen, and/or ongoing contamination or undrained purulent focus.

The text notes involvement of "streptococci, S. aureus, and Eikenella corrodens, as well as with multiple anaerobic organisms", that "Eikenella corrodens is resistant to first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and aminoglycosides", and therefore "treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem is recommended; if there is history of hypersensitivity to β-lactams, a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus metronidazole, or moxifloxacin as a single agent is recommended".

Specific recommendations — Scenario 2 (thawing and continued warming), debridement of blisters — debridement of blisters should not be routinely performed in the field. If a clear, fluid-filled blister is tense and at high risk for rupture during evacuation, blister aspiration and application of a dry gauze dressing should be performed in the field, whereas hemorrhagic bullae should not be aspirated or debrided in the field. These recommendations are common practice but lack evidence beyond case series. Recommendation Grade: 2C.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bartonellosis — Epidemiology and prevention in HIV infection notes that bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is caused by either Bartonella quintana or Bartonella henselae, and "Twenty-four species and three subspecies of Bartonella have been isolated and are officially recognized… and eight have been isolated from humans", but "only B. henselae and B. quintana infections have been identified in HIV-infected patients". BA "most often occurs late in HIV infection, in patients with median CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts < 50 cells/mm3". Exposure patterns differ: "Development of BA lesions caused by B. henselae is statistically linked to cat exposure", while "BA caused by B. quintana is associated with body louse infestation and homelessness", and "To avoid exposure to B. quintana, HIV-infected patients should avoid body lice and, if infected, treat the infestation". For B. henselae, "Cats are the most common vector (via a scratch)… ", and "In some areas of the United States, the prevalence of B. henselae bacteremia in pet cats approaches 50%", supporting that "Control of cat flea infestation and avoidance of cat scratches are therefore critical strategies for preventing B. henselae infections in patients who are HIV infected".

### Animal bites… [^116RCQKs]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Cat bites and, to a lesser extent, dog bites may cause infections with Pasteurella multocida, while human bites may cause infections with anaerobes and Eikenella corrodensbut can also transmit hepatitis and HIV. Risk factors for infection include cat and human bites, location of bite, puncture wounds, and 24-hour or longer delay in seeking treatment. Bites that appear superficial and harmless may be associated with significant underlying tissue injury. Meticulous cleaning with extensive irrigation with sterile saline is the cornerstone of management of a bite. Primary wound closure is contraindicated in infected wounds and lacerations of the hand. Antibiotics are indicated for infected wounds, human bites, bites on hands, and presentation after 24 hours. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium is drug of choice with cephalosporins or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole plusclindamycin in those allergic to penicillin.

If animal is unavailable for rabies virus analysis, complete the full series of rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin.

### Dog and cat bites [^111CjnYD]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Animal bites account for 1% of all emergency department visits in the United States and more than $50 million in health care costs per year. Most animal bites are from a dog, usually one known to the victim. Most dog bite victims are children. Bite wounds should be cleaned, copiously irrigated with normal saline using a 20-mL or larger syringe or a 20-gauge catheter attached to the syringe. The wound should be explored for tendon or bone involvement and possible foreign bodies. Wounds may be closed if cosmetically favorable, such as wounds on the face or gaping wounds. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered, especially if there is a high risk of infection, such as with cat bites, with puncture wounds, with wounds to the hand, and in persons who are immunosuppressed. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is the first-line prophylactic antibiotic. The need for rabies prophylaxis should be addressed with any animal bite because even domestic animals are often unvaccinated. Postexposure rabies prophylaxis consists of immune globulin at presentation and vaccination on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Counseling patients and families about animal safety may help decrease animal bites. In most states, physicians are required by law to report animal bites.

### Erythematous pink papules following a cat bite [^112m5qSc]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What treatment would be most appropriate for this patient?
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months
B. Cephalexin for 10 days
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks

Answers:
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months – Incorrect. Rifampin and isoniazid are more appropriate for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. While rifampin does have activity against some atypical mycobacterium, M chelonae is unlikely to respond well to this antibiotic combination.
B. Cephalexin for 10 days – Incorrect. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin with limited activity against atypical mycobacterium. It is more often used to target staphylococcal or streptococcal infections.
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks – Incorrect. Fluconazole is an antifungal agent that is not effective against mycobacterium species.
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months – Correct. Combination therapy with a macrolide antibiotic and tetracycline for a long-term period (at least 3 months) are appropriate to target M chelonae. Ideally, antibiotic treatment is based on specific susceptibilities if available. The use of doxycycline over other tetracyclines such as minocycline minimizes the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions.
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks – Incorrect. Fluoroquinolones alone are inappropriate for the treatment of this atypical mycobacterium and would need to be combined with a macrolide or tetracycline to account for resistance.

### Managing parrot bite injuries to the hand: not just another animal bite [^115hFpWJ]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bites and scratches are common injuries, frequently sustained from humans, dogs and cats. Exotic pet-related harm however is an important and increasingly emerging class of injury. Whilst the principles of prompt and thorough medical assessment, antibiotics and potential surgical washout and debridement apply, exotic pet wounds require further consideration. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (also known as co-amoxiclav) is not sufficient for the pathogens transmitted by parrot bites. We illustrate the importance of adequate consideration of microbiological pathogens with a case report of an open finger fracture resulting from a parrot bite. We intend this to be a valuable resource for healthcare professionals in their effective management of such injuries.

### Human rabies cluster following badger bites, people's republic of China [^115bmKgg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

All 7 case-patients with badger-associated rabies had tried to catch badgers that were sluggish and could not escape. All bites occurred on the fingers, when the badger was captured or carried home. The captors killed and ate 2 badgers, 4 badgers died spontaneously, and the fate of 1 badger was not known. The cat-associated rabies case from the same area occurred in February 2004. The cat died spontaneously during the same period when some badgers died spontaneously nearby. We found no other villagers who had been bitten by these or other badgers. The case-patients and family members did not know that badgers can transmit rabies and did not seek treatment or postexposure prophylaxis. These case-patients had no other exposure to bites from other potentially rabid animals in the 10 years before onset.

The 7 case-patients lived in villages covering an area of ≈10 km 2, representing ≈0.2% of the total county area. The individual villages were 1,500–3,000 m apart. All were on the same side of a mountain ridge. Mountainous terrain and limited transportation isolate this county from nearby counties. Villagers reported seeing dead badgers before human cases occurred. During the past 20 years in this county, ≈15,000 persons received rabies postexposure prophylaxis after dog bites, but no rabies occurred. During 2002–2004, no human rabies cases followed exposure to dogs that were within 50 km of this county.

After 2004, we set up a rabies surveillance and health education system in this county. At the end of 2004, we advised the public in this and 5 neighboring counties to avoid catching and killing badgers and, if bitten, to seek postexposure prophylaxis. Since that recommendation, no human rabies has occurred in the area. In 2006, a total of 1,719 residents were treated for animal bites. The incidence of animal exposures in this county is higher than in the United States. Dog bites accounted for 86% (1,471), cat bites for 9.5% (164), and other animals for 4.9% (84) of exposures. However, no badger bites were reported.

### Infectious complications of bite injuries [^116TuMqa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bite injuries are a public health burden. Dog bites outnumber cat bites, but cat bites pose the greatest risk for infection. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most frequent infectious manifestations resulting from bite injury, although invasive infection may occur through direct inoculation or dissemination through the bloodstream. Although contemporary, well-designed trials are needed to inform clinical practice, preemptive antibiotic therapy after a bite injury is warranted for injuries posing high risk for infection and for patients at risk of developing severe infection; antibiotics should target aerobic and anaerobic microbes that comprise the oral and skin flora.
