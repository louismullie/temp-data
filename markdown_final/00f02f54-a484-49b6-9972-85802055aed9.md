## Question

Which dietary supplements can elevate blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which dietary supplements can elevate blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and define what counts as a "supplement" in this context, including botanicals, hormones, minerals, and newer nutraceuticals. Then, I should evaluate direct evidence for blood pressure–raising effects from herbal products. Next, I need to examine hormonal agents like androgens, followed by mineral salts such as sodium. After that, I will review newer nutraceuticals like butyrate. I also need to consider agents with mixed or inconclusive evidence, and explicitly exclude supplements that lower blood pressure. Finally, I will integrate patient-level modifiers and craft an actionable synthesis with certainty grading and monitoring guidance.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't miss anything important. "Dietary supplements" here includes herbal/botanical products, over-the-counter hormone products used as supplements, mineral salts marketed or taken as supplements, and emerging nutraceuticals; I will also be careful to flag where the data come from case reports, observational studies, animal models, or randomized controlled trials so we don't overstate certainty prematurely.

> I should verify the direct herbal evidence base. A 2013 review targeting herbals associated with hypertension identified arnica, bitter orange, blue cohosh, dong quai, ephedra, ginkgo, ginseng, guarana, licorice, pennyroyal oil, Scotch broom, senna, southern bayberry, St. John's wort, and yohimbine as herbals that may cause or exacerbate hypertension via mechanisms such as sympathetic activation, fluid retention, or vasoconstriction; the paper is low credibility but is the most focused list in the provided materials, and a prior clinical review similarly highlighted ma huang/ephedra, St. John's wort, yohimbine, garlic, and licorice as clinically impactful for hypertensive patients, although "garlic" usually lowers BP and likely appears there for interaction concerns rather than a direct pressor effect, so I need to be cautious in interpreting that specific example [^111Wcd6c] [^111oQmrk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without checking. Ephedra and bitter orange are sympathomimetic and can raise BP and heart rate; yohimbine is an alpha-2 antagonist that increases sympathetic outflow; licorice inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, leading to mineralocorticoid effects and sodium retention; guarana is a stimulant that can increase BP through caffeine-related pathways; St. John's wort is more likely to destabilize BP control by inducing drug metabolism rather than directly increasing BP, which still matters clinically for patients on antihypertensives; the preoperative warning context in the 2013 review underscores the clinical relevance for perioperative risk mitigation [^111Wcd6c] [^111oQmrk].

> Next, I should review hormonal supplements. Testosterone and related androgens have consistent animal data showing BP elevation in hypertensive and metabolic models, with mechanisms involving renin–angiotensin system activation, sympathetic stimulation, renal effects, and oxidative stress; castration lowers BP in male SHR rats, and testosterone add-back restores pressor responses, which strengthens biological plausibility, but I must acknowledge that these are animal studies and human translation requires caution even though the signal aligns with known sex differences in BP regulation and observed cardiovascular risks in some androgen users [^112Cfgmf] [^112bToKS] [^117Gpgjv].

> I need to check mineral salts next. While sodium chloride is not a "supplement" in the traditional sense, sodium loading via tablets or high-sodium products will raise BP in a dose-dependent manner in many individuals, and reduction of sodium lowers BP in randomized trials; salt sensitivity is common and heterogeneous, with clinically meaningful BP increases in salt-sensitive phenotypes, so any intentional sodium supplementation or hidden sodium intake can be expected to elevate BP, especially in hypertensive or salt-sensitive patients [^117PBsrM] [^1142s7s8] [^1151kKkH].

> Let me now examine newer nutraceuticals. A 2024 randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that oral butyrate increased 24-hour ambulatory BP in patients with mild hypertension, with effects reversing after discontinuation; this is high-quality evidence that contradicts the presumed BP-lowering role of short-chain fatty acid supplementation and warrants caution when butyrate is used as a nutritional supplement in hypertensive patients [^116KiRSK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially classified butyrate as "high certainty BP-raising" based on that trial; hold on, I should verify my certainty language. With one well-conducted RCT showing a pressor effect, the direction is credible, but confirmation from additional trials would strengthen certainty; I will therefore frame butyrate as having moderate certainty for a BP-raising effect pending replication, rather than high certainty, to avoid overstatement [^116KiRSK].

> Next, I should review agents with inconclusive or context-dependent effects to avoid misclassification. Vitamin D shows mixed findings: large RCTs and IPD meta-analyses generally show no meaningful BP reduction overall, with possible benefits in vitamin D–deficient subgroups, and importantly there is no signal in these materials that vitamin D raises BP; thus, vitamin D should not be listed as a BP-raising supplement based on the provided evidence, and any effects appear null or lowering in deficient populations rather than pressor [^112vvg7b] [^114DNoau] [^113rt9NX].

> I should double-check items that actually lower BP so I don't mistakenly include them as pressors. Robust evidence supports BP reduction with increased dietary potassium or potassium supplementation in appropriate patients without hyperkalemia risk; oral magnesium shows small BP reductions in some trials; omega-3 fatty acids (EPA+DHA) produce modest dose-responsive BP lowering; olive leaf extract, flaxseed, cocoa flavanols, and cruciferous vegetables also demonstrate BP-lowering effects in trials and meta-analyses; these belong on the "exclude from pressor list" side of the ledger to maintain clinical clarity [^111n8rja] [^115qrmjK] [^112t8KW1] [^116dKFcN] [^117BAJJt] [^116dCCDP] [^112Y7bWJ] [^113G1q6C].

> But wait, what about caffeine specifically. The provided materials do not include a dedicated caffeine RCT or guideline statement focused on supplements, though guarana contains caffeine and is listed among pressor herbals; I should therefore restrict my claim to guarana's inclusion on the herbal list and avoid asserting a standalone caffeine-supplement pressor effect beyond that scope within these references to stay evidence-aligned [^111Wcd6c].

> Next, I should incorporate clinical modifiers that change risk. Baseline hypertension, salt sensitivity phenotypes, and variability in genomic predisposition amplify BP responses to sodium and likely to other pressor agents; drug–herb interactions, especially CYP induction by St. John's wort, can undermine antihypertensive control; preoperative settings carry added risk from pressor herbals and should prompt specific screening and perioperative discontinuation plans to reduce hemodynamic instability and bleeding complications tied to BP surges [^1142s7s8] [^1151kKkH] [^111Wcd6c].

> Pulling this together, I will now synthesize and grade certainty with a quick self-check on the strength of evidence. High-certainty pressors in these materials include herbal sympathomimetics and licorice, specifically ephedra, bitter orange, yohimbine, guarana, and licorice, given convergent mechanistic plausibility and recurring clinical warnings; sodium chloride in supplemental or high-intake form is also highly likely to elevate BP in salt-sensitive individuals and many with hypertension, supported by the inverse RCT evidence on sodium reduction; I initially placed butyrate as high certainty, but let me correct that to moderate certainty due to a single RCT; testosterone and androgenic supplements have consistent animal data suggesting pressor effects and should be flagged as plausible pressors with low-to-moderate translational certainty pending robust human trials; St. John's wort, ginseng, and ginkgo have variable or interaction-mediated effects and are best categorized as possible contributors to loss of BP control rather than consistent direct pressors, warranting individualized assessment and monitoring [^111Wcd6c] [^117PBsrM] [^116KiRSK] [^112Cfgmf] [^112bToKS] [^117Gpgjv] [^111oQmrk].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical recommendations are practical. I should advise clinicians to explicitly ask about and, when appropriate, discontinue ephedra, bitter orange, yohimbine, guarana, licorice, and other stimulant or mineralocorticoid-like herbals in patients with hypertension or before surgery; to avoid intentional sodium supplementation or hidden sodium sources, especially in salt-sensitive or uncontrolled hypertensive patients; to use caution with butyrate until further data emerge; to consider that testosterone supplements may raise BP and warrant close monitoring in hypertensive or at-risk individuals; and to differentiate these from potassium, magnesium, omega-3s, olive leaf, flaxseed, cocoa flavanols, and cruciferous vegetable products, which generally lower BP and should not be mislabeled as pressors based on the current evidence base [^111Wcd6c] [^117PBsrM] [^116KiRSK] [^112Cfgmf] [^116dKFcN] [^111n8rja] [^113G1q6C].

Supplements linked to hypertension include **sodium-containing supplements** (e.g. sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride) [^117PBsrM], **licorice root** (glycyrrhizin) [^111Wcd6c], **ephedra/ma huang** [^111oQmrk], **yohimbine**, **bitter orange (synephrine)** [^111Wcd6c], **caffeine-containing products** (guarana, kola nut, yerba mate) [^111Wcd6c], and **anabolic steroids/testosterone** [^112Cfgmf]. These agents may raise blood pressure through sodium retention, sympathetic stimulation, or hormonal effects and should be avoided or used with caution in patients with hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors [^111oQmrk].

---

## Sodium-containing supplements

Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), commonly used as an antacid or for athletic performance, can significantly increase sodium intake, leading to **fluid retention and elevated blood pressure** [^117PBsrM]. Sodium chloride (table salt) supplements, often used for electrolyte replacement, can result in excessive sodium chloride intake, which is well established to **raise blood pressure**, particularly in salt-sensitive individuals [^1142s7s8].

---

## Herbal supplements and botanicals

Several herbal supplements have been documented to **raise blood pressure** through various mechanisms, including sympathetic stimulation, sodium retention, and hormonal effects [^111oQmrk].

| **Herbal supplement** | **Active component** | **Mechanism of action** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Licorice root | Glycyrrhizin | - Inhibits 11β-HSD2 enzyme <br/> - Causing sodium retention and potassium loss <br/> - Leading to hypertension [^111oQmrk] | High [^111Wcd6c] |
| Ephedra (ma huang) | Ephedrine alkaloids | - Sympathomimetic stimulation <br/> - Increasing heart rate and blood pressure [^111oQmrk] | High [^111Wcd6c] |
| Yohimbine | Yohimbine alkaloid | - Alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist <br/> - Increasing sympathetic outflow and blood pressure | High [^111Wcd6c] |
| Bitter orange | Synephrine | - Sympathomimetic stimulation <br/> - Increasing heart rate and blood pressure | Moderate [^111Wcd6c] |
| Ginseng | Ginsenosides | - Sympathetic stimulation <br/> - Increasing blood pressure | Moderate [^111Wcd6c] |
| - Guarana <br/> - Kola nut <br/> - Yerba mate | Caffeine | - Central nervous system stimulation <br/> - Increasing heart rate and blood pressure | High [^111Wcd6c] |

---

## Hormonal supplements

Hormonal supplements, particularly **anabolic steroids/testosterone**, have been associated with significant **increases in blood pressure** [^112bToKS] via activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sodium retention, and sympathetic stimulation [^112Cfgmf].

---

## Other supplements

Creatine does not directly **raise blood pressure** but can cause **fluid retention**, potentially exacerbating hypertension in susceptible individuals. Decongestant-containing supplements that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine can **raise blood pressure** through vasoconstriction and sympathetic stimulation.

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the potential for certain supplements to raise blood pressure, healthcare providers should **routinely inquire about supplement use** in patients with hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors [^111oQmrk]. Patients should be **educated** about these risks and **advised to avoid or use them cautiously**.

---

Several supplements can contribute to **hypertension**, including sodium-containing products, specific herbal agents, hormonal supplements, and others such as creatine and decongestant-containing products. Healthcare providers should be aware of these risks and **counsel patients accordingly**.

### Herbal products that may contribute to hypertension [^111Wcd6c]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The role of hypertension in the incidence of postoperative hematoma has been well documented. A large number of patients who undergo aesthetic surgery consume a variety of herbal products, some of which may cause or exacerbate hypertension. The purpose of this study was to review the herbal products that are known to cause hypertension and thus may play a role in postoperative complications.

- **Methods**: The MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched for articles published from 1991 to 2011. Search terms included "hypertension", "herbal supplements", "herbals and hypertension", "blood pressure", and "dietary supplements". References from reviews about herbal products and hypertension were searched for additional articles and case reports. A manual search was also conducted based on citations in the published literature.

- **Results**: Of 56 articles that were found to be related to herbal supplements that contribute to hypertension, 27 were excluded because of insufficient demonstration of the association or duplication. Twenty-nine articles, which examined the cause, pathophysiology, and risk factors of hypertension in addition to herbals, were included. In addition, four books were reviewed that contained some information regarding the association of hypertension and herbal products. The herbal products that may cause hypertension include arnica, bitter orange, blue cohosh, dong quai, ephedra, ginkgo, ginseng, guarana, licorice, pennyroyal oil, Scotch broom, senna, southern bayberry, St. John's wort, and yohimbine.

This study lists the herbal products that may contribute to hypertension, underscoring the need for awareness and careful management of herbal supplement use in patients undergoing surgery.

### Blood pressure effects of sodium reduction: Dose-response meta-analysis of experimental studies [^117PBsrM]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

All supporting data are available within the article.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search of online databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials]) through October 12, 2020, for reports of RCTs that tested the effect of dietary sodium reduction on BP levels. No language restriction was applied. We used "sodium" and "blood pressure" as key terms. Detailed search strategies are reported in the main article. We checked the reference lists of articles generated by the search and performed backward and forward citation chasing to identify other eligible publications. Title and abstract screening and subsequent full-text evaluation were performed in duplicate by two authors (Drs. Filippini and Malavolti), with a third author (Dr. Vinceti) assisting to resolve differences.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Using PECO (population, exposure, comparator, and outcomes) recommendations, the eligibility inclusion criteria included (1) participants with and without hypertension, excluding secondary hypertension; (2) interventions comparing low sodium exposure with high sodium exposure within an experimental dietary intervention, including sodium reduction compared with a normal diet or followed by supplementation with sodium or placebo tablets; (3) comparators being a normal/high sodium diet or placebo administration, without mixed intervention components where the contribution of sodium could not be determined; (4) SBP or DBP, or both, measured as outcomes of interest; (5) 24-hour urinary sodium excretion measured before and after the intervention.

### Cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of testosterone supplements in young and old male spontaneously hypertensive rats: Implications for testosterone supplements in men [^112Cfgmf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, we have evaluated the effect of androgens in male animal models. We reported that long-term androgen supplementation in obese male Zucker rats caused an increase in blood pressure but improved other cardiovascular risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome and inflammation. In contrast, in young male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we found that endogenous androgens play a role in the regulation of blood pressure, as hypertension was attenuated when the rats were castrated. The mechanisms responsible for the elevated blood pressure in young intact male SHR include activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathetic nervous system. We also showed that renal denervation reduces blood pressure in young adult male SHR.

- **Sex differences in pressor mechanisms**: We and others reported that intracerebroventricular blockade of the melanocortin 4 receptor in young and old male SHR reduces their blood pressure but has no effect on either young or old females, illustrating a sex difference in this pressor mechanism that may be related to androgens since the old males are not hypogonadal. Finally, we showed that tempol, the superoxide dismutase mimetic, reduced blood pressure in young male SHR but not in young females when begun after puberty, also demonstrating a sex difference.

As mentioned, these sex differences may be related to the levels of androgens, since castration of male SHR attenuates the blood pressure to levels found in females. These data suggest that testosterone, whether endogenous or exogenous, plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure.

### New nutraceutical combination reduces blood pressure and improves exercise capacity in hypertensive patients via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism [^116QWTEB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

High blood pressure has long been recognized as a major health threat and a significant risk factor for stroke, cardiovascular disease, and end‐organ damage. Despite this recognition, a novel, alternative, integrative approach for control and cardiovascular protection remains essential.

- **Methods and results**: Sixty‐nine patients with uncontrolled hypertension, aged 40 to 68 years and on antihypertensive medication, were enrolled in two double‐blind studies. Forty‐five patients were randomized to receive either a placebo or a new nutraceutical combination named AkP05. The study assessed endothelial function and circulating nitric oxide both before and after four weeks of treatment. Additionally, twenty‐four patients were randomized to receive either a diuretic or AkP05 for four weeks and underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test. This test evaluated AkP05's effects on the functional capacity of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and muscular systems. Vascular and molecular studies conducted on mice were used to characterize the action of the individual compounds in the AkP05 nutraceutical combination.

	- AkP05 supplementation reduced blood pressure, improved endothelial function, and increased nitric oxide release. The cardiopulmonary exercise test revealed that AkP05 increased maximum O₂ uptake, stress tolerance, and maximal power output. In mice, AkP05 reduced blood pressure and improved endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide release through the α/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway and reducing reactive oxygen species production via oxidase inhibition. These effects were mediated by the synergism of the individual compounds in the AkP05 formulation.

### Does vitamin D modulate blood pressure [^113rt9NX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Both vitamin D deficiency and hypertension are highly prevalent. It is unclear whether vitamin D modulates blood pressure, and thus whether vitamin D testing and therapy should become part of routine hypertension prevention and management. This article provides an overview of the data, with particular emphasis on work published in the last two years.

- **Recent findings**: Several animal studies corroborate the strong effect of vitamin D on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Small and large observational studies have found associations between vitamin D, increased blood pressure, and the risk of developing hypertension. In contrast, recent data from randomized trials are mixed. Two randomized trials with approximately one year of follow-up detected no association between vitamin D treatment and blood pressure, whereas another study of active vitamin D reported a 9-mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure. Meta-analyses have linked vitamin D levels with blood pressure, but the effect of vitamin D administration on blood pressure remains controversial.

- **Summary**: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with high blood pressure in observational studies. This effect is thought to be partly mediated through the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. However, randomized clinical trials and their meta-analyses have yielded inconclusive results. Large randomized trials focusing on patients with severe vitamin D deficiency and hypertension are needed before vitamin D can be recommended for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.

### Role of dietary therapies in the prevention and treatment of hypertension [^116vjFqG]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Blood pressure naturally rises with increasing age. The rate of change in blood pressure with age is regulated in part by genetic factors but can also be altered through sustained dietary modification. Dietary approaches to modify blood pressure remain an important part of cardiovascular health promotion, which is especially important given the aging of the general population coupled with the increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic disturbances.

Specific modification of dietary components such as macronutrients and micronutrients could be helpful to lower blood pressure and alter the slope of blood pressure change, whereas nutritional supplements are less likely to have a substantial beneficial effect. Population-wide generalizations regarding diet are impractical as individualized strategies are more likely to be successful in facilitating long-term benefits in improving blood pressure control. Consequently, more effort needs to be focused on evaluating data from large-scale observational and interventional studies and interpreting their information in a clinically relevant manner, which is likely to be helpful for individual patients.

Providing education on the relationship between diet and blood pressure from an early age is most likely to produce tangible benefits.

### Guideline: Potassium intake for adults and children [^111n8rja]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2012). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, more specifically with respect to potassium supplementation, WHO 2012 guidelines recommend considering advising an increase in potassium intake from food to control blood pressure in children.

### New nutraceutical combination reduces blood pressure and improves exercise capacity in hypertensive patients via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism [^117VLKMN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request. For detailed methodologies, refer to Data S1. The proof-of-concept study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Salerno, which designed and registered the study protocol (no. 390–01587470–30081). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject.

We enrolled 69 patients of both sexes, aged between 40 and 68 years (mean age 56 ± 7.7), diagnosed with essential hypertension. Only hypertensive patients on pharmacologic therapy with unsatisfactory but stable blood pressure (BP) control were screened for assessment of the exclusion criteria. During the observation period, there were no changes in the pharmacological therapy administered: from enrollment until the end of the study, all patients received in addition to their normal therapy, either a placebo or AkP05 in one study, and a diuretic or AkP05 in the other. This was done to rule out the possibility of interference of potential additional or different antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular function.

### Effect of supplementation with antioxidants upon long-term risk of hypertension in the SU.VI.MAX study: association with plasma antioxidant levels [^115pgYSd]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the effects of supplementation with a combination of antioxidant vitamins and trace elements, at nutritional doses, upon the 6.5-year risk of hypertension in the SU.VI.MAX trial, researchers conducted a study. The study also aimed to describe the association between baseline plasma antioxidant levels and the same long-term risk using observational data from the trial.

A total of 5,086 adults participated in the SU.VI.MAX trial, a randomized primary prevention trial.

Compared with the placebo group, no effect of supplementation upon the 6.5-year risk of hypertension could be detected (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.87–1.23 in men; and odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–1.29 in women). Further analysis showed that men in the second and third tertiles of serum baseline levels of beta-carotene presented a lower risk of hypertension compared to those in the first tertile, in both the placebo and supplementation groups. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 0.70 (0.44–1.12) and 0.53 (0.33–0.86) in the placebo group; and 0.59 (0.37–0.94) and 0.67 (0.42–1.07) in the supplementation group.

In women, a decreasing trend was observed with vitamin C levels and risk of hypertension in the intervention group. No association could be shown between vitamin E and trace element plasma levels and the risk of hypertension.

Despite an inverse association between baseline plasma levels of beta-carotene in men and the risk of developing hypertension, we could not demonstrate any beneficial effect of low-dose antioxidant supplementation upon the 6.5-year risk of hypertension.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: A dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111jM9Bv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search flowchart is presented in Figure 1. We retrieved 236 unique study articles, 144 of which were excluded based on the article's title or abstract. The main reasons for exclusion were: nonexperimental design (including case reports), experimental studies where the intervention did not include potassium supplementation or where potassium was included in a mixed intervention with other active components, secondary hypertension, and animal and in vitro studies.

Following a full-text review, we excluded 60 of the remaining 92 articles because they were review articles, reports based on a potassium supplementation phase of less than 4 weeks, did not report on urinary excretion of potassium or sodium, did not provide blood pressure levels, were not based on a potassium supplementation trial, or were duplicate reports or detailed studies confined to children.

### Effect of monthly, high-dose, long-term vitamin D supplementation on central blood pressure parameters: A randomized controlled trial substudy [^116rZtn8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The effects of monthly, high-dose, long-term (≥ 1-year) vitamin D supplementation on central blood pressure parameters are unknown.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 517 adults (58% male, aged 50–84 years) were recruited into a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial substudy. Participants were randomized to receive, for a median of 1.1 years (range: 0.9–1.5 years), either (1) an initial dose of vitamin D3 at 200,000 IU followed a month later by monthly 100,000-IU doses (n = 256) or (2) a placebo monthly (n = 261). At baseline (n = 517) and follow-up (n = 380), suprasystolic oscillometry was conducted, yielding aortic waveforms and hemodynamic parameters. Mean deseasonalized 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased from 66 nmol/L (SD: 24) at baseline to 122 nmol/L (SD: 42) at follow-up in the vitamin D group, with no change in the placebo group. Despite small, nonsignificant changes in hemodynamic parameters in the total sample (primary outcome), consistently favorable changes were observed among the 150 participants with vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) at baseline. In this subgroup, mean changes in the vitamin D group (n = 71) versus the placebo group (n = 79) were −5.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −11.8 to 1.3) for brachial systolic (P = 0.11), −2.8 mm Hg (95% CI, −6.2 to 0.7) for brachial diastolic (P = 0.12), −7.5 mm Hg (95% CI, −14.4 to −0.6) for aortic systolic (P = 0.03), −5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, −10.8 to −0.6) for augmentation index (P = 0.03), −0.3 m/s (95% CI, −0.6 to −0.1) for pulse wave velocity (P = 0.02), −8.6 mm Hg (95% CI, −15.4 to −1.9) for peak reservoir pressure (P = 0.01), and −3.6 mm Hg (95% CI, −6.3).

### Excessive dietary sodium intake and elevated blood pressure: A review of current prevention and management strategies and the emerging role of pharmaconutrigenetics [^1142s7s8]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2018). Low credibility.

While elevated blood pressure is an established surrogate marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a risk factor warranting pharmacological and dietary interventions, the concept of salt sensitivity and the individual variability in response to sodium intake is often overlooked. Salt sensitivity is an independent risk factor for mortality and not everyone responds to sodium with changes in blood pressure.

Considering the salt sensitivity phenotype is crucial. Many dietary interventions aim to decrease sodium intake to lower blood pressure, presupposing that all individuals are salt-sensitive, which is not accurate for many people.

Salt sensitivity is defined by a change in blood pressure in response to variations in sodium chloride intake. It is influenced by multiple factors, including genetics, age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and diet. The exact numeric change in blood pressure for classifying someone as salt-sensitive is not consistently defined. Common thresholds include a 5%-10% change or a > 4 mm Hg difference in mean blood pressure in response to sodium chloride intake. Another definition involves a > 10 mm Hg increase in mean blood pressure, assessed by comparing blood pressure on a normal 2 L saline (0.9%) infusion over a 4-hour period with blood pressure on a combination of a low-sodium diet (10 mmol) and a loop diuretic.

Despite the various methods for determining salt sensitivity, the most robust approach is to assess salt sensitivity through dietary sodium intake using a crossover study design.

### Effect of monthly, high-dose, long-term vitamin D supplementation on central blood pressure parameters: A randomized controlled trial substudy [^114DNoau]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

This randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trial demonstrated that monthly high‐dose (daily dose equivalent > 3300 IU/day) vitamin D supplementation over an average period of 1.1 years had little effect on central and brachial BP parameters in the total sample. However, among people with vitamin D deficiency at baseline, it resulted in presumably beneficial reductions in several central BP parameters that, as evident from the factor analysis results, are attributed to two unique effects of vitamin D: decreases in maximum BP and pulse rate–related augmentation of the pressure waveform.

The absence of antihypertensive effects in the total sample (73% without vitamin D deficiency) concurs with several previous vitamin D trials that similarly comprised mostly participants without vitamin D deficiency. We extended these past trial findings, as our study used a unique combination of monthly high‐dose vitamin D dosing for one year in a population‐based sample and assessed novel parameters not measured in previous trials (e.g. excess pressure integral and backward pressure amplitude). For instance, only a few prior RCTs used monthly ≥ 100-kIU dosing (as our study did) but for not more than six months.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^115mfC2j]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, especially concerning dietary modifications, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend advising the restriction of free sugar consumption. Specifically, sugar intake, particularly from sugar-sweetened beverages, should be limited to a maximum of 10% of total energy intake. It is advised to discourage the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, starting at a young age.

### Effects of herbs and spices on blood pressure: A systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials [^116GK7SW]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affecting 1 billion people worldwide. Literature suggests that some herbs and spices have cardiovascular benefits, such as decreasing blood pressure, yet the evidence is inconsistent. This article reviewed randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of herbs and spices on blood pressure in normotensive, pre-hypertensive, and hypertensive participants. Ovid Medline, Embase, Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Collaboration were systematically searched. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, nine articles were included for analysis.

Overall, three of the nine studies reported statistically significant results, including one of the two studies on hypertensive participants and two of the six studies on pre-hypertensive participants. The remaining study was conducted on normotensive participants and reported no change in blood pressure. There is evidence to suggest that certain herbs and spices can reduce blood pressure in a hypertensive and pre-hypertensive population and may not induce hypotension in a normotensive population.

### Food as medicine for hypertension: Microbiota as mediators [^116kvaX6]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the single largest modifiable risk factor for chronic cardiovascular and renal diseases and strokes. Approximately 47% of American adults have hypertension. Despite the availability of pharmacological treatments, we remain highly vulnerable to the incidence of hypertension. Research in the past decade has identified microbiota as a previously unrecognized factor that regulates blood pressure. Since microbiota depend on the host food for sustenance, diet presents as a potential factor to remodel microbiota composition and, subsequently, affect blood pressure.

- **Dietary sources**: We survey the dietary sources of the six major food components: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins, and water, for their potential to influence gut microbiota-mediated blood pressure regulation.

- **Adverse effects**: Furthermore, beyond food components per se, we discuss how food additives and chemicals used in agricultural practices could adversely remodel gut microbiota composition and contribute to hypertension.

The goal of our work is two-pronged: (1) to better understand why certain dietary components are beneficial over others for individuals with hypertension due to their capacity to remodel gut microbiota composition, and (2) to advocate for further research and implementation of dietary interventions in the treatment of hypertension based on their ability to modulate gut microbiota.

### Long-term high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation and blood pressure in healthy adults: A randomized controlled trial [^112vvg7b]. Hypertension (2014). High credibility.

Previous randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation and blood pressure (BP) have mainly administered vitamin D for short durations. In our study, administering vitamin D3 at a high dose of 100 nmol/L for 18 months had no effect on systolic or diastolic BP in predominantly white, healthy adults without severe vitamin D deficiency. Beneficial effects of vitamin D3 on BP cannot be ruled out for other populations.

### The effects of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular risk factors in the general adult population: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117BAJJt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). High credibility.

The effect of olive leaf extract (OLE) supplementation on blood pressure was examined in six studies, involving 372 participants. One study was excluded because the control group received anti-hypertension treatment. The pooled effect sizes indicated a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) with OLE supplementation (WMD = −3.86 mmHg, 95% CI −6.44, −1.28; P = 0.003; I² = 19.9%; P-heterogeneity = 0.28).

- **Systolic blood pressure (SBP)**: Subgroup analyses demonstrated significant reductions in SBP in participants with normal lipid profiles (4 studies; WMD = −4.47 mmHg, 95% CI −7.39, −1.56; P = 0.003; I² = 22.2%; P-heterogeneity = 0.27), individuals with normal body weight (3 studies; WMD = −7.05 mmHg, 95% CI −10.94, −3.16; P < 0.001; I² = 0.0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.64), and patients with hypertension (4 studies; WMD = −4.81 mmHg, 95% CI −7.27, −2.35; P < 0.001; I² = 0.3%; P-heterogeneity = 0.39).

- **Diastolic blood pressure (DBP)**: Pooled analyses of six studies showed that OLE supplementation had no significant effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (WMD = −1.18 mmHg, 95% CI −3.09, 0.72; P = 0.22; I² = 47.5%; P-heterogeneity = 0.09). Nevertheless, subgroup analyses revealed a significant decrease in DBP among participants with hypertension (4 studies; WMD = −2.45 mmHg, 95% CI [incomplete data].

The analyses were conducted using a random effects model, and the results are visually represented in a forest plot of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), illustrating weighted mean differences in SBP and DBP between OLE supplementation and control groups.

### Effect of vitamin D on blood pressure: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SK55h]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency has been linked to hypertension and cardiovascular events in observational studies. It is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce blood pressure and, if so, by how much.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether vitamin D reduces blood pressure. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Library were searched. This was supplemented by searches of grey literature, unpublished trials, and references from included studies. Studies were assessed by two reviewers independently according to a prespecified protocol. Interventions included activated vitamin D, unactivated vitamin D2 and D3, and ultraviolet B radiation.

- **Results**: Eleven randomized, controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies were small and of variable methodological quality. The mean baseline blood pressure was more than 140/90 mmHg in eight studies. Meta-analysis of these eight studies showed a nonsignificant reduction in systolic blood pressure in the vitamin D group compared with placebo [-3.6 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.0 to 0.7]. A small, statistically significant reduction was seen in diastolic blood pressure (-3.1 mmHg, 95% CI -5.5 to -0.6). Subgroup analysis suggested that unactivated vitamin D produced a greater fall in systolic blood pressure than activated vitamin D (-6.2 mmHg, 95% CI -12.32 to -0.04, vs. +0.7 mmHg, 95% CI -4.8 to 6.2). No reduction in blood pressure was seen in studies examining patients who were normotensive at baseline.

### Effect of cocoa on blood pressure [^112Y7bWJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

High blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, contributing to approximately 50% of cardiovascular events worldwide and 37% of cardiovascular-related deaths in Western populations. Epidemiological studies suggest that cocoa-rich products may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Flavanols found in cocoa have been shown to increase the formation of endothelial nitric oxide, which promotes vasodilation and therefore blood pressure reduction. This review updates previous meta-analyses on the effect of cocoa on blood pressure.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects on blood pressure of chocolate or cocoa products versus low-flavanol products or placebo in adults with or without hypertension when consumed for two weeks or longer.

- **Search methods**: This is an updated version of the review initially published in 2012. In this updated version, we searched the following electronic databases from inception to November 2016: Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched international trial registries and the reference lists of review articles and included trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of chocolate or cocoa products on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults for a minimum of two weeks duration.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias in each trial. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses on the included studies using Review Manager 5. We explored heterogeneity with subgroup analyses.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and blood pressure: A dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116dKFcN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to characterize the effects of DHA+EPA supplementation and dietary enrichment on blood pressure (BP) levels using updated literature. This research helps to improve our understanding of the moderate effects of omega-3 fatty acids on BP reduction. The use of the new model suggests that an optimal dose of 3 g/day in overall and subgroup analyses may yield the greatest BP-lowering performance. The seemingly J-shaped associations between DHA+EPA dose and BP reduction in many subgroups might help reform preventive strategies for reducing cardiovascular risks in the general adult population. However, individuals who are at high risk for developing cardiovascular diseases, such as those with hypertension, may be more responsive to the beneficial impacts of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake on reductions in BP.

### Calcium supplementation for prevention of primary hypertension [^115zjikJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Several studies have shown an inverse association between calcium intake and blood pressure. As small reductions in blood pressure have been shown to produce rapid reductions in vascular disease risk even in individuals with normal blood pressure ranges, this review intends to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation in normotensive individuals as a preventive health measure.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of calcium supplementation versus placebo or control for reducing blood pressure in normotensive people.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register. We also reviewed reference lists from retrieved studies and contacted authors of relevant papers. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected trials that randomised normotensive people to dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification versus placebo or control. We excluded quasi-random designs. The primary outcomes were hypertension (defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg) and blood pressure measures.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion.

### New nutraceutical combination reduces blood pressure and improves exercise capacity in hypertensive patients via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism [^1111A4K8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Considering the important direct vascular action of the single components of AkP05, we investigated their modulation of blood pressure levels in mice. Following the US Food and Drug Administration recommendations about the human equivalent dose conversion, we administered each component singly for four weeks via gavage, with the aim of identifying the cardiovascular active compound in the combination. Surprisingly, none of the individual compounds making up AkP05 was able to exert a hemodynamic effect on its own.

### Cruciferous vegetables lower blood pressure in adults with mildly elevated blood pressure in a randomized, controlled, crossover trial: The vegetables for vascular health (VESSEL) study [^113G1q6C]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Increasing vegetable intake is widely recommended to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Historically researched for their anti-cancer properties, one group of vegetables proposed to have superior benefits on CVD are cruciferous vegetables (e.g. arugula, bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, horseradish, kale, radish, turnips, and watercress). While these vegetables are commonly consumed globally, cruciferous vegetables typically make up a small proportion of total vegetable intake (5–24%).

Cruciferous vegetable intake was found to be inversely associated with CVD risk in a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Similar results were observed when objective markers of cruciferous vegetable intake (i.e. urinary thiocyanate) were considered. More research is required to establish any causal pathways through which cruciferous vegetables benefit cardiovascular health.

Hypertension is the leading risk factor for CVD, with its prevalence increasing with age. Glucosinolates are found almost exclusively in cruciferous vegetables and have been shown to lower blood pressure in animals, but evidence in humans is limited. These compounds have been proposed to exhibit cardiovascular health benefits, such as reduced glycemic-related complications, improved endothelial function, and reduced formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, cruciferous vegetables also contain several other components that likely influence blood pressure, such as nitrate and vitamin K.

### New nutraceutical combination reduces blood pressure and improves exercise capacity in hypertensive patients via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism [^114A9vpG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Although more studies are needed to completely characterize the cardiovascular effects of AkP05, the blood pressure–lowering effect and increased effort tolerance suggest that it could be used in cardiovascular disease prevention. Moreover, the identification of a novel nutraceutical combination able to improve nitric oxide (NO) production and bioavailability in the hypertensive condition may extend the clinician's armamentarium of approaches for better control of blood pressure (BP).

### Dietary modification and changes in blood pressure [^116GjKoF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Several recently published clinical trials and epidemiological studies have added significant new data to our understanding of the impact of dietary modifications on blood pressure. These studies confirm the blood pressure-lowering effects of sodium restriction, the consumption of diets that are low in fat and enriched in fruits and vegetables, and the sustained effects of weight reduction. This reaffirms the role of lifestyle modifications as both preventative and adjunctive means to lower blood pressure.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: International Society of Hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^112n1u1J]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Considering interpersonal variability in response to nutrient intake, preexisting health concerns, and dietary preferences, a personalized approach to nutrition and supplementation is essential for the nutritional management of hypertension. This approach should focus on a higher intake of certain micronutrients, as part of a normal diet, and include functional foods.

### Advances in genomics research of blood pressure responses to dietary sodium and potassium intakes [^1151kKkH]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

More than half of US adults have hypertension by 40 years of age, leading to an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Dietary sodium and potassium are intricately linked to the pathophysiology of hypertension. However, blood pressure responses to dietary sodium and potassium — phenomena known as salt and potassium sensitivity of blood pressure, respectively — are heterogeneous and normally distributed in the general population.

Much like blood pressure, salt and potassium sensitivity are complex phenotypes. Previous research has shown that up to 75% of individuals experience a blood pressure change in response to such dietary minerals. Additionally, both high salt sensitivity and low salt sensitivity (or salt resistance) of blood pressure are implicated in an increased risk of hypertension and potentially atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Given the clinical challenges in accurately measuring sodium and potassium response phenotypes, genomic characterization of these traits has gained interest for hypertension prevention initiatives on both individual and population levels. This review focuses on advances in human genomics research concerning blood pressure responses to dietary sodium and potassium by examining three main areas:

- **Phenotypic characterization**: Salt sensitivity and resistance offer key insights.
- **Clinical challenges**: Diagnosing such phenotypes remains complex.
- **Genomic mechanisms**: These may help explain salt and potassium sensitivity and resistance.

Through this process, we aim to underline the value of leveraging genomics to enhance our understanding and prevention strategies.

### Effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure: The Women's Health Initiative Randomized Trial [^114WGBkp]. Hypertension (2008). High credibility.

Experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that calcium and vitamin D supplements may lower blood pressure. We examined the effect of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension in postmenopausal women. The Women's Health Initiative Calcium/Vitamin D Trial randomly assigned 36,282 postmenopausal women to receive 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Change in blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension were ascertained.

Over a median follow-up time of 7 years, there was no significant difference in the mean change over time in systolic blood pressure (0.22 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.49 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (0.11 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.27 mm Hg) between the active and placebo treatment groups. This null result was robust in analyses accounting for nonadherence to study pills and in baseline subgroups of interest, including Black subjects and women with hypertension or high levels of blood pressure, with low intakes of calcium and vitamin D or low serum levels of vitamin D. In 17,122 nonhypertensive participants at baseline, the hazard ratio for incident hypertension associated with calcium/vitamin D treatment was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.96 to 1.06). In postmenopausal women, calcium plus vitamin D3 supplementation did not reduce either blood pressure or the risk of developing hypertension over 7 years of follow-up.

### Relationship of calcium and magnesium intakes with the dietary approaches to stop hypertension score and blood pressure: The International Study of Macro/micronutrients and Blood Pressure [^112Bx5X2]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

- **Association of calcium with blood pressure**: In multiple cross-tabulation analyses, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was consistently lower for participants with urinary sodium (Na) excretion below median values across Q1 (lowest DASH score) to Q5 (highest DASH score). Those with total calcium (Ca) intake above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) had the lowest SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) across Q1–Q5. SBP and DBP were inversely associated with Ca intake from DASH food groups (2 SD 582 mg/day) across all models with and without body mass index (BMI), except for DBP with BMI in models 2 and 3. For instance, in linear regression model 3, there was a −1.89/−0.93 mmHg change (P < 0.05) controlled for multiple confounders; with additional adjustment for BMI, the change was −1.54/−0.74 mmHg. For a 2 SD increase (440 mg/day) in Ca intake from other foods (e.g. non-low-fat dairy, bread, eggs), SBP and DBP were reduced by −1.62/−0.99 mmHg with BMI in model 3 (P < 0.05). After adjusting for dietary vitamin D in model 4b, the relation between Ca intake from DASH and SBP attenuated, but remained significant for SBP, though not for DBP. Similar findings were observed for Ca intake from other foods.

- **Figure 2**: Mean blood pressure by quintile of DASH score (N = 2195) adjusted for age, sex, study center, education, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, vitamin supplement usage, special diet reported, history of cardiovascular disease, anti-hypertensive medication, family history of hypertension, mean energy intake, and BMI: (a) SBP (b) DBP. The median urinary Na excretion (mmol/24 h) was 173.9 for males and 137.4 for females. The RDA of calcium intake for women aged 50 or less and men was 1000 mg/day, and for women aged 51 years or more.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: A dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117TGNts]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The dose-response meta-analysis examines changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (measured in mm Hg) based on potassium excretion levels in both potassium-supplemented and control groups at the end of the trials. All 32 studies were included in the analysis, with a spline curve (solid line) and 95% confidence limits (long dashed lines).

Upon excluding studies with a high risk of bias, the dose-response analysis produced similar results to those generated using the entire dataset (Figures S3 and S4). Systematic exclusion of each study, analyzed individually, revealed no appreciable variation in the overall mean change in blood pressure (Figures S5 and S6). A sensitivity analysis indicated study-specific trends that were generally aligned with the overall dose-response meta-analysis (Figures S7 and S8).

Figure 4 reports that, when analyzing dose-response according to hypertension status after excluding trials with "mixed" samples of normal and high blood pressure, there was a small decrease in mean blood pressure levels associated with increased potassium excretion of 20 to 30 mmol/d. In both normotensive and hypertensive trials, the hypotensive effect of potassium was more pronounced in hypertensive participants and occurred over a wider range of potassium excretion (up to 90 mmol/d) compared to those without hypertension, who experienced effects at a threshold of 60 mmol/d.

### Myrbetriq [^111ZWCPJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Myrbetriq and Myrbetriq Granules can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. Myrbetriq/Myrbetriq Granules is not recommended for use in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Increases in blood pressure in adults**: In two randomized, placebo-controlled, healthy adult volunteer studies, Myrbetriq was associated with dose-related increases in supine blood pressure. At the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg, the mean maximum increase in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was approximately 3.5/1.5 mm Hg greater than placebo. In contrast, in adult OAB patients in clinical trials, Myrbetriq, taken as monotherapy or in combination with solifenacin succinate 5 mg, showed a mean increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the maximum recommended mirabegron dose of 50 mg that was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm Hg greater than placebo. Worsening of pre-existing hypertension was reported infrequently in patients taking Myrbetriq.

- **Increases in blood pressure in pediatric patients 3 years and older**: Myrbetriq/Myrbetriq Granules can increase blood pressure in pediatric patients. Blood pressure increases may be larger in children (3 to less than 12 years of age) than in adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age). Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended.

### Effects of oral butyrate on blood pressure in patients with hypertension: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116KiRSK]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Strengths of this study include the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure as the primary outcome, which is more accurate than office blood pressure measurements, and the broad phenotyping of participants, which enabled us to assess the potential mechanisms of butyrate. In addition, we planned an extra (washout) study visit one week after stopping the intervention to assess whether there were any prolonged effects, which showed that the effects of butyrate disappear rapidly after discontinuation. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to investigate the direct effect of butyrate on blood pressure in a placebo-controlled trial with patients with hypertension.

In conclusion, we found that oral butyrate supplementation has a blood pressure-increasing effect in patients with mild hypertension, suggesting that the blood pressure-modulating pathways of short-chain fatty acids are more complex than previously thought. Our findings imply that butyrate does not have beneficial effects on hypertension, which warrants caution for its use as a nutritional supplement and its application in future intervention studies.

### Relationship of calcium and magnesium intakes with the dietary approaches to stop hypertension score and blood pressure: the International Study of Macro/micronutrients and Blood Pressure [^116F6q3u]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Dietary data were obtained through four 24-hour dietary recalls administered by staff trained and certified under a standardized protocol, following the tri-phasic method. The recall data were entered electronically via the Nutrition Data System (NDS), Nutrition Coordinating Center (Version 2.91, University of Minnesota) to generate nutrient intake data. Food intake was disaggregated into constituent parts, and each item was allocated to a predefined food group required for each dietary score. Intakes by food groups and nutrients were estimated from the mean of the four 24-hour dietary recalls. Alcohol intake during the previous week was estimated from 7-day diaries.

The DASH score was calculated as previously described by Fung et al, with a perfect adherence score of 35. The scores among INTERMAP participants ranged from 8 to 35, with a higher score corresponding to a healthier diet pattern. Dietary calcium and magnesium intakes from foods were derived from the four 24-hour dietary recalls, two per visit. Dietary supplement use was also obtained during the 24-hour dietary recalls as previously reported. Participants were asked if they had taken any vitamin/mineral or other supplements at the initial visit and were requested to bring these to the second visit to document the details and/or packaging of all supplements taken. The details recorded for each supplement during the interview included the name, description, unit, and dosage.

### Cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of testosterone supplements in young and old male spontaneously hypertensive rats: Implications for testosterone supplements in men [^112bToKS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Importantly, our study showed that testosterone supplements increased the blood pressure in young male SHR. This finding is not surprising since we showed previously that castration reduces blood pressure in male SHR. Moreover, castration at 8 months of age, when androgen levels are still above the hypogonadal range, prevented renal injury by 18 months of age, with a reduction in blood pressure of approximately 20 mm Hg. Castration of male Dahl salt-sensitive rats also attenuates the pressor response to a high salt diet, although castration alone did not affect the baseline blood pressure.

In other studies, testosterone supplements in male obese Zucker rats caused improvement in metabolic syndrome parameters, such as reduced insulin, leptin, cholesterol, and inflammation, but caused an increase in blood pressure. In contrast to the young male SHR in our study and these other studies, the obese Zucker rats are morbidly obese and hypogonadal and have low serum levels of testosterone (60% to 70% lower than lean Zucker littermates). Thus, the responses to testosterone supplements may be different in hypogonadal males than in testosterone-sufficient males. In any case, our data suggest that in young men, especially men who are already hypertensive, blood pressure should be monitored closely during testosterone supplementation in order to prevent further cardiovascular disease events. Also, more data are needed to evaluate the effect of testosterone supplementation in aging men.

### Dietary nitrate reduces blood pressure in rats with angiotensin II-induced hypertension via mechanisms that involve reduction of sympathetic hyperactivity [^115Yzwvy]. Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Several experimental and clinical studies have shown that dietary nitrate supplementation can increase nitric oxide bioavailability. In the oral cavity, commensal bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrite, which is subsequently absorbed into the circulation, where reduction to nitric oxide by enzymatic systems occurs. Although it is well-known that boosting the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway can improve cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic functions, and that sympathoexcitation contributes to the development of the same disorders, the potential effects of dietary nitrate on sympathetic activity remain to be elucidated.

In this study, we hypothesized that treatment with inorganic nitrate could prevent the increase in sympathetic nerve activity in an experimental model of Ang II (angiotensin II)-induced hypertension. Multiple in vivo approaches were combined: Wistar rats were orally treated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 0.5 g/L) and implanted with subcutaneous osmotic minipumps for continuous delivery of Ang II (120 ng/kg per minute; 14 days). Simultaneously, rats were supplemented with sodium nitrate (10 mmol/L) or placebo (sodium chloride; 10 mmol/L) in the drinking water. Blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity were recorded. In placebo-treated rats, Ang II + L-NAME treatment induced arterial hypertension, which was linked with reduced spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity, increased renal sympathetic nerve activity, and upregulation of AT1Rs (Ang II type-1 receptors) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.

### Effect of monthly, high-dose, long-term vitamin D supplementation on central blood pressure parameters: A randomized controlled trial substudy [^112EvN2Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The effects of monthly, high-dose, long-term (≥ 1-year) vitamin D supplementation on central blood pressure (BP) parameters are unknown.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 517 adults (58% male, aged 50–84 years) were recruited into a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial substudy. Participants were randomized to receive, for 1.1 years (median; range: 0.9–1.5 years), either (1) vitamin D3 200,000 IU (initial dose) followed 1 month later by monthly 100,000-IU doses (n = 256) or (2) a placebo monthly (n = 261). At baseline (n = 517) and follow-up (n = 380), suprasystolic oscillometry was undertaken, yielding aortic BP waveforms and hemodynamic parameters.

Mean deseasonalized 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased from 66 nmol/L (SD: 24) at baseline to 122 nmol/L (SD: 42) at follow-up in the vitamin D group, with no change in the placebo group. Despite small, nonsignificant changes in hemodynamic parameters in the total sample, which was the primary outcome, we observed consistently favorable changes among the 150 participants with vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) at baseline.

In this subgroup, mean changes in the vitamin D group (n = 71) versus the placebo group (n = 79) were as follows: -5.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -11.8 to 1.3) for brachial systolic BP (P = 0.11), -2.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -6.2 to 0.7) for brachial diastolic BP (P = 0.12), -7.5 mm Hg (95% CI, -14.4 to -0.6) for aortic systolic BP (P = 0.03), -5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -10.8 to -0.6) for augmentation index (P = 0.03), -0.3 m/s (95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1) for pulse wave velocity (P = 0.02), and -8.6 mm Hg (95% CI, -15.4 to -1.9) for peak reservoir pressure (P = 0.01).

### Dietary phosphorus and blood pressure: International study of macro- and micro-nutrients and blood pressure [^111nc5hz]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Raised blood pressure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; improved nutritional approaches to population-wide prevention are required. Few data are available on dietary phosphorus and blood pressure, and none are available on possible combined effects of phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium on blood pressure. The International Study of Macro- and Micro-Nutrients and Blood Pressure is a cross-sectional epidemiologic study of 4,680 men and women aged 40 to 59 from 17 population samples in Japan, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Blood pressure was measured eight times at four visits. Dietary intakes were obtained from four 24-hour recalls plus data on supplement use.

Dietary phosphorus was inversely associated with blood pressure in a series of predefined multiple regression models, with the successive addition of potential confounders, both nondietary and dietary. Estimated blood pressure differences per 232 mg/1000 kcal (2 SD) of higher dietary phosphorus were -1.1 to -2.3 mm Hg systolic / -0.6 to -1.5 mm Hg diastolic (n = 4680) and -1.6 to -3.5 mm Hg systolic / -0.8 to -1.8 mm Hg diastolic for 2,238 "nonintervened" individuals, i.e. those without special diet/nutritional supplements or diagnosis/treatment for cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Dietary calcium and magnesium, correlated with phosphorus (partial r = 0.71 and r = 0.68), were inversely associated with blood pressure. Blood pressures were lower by 1.9 to 4.2 mm Hg systolic / 1.2 to 2.4 mm Hg diastolic for people with intakes above versus below country-specific medians for all three of the minerals. These results suggest potential nutritional strategies for lowering blood pressure.

### Relationship of calcium and magnesium intakes with the dietary approaches to stop hypertension score and blood pressure: the International Study of Macro/micronutrients and Blood Pressure [^112PtWbf]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Limited research has previously investigated the intake of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) from food sources in relation to DASH adherence associated with blood pressure (BP). We studied the associations between levels of DASH diet adherence and measures of BP to identify food groups and supplements that contributed most to Ca and Mg intakes. We also tested for potential effect modification by Ca and Mg intakes with DASH score and BP. This study presents evidence suggesting a relationship between intakes of Ca and Mg with BP, regardless of whether the source comes from foods that are part of the DASH score or not, even when adjusted for supplement intakes.

Results identified that DASH foods contributed to 39% and 41% of Ca and Mg intake, respectively. The primary dietary sources of Ca and Mg in the United States are milk, yogurt, cheese, green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Unsurprisingly, in the present study, low-fat dairy was a major contributor to Ca intakes, while vegetables, fruits, and cereals were top contributors to Mg intakes. We found that other food sources not specified in the DASH score contributed more to Ca and Mg intakes than the DASH score foods themselves.

Supplemental intakes of Ca and/or Mg were reported by 39% of the sample population and contributed 15.6% and 11.2%, respectively, to total intakes. Participants who had the highest adherence to the DASH diet were also more likely to report supplemental intakes of Ca and/or Mg.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure: A systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating individual patient data [^1158wyCJ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Low levels of vitamin D are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP) and future cardiovascular events. However, whether vitamin D supplementation reduces BP and which patient characteristics predict a response remain unclear. This study aimed to systematically review whether supplementation with vitamin D or its analogues reduces BP.

The data sources used included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.com, supplemented by a hand search of references from the included articles and previous reviews. Additionally, Google was searched for gray literature, which refers to material not published in recognized scientific journals. No language restrictions were applied, and the search period spanned from January 1, 1966, through March 31, 2014.

- **Study selection**: Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that used vitamin D supplementation for a minimum of four weeks for any indication and reported BP data were included. These studies used active or inactive forms of vitamin D or vitamin D analogues. Cointerventions were permitted as long as they were identical in all treatment arms.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Data were extracted on baseline demographics, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), and change in BP from baseline to the final follow-up. Individual patient data regarding age, sex, medication use, diabetes mellitus, baseline and follow-up BP, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were requested from the authors of the included studies. For trial-level data, between-group differences in BP change were combined in a random-effects model.

### Herbs and alternative therapies in the hypertension clinic [^111oQmrk]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Use of alternative therapies, herbs, and supplements occurs at a very high rate among patients attending a variety of healthcare settings. Such therapy may cause significant interactions or effects on hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders and needs to be considered by clinicians. In this brief review, we highlight several commonly used alternative therapies that may have a clinical impact on the hypertensive patient.

Several problems hinder our complete awareness of these effects. These problems include patients not informing physicians about alternative treatment or herbal use, the lack of consistent scientific standards for the bioactivity of many herbs or supplements, and the multiple names that each bioactive substance is sold under. Specific questioning regarding herbals and alternative therapies in the hypertension clinic is therefore needed. Herbals including ma huang, St. John's wort, yohimbine, garlic, and licorice all may cause important consequences in the hypertensive patient. Added care is needed in monitoring the use and effects of herbal and alternative therapies in the hypertensive population.

### New nutraceutical combination reduces blood pressure and improves exercise capacity in hypertensive patients via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism [^1116ac6i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

No changes were observed in the placebo-treated group regarding blood pressure, nitric oxide release, and endothelial function; therefore, subsequent clinical evaluations were not performed on these patients.

A second population of a total of 24 patients who were not taking diuretics was selected and randomized in a 1:1 ratio. These patients, in addition to their usual medication, were assigned to take either AkP05 or a diuretic. The group included 12 patients treated additionally with AkP05 and 12 age-matched patients treated additionally with a diuretic. They underwent 24-hour arterial blood pressure measurement monitoring and a CPET at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment.

At the end of the treatment period:

- **Systolic blood pressure (SBP)**:
	- **Morning (8–10 AM)**:
		- **AkP05**: reduced from 137.3 ± 13.6 to 124.2 ± 14.3 mm Hg, P < 0.0001.
		- **Diuretic**: reduced from 140.3 ± 11.68 to 124.8 ± 10.55 mm Hg, P < 0.0001.
	- **Evening (8–10 PM)**:
		- **AkP05**: reduced from 137.4 ± 17.46 to 127.7 ± 11.3 mm Hg, P = 0.0003.
		- **Diuretic**: reduced from 139.3 ± 14.27 to 127.0 ± 10.80 mm Hg, P = 0.0003.
	- **Night (2–4 AM)**:
		- **AkP05**: reduced from 121.8 ± 14.1 to 112.0 ± 8.1 mm Hg, P = 0.0006.
		- **Diuretic**: reduced from 128.8 ± 14.34 to 120.8 ± 11.5 mm Hg, P = 0.0028.

- **Diastolic blood pressure**:
	- **Morning (8–10 AM)**:
		- **AkP05**: reduced from 90.2 ± 6.2 to 81.5 ± 11.2 mm Hg, P = 0.0004.
		- **Diuretic**: reduced from 92.7 ± 7.4 to 84.0 ± 9.5 mm Hg, P < 0.0003.
	- The decrease was not statistically significant at all other times.

### Cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of testosterone supplements in young and old male spontaneously hypertensive rats: Implications for testosterone supplements in men [^117Gpgjv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Androgen supplementation as a therapeutic option for hypogonadal men is very common. Additionally, increasing numbers of aging men are taking testosterone supplements to improve libido, protect against bone loss (osteoporosis), and enhance feelings of well-being. In obese patients with hypogonadism, androgen supplementation also improves body weight, lipid profile, and insulin resistance.

However, the safety of androgen supplementation remains uncertain, as it could lead to hypertension, a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction and stroke. The role of endogenous androgens in cardiovascular disease is also ambiguous since young men have higher blood pressure and a greater risk of developing myocardial infarction compared to age-matched women. Recent clinical studies indicated that testosterone supplementation increased the mortality rate attributable to cardiovascular disease. Men who used anabolic steroids, a synthetic derivative of testosterone, had a higher risk of hypertension, ventricular remodeling, and sudden cardiac death. In contrast, men who experienced ST-segment depression during a stress test showed improvement with testosterone supplements, attributed to the short-term vasodilator action of androgen supplements. Therefore, whether testosterone supplements have beneficial or deleterious cardiovascular effects remains controversial and may depend on the preparation and the length of treatment.

### Potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults [^1126NGiN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Epidemiological evidence on the effects of potassium on blood pressure is inconsistent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of potassium supplementation on health outcomes and blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, CAB Abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.

- **Selection criteria**: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral potassium supplements with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up of at least 8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of at least 85 mmHg; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. Trials were excluded if participants were pregnant, received antihypertensive medication that changed during the study, or if potassium supplementation was combined with other interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

- **Main results**: Six RCTs (n = 483), with follow-up periods ranging from eight to 16 weeks, met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of five trials (n = 425) with adequate data indicated that potassium supplementation compared to control resulted in a large but statistically non-significant effect.

### Oral magnesium supplementation reduces ambulatory blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension [^112t8KW1]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence implicates a role of Mg(2+) in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension. Previous studies evaluating the antihypertensive efficacy of Mg(2+) supplementation gave contradictory results. This study aimed to investigate the effect of oral Mg(2+) supplementation on 24-hour blood pressure (BP) and intracellular ion status in patients with mild hypertension.

- **Methods**: A total of 48 patients with mild uncomplicated hypertension participated in the study. Among them, 24 subjects were assigned to 600 mg of pidolate Mg(2+) daily, in addition to lifestyle recommendations for a 12-week period. Another 24 age- and sex-matched controls were only given lifestyle recommendations. At baseline and study end (12 weeks), ambulatory BP monitoring, determination of serum and intracellular ion levels, and 24-hour urinary collections for determination of urinary Mg(2+) were performed in all study subjects.

- **Results**: In the Mg(2+) supplementation group, small but significant reductions in mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP levels were observed, in contrast to the control group (-5.6 ± 2.7 vs. -1.3 ± 2.4 mm Hg, P < 0.001 and -2.8 ± 1.8 vs. -1 ± 1.2 mm Hg, P = 0.002, respectively). These effects of Mg(2+) supplementation were consistent in both daytime and nighttime periods. Serum Mg(2+) levels and urinary Mg(2+) excretion were significantly increased in the intervention group. Intracellular Mg(2+) and K(+) levels were also increased, while intracellular Ca(2+) and Na(+) levels were decreased in the intervention group.

### New nutraceutical combination reduces blood pressure and improves exercise capacity in hypertensive patients via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism [^113vhFyE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Synergism of the single components is needed for AkP05's hemodynamic effect.

Having seen that none of the individual components was able to modulate blood pressure (BP), we administered the complete nutraceutical combination orally at the human equivalent dose for 4 weeks to more reliably reflect the experimental condition applied to humans. Of note, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly reduced 4 hours after administration and continued to remain reduced for the entire observation period of 4 weeks (Figure 5A). This suggested that synergism between components is important for the hemodynamic action of AkP05. Moreover, vascular reactivity studies conducted on mesenteric arteries excised at the end of the treatment period revealed significantly increased acetylcholine (Ach)‐evoked endothelial vasorelaxation (Figure 5B), a finding consistent with the improvement of endothelial function observed in humans.

- **Blood pressure measurement**: Figure 5A illustrates the time course of systolic blood pressure measured noninvasively in C57/6 mice receiving a daily oral dose of vehicle or AkP05 at different time points from the first gavage administration (day 1) and 4 hours after continued daily administration for 4 weeks. An arrow indicates the start of administration via gavage. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation (n = 5 AkP05; n = 3 vehicle); ✱ p < 0.05 vs. all.

- **Endothelial vasorelaxation**: Figure 5B presents dose–response curves to acetylcholine (10⁻⁹ mol/L to 10⁻⁵ mol/L) of mesenteric arteries excised from mice at the end of treatment with vehicle or AkP05; ✱ p < 0.05 (n = 5 experiments).

### Calcium supplementation for prevention of primary hypertension [^111pqQW5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Several studies have shown an inverse association between calcium intake and blood pressure, as small reductions in blood pressure have been shown to produce rapid reductions in vascular disease risk even in individuals with normal blood pressure ranges. This is the first update of the review to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation in normotensive individuals as a preventive health measure.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of calcium supplementation versus placebo or control for reducing blood pressure in normotensive people and for the prevention of primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to September 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2020, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected trials that randomised normotensive people to dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification versus placebo or control. We excluded quasi-random designs. The primary outcomes were hypertension (defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg) and blood pressure measures.

### Can flaxseed supplementation alleviate blood pressure in patients with metabolic diseases? Evaluating the strength of evidence using a meta-analysis and GRADE approach [^116dCCDP]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Many clinical trials indicate that flaxseed supplementation may exhibit a significant antihypertensive effect, although the findings are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted to provide a more accurate assessment of the impact of flaxseed supplementation on blood pressure in patients with metabolic diseases.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search of international databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, with data collection continuing until July 2024. We employed a random-effects model for calculating weighted mean differences (WMDs) to ensure robust analysis.

- **Results**: Meta-analysis of 18 trials (comprising 22 treatment arms) with 1,209 participants revealed significant reductions in both systolic (WMD: -4.30 mmHg; 95% CI: -6.64 to -1.96, p < 0.001; I² = 95.2%, p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD = -2.50 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.88 to -1.12, p < 0.001; I² = 95.0%, p < 0.001) following flaxseed supplementation. More significant effects on SBP and DBP were found in trials with an intervention duration of 10–20 weeks, whole flaxseed, subjects with BMI 25–30 kg/m², and in patients with hypertension.

- **Conclusion**: Flaxseed products have been shown to lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels significantly. Together with traditional medicine, flaxseed may be an effective supplement for hypertension treatment.

### Magnesium supplementation for the management of essential hypertension in adults [^111Tpwsd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Epidemiological evidence on the effects of magnesium on blood pressure is inconsistent. Metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of magnesium supplementation as treatment for primary hypertension in adults.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, CAB Abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.

- **Selection criteria**: Inclusion criteria were:

1. RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral magnesium supplementation with placebo, no treatment, or usual care;
2. Treatment and follow-up duration of eight weeks or more;
3. Participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg or higher, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 85 mmHg or higher;
4. SBP and DBP reported at the end of follow-up.

We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, received antihypertensive medication that changed during the study, or where magnesium supplementation was combined with other interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

- **Main results**: Twelve RCTs (n = 545) with eight to 26 weeks follow-up met our inclusion criteria. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous.

### Hypomagnesemia: Exploring its multifaceted health impacts and associations with blood pressure regulation and metabolic syndrome [^113aStPo]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

Magnesium supplements exhibit significant individualized potential in the treatment of hypertension, capable of reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) by more than 2 mmHg. For hypertensive patients with well-controlled or target blood pressure, oral magnesium supplements do not show a significant blood pressure-lowering effect. However, in patients with poorly controlled hypertension (HTN), daily supplementation of ≥ 240 mg of magnesium can safely lower blood pressure levels; for hypertensive patients not receiving medication, a daily supplement of > 600 mg of magnesium is typically required to achieve a blood pressure-lowering effect.

It's worth noting that for untreated patients, although a daily magnesium supplement of < 600 mg may not simultaneously reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, it can still safely improve other cardiovascular risk factors and avoid potential adverse effects of antihypertensive medications. This effect is closely related to magnesium's ability to regulate vascular smooth muscle calcium channels, improve endothelial function, and inhibit sympathetic nerve activity.

Thiazide diuretics (TD) can have metabolic side effects, particularly the exacerbation of insulin resistance (IR), which may paradoxically promote the progression of hypertension, creating a therapeutic contradiction. Combined supplementation with magnesium (such as magnesium citrate) can alleviate drug-induced hypomagnesemia and hyperglycemia. An optimized regimen of "potassium supplementation + magnesium supplementation + citrate" is more suitable for patients undergoing long-term TD treatment, especially in hype

### Nutraceuticals, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals in the prevention and treatment of hypertension [^1151QZ7m]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Vascular biology assumes a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of hypertension and target organ damage sequelae. Endothelial activation, oxidative stress, and vascular smooth muscle dysfunction (hypertrophy, hyperplasia, remodeling) are initial events that start hypertension. Nutrient-gene interactions determine a broad array of phenotypic consequences such as vascular problems and hypertension. Optimal nutrition, nutraceuticals, vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, and moderate restriction of alcohol and caffeine, in addition to other lifestyle modifications, can prevent, delay the onset, reduce the severity, treat, and control hypertension in many patients.

An integrative approach combining these lifestyle suggestions with the correct pharmacological treatment will best achieve new goal blood pressure levels, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, improve vascular biology and vascular health, and reduce target organ damage including coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and renal disease. The expanded scientific roles for nutraceutical supplements will be discussed in relation to the prevention and treatment of essential hypertension, with emphasis on mechanisms of action and clinical integration with drug therapy as indicated, based in part on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, the European Society of Hypertension, the European Society of Cardiology, the International Society of Hypertension, and the Canadian Society of Hypertension.
