## Question

What could do an interference in the absorption of methimazole?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could interfere with the absorption of methimazole. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of methimazole and whether it has any known absorption issues. Then, I should verify the FDA labeling for any explicit absorption warnings or drug–food interactions. Next, I will review major guidelines for any cautions that might indirectly reflect impaired absorption. After that, I should consider physiologic or pathologic states that could alter gastrointestinal absorption. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and note any exceptions or special routes that might bypass oral absorption problems.

> Let me first confirm the basic pharmacokinetics, because if absorption is near-complete and rapid, interference would be less likely to matter clinically. Methimazole is readily and almost completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak serum levels achieved within 1 to 2 hours, which argues against routine clinically meaningful malabsorption under ordinary conditions [^111bSxBC] [^115rX3ok].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA label for any explicit absorption cautions or drug–food interactions. I need to check the prescribing information for warnings about taking with food, chelating agents, or pH-related issues. The FDA labeling emphasizes oral administration and divided dosing but does not list food, calcium, iron, bile acid sequestrants, or proton pump inhibitors as causes of reduced absorption, which is notably different from levothyroxine labeling that explicitly warns about absorption interferences and timing with food and interacting agents [^111Ne1J1] [^116LqV2j].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review major guidelines for any indirect signals about absorption problems. The ATA guidance details dosing, monitoring, and safety but does not identify food or co‑medications that impair methimazole absorption, reinforcing the impression that clinically important malabsorption is not a recognized issue in standard practice [^112mXRxo].

> I will now examine whether any pathophysiologic states could plausibly reduce oral bioavailability. Severe gastrointestinal disease with malabsorption, short bowel, or active inflammatory bowel disease could theoretically reduce absorption of orally administered drugs, but these are not documented as specific methimazole issues in the provided sources; when enteral absorption is not feasible, case reports describe compounded intravenous methimazole as a workaround, which indirectly supports the concept that oral absorption is otherwise reliable in typical patients [^115Y3eKc].

> But wait, what if the question is actually about drug interactions that reduce methimazole exposure rather than true absorption interference. I should double-check the labeled drug–drug interactions. The FDA label highlights interactions such as potentiation of warfarin effect and changes in clearance of beta‑blockers, theophylline, and digoxin as the patient becomes euthyroid; these reflect pharmacodynamic and metabolic changes rather than impaired gastrointestinal absorption of methimazole itself [^116LqV2j].

> Let me consider special formulations and routes, because sometimes "absorption" questions arise when oral intake is compromised. There is low‑credibility evidence for rectal administration of methimazole in acute care settings when oral or IV routes are not optimal, and case reports describe IV methimazole for patients unable to take oral or rectal medication; these are exceptions that preserve systemic exposure when oral absorption is bypassed, not evidence that oral absorption is inherently unreliable [^116UD4ZK] [^115Y3eKc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if high‑dose iodine or potassium iodide could impair methimazole absorption, but I should verify that. Potassium iodide has been studied as an adjunct to methimazole to improve biochemical control, not to impair absorption; the Wolff–Chaikoff effect is pharmacologic and intrathyroidal, not an absorption interaction, so I should correct that assumption and not ascribe an absorption interference where none exists [^116do3Xs] [^117Dg2xE].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Based on pharmacokinetics and regulatory labeling, methimazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed orally, and there are no documented food or drug interferences that meaningfully reduce its gastrointestinal absorption in standard use; clinically significant malabsorption is not a recognized issue, though severe GI disease could theoretically impair any oral drug and would prompt consideration of parenteral routes in exceptional circumstances [^111bSxBC] [^115rX3ok] [^115Y3eKc].

---

Methimazole is **rapidly and almost completely absorbed** after oral administration [^115rX3ok], with peak levels at 1–2 hours and an absorption rate near 100% [^115rX3ok]. There are **no clinically significant food or drug interactions** that reduce its absorption, and no specific dietary restrictions are required. However, **gastrointestinal conditions** (e.g. celiac disease, IBD, bariatric surgery) may impair absorption and warrant closer monitoring of thyroid function and dose adjustment as needed.

---

## Pharmacokinetics of methimazole absorption

Methimazole exhibits **rapid and nearly complete absorption** following oral administration [^111bSxBC], with peak serum concentrations achieved within 1–2 hours [^115rX3ok]. The drug is absorbed primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, with minimal first-pass metabolism, contributing to its high oral bioavailability.

---

## Factors influencing methimazole absorption

### Gastrointestinal conditions

Several **gastrointestinal conditions** can impair methimazole absorption, including:

- **Celiac disease**: Malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease can reduce the absorption of orally administered medications, including methimazole.

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can impair absorption due to inflammation and structural abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Bariatric surgery**: Surgical procedures that alter the gastrointestinal anatomy, such as gastric bypass surgery, can affect drug absorption by changing the site and rate of absorption.

---

### Concurrent medications

Currently, there are **no well-documented drug interactions** that significantly impair methimazole absorption. However, medications that alter gastrointestinal motility or pH may theoretically influence absorption, although clinical evidence is limited.

---

### Dietary factors

There are **no specific dietary restrictions** or known dietary factors that significantly interfere with methimazole absorption. Unlike levothyroxine, which requires fasting administration and careful timing relative to meals and other medications, methimazole does not have such stringent dietary requirements [^111Ne1J1].

---

## Clinical implications of impaired absorption

Impaired absorption of methimazole can lead to **suboptimal therapeutic outcomes**, including persistent hyperthyroidism symptoms and delayed achievement of euthyroidism. Clinicians should monitor thyroid function tests closely, particularly in patients with known gastrointestinal conditions or those undergoing gastrointestinal surgeries.

---

## Clinical management strategies

When impaired absorption is suspected, clinicians may consider the following strategies:

- **Dose adjustment**: Increasing the dose of methimazole may compensate for reduced absorption, but careful monitoring is essential to avoid overtreatment and hypothyroidism.

- **Alternative routes of administration**: In rare cases where oral absorption is severely impaired, alternative routes such as rectal administration or intravenous methimazole may be considered [^116UD4ZK] [^115Y3eKc].

- **Monitoring thyroid function tests**: Regular monitoring of free T4, total T3, and TSH levels is crucial to assess therapeutic efficacy and adjust dosing accordingly [^112mXRxo].

## Summary of factors influencing methimazole absorption

| **Factor** | **Effect on absorption** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal conditions (celiac disease, IBD, bariatric surgery) | - Impaired absorption <br/> - Reduced bioavailability | - Suboptimal therapeutic outcomes <br/> - Delayed euthyroidism |
| Concurrent medications | Limited evidence of significant interaction | Minimal clinical impact |
| Dietary factors | No significant interference | No specific dietary restrictions required |

---

Methimazole is **rapidly and almost completely absorbed** after oral administration, with minimal interference from dietary factors or concurrent medications. However, gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and bariatric surgery can impair absorption, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments.

### Different doses of methimazole treatment of children and adolescents with Graves' disease: a clinical study based on 161 cases of outpatients [^116FqQDA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most pediatric endocrinologists recommend MMI as initial treatment in the hope that the patient's Graves' disease will be resolved. The typically used MMI dose is 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg/day. For severe clinical or biochemical hyperthyroidism, doses exceeding 50–100% may be employed. The fundamental principle followed with MMI is to begin with a high dosage, then gradually reduce and maintain it. While the initial dosage of MMI may vary based on the severity of Graves' disease, there is a scarcity of clinical research investigating the effectiveness and potential adverse events associated with these initial dosages concerning disease severity, especially in the context of Chinese children and adolescents. In our clinical practice, we have also observed an increased occurrence of adverse effects in children and adolescents with severe hyperthyroidism who are given high doses of MMI as initial treatment. Therefore, our study selected varying MMI doses for the treatment of young Chinese individuals with Graves' disease, taking into account disease severity. The study aimed to analyze short-term efficacy and associated adverse effects, offering a clinical foundation for the scientific management of Graves' disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Grave's disease [^117FhYvg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the etiology, diagnosis, and clinical presentation of Graves disease and provide an overview of the standard and adjunctive treatments. Specifically, antithyroid drugs, beta-blockers, inorganic iodide, lithium, and radioactive iodine are discussed, focusing on current controversies.

Data Sources

Primary articles were identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-July 2000). Key word searches included beta-blockers, Graves disease, inorganic iodide, lithium, methimazole, and propylthiouracil. Additional articles from these sources and endocrinology textbooks were also identified. We agreed to include articles that would highlight the most relevant points, as well as current areas of controversy.

Data Synthesis

Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The 3 main treatment options for patients with Graves hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Although the antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI) have similar efficacy, there are situations when 1 agent is preferred. MMI has a longer half-life than PTU, allowing once-daily dosing that can improve patient adherence to treatment. PTU has historically been the drug of choice for treating pregnant and breast-feeding women because of its limited transfer into the placenta and breast milk. Adjuvant therapies for Graves disease include beta-blockers, inorganic iodide, and lithium. beta-Blockers are used to decrease the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Inorganic iodide is primarily used to prepare patients for thyroid surgery because of its ability to decrease the vascularity of the thyroid gland. Lithium, which acts in a manner similar to iodine, is not routinely used due to its transient effect and the risk of potentially serious adverse effects. In the US, radioiodine therapy has become the preferred treatment for adults with Graves disease. It is easy to administer, safe, effective, and more affordable than long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs. Hypothyroidism is an inevitable consequence of radioiodine therapy. Radioiodine is contraindicated in pregnant women because it can damage the fetal thyroid gland, resulting in fetal hypothyroidism. Bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy, which was once the only treatment available, is now performed only in special circumstances. In addition to the normal risks associated with surgery, laryngeal nerve damage, hypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism can occur following that procedure.

Conclusions

Despite extensive experience with medical management, controversy prevails regarding choosing among the various drugs for treatment of Graves disease. None of the treatment options, including antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, and surgery, is ideal. Each has risks and benefits, and selection should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Propylthiouracil [^1156iJU9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Propylthiouracil is indicated:

in patients with Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goiter who are intolerant of methimazole and for whom surgery or radioactive iodine therapy is not an appropriate treatment option
to ameliorate symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy in patients who are intolerant of methimazole

### Methimazole [^111bSxBC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Methimazole inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones and thus is effective in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The drug does not inactivate existing thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine that are stored in the thyroid or circulating in the blood nor does it interfere with the effectiveness of thyroid hormones given by mouth or by injection.

Methimazole is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine.

### An alternative for rapid administration of medication and fluids in the emergency setting using a novel device [^116UD4ZK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Routes of administration for medications and fluids in the acute care setting have primarily focused on oral, intravenous, or intraosseous routes, but, in many patients, none of these routes is optimal. A novel device (Macy Catheter; Hospi Corp) that offers an easy route for administration of medications or fluids via rectal mucosal absorption (proctoclysis) has recently become available in the palliative care market; we describe here the first known uses of this device in the emergency setting. Three patients presenting to the hospital with conditions limiting more typical routes of medication or fluid administration were treated with this new device; patients were administered water for hydration, lorazepam for treatment of alcohol withdrawal, ondansetron for nausea, acetaminophen for fever, aspirin for antiplatelet effect, and methimazole for hyperthyroidism. Placement of the device was straightforward, absorption of administered medications (judged by immediacy of effects, where observable) was rapid, and use of the device was well tolerated by patients, suggesting that this device may be an appealing alternative route to medication and fluid administration for a variety of indications in acute and critical care settings.

### Methimazole [^112QYydX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

First Trimester Use of Methimazole and Congenital Malformations

Methimazole crosses the placental membranes and can cause fetal harm when administered in the first trimester of pregnancy. Rare instances of congenital defects, including aplasia cutis, craniofacial malformations (facial dysmorphism; choanal atresia), gastrointestinal malformations (esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula), omphalocele and abnormalities of the omphalomesenteric duct have occurred in infants born to mothers who received methimazole in the first trimester of pregnancy. If methimazole tablets are used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be warned of the potential hazard to the fetus.

Because of the risk for congenital malformations associated with use of methimazole in the first trimester of pregnancy, it may be appropriate to use other agents in pregnant women requiring treatment for hyperthyroidism. If methimazole tablets is used, the lowest possible dose to control the maternal disease should be given.

Agranulocytosis

Agranulocytosis is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction of methimazole therapy. Patients should be instructed to immediately report to their physicians any symptoms suggestive of agranulocytosis, such as fever or sore throat. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia (pancytopenia) may also occur. The drug should be discontinued in the presence of agranulocytosis or aplastic anemia (pancytopenia), and the patient's bone marrow indices should be monitored.

Antithyroid drug dose conversion — when switching between methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU), a dosage ratio of MMI to PTU of 1:20 is recommended; 15 mg of MMI is roughly equivalent to 300 mg of PTU, and because PTU has a considerably shorter half-life, the PTU dose should be split over the day (e.g. MMI 15 mg once daily may be substituted with PTU 100 mg three times a day).

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^1128yt3x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics of two study groups are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, sex distribution, smoking status, goiter size and serum concentrations of fT4, T3, TSH and TRAb and daily MMI dosage at the time of this study entry between those who continued versus stopped MMI treatment. Nonetheless, patients who continued MMI therapy had received MMI for longer duration as compared to those who discontinued MMI (15.6 ± 1.9 vs. 12.8 ± 4.0 years, respectively).

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^114PWMYx]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Management when remission is not achieved after methimazole — Pediatric patients with GD who are not in remission following 1–2 years of methimazole therapy should be considered for treatment with radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy (1/+00). If after stopping MMI after 1 or 2 years remission is not achieved, 131I or surgery should be considered; alternatively, practitioners can continue MMI for extended periods if adverse effects do not occur and the hyperthyroid state is controlled, using this as a bridge to 131I or surgery, and in selected situations low-dose MMI can be continued, although the likelihood of remission is not great.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was sustained euthyroidism during the additional six years of follow-up. Key secondary outcomes were the occurrence of both clinical and subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism during the length of study. Assessment of safety of MMI therapy was performed by observation of adverse events during the treatment.

### The complex web of interferences with thyroid function tests [^114YTtYx]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thyroid disorders are common. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone is frequently measured and is the single best initial biomarker to diagnose thyroid disease. Automated immunoassays used to evaluate thyroid function are susceptible to interferences that can affect test results and therefore clinical decisions. In this comprehensive review, our aim is to discuss common assay and drug interferences leading to abnormal thyroid function tests.

Methods

Authors conducted a literature review of PubMed to include studies on drug related and laboratory assay interferences leading to primary and secondary thyroid dysfunction in addition to interferences with thyroid hormone replacement and thyroid function tests.

Results

Overall, there are several assay interferences as well as drug interferences leading to primary thyroid dysfunction including iodine-containing drugs such as amiodarone, lithium, immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, drug interferences leading to secondary thyroid dysfunction such as glucocorticoids, and drug interferences affecting thyroid hormone absorption, metabolism, and thyroid binding globulin levels. In addition, assay interferences from biotin, heterophile antibodies, macro-thyrotropin or anti-streptavidin antibodies may occur without underlying thyroid dysfunction, leading to abnormal thyroid function tests.

Conclusion

For appropriate patient management, it is imperative to identify assay interferences when discrepancies between clinical presentation and thyroid function test results are noted.

### Methimazole [^112o3Jv9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dosage of methimazole PO for treatment of hyperthyroidism in adults with Graves' disease (moderate) is:

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112LJbJr]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Methimazole (MMI) dosing for Graves' disease — At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of 10–30 mg daily are used to restore euthyroidism, and the dose can then be titrated down to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). The task force suggests the following as a rough guide to initial MMI daily dosing: 5–10 mg if free T4 is 1–1.5 times the upper limit of normal; 10–20 mg for free T4 1.5–2 times the upper limit of normal; and 30–40 mg for free T4 2–3 times the upper limit of normal; serum T3 levels are important to monitor initially because some patients normalize their free T4 levels with MMI but have persistently elevated serum T3, and adverse drug reactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses.

Prescriptions of Methimazole

Data on methimazole consumption (carbimazole is not permitted in Italy) were retrieved from the National Observatory on the Use of Medicines Database. This database, which is coordinated by the Italian Medicines Agency, collects data on medications dispensed by community pharmacies and reimbursed by the Italian National Health Care Service, as well as data provided directly from health facilities (excluding in-hospital). Information on each drug package was tracked via unique identifier codes based on the 5 th -level Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. According to this classification, all methimazole prescriptions (ATC H03BB02 and H03BB52 in association with dibromotyrosine) dispensed during the study period were identified.

Drug consumption can be expressed in cost, number of units, number of prescriptions, or the physical quantity of drugs. However, these variables can vary between regions and countries over time, limiting comparisons. To tackle this issue, a technical unit of measurement referred to as daily defined dose (DDD) was developed for use in drug utilization studies. It is defined as the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. DDDs are only assigned for medicines given an ATC code and are allocated to drugs by the WHO Collaborating Centre in Oslo, working in close association with the WHO International Working Group on Drug Statistics Methodology.

The DDD is a unit of measurement and does not necessarily correspond to the recommended or prescribed daily dose. Therapeutic doses for individual patients and patient groups will often differ from the DDD because they are based on individual characteristics such as age, weight, ethnic differences, type and severity of disease, and pharmacokinetic considerations. Therefore, drug utilization data presented in DDDs give a rough estimate of consumption and not an exact picture of actual use. DDDs provide a fixed unit of measurement independent of price, currencies, package size, and route of administration. By applying DDD, it is possible to examine changes in drug utilization over time, make international comparisons, and follow the changes in the use of a class of drugs.

In this study, the mean number of DDDs/1000 inhabitants per day was calculated by dividing the total number of DDDs of methimazole dispensed during the study period in Italy and the total number of adult inhabitants (individuals registered by the Italian National Institute of Statistics in the same period). The result was then divided by 365 and reported per thousand inhabitants.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^1136zUy4]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Antithyroid drug dosing regimens for methimazole (MMI), carbimazole, and propylthiouracil (PTU): MMI and carbimazole, which is rapidly converted to MMI in the serum (10 mg of carbimazole is metabolized to approximately 6 mg of MMI), work in a virtually identical fashion. At the start of MMI therapy, higher doses are advised (10–20 mg daily) to restore euthyroidism, followed by titration to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). PTU is usually administered two or three times daily, starting with 50–150 mg three times daily, with reduction to a maintenance PTU dose of 50 mg two or three times daily as thyroid function normalizes. Higher-dose "block and replace" combinations with l-thyroxine are not generally recommended, as they have been shown to result in a higher rate of ATD side effects.

### Effect of Graves' disease and methimazole on warfarin anticoagulation [^112HBDoc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of Graves' disease treated with methimazole and examine the influence of thyroid hormone alteration on warfarin anticoagulation.

Case Summary

A 54-year-old man presented to the emergency department with palpitations, fatigue, weight loss, and anxiety attacks. He was taking no medications at that time. An electrocardiogram showed new onset atrial fibrillation. His thyroid profile was consistent with hyperthyroidism. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and started on methimazole 30 mg/day, metoprolol, enoxaparin, and warfarin 5 mg/day. Postdischarge doses of warfarin and methimazole were adjusted over the next several months based on thyroid panel results indicative of hypothyroidism. Postdischarge changes in methimazole dose caused alterations in thyroid function and intensity of anticoagulation as measured by international normalized ratio.

Discussion

Interactions between warfarin and drugs that alter thyroid hormone concentrations have been reported; however, the extent and significance of the interaction between methimazole and warfarin have been inadequately described. Thyroid hormone concentrations influence the metabolic rates of proteins and, thus, can alter the amount of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which in turn can alter the extent of inhibition by warfarin. This may lead to changes in the intensity of anticoagulation and thereby increase the risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events.

Conclusions

Changes in thyroid hormone concentrations have the potential to significantly alter the extent of warfarin-induced anticoagulation. Clinicians must be aware of the need for close anticoagulation monitoring and dosage adjustment in patients receiving concomitant warfarin and methimazole.

### Desensitization to methimazole [^11355B2J]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thionamides (methimazole and propylthiouracil) have been associated with common side effects, such as rash and pruritus, and rare but serious adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity. Methimazole is usually the preferred thionamide for the treatment of hyperthyroidism if the patient is not planning to conceive or not in the first trimester of pregnancy, given the less frequent dosing and lower risk of hepatotoxicity. In patients who experience rash or itching when treated with methimazole, switching them to propylthiouracil is one treatment option. Here we report our experience regarding desensitization to methimazole to allow continued treatment with methimazole as an alternative management option.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients at a single institution who had side effects to methimazole and who were desensitized to methimazole under the supervision of an allergist. A total of 7 patients were included who experienced side effects to methimazole that did not include agranulocytosis or hepatotoxicity.

Results

All 7 patients were able to take methimazole for treatment of their hyperthyroidism, either for continued medical therapy or as a bridge to definitive therapy, with either surgery or radioactive iodine treatment.

Conclusion

Under the supervision of an allergist, desensitization to methimazole is an option for treating patients who experience side effects to methimazole (excluding agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity).

Maternal antithyroid drugs during lactation — drug transfer, infant thyroid effects, and dose limits: In women given 200 mg propylthiouracil (PTU), only 0.007%–0.077% of the ingested dose was detected in milk, and a lactating mother consuming PTU 200 mg three times daily would transmit only 149 μg (0.149 mg) of PTU daily to her infant; separate studies confirm normal thyroid function in breastfed infants of mothers consuming PTU. For methimazole (MMI)/CM, approximately 0.1%–0.2% of an orally administered dose is excreted into breast milk, and a single 40 mg dose of MMI could result in delivery of 70 μg (0.07 mg) to the breastfeeding infant; even when women were overtreated and had TSH 19–102 mU/L, neonatal thyroid function was nonetheless confirmed in breastfeeding infants. Together, these data have led experts to confirm the safety of low to moderate doses of both PTU and MMI/CM in breastfeeding infants, and given the small studied population, maximal daily doses of 20 mg MMI or 450 mg PTU are advised.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently recommended that PTU be reserved for patients who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, or who are allergic to or intolerant to MMI. In general, a potency ratio of MMI to PTU of at least 20–30:1 is recommended when changing from one drug to another, although there are no studies that have examined this potency ratio directly; for example, 300 mg of PTU would be roughly equivalent to 10 to 15 mg of MMI, and if PTU is continued during the second and third trimesters hepatic enzymes should be measured every 4 weeks, at the same time that thyroid function is assessed, although there are no prospective data that show that this monitoring is effective in preventing fulminant PTU-related hepatotoxicity.

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^111VuVb1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to drug interactions, food might also impair LT4 absorption via direct complexation. Although the rule of "30 to 60 minutes before breakfast on an empty stomach" is widely recommended, it is inconvenient to follow and may cause poor compliance. The administration time remains debatable and clinical studies are emerging. Dosing before dinner slightly reduces the therapeutic efficacy of LT4, since 2 to 4 hours are usually required for the stomach to empty. Dosing at bedtime is a promising option. In 2010, a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial recruiting 90 patients examined the efficacy of taking LT4 at bedtime. Reduced TSH levels and elevated total T3 and total T4 (TT4) levels were observed in patients taking LT4 at bedtime, with no significant difference in quality of life or preference. In addition, it is estimated that fasting for at least 3 hours is required for bedtime administration. More recently, a meta-analysis including 10 prospective and randomized controlled studies revealed no significant difference in TSH and FT3 between patients who took LT4 before breakfast and at bedtime. Surprisingly, the FT4 level favored bedtime administration (P = 0.03). Eating habits and time intervals between dinner and bedtime, which may vary in different countries and cultures, affect the absorption of LT4 ingested at bedtime. Clinicians should take these factors into consideration before informing patients about the possibility of taking LT4 at bedtime.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^111Wob5X]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term antithyroid drug therapy has become one of the options for treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. The aim of this study was to compare thyroid status in those who discontinued methimazole (MMI) treatment after 12.8 years with those who continued MMI as long as 24 years.

Methods

Fifty nine patients with Graves' disease on long-term MMI for 14.2 ± 2.9 years were recruited; 32 patients (54%) decided to discontinue MMI and 27 (46%) preferred additional years of MMI treatment. All patients were followed for a mean of 6 additional years.

Results

Of 27 patients who continued MMI up to 24 years, suppressed serum thyrotropin (TSH) was not observed in any patient after the seventh year of treatment. Serum free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, TSH and TSH receptor antibody concentrations remained normal up to the length of the study. Mean daily dose of MMI to maintain TSH in the reference range decreased gradually and reached to 2.8 ± 1.7 mg by 24 years of MMI treatment. No adverse reaction related to MMI occured during additional years of therapy. In 32 patients who discontinued MMI, hyperthyroidism relapsed in 6 patients (19%), one left follow-up and 25 (78%) remained euthyroid during the study.

Conclusions

Long-term low dose MMI treatment may be a lifelong effective and safe therapeutic modality in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism for prevention of relapse, if studies from other centers confirm findings of this research.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^112RFSzT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

The beneficial effect of LT-ATD therapy has been documented in patients with Graves' orbitopathy and those with relapse of hyperthyroidism following conventional 12–18 months ATD treatment. It has also been recommended in patients with high serum TRAb concentration at the end of 18 months course of ATD therapy. Our experience in the present study shows that even in those with continuous positive TRAb, LT-MMI treatment causes gradual decrease of serum TRAb concentrations and remission of hyperthyroidism. Previous studies have also shown more stable euthyroidism and comparable or better cost-benefit when compared to RAI treatment. Considering recent findings that effective control of hyperthyroidism improves cardiovascular outcomes, a stable euthyroid state during continuous MMI treatment highlights a potential advantage of this mode of therapy.

Strengths of this study are the longest follow-up of patients with continuous MMI therapy and demonstration of the point of normalization of TSH in all treated patients. In addition, findings emphasize the fact that many patients require < 2.5 mg MMI daily to remain euthyroid and there is paucity of adverse events on low dose LT-MMI treatment. Following limitations are noteworthy; first, the study arm was selected by each patient choice; therefore, study enrollment was not randomized and possibilities of biases may exist which can affect the results. Second, with regards to the proposed relationships between iodine intake and efficacy of ATDs, although still unresolved and contradictory, our findings in an iodine-sufficient population may not be generalizable to other regions. Third, those who continued very LT-MMI treatment were already 2.8 years more on MMI than patients who discontinued medication.

Drug Interactions

Anticoagulants (oral): Due to the potential inhibition of vitamin K activity by propylthiouracil, the activity of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) may be increased; additional monitoring of PT/INR should be considered, especially before surgical procedures.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: Hyperthyroidism may cause an increased clearance of beta blockers with a high extraction ratio. A reduced dose of beta-adrenergic blockers may be needed when a hyperthyroid patient becomes euthyroid.

Digitalis glycosides: Serum digitalis levels may be increased when hyperthyroid patients on a stable digitalis glycoside regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dose of digitalis glycosides may be needed.

Theophylline: Theophylline clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable theophylline regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dose of theophylline may be needed.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Laboratory animals treated with propylthiouracil for > 1 year have demonstrated thyroid hyperplasia and carcinoma formation. Such animal findings are seen with continuous suppression of thyroid function by sufficient doses of a variety of antithyroid agents, as well as in dietary iodine deficiency, subtotal thyroidectomy, and implantation of autonomous thyrotropic hormone-secreting pituitary tumors. Pituitary adenomas have also been described.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category D.

See WARNINGS.

In pregnant women with untreated or inadequately treated Graves' disease, there is an increased risk of adverse events of maternal heart failure, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth and fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism.

If propylthiouracil is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking propylthiouracil, the patient should be warned of the rare potential hazard to the mother and fetus of liver damage.

Because propylthiouracil crosses placental membranes and can induce goiter and cretinism in the developing fetus, it is important that a sufficient, but not excessive, dose be given during pregnancy. In many pregnant women, the thyroid dysfunction diminishes as the pregnancy proceeds; consequently a reduction of dosage may be possible. In some instances, antithyroid therapy can be discontinued several weeks or months prior to delivery.

Since methimazole may be associated with the rare development of fetal abnormalities propylthiouracil may be the preferred agent during the first trimester of pregnancy. Given the potential for maternal hepatotoxicity from propylthiouracil, it may be preferable to switch from propylthiouracil to methimazole for the second and third trimesters during pregnancy.

### Management of Grave's thyroidal and extrathyroidal disease: an update [^115rX3ok]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Antithyroid Drugs

The thionamide antithyroid drugs (ATDs) have been the most common treatment of GD in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, in contrast to the USA where RAI has been more prevalent. More recently, however, ATDs have been used in nearly 60% of GD patients in the USA versus 35% only for RAI. This is mainly because RAI is associated with both sustained increases in TSH-R-Ab titers after RAI and a definite risk for a de novo GO and/or exacerbation of the clinical activity and severity of the orbital disease.

The thiourea derivatives (ATDs) inhibit iodine organification, a process catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. ATDs negatively impact the activity and numbers of intrathyroidal T cells, the aberrant thyrocyte expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and subsequent oxidative damage.

Three compounds are available with methimazole (MMI) as the classical and most widely distributed ATD. In comparison, carbimazole (CBM) is an inactive drug and much less available worldwide. CBM is rapidly metabolized in the blood to MMI with an average 2-fold weaker potency than MMI. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the least potent compound (10-fold weaker than MMI). However PTU additionally inhibits the thyroxine (T4) deiodination to 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. MMI has the longest half-life, an acceptable and low side-effect profile and is, therefore, regarded as the standard ATD with the highest efficacy. Absorption of MMI following oral administration approximates 100% leading to peak serum levels within 1 to 2 hours. The intrathyroidal concentration of MMI is markedly higher than in the plasma with stable intrathyroidal levels for approximately 22 hours postresorption. Initial daily dosing of MMI depends on the severity of hyperthyroidism and is based on the elevation in free thyroid hormone levels; using 20 and 30 mg if fT4 is 2- and 3-fold increased, respectively. The inhibition of the T4 deiodination and the lower placental transfer and less severe PTU-caused embryopathy explain why PTU is the first-line therapy of both thyroid storm in GD as well as in the first 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy.

### Methimazole [^116LqV2j]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Genral

Patients who receive methimazole should be under close surveillance and should be cautioned to report immediately any evidence of illness, particularly sore throat, skin eruptions, fever, headache, or general malaise. In such cases, white-blood-cell and differential counts should be obtained to determine whether agranulocytosis has developed. Particular care should be exercised with patients who are receiving additional drugs known to cause agranulocytosis.

Information for Patients

Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant while taking an antithyroid drug, they should contact their physician immediately about their therapy.

Inform patients that cases of vasculitis resulting in severe complications have occurred with methimazole. Inform patients to promptly report symptoms that may be associated with vasculitis including new rash, hematuria or decreased urine output, dyspnea or hemoptysis (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Laboratory Tests

Because methimazole may cause hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding, prothrombin time should be monitored during therapy with the drug, especially before surgical procedures.

Thyroid function tests should be monitored periodically during therapy. Once clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism has resolved, the finding of a rising serum TSH indicates that a lower maintenance dose of methimazole should be employed.

Drug Interactions

Anticoagulants (oral) - Due to potential inhibition of vitamin K activity by methimazole, the activity of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) may be increased; additional monitoring of PT/INR should be considered, especially before surgical procedures.

β-adrenergic blocking agents - Hyperthyroidism may cause an increased clearance of beta blockers with a high extraction ratio. A dose reduction of beta-adrenergic blockers may be needed when a hyperthyroid patient becomes euthyroid.

Digitalis glycosides - Serum digitalis levels may be increased when hyperthyroid patients on a stable digitalis glycoside regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dosage of digitalis glycosides may be needed.

Theophylline - Theophylline clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable theophylline regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dose of theophylline may be needed.

### Intravenous methimazole in the treatment of refractory hyperthyroidism [^115Y3eKc]. Thyroid (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Management of a hyperthyroid patient unable to take oral or rectal medication is a difficult clinical problem. The need for an alternative parenteral route of antithyroid medication administration in thyrotoxic patients occurs in certain rare cases, such as emergent gastrointestinal surgery, bowel ileus or obstruction, or severe vomiting and diarrhea. We report a simple and successful protocol for the preparation and use of intravenous methimazole (MMI) for treatment of hyperthyroidism in patients intolerant of orally and rectally administered thionamides.

Methods

Five hundred milligrams of methimazole USP powder was reconstituted with pH-neutral 0.9% sodium chloride solution to a final volume of 50 mL using aseptic technique, then filtered through a 0.22-microm filter. MMI injection was administered as a slow intravenous push over 2 minutes and followed by a saline flush.

Cases

A 76-year-old man, intolerant of oral and rectal medications because of an ileus and intractable diarrhea, who developed worsening thyrotoxicosis after an emergent spinal cord decompression, and a 42-year-old man with chronic liver disease and hyperthyroidism, requiring emergent exploratory laparotomy and maintenance of complete bowel rest because of persistent gastrointestinal bleeding were rendered euthyroid using intravenous MMI.

Conclusion

Two cases of hyperthyroidism successfully treated with a preparation of intravenous MMI are described.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^116i2Ryw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrates continuous decline in serum fT4 and T3 concentrations and rise in serum TSH during 24 years of MMI treatment accompanied by continuous normalization of serum TRAb and gradual decrease in daily doses of MMI to maintain euthyroid state. We have not found any episode of exacerbation of hyperthyroidism during 24 years of follow-up in patients treated with continuous LT-MMI treatment. In addition, no adverse events occurred after the first year up to 24 years of continuous MMI treatment; findings in agreement with a recent systematic review on safety of long-term ATD treatment.

Several studies have reported that in patients who experience relapse of hyperthyroidism after 12–18 months of ATD therapy, remission may be attained by additional 5 to 10 years of treatment Therefore, some patients may prefer continuous lifelong MMI therapy for management of Graves' hyperthyroidism. In the present study, majority of patients who discontinued treatment after mean 12.8 years of continuous MMI stayed euthyroid during 6 years of follow-up; only 19% experienced relapse of hyperthyroidism. Results are similar to other studies reporting increased remission rates in Graves' hyperthyroidism after long-term MMI therapy, compared to the conventional 12–18 month ATD therapy. A proposed justification for the observed results of LT-MMI therapy is related to immunomodulatory properties of MMI, an effect which is not yet fully understood.

The 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend RAI or thyroidectomy as the therapeutic choices in the setting of hyperthyroidism after the conventional 12–18 months of ATD therapy; continuous low dose MMI has been suggested in patients with persistently high TRAb concentrations. Safety of LT-ATD treatment has been shown in clinical studies. Likewise, based on the findings of a recently published trial, LT-ATD treatment of ≥ 5 years induces cure of disease in 86% of patients with GD after ATD discontinuation. In a large cohort of GD patients treated by ATD from Japan, Okamura, et al. showed that serum TRAb level may become normal following the conventional ATD treatment but it will fluctuate and remission of GD occurs after the median 6.2 years of ATD therapy. These findings point to the importance of LT-ATD treatment to ensure higher probability of remission.

### Antithyroid drugs inhibit thyroid hormone receptor-mediated transcription [^1158d2Ct]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are widely used as antithyroid drugs (ATDs) for the treatment of Graves' disease. Both MMI and PTU reduce thyroid hormone levels by several mechanisms, including inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. In addition, PTU decreases 5'-deiodination of T(4) in peripheral tissues. ATDs may also interfere with T(3) binding to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). However, the effect of ATDs on the transcriptional activities of T(3) mediated by TRs has not been studied.

Objective

The present study was undertaken to determine whether ATDs have an effect on the gene transcription regulated by T(3) and TRs in vitro.

Methods

Transient gene expression experiments and GH secretion assays were performed. To elucidate possible mechanisms of the antagonistic action of ATDs, the interaction between TR and nuclear cofactors was examined.

Results

In the transient gene expression experiments, both MMI and PTU significantly suppressed transcriptional activities mediated by the TR and T(3) in a dose-dependent manner. In mammalian two-hybrid assays, both drugs recruited one of the nuclear corepressors, nuclear receptor corepressor, to the TR in the absence of T(3). In addition, PTU dissociated nuclear coactivators, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 and glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein-1, from the TR in the presence of T(3). Finally, MMI decreased the GH release that was stimulated by T(3).

Conclusions

ATDs inhibit T(3) action by recruitment of transcriptional corepressors and/or dissociation of coactivators. This is the first report to show that ATDs can modulate T(3) action at the transcriptional level.

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^116RTUzM]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to drugs that alter the absorption of LT4, some drugs affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of LT4 after absorption. The induction of cytochrome P450 enzyme activity in the liver by statins or protease inhibitors can accelerate the catabolism of LT4, and hence decrease serum T4 levels. Moreover, increased inactivation of LT4 via the monodeiodinase induced by mifepristone, rifampicin, and carbamazepine can reduce the T 1/2 of LT4. Similarly, phenytoin and imatinib inactivate LT4 via nondeiodinative hepatic metabolism and decrease the ratio of T3 to T4. TBG and albumin are other targets for drug interactions. Estrogen can increase TBG and albumin concentrations and decrease FT4 levels, whereas androgen has the opposite effects. Interestingly, metformin suppresses TSH levels. The potential mechanism may be enhancing the inhibitory modulatory effect of THs on central TSH secretion and changing the affinity and/or the number of TH receptors.

In hypothyroid patients who are suspected of having drug interactions, the diagnosis of malabsorption entails a comprehensive medical history taking. Any diet change or drug used before the increase in TSH levels should be thoroughly investigated. Clinicians should also be alert for frequently prescribed agents interfering with LT4, such as calcium and iron supplements, PPIs, statins, and hypoglycemics. Explorative drug withdrawal tests (tests for thyroid function before and after the withdrawal of a suspected interfering drug) are both diagnostic and therapeutic. Biological hypothyroidism is easily corrected a few days after withdrawal of drugs reducing intestinal absorption, while a longer time (weeks to months) is needed for drugs affecting in vivo metabolism. After the identification of the interfering drug, a dosing separation of 2 to 8 hours is generally recommended to avoid direct complexation. Besides, patients can switch to another drug of the same class. Ranitidine, for instance, had no effect on T3, T4, and TSH levels, whereas cimetidine reduced the AUC of LT4 by more than 20% compared with the placebo. In addition, many cases of drug or food interference can be concealed by an increased daily dose of LT4. Furthermore, novel LT4 preparations are designed to reduce the high TSH levels induced by malabsorption due to calcium and iron supplements, PPIs, coffee, and breakfast. Liquid formulations are spared from gastric dissolution and are mixed more evenly than solid formulations. As a last resort, the discontinuation of the interfering medication is recommended for patients with severe malabsorption or those who would tolerate drug withdrawal.

### Comparison of efficacy and adverse effects between methimazole 15 mg + inorganic iodine 38 mg / day and methimazole 30 mg / day as initial therapy for Graves' disease patients with moderate to severe hyperthyroidism [^117Umq6K]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Methimazole (MMI) is usually used at an initial dose of 30mg/day for severe Graves' disease (GD) hyperthyroidism, but adverse effects are more frequent at this dose than at MMI 15mg/day.

Objectives

We designed a regimen to address the lack of a primary therapeutic effect of the MMI 15mg/day by combining it with inorganic iodine at 38.2mg/day. Our aim was to compare the two regimens (MMI 15mg+inorganic iodine at 38.2mg/day (M15+I) vs. MMI 30mg/day (M30)) in terms of therapeutic effect, adverse effects, and remission rate.

Design and Patients

In a prospective study, 310 patients with untreated GD (serum free thyroxine (fT4) ≥ 5ng/dL) were assigned to one of the two regimens. Potassium iodide was discontinued in the M15+I group as soon as the serum fT4 level was within the reference range (0.8–1.6ng/dL).

Results

Percentages of patients achieving an fT4 level within reference range in ≤ 30, ≤ 60, or 90 days on the study treatment regimens were 45.3%, 73.9%, and 82.0% respectively for the M15+I group, and 24.8%, 63.1%, and 75.2% respectively for the M30 group. Hence, the proportions of patients achieving this goal in ≤ 30 or ≤ 60 days were significantly larger in the M15+I group. Adverse effects that required discontinuation of MMI were more frequent in the M30-treated than in the M15+I-treated group (14.8% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.0387). The remission rates in the M15+I and M30 groups were 19.9% and 14.8%-higher in the former, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusion

The results of this study raise the possibility that M15+I is superior to M30 as a primary treatment for moderate to severe hyperthyroidism caused by GD.

Management of serious allergic reactions to methimazole in children — If children develop serious allergic reactions to MMI, radioactive iodine or surgery should be considered because the risks of PTU are viewed to be greater than the risks of radioactive iodine or surgery, and PTU may be considered for short-term therapy in this setting to control hyperthyroidism in preparation for surgery.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^114BhLUP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, long-term low dose MMI treatment may be prescribed effectively, even throughout the patients' life for those with Graves' hyperthyroidism who do not desire ablation treatment. Low cost, safe and effective drugs are prescribed as lifelong therapy for some specific diseases, such as epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease and hypothyroidism and MMI may be added to the list of lifelong drugs for control of Graves' hyperthyroidism. During long-term MMI therapy in women of reproductive age, special attention should be made to discontinue MMI or change to propylthiouracil in those planning for pregnancy. It is noteworthy that final decision to select mode of treatment in GD is according to physicians and patients decisions and some may prefer definitive therapy of hyperthyroidism by ablation over long-term treatment. In addition, the findings of the present article are from a single-center study by investigators with expertise in low dose MMI therapy. Further very long-term ATD treatment studies from other clinical centers with more sophisticated designs in order to minimize biases will shed more light on the efficacy of this mode of therapy in GD and perhaps other causes of hyperthyroidism.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis — initial combined therapy considerations and methimazole (MMI) dosing: Individuals with moderate thyrotoxicosis and compromised cardiac status should be considered for initial combined therapy rather than sequential empiric therapy; some centers recommend starting combined therapy with ATDs and corticosteroids at the time of initial AIT diagnosis, and between 16% and 25% of surveyed thyroidologists prefer combination ATD and corticosteroid therapy for apparent type 2 AIT. Technical remarks specify a suggested starting dose of MMI of 40 mg once daily until euthyroid (generally 3–6 months), and if high doses of MMI continue to be required, splitting the dose may be more effective.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

In a 2 year study, rats were given methimazole at doses of 0.5, 3, and 18 mg/kg/day. These doses were 0.3, 2, and 12 times the 15 mg/day maximum human maintenance dose (when calculated on the basis of surface area). Thyroid hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma developed in rats at the two higher doses. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear.

Pregnancy

(See WARNINGS)

If methimazole is used during the first trimester of pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be warned of the potential hazard to the fetus.

In pregnant women with untreated or inadequately treated Graves' disease, there is an increased risk of adverse events of maternal heart failure, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth and fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism.

Because methimazole crosses placental membranes and can induce goiter and cretinism in the developing fetus, hyperthyroidism should be closely monitored in pregnant women and treatment adjusted such that a sufficient, but not excessive, dose be given during pregnancy. In many pregnant women, the thyroid dysfunction diminishes as the pregnancy proceeds; consequently, a reduction of dosage may be possible. In some instances, anti-thyroid therapy can be discontinued several weeks or months before delivery.

Due to the rare occurrence of congenital malformations associated with methimazole use, it may be appropriate to use an alternative anti-thyroid medication in pregnant women requiring treatment for hyperthyroidism, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy during organogenesis.

Given the potential maternal adverse effects of propylthiouracil (e.g., hepatotoxicity), it may be preferable to switch from propylthiouracil to methimazole for the second and third trimesters.

Nursing Mothers

Methimazole is present in breast milk. However, several studies found no effect on clinical status in nursing infants of mothers taking methimazole. A long-term study of 139 thyrotoxic lactating mothers and their infants failed to demonstrate toxicity in infants who are nursed by mothers receiving treatment with methimazole. Monitor thyroid function at frequent (weekly or biweekly) intervals.

Pediatric Use

Because of postmarketing reports of severe liver injury in pediatric patients treated with propylthiouracil, methimazole is the preferred choice when an antithyroid drug is required for a pediatric patient.

ATDs — Thionamides

Methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the only 2 ATDs available in the United States. Outside the United States, carbimazole, which rapidly metabolizes to MMI, is also available. Thionamides inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO)–mediated iodination of thyroglobulin in the thyroid gland and block the synthesis of T4 and T3. PTU also blocks peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Some data suggest that ATD can affect thyroid autoimmunity given the decline in thyroid-stimulating antibody titer with ATD use and possible remission of GD on medical therapy alone. The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of ATD is described in Figure 1.

In nonpregnant patients, MMI is the drug of choice. MMI is preferred over PTU because of its better efficacy, safety, and longer duration of action allowing for once-a-day dosing regimen. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends starting MMI at 10 to 30 mg daily to restore euthyroidism. Initial MMI dosing depends on the severity of hyperthyroidismand the degree of FT4 elevation. If FT4 level is 1 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, initial MMI dose of 5 to 10 mg daily is given; if level is 1.5 to 2 times the upper limit of normal, initial MMI dose of 10 to 20 mg daily is given; and if levels are 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal, initial MMI dose of 30 to 40 mg daily is given. Split dosing of MMI may be more effective than a single daily dose when more rapid achievement of euthyroidism is needed. When requiring > 30 mg/d, split dosing can help reduce gastrointestinal side effects. The equivalent PTU to MMI doses can be calculated using an average ratio of 15–20 to 1.

### Control of Graves' hyperthyroidism with very long-term methimazole treatment: a clinical trial [^116rDFk9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term antithyroid drug therapy has become one of the options for treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. The aim of this study was to compare thyroid status in those who discontinued methimazole (MMI) treatment after 12.8years with those who continued MMI as long as 24years.

Methods

Fifty nine patients with Graves' disease on long-term MMI for 14.2 ± 2.9years were recruited; 32 patients (54%) decided to discontinue MMI and 27 (46%) preferred additional years of MMI treatment. All patients were followed for a mean of 6 additional years.

Results

Of 27 patients who continued MMI up to 24years, suppressed serum thyrotropin (TSH) was not observed in any patient after the seventh year of treatment. Serum free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, TSH and TSH receptor antibody concentrations remained normal up to the length of the study. Mean daily dose of MMI to maintain TSH in the reference range decreased gradually and reached to 2.8 ± 1.7mg by 24years of MMI treatment. No adverse reaction related to MMI occured during additional years of therapy. In 32 patients who discontinued MMI, hyperthyroidism relapsed in 6 patients (19%), one left follow-up and 25 (78%) remained euthyroid during the study.

Conclusions

Long-term low dose MMI treatment may be a lifelong effective and safe therapeutic modality in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism for prevention of relapse, if studies from other centers confirm findings of this research.

### Continuous methimazole therapy and its effect on the cure rate of hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine: an evaluation by a randomized trial [^114Mbbme]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Background

A randomized clinical trial was performed to clarify whether continuous use of methimazole (MTZ) during radioiodine ((131)I) therapy influences the final outcome of this therapy.

Design

Consecutive patients with Graves' disease (n = 30) or a toxic nodular goiter (n = 45) were rendered euthyroid by MTZ and randomized to stop MTZ 8 d before (131)I (-MTZ; n = 36) or to continue MTZ until 4 wk after (131)I (+MTZ; n = 39). Calculation of the (131)I activity included an assessment of the (131)I half-life and the thyroid volume.

Results

The 24-h thyroid (131)I uptake was lower in the +MTZ group than in the -MTZ group (44.8 ± 15.6% vs. 62.1 ± 9.9%, respectively; P < 0.001). At 3 wk after therapy, no significant change in serum free T(4) index was observed in the +MTZ group (109 ± 106 vs. 83 ± 28 nmol/liter at baseline; P = 0.26), contrasting an increase in the -MTZ group (180 ± 110 vs. 82 ± 26 nmol/liter; P < 0.001). The number of cured patients was 17 (44%) and 22 (61%) in the +MTZ and -MTZ groups, respectively (P = 0.17). Cured patients tended to have a lower 24-h thyroid (131)I uptake (50.1 ± 13.8% vs. 56.4 ± 17.1%; P = 0.09). By adjusting for a possible interfactorial relationship through a regression analysis (variables: randomization, 24- and 96-h thyroid (131)I uptake, type and duration of disease, age, gender, presence of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyroid volume, dose of MTZ), only the continuous use of MTZ correlated with treatment failure (P = 0.006), whereas a low 24-h thyroid (131)I uptake predicted a better outcome (P = 0.006).

Conclusion

Continuous use of MTZ hinders an excessive increase of the thyroid hormones during (131)I therapy of hyperthyroid diseases. However, such a strategy seems to reduce the final cure rate, although this adverse effect paradoxically is attenuated by the concomitant reduction of the thyroid (131)I uptake.

### Propylthiouracil [^117LAdzo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Propylthiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones and thus is effective in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The drug does not inactivate existing thyroxine and triiodothyronine that are stored in the thyroid or circulating in the blood, nor does it interfere with the effectiveness of thyroid hormones given by mouth or by injection. Propylthiouracil inhibits the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in peripheral tissues and may therefore be an effective treatment for thyroid storm.

Propylthiouracil is readily absorbed and is extensively metabolized. Approximately 35% of the drug is excreted in the urine, in intact and conjugated forms, within 24 hours.

Mean dose of MMI was 9.8 ± 1.0 mg daily after three months of therapy and decreased to 5.4 ± 1.6 mg per day by the end of the first year of MMI treatment. Daily doses of MMI to maintain euthyroidism were gradually lowered to ≤ 5 mg by 10 years after the start of study in all patients. Mean daily dose of MMI decreased to 2.8 ± 1.7 mg daily after 24 years of LT-MMI treatment (Fig. 2); 5 of 11 patients required ≤ 2.5 mg daily MMI to remain euthyroid. None of the subjects showed recurrence on therapy. Six patients developed minor skin reactions in the first few months of therapy; adverse reactions such as agranulocytosis and liver dysfunction were not observed. Thereafter, no adverse reactions related to MMI occurred during 24 years of follow-up.

### Different doses of methimazole treatment of children and adolescents with Graves' disease: a clinical study based on 161 cases of outpatients [^114pXTCF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Graves' disease (GD) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents, which can occur at any stage of childhood. The incidence of GD in children and adolescents appears to be increasing worldwide, ranging from 1.5 to 6.5 cases per 100 000 person-year. There are currently three options for treating GD: antithyroid drugs (ATDs), surgery and radioactive iodine.

The optimal treatment of GD in children and adolescents remains controversial. More clinical studies are needed to compare the frequency of failures and the short- and long-term side effects of various treatments. At present, ATD is still the first choice for children and adolescents with GD, although many of them eventually experience a relapse of GD. Meanwhile, the definitive treatment (surgery or radiation) often results in permanent hypothyroidism, requiring lifelong replacement of levothyroxine. On the surface, the situation looks rather bleak. For clinicians, how to scientifically manage GD adolescents and counsel them about the disease course to obtain more significant benefits in the treatment process is an urgent clinical problem.

ATD is usually the first-line therapy for most young GD people. How to control hyperthyroidism effectively and reduce adverse reactions has always been the focus of clinical medical research. To date, the correlation between the initial dose of methimazole (MMI) and the clinical course of GD remains controversial. In particular, there are few clinical studies on MMI treating Chinese youth with GD. Therefore, in this study, different doses of MMI were selected for the treatment of young Chinese people with GD according to the severity of the disease. The short-term efficacy and related adverse effects were analyzed to provide a clinical basis for the scientific management of GD.

### Carbimazole-related gastroschisis [^113nxCHV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of gastroschisis in a newborn secondary to carbimazole exposure in utero.

Case Summary

A 25-year-old white woman was treated for Graves disease with carbimazole throughout pregnancy. A boy was born prematurely by vaginal delivery, with a gastroschisis without associated malformative syndrome. Death occurred in the 25th hour of life after surgical repair.

Discussion

Carbimazole is completely metabolized to methimazole after absorption. Carbimazole or methimazole intake during pregnancy has been associated with an increased incidence of scalp aplasia. Abdominal wall defects secondary to carbimazole or methimazole exposure in utero seem to be a rare occurrence. However, other cases of abdominal wall defects have been reported in 4 newborns, 2 of them associated with scalp aplasia. An objective causality assessment revealed that the relationship between the gastroschisis and the exposure to carbimazole in utero was possible.

Conclusions

It is important to emphasize the possible risk of abdominal wall defects in newborns to pregnant women taking carbimazole or methimazole.

Duration of methimazole therapy in children with Graves' disease — If methimazole is chosen as first-line therapy, it should be administered for 1–2 years and then discontinued or the dose reduced to assess remission (1/+00). In children, antithyroid drug (ATD) courses of 1–2 years yield remission rates generally 20%–30%, defined as being euthyroid for 1 year after stopping therapy, and the chance of remission after 2 years is low when the thyroid is more than 2.5 times normal size for age, age is < 12 years, or initial FT4 is > 4 ng/dL; 50 pmol/L; likelihood is higher with achievement of euthyroid state within 3 months.

### The effect of methimazole on cure rates after radioiodine treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism: a randomized clinical trial [^1179EUVF]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Forty-two newly diagnosed patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism were randomly assigned to receive 131I therapy after pretreatment with methimazole (21) or beta-blocker alone (21) and prospectively evaluated, to determine possible effects of methimazole on 131I treatment outcome. After randomization, 8 patients were excluded from the study (5 from pretreatment group and 3 from nonpretreatment group). Radioactive iodine (baseline dose 15 mCi, adjusted for goiter size and/or 131I uptake) was administered after pretreatment with methimazole (30 mg initial dose for at least 2 months and stopped 6 days before treatment) and beta-blocker or pretreatment with beta-blocker alone (atenolol 50–100 mg/d). All but one patient in each group became hypothyroid. A similar length of time was required by both groups to achieve hypothyroidism (112 days, [95% confidence interval [CI] = 28 to 196 days) in the pretreated group and 106 days, [95% CI = 45 to 167 days] in nonpretreated patients). Free thyroxine (T4) normalized 44 ± 39 days after therapy in the nonpretreated group and 35 ± 30 days in the pretreated group (p = 0.57) and decreased to subnormal levels 80 ± 70 days in nonpretreated and 65 ± 32 days in pretreated patients (p = 0.46). We conclude that pretreating patients with methimazole before radioactive iodine therapy does not interfere with the final outcome. Similar cure rates and time required to achieve hypothyroidism after radioiodine were observed when patients were pretreated with methimazole compared to nonpretreated patients.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy — monitoring schedule and dose adjustment: An assessment of serum free T4 and total T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks after initiation, and serum T3 should be monitored because serum free T4 may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3; serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months and is therefore not a good early monitoring parameter. Once euthyroid, methimazole (MMI) dose can be decreased by 30%–50% with biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks; once euthyroid on the minimal dose, evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and if receiving long-term MMI (> 18 months), the interval can be increased to 6 months.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^1163ijQv]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Graves' disease — antithyroid drug selection and dosing: Methimazole (MMI) should be used in virtually every child receiving antithyroid drug therapy, can be given once daily, and adult data show better compliance with once-daily MMI versus multiple daily PTU (83% vs. 53%). Typical MMI dosing is 0.2–0.5 mg/kg daily (range 0.1–1.0 mg/kg daily) with an age-band option of infants 1.25 mg/day; 1–5 years 2.5–5.0 mg/day; 5–10 years 5–10 mg/day; and 10–18 years 10–20 mg/day. In severe hyperthyroidism, doses 50%–100% higher than the above can be used, and when thyroid hormone levels normalize, MMI doses can be reduced by 50% or more; block-and-replace regimens adding levothyroxine are discouraged, as we suggest that this practice in general be avoided.

Methimazole can cause mild abnormal liver tests or transient transaminase elevations in up to one-third of patients, whereas with PTU significant transaminase elevations to 3-fold above the upper limit of normal are seen in up to 4% of patients, and PTU can cause fatal hepatic necrosis; a review found PTU hepatotoxicity occurred after a median of 120 days, and routine liver function monitoring has not been found to prevent severe hepatotoxicity, with any benefit for the first 120 days of therapy. Technical remarks advise discontinuing PTU if transaminases reach > 3 times the upper limit of normal or rise from baseline, then monitor liver function tests weekly and refer for specialty care if resolution is not evident.

### Radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease [^11121NKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Both antithyroid medications and radioiodine are commonly used treatments but their frequency of use varies between regions and countries. Despite the commonness of the diagnosis, any possible differences between the two treatments with respect to long-term outcomes remain unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic literature search in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE and the trials registers ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search was September 2015 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease with at least two years follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. One author carried out screening for inclusion, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment and a second author checked this. We presented data not suitable for meta-analysis as descriptive data. We analysed the overall quality of evidence utilising the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included two RCTs involving 425 adult participants with Graves' disease in this review. Altogether 204 participants were randomised to radioiodine therapy and 221 to methimazole therapy. A single dose of radioiodine was administered. The duration of methimazole medication was 18 months. The period of follow-up was at least two years, depending on the outcome measured. For most outcome measures risk of bias was low; for the outcomes health-related quality of life as well as development and worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy risks of performance bias and detection bias were high in at least one of the two RCTs. Health-related quality of life appeared to be similar in the radioiodine and methimazole treatment groups, however no quantitative data were reported (425 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence). The development and worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy was observed in 76 of 202 radioiodine-treated participants (38%) and in 40 of 215 methimazole-treated participants (19%): risk ratio (RR) 1.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.70); 417 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. A total of 35% to 56% of radioiodine-treated participants and 42% of participants treated with methimazole were smokers, which is associated with the risk of worsening or development of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Euthyroidism was not achieved by any participant being treated with radioiodine compared with 64/68 (94%) of participants after methimazole treatment (112 participants; 1 trial). In this trial thyroxine therapy was not introduced early in both treatment arms to avoid hypothyroidism. Recurrence of hyperthyroidism (relapse) in favour of radioiodine treatment showed a RR of 0.20 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.66); P value = 0.22; 417 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence. Heterogeneity was high (I² = 91%) and the RRs were 0.61 or 0.06 with non-overlapping CIs. Adverse events other than development of worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy for radioiodine therapy were hypothyroidism (39 of 41 participants (95%) compared with 0% of participants receiving methimazole, however thyroxine treatment to avoid hypothyroidism was not introduced early in the radioiodine group - 104 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence) and drug-related adverse events for methimazole treatment (23 of 215 participants (11%) reported adverse effects likely related to methimazole therapy - 215 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence). The outcome measures all-cause mortality and bone mineral density were not reported in the included trials. One trial (174 participants) reported socioeconomic effects: costs based on the official hospital reimbursement system in Sweden for patients without relapse and methimazole treatment were USD 1126/1164 (young/older methimazole group) and for radioiodine treatment USD 1862. Costs for patients with relapse and methimazole treatment were USD 2284/1972 (young/older methimazole group) and for radioiodine treatment USD 2760.

Authors' Conclusions

The only antithyroid drug investigated in the two included trials was methimazole, which might limit the applicability of our findings with regard to other compounds such as propylthiouracil. Results from two RCTs suggest that radioiodine treatment is associated with an increased risk of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Our findings suggest some benefit from radioiodine treatment for recurrence of hyperthyroidism (relapse) but there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect size.

Management of relapse after methimazole for GD: If a patient with GD becomes hyperthyroid after completing a course of methimazole, consideration should be given to treatment with radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy, and low-dose methimazole treatment for longer than 12–18 months may be considered in patients not in remission who prefer this approach.

Graves' disease in pregnancy — antithyroid drug (ATD) selection and lactation — ATD therapy should be used for overt hyperthyroidism due to GD during pregnancy, with propylthiouracil (PTU) used in the first trimester and methimazole (MMI) used when therapy is started after the first trimester (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence); concerns about rare but potentially fatal PTU-related hepatotoxicity led the U.S. FDA to recommend reserving PTU for patients in the first trimester or allergic/intolerant to MMI, and the period of highest teratogenic risk from ATDs is gestational weeks 6–10; during breastfeeding, both MMI and PTU appear in small concentrations in milk with normal infant outcomes reported, but MMI is the preferred ATD in nursing mothers due to potential hepatic necrosis with maternal PTU use.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Methimazole is indicated:

In patients with Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goiter for whom surgery or radioactive iodine therapy is not an appropriate treatment option
To ameliorate symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Methimazole is administered orally. The total daily dosage is usually given in 3 divided doses at approximately 8-hour intervals.

Adults- The initial daily dosage is 15 mg for mild hyperthyroidism, 30 mg to 40 mg for moderately severe hyperthyroidism, and 60 mg for severe hyperthyroidism, divided into 3 doses at 8-hour intervals. The maintenance dosage is 5 mg to 15 mg daily.

Pediatric - Initially, the daily dosage is 0.4 mg/kg of body weight divided into 3 doses and given at 8-hour intervals. The maintenance dosage is approximately 1/2 of the initial dose.

### Methimazole-induced hepatotoxicity [^117T6gBo]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the case of a patient with Graves' hyperthyroidism in whom treatment with methimazole led to severe cholestasis.

Methods

A detailed case report and an overview of previously published cases of methimazole- and carbimazole-induced hepatotoxicity, found in a MEDLINE search with use of methimazole, carbimazole, thionamides and antithyroid agents as subject headings, are provided.

Results

In a 36-year-old woman with severe hyperthyroidism, treatment with methimazole (20 mg twice daily) was initiated. Nineteen days later, pruritus, scleral icterus, dark urine, and abdominal discomfort prompted discontinuation of the therapy. Laboratory investigations and abdominal ultrasonography showed findings consistent with a cholestatic reaction to methimazole. Recovery was slow but complete. Of the 30 previously published cases of hepatotoxicity related to treatment with methimazole or carbimazole in which the nature of the hepatic injury was described, 19 were also cholestatic.

Conclusion

Physicians should be aware that thionamide drugs can be associated with hepatotoxicity. Analysis of the known cases suggests that older age of the patient and higher dose of the drug are risk factors for cholestatic injury.

### Methimazole for prevention of iodinated contrast media-induced exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis in susceptible patients [^1118MmLo]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Iodinated contrast media (ICMs) are widely used in a variety of examinations and procedures. The aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of methimazole (MMI) in prevention of thyrotoxicosis after ICM exposure.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included patients aged ≥ 18 years admitted to a tertiary medical center who underwent ICM examination or procedure and received MMI prior to iodine exposure.

Results

A total of 179 patients with 202 hospitalizations were included. The mean age was 72.3 ± 13.5 years (female, 64%). Nearly all patients (99%) had a history of thyroid disease, and 91% were treated with MMI prior to admission. Seventy-five patients had low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels prior to ICM exposure. In this high-risk group, MMI led to normalization of TSH after discharge in 19%, and 64% remained with low TSH levels after discharge but with a small median difference in free thyroxine levels of -0.5 (interquartile range [IQR], -5.9 to 5.2) pmol/L. In the 8 patients with dose increase during hospitalization, treatment with MMI was beneficial with a median free thyroxine decrease of -6.2 (IQR, -9.2 to -1) pmol/L and TSH increase of 0.2 (IQR, 0.02–0.7) mIU/L. In 110 patients with normal TSH levels before admission, with MMI treatment, most (71%) remained euthyroid after discharge, 13% had low TSH levels, and 9% had high TSH levels. In the 15 patients with high TSH levels prior to admission, the TSH levels of only 2 patients normalized, 47% remained with high TSH levels, and 27% had low TSH levels after discharge.

Conclusion

In patients with pre-existing thyrotoxicosis treated with antithyroid drugs, MMI therapy before ICM exposure prevented exacerbations. In patients with low TSH levels before admission, increasing the dose of MMI before exposure led to improvement in thyroid functions after discharge.
