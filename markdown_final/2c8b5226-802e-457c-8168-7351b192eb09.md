## Question

What is the difference between folate and folic acid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between folate and folic acid, including chemistry, bioavailability, metabolism (UMFA), safety concerns, and what current guidelines actually recommend. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions and chemical forms. Then, I should review dietary sources and stability. Next, I will examine bioavailability and the rationale for dietary folate equivalents. After that, I need to check human metabolic handling and the unmetabolized folic acid phenomenon. Then, I should review safety signals and where the evidence remains uncertain. Next, I must verify guideline-backed clinical recommendations and thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize practical takeaways and note any nuanced alternatives like 5-MTHF, while confirming appropriate lab monitoring and population targets [^116DrzF4] [^113izMMN] [^111Kt6Dz] [^112bXHkk] [^116hvZfQ] [^113dxFX9].

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions. Folate is a generic term for naturally occurring, reduced one-carbon carriers in foods, whereas folic acid is pteroylmonoglutamic acid, the fully oxidized synthetic form used in supplements and fortification; wait, I almost implied they're interchangeable, but they are chemically distinct species with different stability and handling in the body, so I need to keep that distinction explicit [^116DrzF4].

> I will now examine structural features because they drive function and handling. Natural folates are typically reduced, labile, and often polyglutamated for intracellular retention, which must be deconjugated before absorption, while folic acid is oxidized, unusually stable, and a monoglutamate designed for high stability and bioavailability; hold on, I should verify the absorption step — yes, polyglutamates require hydrolysis pre-absorption, which differentiates their kinetics from folic acid in the gut [^116DrzF4].

> Next, I should review sources to avoid conflating intake patterns. Natural folate is abundant in leafy greens and legumes, whereas folic acid is provided by supplements and fortified foods; I should confirm that fortification has reduced NTDs in countries adopting it, which it has, though not all regions mandate fortification, influencing background status and risk [^116DrzF4] [^112AmqqQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "more is always better"; I need to check bioavailability differences and how DFEs were derived. Controlled feeding data show food folates are substantially less bioavailable than folic acid, with relative bioavailability estimates around 30% to 59% in test foods like spinach and yeast, a key reason for adopting dietary folate equivalents; meta-analytic biomarker data also show consistent dose–response to folic acid up to about 400 μg/day, after which variability increases and responses are less predictable [^112wmagr] [^113izMMN] [^115px56A].

> I should confirm human metabolic handling next, especially the UMFA issue. Let me verify whether the human gut reduces folic acid efficiently — data using portal vein sampling show limited mucosal reduction of folic acid, with most labeled folic acid appearing unmetabolized in the portal vein shortly after dosing, whereas reduced folates are readily converted to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; the rate-limiting DHFR step for folic acid is slow and variable in humans, which helps explain detection of unmetabolized folic acid in circulation and even in breast milk [^111Kt6Dz] [^111tqQZc] [^113pXY7H].

> But wait, what about clinical safety signals — do they mandate changing practice, or are they hypothesis-generating? Concerns include masking of B12 deficiency and possible links of high folic acid exposure to cancer incidence in some contexts, with a trial signal for prostate cancer risk during folic acid supplementation and no protective effect against colorectal adenomas; however, an NIH-convened review emphasizes that evidence for adverse outcomes from excess folic acid or UMFA remains inconclusive, so I should present these as areas of uncertainty rather than firm contraindications [^112DozGv] [^115S4ePV] [^115QJ2cX] [^113rku9w].

> Let me now verify guideline-backed recommendations because clinical decisions must anchor to high-quality guidance. The USPSTF advises 400–800 μg/day of folic acid for all who are planning or could become pregnant, and ACOG specifies 400 μg/day for average-risk and 4,000 μg/day for high-risk individuals beginning before conception through early pregnancy; WHO focuses on a population RBC folate target of ≥ 906 nmol/L for NTD prevention, cautioning this threshold is for population-level assessment and not individual diagnosis; hold on, I should double-check that these bodies specify folic acid rather than "folate" generically — they do, reflecting the evidence base and stability of the synthetic form [^112bXHkk] [^11118rKA] [^116hvZfQ] [^113dxFX9] [^111QkY3C].

> I need to ensure I address alternatives and special cases thoughtfully. The biologically active [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate can raise RBC folate at least as much as equimolar folic acid in some trials, and emerging data suggest potential child neurocognitive benefits when continuing 400 μg/day of folic acid beyond the first trimester, but guidelines still prioritize folic acid for NTD prevention due to the strength and consistency of the evidence base and programmatic feasibility; I should clarify that extended supplementation beyond the first trimester is not universally recommended, though supportive data are accumulating [^113XaANC] [^113WoeXx] [^112bXHkk] [^116hvZfQ].

> Next, I should review laboratory considerations to avoid misapplication. Serum folate is generally sufficient for diagnosing deficiency in clinical practice and routine RBC folate testing is not recommended by BSH, whereas WHO's ≥ 906 nmol/L RBC folate threshold is intended for public health monitoring rather than individual patient management; wait, I nearly applied the population cutoff to an individual — let me correct that and keep it at the population level as WHO specifies [^113bpSGh] [^113dxFX9] [^111QkY3C].

> Synthesizing the clinical distinctions, I should emphasize the practical takeaways. Folate refers to natural, reduced, often polyglutamated vitamers in foods, while folic acid is the stable, oxidized monoglutamate used in supplements and fortification; folic acid is more bioavailable than food folates and, despite limited mucosal reduction leading to circulating UMFA, remains the guideline-endorsed form for periconceptional prevention of neural tube defects, with safety surveillance ongoing and current adverse-signal evidence judged insufficient to overturn recommendations; in practice, use folic acid per guidelines, optimize dietary folate, ensure adequate vitamin B12 status, and reserve population RBC folate targets for public health assessment rather than individual diagnosis [^116DrzF4] [^113izMMN] [^111Kt6Dz] [^112bXHkk] [^116hvZfQ] [^113dxFX9] [^113rku9w].

---

Folate is the natural, reduced form of vitamin B9 found in foods, while folic acid is the synthetic, oxidized form used in supplements and fortification [^116DrzF4]. Folic acid is **more stable and about 1.7 times more bioavailable than food folate** [^113izMMN], but it requires reduction by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is slow and variable, leading to **unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA)** in plasma at intakes above ~200–400 µg/day. UMFA may **mask B12 deficiency** and has **uncertain long-term risks**, so intake should stay below the **1,000 µg/day UL** unless medically indicated. For NTD prevention, **400–800 µg/day folic acid** [^1119t4Zd] is recommended for women who could become pregnant, with **4 mg/day for high-risk women** [^116hvZfQ]; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is an alternative for those with MTHFR variants or concerns about UMFA [^113XaANC].

---

## Chemical structure and stability

**Folate** refers to naturally occurring, reduced forms (e.g. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate [5-MTHF]) with polyglutamate tails [^116DrzF4] that are labile and sensitive to heat, light, and oxidation. **Folic acid** is the synthetic, fully oxidized pteroylmonoglutamic acid [^116DrzF4], which is highly stable and used in supplements and fortification.

---

## Bioavailability and absorption

**Folate** has lower bioavailability (~50–60%) due to polyglutamate hydrolysis and instability [^112wmagr], whereas **folic acid** has higher bioavailability (~85–100%) [^113izMMN] owing to its stability and efficient absorption [^112wmagr].

---

## Metabolism and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA)

**Folate** is rapidly converted to 5-MTHF in the gut and liver [^111Kt6Dz], entering circulation as the active form. **Folic acid** requires reduction by DHFR to DHF/THF, followed by methylation to 5-MTHF; because DHFR activity is slow and variable [^111Kt6Dz], UMFA appears in plasma at intakes > ~200–400 µg/day.

---

## Physiological roles and health implications

Both forms support DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation [^116DrzF4], and prevent megaloblastic anemia [^111JZjKw] and NTDs. Folic acid is **more effective for rapid status improvement and NTD prevention** [^116ey7BZ] because of its higher bioavailability and stability [^116DrzF4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Population** | **Folate (natural)** | **Folic acid (synthetic)** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | Emphasize dietary intake (400 µg DFE/day) | Supplementation not routinely recommended |
| Women of reproductive age | Dietary intake encouraged | 400–800 µg/day [^1119t4Zd] recommended for NTD prevention [^112bXHkk] |
| High-risk pregnancy (previous NTD) | Dietary intake encouraged | 4 mg/day [^116hvZfQ] recommended |
| Individuals with MTHFR polymorphisms | 5-MTHF supplementation recommended | Folic acid less effective due to impaired conversion |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Folate is generally safe, and excess intake rarely causes adverse effects. Folic acid in **excess (> 1,000 µg/day)** may **mask B12 deficiency**, cause **UMFA accumulation** [^111Kt6Dz], and may have **uncertain long-term risks** (e.g. cancer promotion, cognitive effects) [^113rku9w] [^1153JoBA].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Folic acid supplementation is critical for NTD prevention [^1119t4Zd]; continued supplementation [^116p2A8i] may benefit neurocognitive development [^113WoeXx].

- **Elderly**: Excess folic acid may mask B12 deficiency and worsen cognitive decline [^1126ZCtY].

- **Genetic polymorphisms**: MTHFR variants reduce folic acid conversion; 5-MTHF is preferred.

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Characteristic** | **Folate (natural)** | **Folic acid (synthetic)** |
|-|-|-|
| Source | Naturally occurring in foods | Synthetic; supplements/fortification |
| Stability | Labile; sensitive to heat/light | Highly stable |
| Bioavailability | Lower (~50–60%) | Higher (~85–100%) |
| Metabolism | Rapid conversion to 5-MTHF | Slow DHFR-dependent conversion |
| UMFA presence | None | Present at higher intakes |
| Clinical use | Dietary intake emphasized | Supplementation for NTD prevention |

---

Folate and folic acid are distinct in structure, stability, bioavailability, and metabolism. Folic acid is more effective for **rapid status improvement and NTD prevention** [^1119t4Zd], but excess intake can cause **UMFA accumulation** [^111Kt6Dz] and **mask B12 deficiency** [^113rku9w]. Recommendations should balance benefits and risks, with 5-MTHF considered for those with MTHFR variants or UMFA concerns.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, particularly in relation to pregnant patients, vitamin B9 and B12, the USPSTF 2023 guidelines recommend offering folic acid supplementation of 400–800 mcg/day to all individuals planning to or who could become pregnant to prevent fetal neural tube defects.

### Folic acid handling by the human gut: Implications for food fortification and supplementation [^111Kt6Dz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Thinking, which is based mainly on rodent studies, is that physiologic doses of folic acid (pterylmonoglutamic acid), such as dietary vitamin folates, are biotransformed in the intestinal mucosa and transferred to the portal vein as the natural circulating plasma folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF), before entering the liver and the wider systemic blood supply.

- **Objective**: We tested the assumption that, in humans, folic acid is biotransformed (reduced and methylated) to 5-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa.

- **Design**: We conducted a crossover study in which we sampled portal and peripheral veins for labeled folate concentrations after oral ingestion with physiologic doses of stable-isotope-labeled folic acid or the reduced folate 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-FormylTHF) in six subjects with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) in situ. The TIPSS allowed blood samples to be taken from the portal vein.

- **Results**: Fifteen minutes following a dose of folic acid, 80 ± 12% of labeled folate in the hepatic portal vein was unmodified folic acid. In contrast, following a dose of labeled 5-FormylTHF, only 4 ± 18% of labeled folate in the portal vein was unmodified 5-FormylTHF; the rest had been converted to 5-MTHF after 15 minutes post-dose.

- **Conclusions**: The human gut appears to have a very efficient capacity to convert reduced dietary folates to 5-MTHF but limited ability to reduce folic acid. Therefore, large amounts of unmodified folic acid in the portal vein are probably attributable to an extremely limited mucosal cell dihydrofolate reductase function.

### Red blood cell folate concentrations increase more after supplementation with [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate than with folic acid in women of childbearing age [^113XaANC]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

For the primary prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), public health authorities recommend women of childbearing age to take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily, starting 4 weeks before conception and continuing during the first trimester. The biologically active derivative [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ([6S]-5-MTHF) could be an alternative to folic acid.

- **Objective**: We investigated the effect of supplementation with [6S]-5-MTHF compared with that of folic acid on red blood cell folate concentration, an indicator of folate status.

- **Design**: The study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial. Healthy women (n = 144) aged 19–33 years received 400 micrograms of folic acid, the equimolar amount of [6S]-5-MTHF (416 micrograms), 208 micrograms of [6S]-5-MTHF, or placebo as a daily supplement for 24 weeks. Red blood cell and plasma folate concentrations were measured at baseline and at 4-week intervals.

- **Results**: The increase in red blood cell folate over time was significantly higher in the group receiving 416 micrograms of [6S]-5-MTHF daily than in the groups receiving 400 micrograms of folic acid daily or 208 micrograms of [6S]-5-MTHF daily (P < 0.05).

### Practice bulletin no. 187: Neural tube defects [^116hvZfQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for folate deficiency, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, the ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend offering folic acid supplementation of 4,000 mcg/day starting 3 months before pregnancy and continuing until 12 weeks of gestational age in women at high risk of neural tube defects.

### Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy for maternal health and pregnancy outcomes [^111pz9XC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

During pregnancy, fetal growth causes an increase in the total number of rapidly dividing cells, which leads to increased requirements for folate. Inadequate folate intake leads to a decrease in serum folate concentration, resulting in a decrease in erythrocyte folate concentration, a rise in homocysteine concentration, and megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and other tissues with rapidly dividing cells.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of oral folic acid supplementation alone or with other micronutrients versus no folic acid (placebo or same micronutrients but no folic acid) during pregnancy on hematological and biochemical parameters during pregnancy and on pregnancy outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2012), and we contacted major organizations working in micronutrient supplementation, including UNICEF Nutrition Section, the World Health Organization (WHO) Maternal and Reproductive Health, WHO Nutrition Division, and the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized, cluster-randomized, and crossover controlled trials evaluating supplementation of folic acid alone or with other micronutrients versus no folic acid (placebo or same micronutrients but no folic acid) in pregnancy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: Thirty-one trials were included in the analysis.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: Summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^113TWfyf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

The Government of Canada and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada both recommend a daily multivitamin supplement containing 400 µg folic acid (FA) for the primary prevention of neural tube defects among low-risk women from before conception and throughout lactation. Prenatal supplements marketed and prescribed in Canada typically exceed the recommended dose, usually providing ≥ 1000 µg FA/d. This high daily dose, coupled with staple-food FA fortification, has resulted in the observation of very high blood folate concentrations among reproductive-aged women consuming FA-containing supplements. The long-term consequences of high folate status on fetal development are unknown; however, evidence from animal studies and some human epidemiologic data suggest potential adverse consequences.

To address this issue, a workshop was convened with the overall goal to identify challenges and solutions to aligning supplemental FA intakes with evidence-based recommendations. Thirty-eight stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and health professional groups participated. Group discussions facilitated the identification and prioritization of five key challenges, for which solutions and implementation strategies were proposed. The five themes encompassed:

- **Clarity and harmonization**: Clarity and harmonization of evidence-based guidelines.
- **Reformulation or relabeling**: Reformulation or relabeling of FA-containing supplements.
- **Access to FA**: Access to FA for all women.
- **Knowledge dissemination strategies**: Knowledge dissemination strategies and education of the public and health care professionals.
- **Attitude change**: Attitude change to overcome the perception of "more is better".

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^116bXGgd]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

A sample size of 63 participants per treatment group was required to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 100 nmol/L in mean RBC folate concentrations across groups at the end of the intervention period (16 weeks), while adjusting for baseline RBC folate concentration, with 80% power and two-sided α of 0.0167 for pairwise comparisons between the three treatment groups (overall α = 0.05). The sample size assumes an SD of 202 nmol/L, a correlation between RBC folate concentrations at baseline and 16 weeks of 0.6, and a drop-out rate of up to 10%. We aimed to recruit 100 participants per group to allow for some uncertainty in the assumed values.

A descriptive comparison of the randomized groups was conducted on all baseline demographic characteristics and baseline measures of the outcomes. The primary analysis was performed on the available data according to treatment allocation at randomization (intention-to-treat analysis). A secondary "per-protocol" analysis was also performed, including only women who completed the study and were > 80% adherent to the treatment regime. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using linear regression models, and binary outcomes were analyzed using log-binomial regression models or log Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation if convergence issues occurred. Adjustment was also made for baseline body mass index (BMI) category in an unplanned sensitivity analysis after observing a chance imbalance in BMI between the treatment groups.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113oUzcZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

Subgroup analyses revealed more pronounced intervention effects among populations with lower baseline folate levels (baseline folate < 16 nmol/L in 9 RCTs: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97, P < 0.0001; baseline folate ≥ 16 nmol/L in 6 RCTs: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95–1.07, P = 0.78; P = 0.016 for interaction). A larger magnitude of homocysteine reduction was associated with a greater reduction in the risk of CVD (change in homocysteine by 4 μmol/L in 10 RCTs: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96–1.06; P = 0.67; by 4 to < 5 μmol/L in 3 RCTs: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85–1.01; P = 0.08; by ≥ 5 μmol/L in 5 RCTs: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.94; P = 0.005; P = 0.009 for interaction). There was no significant difference in the intervention effect for other subgroups; however, the benefits of folic acid supplementation for stroke and CVD appear to be stronger in Asian populations than in European or North American populations.

We did not observe a significant difference of intervention effect according to the dosage of folic acid supplementation. We also examined the intervention effect stratified by the average baseline age of participants and duration of follow-up but did not observe a clear pattern of intervention effect on CVD in the joint categories of these two variables (P = 0.22 for interaction).

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^115MFV7X]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Although evidence is lacking to confirm a potential dose-dependent adverse effect of folic acid (FA) when supplemented across all trimesters, the "precautionary principle" could be considered in the re-evaluation or confirmation of periconceptional supplementation guidelines. The precautionary principle had its origin in environmental science and aims to anticipate, monitor, and prevent unintended adverse consequences of public health interventions. In the context of prenatal supplementation guidelines, the precautionary principle can be defined as a guide for decision-making in the public health context and a policy tool for acknowledging scientific uncertainty by prompting a preventive intervention, calling for more research, or both, in light of the existing state of the evidence.

### Will mandatory folic acid fortification prevent or promote cancer [^1153JoBA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

An overwhelming body of evidence supports a protective effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation against neural tube defects (NTDs), which led to mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States. The effectiveness of folic acid fortification in improving folate status has been quite striking, with a dramatic increase in blood measurements of folate in the United States. Preliminary reports suggest a significant reduction of approximately 15–50% in NTDs in the United States. The success of folic acid fortification in improving folate status and reducing NTD rates is a public health triumph and provides a paradigm of collaboration between science and public health policy.

Although folic acid is generally regarded as safe, there is ongoing concern that folic acid fortification may have adverse effects on subpopulation groups not originally targeted for fortification. Emerging evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation may enhance the development and progression of already existing, undiagnosed premalignant and malignant lesions. Over recent years, the US population has been exposed to a significant increase in folate intake, for which no comprehensive safety data exist. The potential cancer-promoting effect of folic acid supplementation needs to be considered in carefully monitoring the long-term effects of folic acid fortification on the vast majority of the US population who are not at risk of NTDs.

### Folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake during pregnancy and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery: a prospective observational cohort study [^114fVksn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

One possible explanation for these conflicting results could be the dosage of folic acid. While most of the studies finding an association with gestational length or preterm delivery (PTD) were based on high doses of folic acid (≥ 5000 μg/d, ≥ 2500 μg/d, and ≥ 500 μg/d), only two women in our study population consumed as much as 5000 μg/d of supplemental folic acid. Additionally, only 10% consumed > 500 μg/d and 16% consumed > 400 μg/d. However, the Hungarian randomized controlled trial (RCT), one of the largest conducted so far, did not find any effect of a high dosage of 800 μg/d of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on PTD. Unfortunately, the folic acid dosage was not indicated in all of the studies.

The assessment of folate intake from supplementation alone or in populations with different dietary folate intakes are additional factors compromising comparability between studies. Recent US studies are performed against the background of mandatory folate fortification of food, whereas other studies have examined supplementation effects in folate-deficient populations. Few studies have assessed the effects of both dietary folate and folic acid supplementation separately or in combination, and adjustments for bioavailability are rare. In this Norwegian study population, only 3% of the participants reached the Nordic Nutrition Recommendation of 500 μg/d with their dietary folate intake, and 44% of the participants achieved the recommended level with their combined dietary folate and supplemental folic acid intake. After stratification for dietary folate intake, the early initiation of folic acid supplementation was significantly associated with…

### Initiation and duration of folic acid supplementation in preventing congenital malformations [^117EPgT3]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Pre- and post-conception folic acid (FA) supplementation results in varying risks of congenital malformations. Compared to women who did not supplement with FA, those who began FA after pregnancy showed a lower risk of congenital malformations. This association was marginally statistically significant in sensitive analyses (see Additional file 1: Table S3).

Further analyses revealed that among women who initiated FA after becoming pregnant, an earlier start, such as within the first month of gestation (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.55; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.33–0.91), and moderate duration of FA use (e.g. 1.01–2 months, OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36–0.98), correlated with a reduced risk of congenital malformations compared to those without supplementation (see Table 2). In contrast, preconceptional FA initiation, including among subgroups who started supplementation more than three months or three months or less before pregnancy, was not significantly linked with congenital malformations (see Additional file 1: Tables S9–11).

- **Post-conception folic acid supplementation and risk of congenital malformations**:
	- Adjusted analyses accounted for region, maternal age, ethnicity, parity, conception mode, education level, family income, history of adverse pregnancy outcomes, medicine exposure, and early pregnancy conditions.

### Folic acid handling by the human gut: Implications for food fortification and supplementation [^112DozGv]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Concerns have been mounting about the safety of persistent exposure to folic acid that results in the circulation of unmetabolized folic acid, including the potential for masking vitamin B-12 deficiency and the acceleration of cognitive decline in the elderly with a low vitamin B-12 status. An increase in the incidence of prostate and other cancers was seen in studies performed to address the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation reduces cancer risk, and an increase in overall mortality was seen in patients who were taking folic acid supplements.

That dietary folate is beneficial but supplemental folic acid may have some detrimental effects is a paradox because both dietary folates and folic acid are taken up by mucosal cells with a similar affinity by the proton-coupled folate transporter. The absorptive mucosa simply rearranges 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-FormylTHF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) before transport to the serosal side and transports 5-MTHF unchanged. The generally accepted wisdom, derived from rodent studies, is that physiologic doses of folic acid are biotransformed in the intestinal absorptive mucosa and transferred to the hepatic portal vein as 5-MTHF in the same way as dietary folates. This belief may have been a misinterpretation of an article that concluded "under physiological conditions only 5-MTHF reaches the blood", which was based on a study where only a small percentage of ingested folate was folic acid. This apparent consensus was challenged by studies that showed…

### Folate bioavailability: Implications for establishing dietary recommendations and optimizing status [^113izMMN]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

The addition of folic acid to the US food supply, along with the critical role of folate in certain health outcomes, has intensified worldwide interest in the bioavailability of folate. Bioavailability is a function of absorptive and postabsorptive processes, which in turn are influenced by diet, individuality, and complex diet-host interactions. As such, it is unlikely that a single bioavailability figure will accurately reflect food folate bioavailability from every diet for every person.

Although there is broad agreement that naturally occurring food folate is not as bioavailable as folic acid, questions remain as to the extent of these differences, particularly within the context of a whole diet. This article:

- **Summarizes and integrates bioavailability estimates** derived from studies that use whole-diet approaches.

- **Highlights the influences of genetics, ethnicity-race, and sex** as postabsorptive bioavailability modifiers.

- **Discusses the adequacy of the US folate Recommended Dietary Allowance** in achieving folate sufficiency in select subpopulations.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^1121YRwi]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for folate deficiency, specifically concerning pregnant patients, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering prophylactic folic acid administration of 200–500 mcg/day during pregnancy.

### Unmetabolized folic acid and total folate concentrations in breast milk are unaffected by low-dose folate supplements [^113pXY7H]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Many lactating women in North America are exposed to high synthetic folic acid intakes due to food fortification and vitamin supplement use. Few data exist on the potential long-term effect of high folic acid intakes on milk folate concentrations, whereas no data are available on the effect of supplemental [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ([6S]-5-methylTHF).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of three treatments (placebo, folic acid, and [6S]-5-methylTHF) on milk folate and folate-binding protein (FBP) concentrations and to determine whether unmetabolized folic acid is present in milk.

In this 16-week randomized, placebo-controlled intervention, 69 lactating women were randomly assigned to receive [6S]-5-methylTHF (416 microg/d, 906 nmol/d) or a placebo, or were assigned to receive folic acid (400 microg/d, 906 nmol/d) within one week postpartum. Total milk folate, FBP, and unmetabolized folic acid concentrations were measured at 16 weeks.

Unmetabolized folic acid was detected in 96% of milk samples tested, representing approximately 8% of total milk folate concentrations. Total milk folate, FBP, and the proportion of unmetabolized milk folic acid did not differ between treatments; however, FBP concentrations were significantly lower than those published before mandatory folic acid fortification of the food supply.

Maternal intake of synthetic folic acid leads to the appearance of unmetabolized folic acid in milk and, seemingly, a down-regulation of milk FBP synthesis.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^116s74RT]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Women tend to supplement their diets with multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements more often than men, and reports indicate that more than 90% of pregnant women in the United States supplement their diets with prenatal MVMs. Given the widespread use of MVMs among women and the increasing efforts to unveil the importance of phenotype-specific health determinants, it seems imperative to review what is known about variations in nutrient physiology among women from different ethnic and racial groups and at different reproductive stages of life. In this study, we embark on an assessment of the scientific evidence and knowledge gaps that impact the precise determination of nutrient levels, specifically calcium, iron, and folic acid, that confer benefits to various subpopulations of women in the United States.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: Summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^116DrzF4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Folate is a generic descriptor for a family of compounds that share a pteroylglutamic acid core, with the primary biological role of transferring 1-carbon units. Pteroylglutamic acid, or folic acid (FA), is the most common form of folate used in dietary supplements and as a fortificant in foods. It is completely oxidized, stable, highly bioavailable, and seldom found in nature. In contrast, naturally occurring folates are more labile, less bioavailable, typically reduced (e.g. dihydro- or tetrahydrofolate), and frequently carry a carbon group (e.g. methyl, formyl). A significant fraction of naturally occurring folates have a polyglutamate tail, necessary for cellular retention and enzyme affinity in living cells. Folate monoglutamates, but not polyglutamates, are transported across cells.

Excellent sources of naturally occurring folate include green leafy vegetables, dark green vegetables, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, and legumes, including beans, chickpeas, and lentils. Folate is best known for its role as a cofactor in nucleotide synthesis, necessary for DNA and RNA biosynthesis and repair, and for the remethylation of homocysteine to produce the essential amino acid methionine. Methionine is used for protein synthesis or can be converted to S-adenosylmethionine. S-adenosylmethionine is involved in numerous methylation reactions in the body, including those of DNA and histones, which are required for epigenetic programming early in life.

### Practice bulletin no. 187: Neural tube defects [^11118rKA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for folate deficiency, especially in pregnant patients, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend offering folic acid supplementation of 400 mcg/day. This should begin at least 1 month before pregnancy and continue through the first 12 weeks in all women planning a pregnancy or capable of becoming pregnant.

### Folic acid: A public-health challenge [^112AmqqQ]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Despite worldwide public-health campaigns recommending periconceptional daily supplementation of synthetic folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, many women are not following these recommendations. At the same time, in most European countries, no decline in defects has been recorded in recent years. Vulnerable groups include those with a low standard of education, young people, and women with unplanned pregnancies. Furthermore, in most countries without mandatory fortification, the general population is not consuming the recommended 0.4 mg of food folate per day.

Voluntary fortification improves the situation but does not reach all parts of the population. In the United States, Canada, and Chile, mandatory fortification of flour has substantially improved folate and homocysteine status, with neural tube defect rates falling by between 31% and 78%. Nevertheless, many countries do not choose mandatory folic acid fortification, in part because expected additional health benefits are not yet scientifically proven in clinical trials, in part due to feared health risks, and because of the issue of freedom of choice. Thus, additional creative public-health approaches need to be developed to prevent neural tube defects and improve the folate status of the general population.

### Folic acid and risk of prostate cancer: Results from a randomized clinical trial [^115S4ePV]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

Data regarding the association between folate status and risk of prostate cancer are sparse and conflicting. We studied prostate cancer occurrence in the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, a placebo-controlled randomized trial of aspirin and folic acid supplementation for the chemoprevention of colorectal adenomas conducted between July 6, 1994, and December 31, 2006. Participants were followed for up to 10.8 years (median = 7.0, interquartile range = 6.0–7.8) and asked periodically to report all illnesses and hospitalizations. Aspirin alone had no statistically significant effect on prostate cancer incidence, but there were marked differences according to folic acid treatment.

Among the 643 men who were randomly assigned to placebo or supplementation with folic acid, the estimated probability of being diagnosed with prostate cancer over a 10-year period was 9.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.5% to 14.5%) in the folic acid group and 3.3% (95% CI = 1.7% to 6.4%) in the placebo group (age-adjusted hazard ratio = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.23 to 5.65, Wald test P = 0.01). In contrast, baseline dietary folate intake and plasma folate in non-multivitamin users were inversely associated with risk of prostate cancer, although these associations did not attain statistical significance in adjusted analyses. These findings highlight the potential complex role of folate in prostate cancer and the possibly different effects of folic acid-containing supplements vs natural sources of folate.

### International expert consensus on micronutrient supplement use during the early life course [^116p2A8i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

There was strong consensus for folic acid supplement use during the preconception period and the first trimester, which aligns with existing guidelines to take supplemental folic acid (vitamin B9) to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Obstetricians and gynecologists are generally aware of the importance of folic acid intake during these periods, but they may be less informed about the role of folic acid in preventing other congenital defects as a substrate in one-carbon metabolism. In addition, folic acid supplement use during early pregnancy (4 weeks before to 8 weeks after conception) appears to benefit the neurocognitive development of the child. However, the potential advantages of folic acid supplement use beyond the first trimester remain unclear.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, which included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 17 cohort studies, demonstrated that folic acid supplement use during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of pre-eclampsia, although the timing of supplement use was not specified. Folic acid supplement use after the first trimester has been shown to increase maternal and cord blood folate levels and prevent the increase in homocysteine normally observed late in the second and third trimesters. However, given that these studies did not include pregnancy outcomes and that guidelines only cover preconception and early pregnancy, the lack of consensus for folic acid during the third trimester may be expected.

### Modeling the impact of folic acid fortification and supplementation on red blood cell folate concentrations and predicted neural tube defect risk in the United States: Have we reached optimal prevention [^113WHLww]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The US CDC and the Institute of Medicine recommend that women capable of becoming pregnant consume ≥ 400 µg synthetic folic acid per day to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs). The United States has three sources of folic acid: fortified enriched cereal grain products (ECGPs), fortified ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals, and dietary supplements.

- **Objective**: Our objectives were as follows: 1) to estimate the usual daily folic acid intake and distributions of red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations among women consuming folic acid from different sources; 2) to assess the usual daily total folic acid intake associated with optimal RBC folate concentrations for NTD prevention; 3) to predict NTD prevalence; and 4) to estimate the number of preventable folate-sensitive NTDs.

- **Design**: NHANES data (2007–2012) for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (12–49 years) were used to estimate usual daily intakes of synthetic folic acid and natural food folate. We applied existing models of the relation between RBC folate concentrations and NTD risk to predict NTD prevalence.

- **Results**: Based on the distribution of overall RBC folate concentrations (4783 women), the predicted NTD prevalence was 7.3 per 10,000 live births [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 5.5–9.4 per 10,000 live births]. Women consuming folic acid from ECGPs as their only source had lower usual daily total folic acid intakes (median: 115 µg/d; IQR: 79–156 µg/d), lower RBC folate concentrations (median: 881 nmol/L; IQR: 704–1108 nmol/L), and higher predicted NTD prevalence (8.5 per 10,000 live births; 95% UI: 6.4–10.8 per 10,000 live births).

### Impact of folic acid supplementation on the epigenetic profile in healthy unfortified individuals - a randomized intervention trial [^116SZQGn]. Epigenetics (2024). High credibility.

Folic acid fortification of staple foods has been introduced in many countries globally to prevent neural tube defects in newborns, as this birth defect results from a folate deficiency in women around the time of conception. While the mechanisms underlying the link between low folate levels in the mother and failure to close the spina bifida in the fetus have not been fully clarified, it is likely that epigenetic mechanisms play a role. Folate is an essential mediator in one-carbon metabolism, which provides methyl groups for DNA synthesis and methylation.

The availability of active methyl groups can be influenced by diet and uptake of folic acid as well as other key players in one-carbon metabolism, such as choline and methionine. Folate deficiency may correlate with hypomethylation. Conversely, high folate levels may be associated with hypermethylation; however, research in this area is lacking. If folic acid fortification affects DNA methylation, this might be associated with disease initiation or promotion. Hence, it is important to understand the impact of folic acid intake on DNA methylation.

### Randomized trial of a physician-based intervention to increase the use of folic acid supplements among women [^113zyRNi]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Fewer than one-third of American women take folic acid daily, although many report they would if their physicians advised them. This study determined the impact of a physician intervention during routine gynecologic visits on folic acid supplementation.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive brief folic acid counseling, a reminder phone call, and 30 folic acid tablets (n = 162 women; intervention group) or to receive counseling about other preventive health behaviors and a folic acid informational pamphlet (n = 160 women; control group). Self-reported folic acid use was compared at baseline and at 2 months.

Of the 279 patients who completed the study, weekly folic acid intake increased in the intervention group by 68%, compared with 20% in the control group (P = 0.008). No significant differences were found in daily intake. The women most influenced by the intervention were black, lower-income, and not planning pregnancies.

With little effort expended to encourage folic acid use, gynecologists could potentially reduce the risk of folate-preventable birth defects among their patients by as much as 11%.

### Folate dietary insufficiency and folic acid supplementation similarly impair metabolism and compromise hematopoiesis [^111tqQZc]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Data presented herein demonstrate that both low and high levels of dietary folate compromise metabolism in multiple organs, with significant defects manifesting in the B-progenitor compartment. Although folate is required in multiple biosynthetic pathways, including nucleotides, glutathione, SAM, and amino acids, we primarily observed deficiencies in the nucleotide synthesis pathways for B-progenitors isolated from mice fed FD and SD diets, as demonstrated using both NMR and UHPLC-mass spectrometry. The impact of the FD and SD diets on reduced nucleotide synthesis in B-progenitor cells likely contributed to the S-phase proliferative defects observed using EdU analysis.

The observation that both low and high levels of dietary folate promote similar metabolic defects in hematopoietic cells is surprising. Nonetheless, based on mathematical modeling, Ulrich and colleagues have suggested that adverse effects of high folate diets might be explained by the ability of key enzymes, including in the purine and pyrimidine synthetic pathways, to be inhibited by products of folate metabolism. For example, thymidylate synthase (TS) uses methylene-tetrahydrofolate (MTHF) to make dTMP from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), producing dihydrofolate (DHF), which must be recycled by DHFR to regenerate tetrahydrofuran (THF). Importantly, DHF can inhibit TS activity. Notably, supplemented folic acid requires reduction by DHFR (mostly in the liver) to DHF; however, this reaction is more than 1000 times slower relative to the reduction of DHF to THF, and DHFR exhibits variable activity in the livers of individuals.

### Quantifying the effect of folic acid [^116ey7BZ]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Folic acid is known to prevent neural-tube defects (NTDs), but the size of the effect for a given dose is unclear. We aimed to quantify such an effect.

- **Methods**: We used published data from 13 studies of folic acid supplementation on serum folate concentrations, and results from a large cohort study of the risk of NTDs according to serum folate, to measure the preventive effect of specified increases in intake of folic acid.

- **Findings**: Serum folate concentrations increase by 0.94 ng/mL (95% CI 0.77–1.10) for every 0.1 mg/day increase in folic acid intake in women aged 20–35 years, and about double that in people aged 40–65. Every doubling of serum folate concentration roughly halves the risk of an NTD. These two effects can be combined to predict the reduction in risk according to intake of extra folic acid and background serum folate concentration. Such results predict that the preventive effect is greater in women with low serum folate than in those with higher concentrations. The results have also been used to predict direct observations from large randomised trials and the effect of food fortification. From a typical western background serum folate of 5 ng/mL, about 0.2 mg/day (the US level of folic acid fortification) would be expected to reduce NTDs by about 20%; a similar effect can be expected from the British recommendation (0.24 mg/day). An increase of 0.4 mg/day would reduce risk by about 36%, of 1 mg/day by 57%, and taking a 5-mg tablet daily would reduce risk by about 85%.

- **Interpretation**: Folic acid fortification levels should be increased.

### MTHFR 677c→t genotype is associated with folate and homocysteine concentrations in a large, population-based, double-blind trial of folic acid supplementation [^114nVspg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype is associated with modification of disease and risk of neural tube defects. Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations change in response to daily intakes of folic acid supplements, but no large-scale or population-based randomized trials have examined whether the MTHFR genotype modifies the observed response.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether the MTHFR 677C→T genotype modifies the response to folic acid supplementation during and 3 months after discontinuation of supplementation.

- **Design**: Northern Chinese women of childbearing age were enrolled in a 6-month supplementation trial of different folic acid doses: 100, 400, and 4000 μg/day and 4000 μg/week. Plasma and RBC folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations were measured at baseline; after 1, 3, and 6 months of supplementation; and 3 months after discontinuation of supplementation. MTHFR genotyping was performed to identify a C→T mutation at position 677 (n = 932).

- **Results**: Plasma and RBC folate and homocysteine concentrations were associated with MTHFR genotype throughout the supplementation trial, regardless of folic acid dose. MTHFR TT was associated with lower folate concentrations, and the trend of TT < CC was maintained at even the highest doses. Folic acid doses of 100 μg/day or 4000 μg/week did not reduce high homocysteine concentrations in those with the MTHFR TT genotype.

- **Conclusion**: MTHFR genotype was an independent predictor of plasma and RBC folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations and did not have a significant impact on reducing high homocysteine concentrations in individuals with the MTHFR TT genotype.

### Physiological need for calcium, iron, and folic acid for women of various subpopulations during pregnancy and beyond [^1125g4pU]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Folate, or vitamin B9, is a water-soluble vitamin that the body utilizes to synthesize nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and to metabolize amino acids for cell growth. Although it is found in many foods such as dark leafy greens, peas and beans, and fruits, many countries fortify grain and cereal products with folic acid (synthetic folate).

One of the benefits of folate when taken during pregnancy is the prevention of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs). Folate and folic acid have also shown benefits or potential benefits in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, antiviral therapies, longer-term neurological development in infants, neurological status in adults, treatment of chronic diseases such as arthritis and sickle cell disease, reduction of the effects of radiation exposure, and improvement in neurocognitive function. They are also used as additives in various treatments and medications.

Although the benefits of folic acid supplementation in preventing NTDs are clear, some concerns are associated with increased folate and folic acid intake. Folic acid supplementation may mask an existing vitamin B12 deficiency. Additionally, some studies have linked excess folic acid intake with an increased risk of the development and recurrence of certain types of cancers.

No gender-specific differences in folate or folic acid metabolism or biological requirements for men and women have been reported, except to accommodate reproductive differences. The National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements recommends identical folic acid intake requirements for men and women.

### Self-management of iron and folic acid supplementation during pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postnatal periods: a systematic review [^113MKqKp]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

Folic acid supplements pre-pregnancy, IFA supplements during pregnancy, and iron supplements postnatal are known to improve maternal and birth outcomes and present few safety concerns when taken in recommended doses. In this review, we aimed to identify literature that distinguished between self-management and provider-initiated management of these supplements to identify the effect on maternal and fetal and newborn health outcomes, as well as end-users' and providers' values and preferences, cost and cost-effectiveness. We were unable to identify any studies on this topic, highlighting a gap in understanding of self-care interventions relating to IFA supplementation during pregnancy and identifying an area for further research to support the movement towards self-care interventions as a mechanism to help individuals more fully attain their right to health.

### Early pregnancy folate-cobalamin interactions and their effects on cobalamin status and hematologic variables throughout pregnancy [^115GivUp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Periconception folic acid supplementation is widespread, but how it interacts with cobalamin status is rarely considered. The aim of this study was to investigate whether first-trimester folate-cobalamin interactions affect pregnancy cobalamin status, hematologic variables, and pregnancy outcomes.

In the longitudinal Reus-Tarragona Birth Cohort study, from less than 12 gestational weeks throughout pregnancy, fasting plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, plasma cobalamin, holotranscobalamin (holoTC), methylmalonic acid (MMA), total homocysteine (tHcy), hemoglobin, mean cell volume (MCV), postglucose-load serum glucose, gestational hypertension, gestational age at birth, and birth weight were recorded in 563 participants.

The highest plasma folate concentrations occurred in the first trimester when folic acid supplement use was extensive. Supplementation beyond the first trimester interacted with time of pregnancy on plasma folate, RBC folate, and tHcy throughout pregnancy (P-interaction < 0.001). Plasma folate and RBC folate were higher and tHcy was lower in continued supplement users than in nonusers. Elevated plasma folate (≥ 30 nmol/L) occurred in 78.9% of women who exceeded the recommended 400 µg folic acid/d. First-trimester folate-cobalamin status interactions were associated with MMA (P-interaction < 0.001) throughout pregnancy. When plasma cobalamin was suboptimal (≤ 221 pmol/L; n = 36), participants with elevated plasma folate (n = 11) had higher MMA concentrations than did those with nonelevated plasma folate (n = 23).

### Biomarker responses to folic acid intervention in healthy adults: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115px56A]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). High credibility.

The task of revising dietary folate recommendations for optimal health is complicated by a lack of data quantifying the biomarker response that reliably reflects a given folate intake.

- **Objective**: We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis in healthy adults to quantify the typical response of recognized folate biomarkers to a change in folic acid intake.

- **Design**: Electronic and bibliographic searches identified 19 randomized controlled trials that supplemented with folic acid and measured folate biomarkers before and after the intervention in apparently healthy adults aged ≥ 18 years. For each biomarker response, the regression coefficient (β) for individual studies and the overall pooled β were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Folate biomarkers (serum/plasma and red blood cell folate) increased in response to folic acid in a dose-response manner only up to an intake of 400 μg/day. Calculation of the overall pooled β for studies in the range of 50 to 400 μg/day indicated that a doubling of folic acid intake resulted in an increase in serum/plasma folate by 63% (71% for the microbiological assay; 61% for the nonmicrobiological assay) and red blood cell folate by 31% (irrespective of whether microbiological or other assays were used). Studies that used the microbiological assay indicated lower heterogeneity compared with studies using nonmicrobiological assays for determining serum/plasma (I² = 13.5% compared with I² = 77.2%) and red blood cell (I² = 45.9% compared with I² = 70.2%) folate.

- **Conclusions**: Studies administering more than 400 μg folic acid/day showed higher variability and less consistent dose-response behavior, thus questions remain about the efficacy and safety of higher dosages.

### Effect of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron and folic acid supplementation on size at birth and subsequent growth through 24 mo of age: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Y1M95]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials that assessed the effect of daily prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) compared to iron and folic acid (IFA) on an infant's size at birth and/or anthropometric outcomes up to 24 months of age. The review protocol was preregistered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42024551864) on July 6, 2024.

- **Literature searches**: We included the trials from Keats et al, a 2019 Cochrane review that informed the 2020 WHO guideline on MMS, as well as newly published trials identified through the same search criteria and meeting the same inclusion criteria. Of the 19 trials included in the Cochrane review, which were conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and compared MMS with iron, with and without folic acid, one provided MMS twice weekly and was, therefore, excluded from the systematic review assessing the impact of daily supplementation.

Given our initial focus on the 18 trials included in the Cochrane review published in 2019, there was a need to identify new trials and follow-up studies of the 18 included trials that conducted anthropometric assessments of the offspring up to 2 years of age. This was done in three steps. First, we conducted systematic literature searches in three electronic databases (MEDLINE [Ovid], Embase [Ovid], and Scopus) on July 2, 2024, without applying language restrictions, to identify new trials published since 2018 (the date of the literature searches for the Cochrane review). The search strategy employed in Embase (Ovid) is presented in the supplemental appendix. Second, we conducted searches in MEDLINE (Ovid) using the trial identification number of each of the 18 trials.

### Low-dose daily folic acid (400 μg) supplementation does not affect regulation of folate transporters found present throughout the terminal ileum and colon of humans: a randomized clinical trial [^112zFPCu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Folic acid supplementation during the periconceptional period reduces the risk of neural tube defects in infants, but concern over chronic folic acid exposure remains. An improved understanding of folate absorption may clarify potential risks. Folate transporters have been characterized in the small intestine, but less so in the colon of healthy, free-living humans. The impact of folic acid fortification or supplementation on the regulation of these transporters along the intestinal tract is unknown.

- **Objective**: The objective was to characterize the expression of folate transporters/receptor (FT/R) and folate hydrolase, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), from the terminal ileum and throughout the colon of adults and assess the impact of supplemental folic acid.

- **Methods**: In this 16-week open-labeled randomized clinical trial, adults consumed a low folic acid-containing diet, a folate-free multivitamin, and either a 400 μg folic acid supplement or no folic acid supplement. Dietary intakes and blood were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks (time of colonoscopy). Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein expression of FT/R and GCPII were assessed in the terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending and descending colon.

- **Results**: Among 24 randomly assigned subjects, no differences in dietary folate intake or blood folate were observed at baseline. The mean ± SD red blood cell folate at 16 weeks was 1765 ± 426 and 911 ± 242 nmol/L in the 400 μg and 0 μg folic acid groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). Reduced folate carrier, proton-coupled folate transporter, and folate-receptor alpha expression were…

### Preconception counseling improves folate status of women planning pregnancy [^1177yYdz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether counseling women planning pregnancy to start or continue folic acid supplementation improves folate status. Women and their partners reported folic acid supplement intake in a preconceptional health questionnaire. The women were categorized as reported "users" or "nonusers" of supplements before counseling. The use of periconceptional folic acid was addressed at a subsequent preconceptional consultation. Differences between reported supplement users and nonusers before counseling, as well as between assumed users and nonusers of folic acid (with precounseling red cell and serum folate levels above and below 590 nmol/L and 20 nmol/L, respectively), were analyzed.

A total of 111 (66%) of 168 eligible women participated in the study. Estimated mean red cell folate levels of women who reported no use of folic acid supplements before counseling increased significantly after 4 months from 540 nmol/L to 680 nmol/L. Red cell folate levels of women who reported taking supplements (44%) remained stable up to 1 year after counseling. Women with low precounseling folate levels showed a highly significant mean increase in red cell folate from 475 nmol/L to 689 nmol/L 4 months after counseling.

In conclusion, addressing periconceptional folic acid use at a preconceptional consultation improves folate status among women planning to conceive.

### Effect of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron and folic acid supplementation on size at birth and subsequent growth through 24 mo of age: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112t7swc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

The study investigates the impact of prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation on birth size and growth up to 24 months, compared to iron and folic acid supplementation alone. It uses a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, which enhances the robustness of the findings. The results suggest potential benefits in nutritional interventions during pregnancy to support early childhood development.

The research emphasizes that the conclusions are based on a comprehensive data set, which strengthens the credibility of the findings.

### Association between adherence to folic acid supplements and serum folate, and plasma homocysteine among hemodialysis patients [^113ixdUv]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between adherence to prescribed folic acid supplements and folic acid intake, serum folate, and plasma homocysteine levels in hemodialysis patients. Additionally, the study assessed the effects of changes in adherence patterns from enrollment to one year later on these same measures.

- **Design**: Secondary data analysis.

- **Participants**: Eighty-six hemodialysis patients from the Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study's Homocysteine ancillary study.

- **Main outcome measures**: Folic acid supplement intake, serum folate, and plasma homocysteine.

Results indicated that 88% of patients at enrollment and 91% one year later adhered to their prescribed folic acid supplements. Non-adherers demonstrated lower intakes of folic acid at both enrollment and one year later, along with lower serum folate levels at enrollment. Significant differences were observed between the three adherence change groups in folic acid intake (P = 0.001) and plasma homocysteine (P < .001) from enrollment to one year later. Initially non-adherent patients displayed the lowest intakes and serum folate levels, as well as the highest plasma homocysteine levels. Upon becoming adherent one year later, these patients experienced the most significant changes: a 5,461% increase in folic acid intake (P = 0.03), a 69% increase in serum folate (P = 0.04), and a 29% decrease in plasma homocysteine (P = 0.03).

In conclusion, hemodialysis patients non-adherent to folic acid supplement prescriptions exhibited low folic acid intakes, low serum folate levels, and high homocysteine levels. Improvement in their adherence resulted in increased folic acid intakes and serum folate levels.

### Meta-analysis of folic acid efficacy trials in stroke prevention: Insight into effect modifiers [^116X7zRg]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and effect modifiers of folic acid supplementation in the prevention of stroke in regions without folic acid fortification, based on relevant, up-to-date published randomized trials.

- **Methods**: Relative risk (RR) was used to measure the effect of folic acid supplementation on the risk of stroke using a fixed effects model.

- **Findings**: Overall, folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the stroke risk by 11% (22 trials, n = 82,723; RR 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–0.96). The effect was greater in low folate regions (2 trials, n = 24,020; Asia, 0.78, 0.67–0.90) compared to high folate regions (7 trials, n = 14,655; America, 1.05, 0.90–1.23), and among patients without folic acid fortification (11 trials, n = 49,957; 0.85; 0.77–0.94) compared with those with folic acid fortification (7 trials, n = 14,655; 1.05, 0.90–1.23). In further stratified analyses among trials without folic acid fortification, a larger beneficial effect was found in those trials that used a low dosage of folic acid (≤ 0.8 mg: 0.78, 0.69–0.88) or low baseline vitamin B12 levels (< 384 pg/mL: 0.78, 0.68–0.89). In the corresponding comparison groups, the effect sizes were attenuated and insignificant (p for interaction < 0.05 for both). Although the interaction tests were not significant, there might be a higher benefit in trials with a low dosage of vitamin B12, a low prevalence of statin use, but a high prevalence of hypertension.

- **Conclusions**: Folic acid supplementation could reduce the stroke risk in regions without folic acid fortification, particularly in individuals with specific conditions such as low vitamin B12 levels and low folic acid dosage.

### Knowledge gaps in understanding the metabolic and clinical effects of excess folates/folic acid: A summary, and perspectives, from an NIH workshop [^113rku9w]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Folate, an essential nutrient found naturally in foods in a reduced form, is present in dietary supplements and fortified foods in an oxidized synthetic form (folic acid). There is widespread agreement that maintaining adequate folate status is critical to preventing diseases due to folate inadequacy, such as anemia, birth defects, and cancer. However, concerns exist regarding the potential adverse effects of excess folic acid intake and/or elevated folate status. Initially, concerns focused on the exacerbation of clinical effects of vitamin B-12 deficiency and its role in neurocognitive health. More recently, animal and observational studies have suggested potential adverse effects on cancer risk, birth outcomes, and other diseases.

Observations indicating adverse effects from excess folic acid intake, elevated folate status, and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) remain inconclusive. The data do not provide the evidence needed to affect public health recommendations. Moreover, strong biological and mechanistic premises connecting elevated folic acid intake, UMFA, and/or high folate status to adverse health outcomes are lacking. However, the body of evidence on potential adverse health outcomes indicates the need for comprehensive research to clarify these issues and bridge knowledge gaps.

Three key research questions encompass the additional research needed to establish whether high folic acid or total folate intake contributes to disease risk:

1. Does UMFA affect biological pathways leading to adverse health effects?
2. Does elevated folate status resulting from any form of folate intake contribute to disease risk?

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112rKy3Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The intervention effects of folic acid supplementation may be modified by the genetic backgrounds of specific populations. Previous genetic studies have indicated an association between the MTHFR genotype and significant differences in homocysteine reduction following the same folic acid supplementation. Participants with different MTHFR genotypes also showed significantly different cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks; however, only three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) measured the MTHFR genotypes of participants. The intervention effects of folic acid supplementation were not significant for stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), or CVD in both the Norwegian Vitamin Trial (NORVIT) and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial (WENBIT).

In a post hoc analysis combining two RCTs, Ebbing and colleagues measured the MTHFR genotype of 976 participants but did not find any significant interaction between the MTHFR genotype and the intervention. The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT) also did not find a significant interaction between the MTHFR genotype and the intervention on stroke. Nevertheless, after further stratifying the intervention effects according to the joint classification of baseline folate level and MTHFR genotype, folic acid intervention significantly reduced stroke risk in those with low folate levels and the CC or CT genotype, and in those with high baseline folate together with the TT genotype, but not among those with low folate and the TT genotype.

### Do racial and ethnic differences in serum folate values exist after food fortification with folic acid [^113yGnRQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

The United States food supply has been fortified with folic acid since 1998. However, information about folate levels early in pregnancy before the fortification remains limited. This study examined the associations between serum folate at the first prenatal visit and maternal race/ethnicity, age, vitamin use, and body mass index.

- **Study design**: This cross-sectional study assessed serum folate levels among 9,421 women who entered prenatal care in 1999 and 2000 in southern California. Information on race/ethnicity, vitamin use, weight, height, and age was obtained from surveys and birth certificates.

- **Results**: After adjustment for vitamin use, the strongest predictor of serum folate level, being in the lowest folate quartile (≤ 16 ng/mL) was independently related to being of Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander race/ethnicity, being younger in age, and being overweight or obese.

- **Conclusion**: Even after food fortification with folic acid, differences in serum folate values in pregnant women by maternal race/ethnicity, age, and body mass index persisted.

### Total folate and folic acid intake from foods and dietary supplements in the United States: 2003–2006 [^1173MaX3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

The term total folate intake is used to represent folate that occurs naturally in food as well as folic acid from fortified foods and dietary supplements. Folic acid has been referred to as a double-edged sword because of its beneficial role in the prevention of neural tube defects and yet possible deleterious effects on certain cancers and cognitive function. Previous monitoring efforts did not include folic acid from dietary supplements and are therefore not complete.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to combine data on dietary folate (as measured by two 24-hour recalls) and folic acid from dietary supplements (collected with a 30-day frequency questionnaire) with the use of the bias-corrected best power method to adjust for within-person variability.

- **Design**: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey. Linear contrasts were constructed to determine differences in dietary and total folate intake for age and racial-ethnic groups by sex; prevalence of inadequate and excessive intakes is presented.

- **Results**: In 2003–2006, 53% of the US population used dietary supplements; 34.5% used dietary supplements that contained folic acid. Total folate intake (in dietary folate equivalents) was higher for men (813 ± 14) than for women (724 ± 16) and higher for non-Hispanic whites (827 ± 19) than for Mexican Americans (615 ± 11) and non-Hispanic blacks (597 ± 12); 29% of non-Hispanic black women had inadequate intakes. Total folate and folic acid intakes are highest for those aged ≥ 50 years.

### Folate and asthma [^1174GfQx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Findings from experimental studies and animal models led to the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation during pregnancy confers an increased risk of asthma. This review provides a critical examination of experimental and epidemiologic evidence of a causal association between folate status and asthma. In industrialized nations, the prevalence of asthma was rising before widespread fortification of foodstuffs with folic acid or folate supplementation before or during pregnancy, thus suggesting that changes in folate status are an unlikely explanation for "the asthma epidemic". Consistent with this ecologic observation, evidence from human studies does not support moderate or strong effects of folate status on asthma. Given known protective effects against neural tube and cardiac defects, there is no reason to alter recommendations for folic acid supplementation during conception or pregnancy based on findings for folate and asthma. Although we believe that there are inadequate data to exclude a weak effect of maternal folate status on asthma or asthma symptoms, such effects could be examined within the context of very large (and ongoing) birth cohort studies. At this time, there is no justification for funding new studies of folate and asthma.

### Laboratory assessment of folate (vitamin B) status [^115G5SbB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Folate (vitamin B9) plays a crucial role in fundamental cellular processes, including nucleic acid biosynthesis, methyl group biogenesis, and amino acid metabolism. The detection and correction of folate deficiency prevent megaloblastic anaemia and reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Coexisting deficiencies of folate and vitamin B12 are associated with cognitive decline, depression, and neuropathy. Folate deficiency and excess have also been implicated in some cancers. Excessive exposure to folic acid, a synthetic compound used in supplements and fortified foods, has been linked to adverse health effects.

- **Laboratory markers**:
	- Of at least three distinct laboratory markers of folate status, the total abundance of folate in serum/plasma is used by the majority of laboratories.
	- The analysis of folate in red cells is also commonly performed. Since the folate content of red cells is fixed during erythropoiesis, this marker indicates folate status over the preceding ~4 months.
	- Poor stability, variation in polyglutamate chain length, and unreliable extraction from red cells make the analysis of folate challenging.

The clinical use of measuring specific folate species has also been explored. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, the main form of folate found in blood, is essential for the vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase mediated remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. As such, homocysteine measurement reflects cellular folate and vitamin B12 use. When interpreting homocysteine results, specific reference ranges according to age, sex, and pregnancy should be applied.

### Abnormal folate metabolism in foetuses affected by neural tube defects [^1116Efun]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

Folic acid supplementation can prevent many cases of neural tube defects (NTDs), whereas suboptimal maternal folate status is a risk factor, suggesting that folate metabolism is a key determinant of susceptibility to NTDs. Despite extensive genetic analysis of folate cycle enzymes and quantification of metabolites in maternal blood, neither the protective mechanism nor the relationship between maternal folate status and susceptibility are understood in most cases.

In order to investigate potential abnormalities in folate metabolism in the embryo itself, we derived primary fibroblastic cell lines from foetuses affected by NTDs and subjected them to the dU suppression test, a sensitive metabolic test of folate metabolism. Significantly, a subset of NTD cases exhibited low scores in this test, indicative of abnormalities in folate cycling that may be causally linked to the defect. Susceptibility to NTDs may be increased by suppression of the methylation cycle, which is interlinked with the folate cycle. However, reduced efficacy in the dU suppression test was not associated with altered abundance of the methylation cycle intermediates, S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, suggesting that a methylation cycle defect is unlikely to be responsible for the observed abnormality of folate metabolism.

Genotyping of samples for known polymorphisms in genes encoding folate-associated enzymes did not reveal any correlation between specific genotypes and the observed abnormalities in folate metabolism. These data suggest that, as yet, unrecognized genetic variants result in embryonic abnormalities in folate metabolism.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^117NtMEi]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

While no studies have compared iron with different weekly folic acid doses on RBC folate, weekly dosing has been compared with daily supplementation in at least two trials. Unsurprisingly, daily dosing is more effective than weekly at increasing blood folate indices. Among New Zealand women (18–40 years), daily supplementation with 0.4 mg folic acid was more effective than 2.8 mg weekly at increasing RBC folate after 12 weeks (MD (95% CI) 411 (325 to 504) and 265 (192 to 345) nmol/L, respectively) compared with the 0 mg group. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that 2.8 mg folic acid weekly would still be expected to decrease NTD risk. Moreover, in the New Zealand study, over half of the women taking the weekly folic acid supplement achieved an RBC folate concentration associated with a low risk of NTD at week 12 compared with nearly three-quarters in the daily 0.4 mg group. Compared with their respective placebo groups, the MD in RBC folate among women receiving 2.8 mg folic acid weekly in the New Zealand study was not as great as the difference reported in our study (MD 265 vs 355 nmol/L). The greater difference in mean RBC folate observed in our study may be due to the longer duration of our study compared with the New Zealand study (16 vs 12 weeks), as baseline RBC folate concentrations were similar after calibrator adjustment.

### Guideline: Optimal serum and red blood cell folate concentrations in women of reproductive age for prevention of neural tube defects [^113dxFX9]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for myelomeningocele, specifically in relation to periconceptional folic acid supplementation, the WHO 2015 guidelines recommend aiming for RBC folate concentrations greater than 400 ng/mL (906 nmol/L) in females of reproductive age. This level is suggested to achieve the greatest reduction of neural tube defects at the population level.

Consider using this threshold as an indicator of folate insufficiency in females of reproductive age. It is important to note that this threshold should be applied only at the population level, as low folate concentrations cannot explain all cases of neural tube defects and cannot predict the individual risk of having a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy.

### Folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects: US Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^112bXHkk]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for folate deficiency, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, USPSTF 2023 guidelines recommend that folic acid supplementation of 400–800 mcg/day be offered to all individuals planning to or who could become pregnant, to prevent fetal neural tube defects.

### Total folate and folic acid intakes from foods and dietary supplements of US children aged 1–13 y [^1126Y1cm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). High credibility.

Total folate intake includes naturally occurring food folate and folic acid from fortified foods and dietary supplements. Recent reports have focused on total folate intakes of persons aged ≥ 14 years; however, information on total folate intakes of young children is limited.

- **Objective**: The objective was to compute total folate and total folic acid intakes of US children aged 1–13 years by using a statistical method that adjusts for within-person variability and to compare these intakes with the Dietary Reference Intake guidelines for adequacy and excess.

- **Design**: Data from the 2003–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey, were analyzed. Total folate intakes were derived by combining intakes of food folate (naturally occurring and folic acid from fortified foods) based on 24-hour dietary recall results and folic acid intakes from dietary supplements based on a 30-day questionnaire.

- **Results**: More than 95% of US children consumed at least the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for folate from foods alone. More than one-third (35%) of US children aged 1–13 years used dietary supplements, and 28% used dietary supplements containing folic acid. Supplement users had significantly higher total folate and folic acid intakes than nonusers. More than half (53%) of dietary supplement users exceeded the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for total folic acid (fortified food + supplements), compared with 5% of nonusers.

- **Conclusions**: Total folate intakes of most US children aged 1–13 years meet the EAR.

### Guideline: Optimal serum and red blood cell folate concentrations in women of reproductive age for prevention of neural tube defects [^111QkY3C]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for myelomeningocele, specifically in relation to periconceptional folic acid supplementation, the WHO 2015 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal serum folate threshold for the prevention of neural tube defects in females of reproductive age at the population level.

### Folic acid for the prevention of colorectal adenomas: a randomized clinical trial [^115QJ2cX]. JAMA (2007). High credibility.

Laboratory and epidemiological data suggest that folic acid may have an antineoplastic effect in the large intestine. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of folic acid supplementation for preventing colorectal adenomas.

The research was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-factor, phase 3, randomized clinical trial conducted at 9 clinical centers between July 6, 1994, and October 1, 2004. Participants included 1,021 men and women with a recent history of colorectal adenomas and no previous invasive large intestine carcinoma.

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 mg/d of folic acid (n = 516) or placebo (n = 505) and were separately randomized to receive aspirin (81 or 325 mg/d) or placebo. Follow-up consisted of two colonoscopic surveillance cycles: the first interval was at 3 years, and the second was at 3 or 5 years later.

The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of at least one colorectal adenoma. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of advanced lesions (≥ 25% villous features, high-grade dysplasia, size ≥ 1 cm, or invasive cancer) and adenoma multiplicity (0, 1–2, or ≥ 3 adenomas).

During the first 3 years, 987 participants (96.7%) underwent colonoscopic follow-up. The incidence of at least one colorectal adenoma was 44.1% for folic acid (n = 221) and 42.4% for placebo (n = 206) [unadjusted risk ratio (RR), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90–1.20; p = 0.58]. The incidence of at least one advanced lesion was 11.4% for folic acid (n = 57) and 8.6% for placebo (n = 43).

### Folate, vitamin B12, one carbon metabolism and the nervous system: Excess folic acid is potentially harmful [^1126ZCtY]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Low credibility.

Folate, vitamin B12, and one carbon metabolism are fundamental to genetics, epigenetics, and nervous system development, as well as brain health at all ages. While the neuropsychiatric complications of both deficiency and inborn errors of folate and vitamin B12 are well documented, there has been controversy regarding whether excess folic acid is harmful to the nervous system, particularly when coupled with vitamin B12 deficiency. There is now substantial and consistent clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence indicating that excess folic acid is potentially harmful to the nervous system. Recent experimental evidence corroborates that both folate deficiency and excess impair cortical neurogenesis, with the greatest impact observed when vitamin B12 deficiency is combined with excess folic acid.

Excess folic acid increases the demand for vitamin B12, thereby aggravating the block in the folate cycle caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. Maintaining the balance between folate and vitamin B12 is crucial for methylation, genetics, and epigenetics. Both folate deficiency and excess can impair cellular differentiation and nervous system development through gene hypomethylation or hypermethylation. In countries with folic acid fortification policies, many individuals are exposed to excess folate, and the long-term genetic, epigenetic, and transgenerational implications are yet to be clarified. The safe upper limit of folic acid should be reconsidered concerning the vitamin B12 status of individuals and populations. The combination of a natural folate together with vitamin B12 would greatly enhance benefits and reduce harms.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114TgdkF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, we found a modest benefit of a 10% reduced risk of stroke with folic acid supplementation compared with the control group. Folic acid supplementation also showed a small but significant benefit, or 4% less risk, of overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, with significant heterogeneity according to baseline folate levels, preexisting diseases, or the extent of homocysteine reduction. No significant benefit or harm of folic acid supplementation on the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) was found.

- **Comparison with other meta-analyses or reviews**: Compared with the most recent systematic reviews of folic acid supplementation and CVD risk, we included three new trials published during the 2013–2015 period and conducted in four countries with 22,510 more participants. Consequently, our comprehensive meta-analysis summarized the most up-to-date evidence. In addition, different from previous meta-analyses, we included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of folic acid supplementation and CVD without restrictions on the study sample size, treatment period, or preexisting disease status. However, we conducted stratified analyses to fully consider the impact of these factors on the intervention effect.

Folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 18% in a meta-analysis in 2007 based on eight RCTs with at least 10 stroke cases in each group and at least six months of follow-up. After that, with more RCTs published, 10 more meta-analyses of folic acid supplementation and risk of stroke were published with different inclusion criteria.

### Determining bioavailability of food folates in a controlled intervention study [^112wmagr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

The concept of dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) in the United States recognizes the differences in bioavailability between natural food folates and the synthetic vitamin, folic acid. However, many published reports on folate bioavailability are problematic because of several confounding factors.

- **Objective**: We compared the bioavailability of food folates with that of folic acid under controlled conditions. To broadly represent the extent to which natural folates are conjugated in foods, we used two natural sources of folate: spinach (50% polyglutamyl folate) and yeast (100% polyglutamyl folate).

- **Design**: Ninety-six men were randomly assigned, according to their screening plasma homocysteine (tHcy) concentration, to one of four treatment groups for an intervention period of 30 days. Each subject received (daily under supervision) either a folate-depleted "carrier" meal or a drink plus one of the following: a placebo tablet, 200 micrograms of folic acid in a tablet, 200 micrograms of natural folate provided as spinach, or 200 micrograms of natural folate provided as yeast.

- **Results**: Among the subjects who completed the intervention, responses (increase in serum folate, lowering of tHcy) relative to those in the placebo group (n = 18) were significant in the folic acid group (n = 18) but not in the yeast folate (n = 19) or the spinach folate (n = 18) groups. Both natural sources of folate were significantly less bioavailable than folic acid. Overall estimations of folate bioavailability relative to that of folic acid were found to be between 30% (spinach) and 59% (yeast).

### Effects of maternal folic acid supplementation during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy on neurocognitive development in the child: an 11-year follow-up from a randomised controlled trial [^113WoeXx]. BMC Medicine (2021). High credibility.

In summary, our findings in the children of participants in a randomised trial in pregnancy add considerably to the existing evidence from observational studies that have linked maternal folate status in pregnancy with neurocognitive outcomes in the child. We examined the effect of FA intervention in trimesters 2 and 3 of pregnancy (in women taking FA as recommended in the first trimester) and provide the first randomised trial evidence that continued FA supplementation (400 μg/day) throughout pregnancy can influence cognitive performance and brain function of the child up to 11 years of age.

In addition to using standardised IQ tests to measure child cognition, we applied magnetoencephalographic brain imaging for the first time in a study of this kind. The findings not only reinforce our previous findings of cognitive benefits in these children at 3 and 7 years but provide new evidence of a specific role of prenatal FA in semantic processing of language. The totality of evidence has important impacts in informing new policy and clinical practice in relation to FA use in pregnancy.

Whereas recommendations for NTD prevention in the UK and most countries worldwide advise mothers to take FA supplements from before conceiving until the end of the 12th gestational week only, our findings suggest that continued FA intervention in pregnancy beyond the early period required to prevent NTD is beneficial to neurocognitive development in the child. In a wider context, we demonstrate the application of MEG as a non-invasive tool in paediatric research.
