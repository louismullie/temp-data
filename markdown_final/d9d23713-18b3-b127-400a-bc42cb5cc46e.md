## Question

Tobradex in 9 months old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Tobradex (tobramycin/dexamethasone) is appropriate for a 9-month-old infant and, if so, how to dose, monitor, and what alternatives to consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled pediatric status and what "not established" means in practice. Then, I should verify the specific risks of topical steroids in infants, especially IOP effects and delayed healing. Next, I will review any pediatric data for the components and consider whether any off-label pediatric use is supported. After that, I should outline a cautious, indication-specific approach if use is unavoidable, including dosing, duration, and monitoring. Finally, I will consider safer alternatives and summarize a risk–benefit recommendation with clear guardrails.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because that frames everything. The FDA labeling for Tobradex ST states that safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 2 years have not been established, which means there is no approved indication and no pediatric-specific dosing or safety data provided by the manufacturer for infants, including a 9-month-old [^6a07e222] [^afb3fed7].

> Wait, let me verify what "not established" implies clinically. It does not automatically mean contraindicated; it means there is insufficient evidence to support routine use, and any use would be off-label and should be justified by a compelling indication and close monitoring, with explicit informed consent and documentation of rationale, especially given infant vulnerability to steroid-related ocular complications [^6a07e222] [^f18b9453].

> I need to check the key risks of topical steroids in infants. Prolonged or inappropriate steroid exposure can cause steroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation and glaucoma, posterior subcapsular cataract, and delayed corneal healing; these risks are real and can be vision-threatening, and they are magnified in infants whose ocular structures and IOP dynamics differ from adults, so even short courses warrant caution and follow-up [^3105470b] [^507137b6] [^82d25942].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the antibiotic component. I initially thought tobramycin ophthalmic solution is labeled down to 2 months, but wait, I should double-check that. The tobramycin ophthalmic solution labeling indicates safety and effectiveness in children but notes that safety and effectiveness below 2 months have not been established, so for a 9-month-old, the antibiotic alone has pediatric precedent, though not specifically for the combination product or for infants under 2 months [^ac0b370e] [^190f0afc].

> Next, I should review whether any pediatric data exist for the combination. I do not find pediatric clinical trials of Tobradex in infants; the pediatric evidence base for tobramycin ophthalmic drops supports use in children, and azithromycin 1.5% has pediatric data showing noninferiority to tobramycin in bacterial conjunctivitis with better early cure and simpler dosing, but neither dataset validates the steroid–antibiotic combination in infants, reinforcing that any Tobradex use in a 9-month-old remains off-label and unsupported by pediatric trials [^ac0b370e] [^5073bef3] [^f5471db0].

> Let me consider scenarios where use might still be reasonable despite the lack of pediatric data. If a 9-month-old has a severe mixed anterior segment inflammation with documented bacterial infection or high suspicion where the anti-infective and anti-inflammatory effects are both urgently needed, a short, closely supervised course may be justified; however, I should confirm that alternatives have been considered and that the infant will have reliable follow-up for IOP checks and clinical reassessment within 48–72 hours if not improving [^3105470b] [^5bc6f566].

> I should confirm dosing pragmatics if, after shared decision-making, use is unavoidable. The adult labeled regimen is 1 drop every 4–6 hours, with possible increase to every 2 hours for 24–48 hours in severe cases, then taper; for an infant, I would use the lowest effective frequency, target 5–7 days total when possible, and avoid prolonged therapy, with explicit caregiver instructions on administration technique and contamination avoidance, and a plan to stop if no improvement in 48 hours [^5bc6f566] [^143b2762].

> But wait, what if we can avoid steroids altogether. For bacterial conjunctivitis, azithromycin 1.5% twice daily for 3 days achieves high cure rates with simpler dosing and has pediatric data down to young infants, which can reduce steroid exposure; for inflammation without infection, a preservative-free topical steroid such as dexamethasone 0.1% may be considered short term if infection is excluded, with careful IOP monitoring; for blepharitis or meibomian disease, nonsteroidal options and lid hygiene are preferred first-line in children to minimize steroid risks [^5073bef3] [^f5471db0] [^77d64e7e] [^b12ecab9].

> I should double-check monitoring requirements if steroids are used. If treatment extends to 10 days or more, IOP should be checked, recognizing this is challenging in infants; practically, many clinicians arrange reassessment within 1–2 weeks and sooner if symptoms persist, with explicit return precautions for pain, photophobia, corneal clouding, or behavior changes suggesting discomfort or vision problems [^3105470b] [^5bc6f566].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure the recommendation is balanced. Given the absence of pediatric safety or efficacy data for Tobradex in infants and the meaningful risks of steroid-induced IOP elevation, cataract, and delayed healing, routine use in a 9-month-old is not recommended; reserve it for exceptional cases where the combined antibiotic–steroid is clearly indicated and alternatives are inadequate, use the shortest effective course with the lowest frequency, and ensure close ophthalmic follow-up with documented informed consent [^6a07e222] [^3105470b] [^f18b9453].

---

Tobradex (tobramycin/dexamethasone) is **not recommended for routine use** in a 9-month-old because safety and effectiveness are not established in children under 2 years [^6a07e222] [^afb3fed7]. If absolutely necessary, use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration (≤ 7 days) with close follow-up. Monitor for steroid-related adverse effects, especially intraocular pressure elevation [^3105470b], and discontinue if no improvement within 48 hours [^5bc6f566]. Consider safer alternatives such as tobramycin alone [^ac0b370e] or azithromycin for bacterial conjunctivitis [^5073bef3] [^f5471db0].

## Clinical considerations for tobradex use in infants

### Safety and efficacy

- **Lack of pediatric data**: Safety and effectiveness in children under 2 years are not established [^6a07e222] [^afb3fed7].
- **Steroid risks**: Prolonged steroid use can cause elevated intraocular pressure, glaucoma, cataracts, and delayed healing [^3105470b] [^507137b6].
- **Aminoglycoside sensitivity**: Rare hypersensitivity or local toxicity can occur [^507137b6] [^3105470b].

---

### Indications and dosing

- **Indications**: Reserved for severe bacterial conjunctivitis with significant inflammation when benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosing**: If used, 1 drop every 4–6 hours; during the first 24–48 hours, may increase to every 2 hours, then taper as improves [^5bc6f566].
- **Duration**: Limit to ≤ 7 days; reassess at 48 hours if no improvement [^5bc6f566].

---

### Monitoring and precautions

- **Intraocular pressure**: Monitor if treatment extends beyond 10 days or if symptoms persist [^3105470b].
- **Infection risk**: Watch for secondary infections, especially fungal or viral, which steroids can mask or worsen [^3105470b] [^5ab6b1b6].
- **Discontinuation**: Stop if no improvement in 48 hours or if adverse effects occur [^5bc6f566].

---

## Alternative treatments

Consider **safer alternatives** when appropriate:

| **Condition** | **Recommended alternative** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Bacterial conjunctivitis | Tobramycin ophthalmic solution alone [^ac0b370e] | Established safety in children; avoid steroid risks |
| Bacterial conjunctivitis (short course) | Azithromycin 1.5% ophthalmic solution [^5073bef3] [^f5471db0] | Effective with shorter, less frequent dosing; good pediatric safety |
| Inflammation without infection | Preservative-free dexamethasone 0.1% [^77d64e7e] | Lower steroid exposure; monitor closely |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Use **clinical judgment** and reserve Tobradex for severe cases when alternatives are inadequate. Prefer single-agent antibiotics or nonsteroidal options when possible, and monitor closely for adverse effects with any steroid-containing drop in infants [^f18b9453].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Avoid routine use**: Not recommended in 9-month-olds due to lack of data and steroid risks [^6a07e222] [^afb3fed7].
- **If necessary**: Use the lowest dose for ≤ 7 days with close follow-up.
- **Monitor**: Watch for IOP elevation, infection, and delayed healing [^3105470b] [^507137b6].
- **Alternatives**: Prefer tobramycin alone or azithromycin for bacterial conjunctivitis; use preservative-free dexamethasone only if steroid is essential [^ac0b370e] [^5073bef3] [^77d64e7e].

Tobradex should be **avoided in infants** unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, with careful monitoring and a plan to minimize exposure.

5.1 Intraocular Pressure Increase

Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure (IOP) should be monitored.

5.2 Aminoglycoside Sensitivity

Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur.

5.3 Cataracts

Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation.

5.4 Delayed Healing

The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.

5.5 Bacterial Infections

Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be reevaluated.

5.6 Viral Infections

Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).

5.7 Fungal Infections

Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use.

5.8 Vision Blurred

Vision may be temporarily blurred following dosing with TOBRADEX ST. Care should be exercised in operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.

5.9 Risk of Contamination

Do not touch the dropper tip of the bottle to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents.

5.10 Contact Lens Use

TOBRADEX ST contains benzalkonium chloride, an antimicrobial preservative, that may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of TOBRADEX ST.

### Is it necessary to use tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment prophylactically in eyes at the end of intraocular surgery? [^bedbd503]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Of course, the present study has limitations. The sample size was relatively small and from a single hospital. Only one doctor systematically used the tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment at the end of intraocular surgery, while the others did not, probably introducing some bias. Nevertheless, the entire preoperative and intraoperative disinfection protocol is the same for all surgeons. Finally, the occurrence of endophthalmitis events was very low, preventing any analysis of the factors associated with the occurrence of endophthalmitis.

In conclusion, using tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment did not decrease the risk of endophthalmitis after intraocular surgery, although there was not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it is better not to use topical antibiotics (such as other kinds of antibiotic eye drops or ointment) at the end of intraocular surgery. Considering antibiotics resistance, surgical treatment specifications, side effects of the ointment, increased eye secretions, uncomfortable feeling, and cost burden, we suggest that it is not necessary to use tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment prophylactically at the end of intraocular surgery, but prospective trials will be necessary to confirm those results. In the future study we plan to perform the large sample randomized controlled trial with a non-inferiority design to confirm our conclusion.

Conclusions

We did not observe a statistically significant difference in the incidence of endophthalmitis in patients with or without prophylactic tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment. And tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment seemed to increase some side effects such as eye secretions increasing and foreign body feeling.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs, which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available.

The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin (TOBREX®) are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including eye pain, eyelids pruritus, eyelid edema, and conjunctival hyperemia. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients.

The reactions due to the steroid component are: increased IOP with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve disorder; subcapsular cataract; and impaired healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.4)].

The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.

Non-ocular adverse events occurring at an incidence of 0.5% to 1% included headache and increased blood pressure.

The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with the individual components below:

Aminoglycosides: Neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness in patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, because of their potential effect on neuromuscular function.

Dexamethasone: Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after use of dexamethasone in excess of the listed dosing instructions in predisposed patients, including children and patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TOBRADEX ST. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Additional adverse reactions identified from postapproval use include, anaphylactic reaction, and erythema multiforme.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in 2 groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to human doses of 16 and 32 mg/kg/day, respectively) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism. TOBRADEX ST ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TOBRADEX ST is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

### Tobramycin ophthalmic solution [^ac0b370e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Tobramycin ophthalmic solution, 0.3% is a topical antibiotic indicated in the treatment of external infections of the eye and its adnexa caused by susceptible bacteria. Appropriate monitoring of bacterial response to topical antibiotic therapy should accompany the use of tobramycin ophthalmic solution. Clinical studies have shown tobramycin to be safe and effective for use in children.

### Is it necessary to use tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment prophylactically in eyes at the end of intraocular surgery? [^0cec568d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative treatment

The preoperative examinations included slit lamp biomicroscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, visual electrophysiology, corneal endothelium counting, optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasound biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement.

For the patients who did not receive tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment, the surgeries were performed by the experienced surgeons (supplemental Table 1). In contrast, for the patients who received tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment at the end of surgery, the surgeries were performed by the same experienced surgeons from the Department of Ophthalmology of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital (supplemental Table 1). At the end of surgery, 1–1.5-cm-long of tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment (Alcon-Couvreur SA, Puurs, Belgium) was applied in the conjunctival sac.

The preparation before surgery was standardized for all cases, including using antibiotic eye drops four times per day for at least 3 days before surgery. The patient's eyelashes were cut before pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). The iodine wipe area included the eyelids and adjacent skin on the nose, cheek, forehead, and temporal area. The head was wrapped in a sterilized cloth and the patient was covered with a sterilized sheet. It was worth noting that povidone iodine was used for conjunctival sac disinfection during surgery. All patients underwent standard surgery by the same team of surgeons. After surgery, the patients returned to the ward. The patients only treated with tobramycin-dexamethasone four times per day for a week. No other types of antibiotics were used intraoperatively for any patients.

Follow-up

At our center, ophthalmology examinations are routinely carried out at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after surgery, including visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, direct ophthalmoscopy, and intraocular pressure and the forward reaction were recorded. The complaints of patients after the surgery were also recorded it. After discharge, the patients are followed once a year or if needed.

Results

Characteristics of the patients/eyes

The eye ointment group was composed of 997 males and 1400 females, with a mean age of 62.6 ± 13.4 years (Table 1). The non-ointment group was composed of 725 males and 689 females, with a mean age of 64.9 ± 14.9 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age (P = 0.505). The eye ointment treatment group included 1305 eyes treated for cataract, 535 eyes treated with vitrectomy, and 557 eyes treated for glaucoma. The non-ointment treatment group included 669 eyes treated for cataract, 343 eyes treated with vitrectomy, and 402 eyes treated for glaucoma.

Endophthalmitis occurrence

The mean follow-up was 2.2 years (range, 1 to 4 years). Three patients suffered postoperative endophthalmitis (Table 2), and all of them were in the eye ointment group (3/2397, 0.13%) and were with a primary diagnosis of cataract and glaucoma. The diagnosis of endophthalmitis was standard and included obvious pain, a sudden drop in vision and increased conjunctival sac secretions, as well as vitreous cavity turbidity and anterior chamber empyema as evidenced on B-mode ultrasonography. These three patients with endophthalmitis were followed for 3 years. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative endophthalmitis between the eye ointment group and the non-ointment group (P = 0.184).

Table 2
Anterior chamber reaction and patient complaints

As shown in Table 2, the anterior chamber reactions 1 day after surgery were more serious in the eye ointment group compared with the non-ointment group (all P < 0.05). Consequently, patient complaints such as increased eye secretions and a foreign body feeling were more frequent postoperatively in the eye ointment group (all P < 0.05), but there were no statistically significant differences at 1 month postoperatively (all P > 0.05).

Eye ointment tube contamination

The tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment was collected after opening the tube and cultured for bacterial contamination. The contamination rate was 0% at all time points over 7 days.

Background

There are no data available regarding the complications associated with using antibiotic ointment at the end of intraocular surgery. This study aimed to explore the necessity of using ocular tobramycin-dexamethasone prophylactically at the end of intraocular surgery.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who received intraocular surgery at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017. The patients were grouped according to whether they received tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment or not after surgery. The Tobramycin dexamethasone eye ointment was sampled to observe bacterial contamination pathogens at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 6, 8, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 168 h after being opened.

Results

A total of 3811 eyes in 3811 patients (mean age of 63 ± 12 years) were included: 2397 eyes that received prophylactic tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment and 1414 eyes that did not. The overall rate of endophthalmitis was 0.08% (3/3811) in our study, all in the eye ointment group (0.12%, 3/2397); no patients developed endophthalmitis in the non-ointment group (0%, 0/1414)(P = 0.184). The anterior chamber reactions 1 day after surgery were more serious in the eye ointment group compared with the non-ointment group (all P < 0.05), but there were no statistically significant differences at 1 month postoperatively (all P > 0.05). The contamination rate was 0% at all time points over 7 days.

Conclusion

We did not observe a statistically significant difference in the incidence of endophthalmitis in patients with or without prophylactic tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment. And tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment seemed to increase some side effects such as eye secretions increasing and foreign body feeling.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. TOBRADEX ST ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to human doses of 8 and 16 mg/kg/day, at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than the topical ocular dose).

General: The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.

Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.

Information for Patients: Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day.

Pregnancy: Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism.

Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.

### Is it necessary to use tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment prophylactically in eyes at the end of intraocular surgery? [^36d6a1d3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

High-quality evidence about preoperative antibiotics for the prevention of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery has been reported in the Cochrane Library, offering different suggestions about the use of topical antibiotics. One report showed that an injection of cefuroxime with or without topical levofloxacin can decrease the chance of endophthalmitis after surgery. Another suggested that the use of antibiotic eye drops in addition to an antibiotic injection reduced the chance of endophthalmitis compared with using an injection or eye drops alone. Therefore, it is questionable whether to use topical antibiotics prophylactically. Topical antibiotics used before or after an ocular surgery for avoiding endophthalmitis are controversial, as harmful effects have been highlighted with the use of topical antibiotics, such as increased antibiotics resistance.

Prophylactic antibiotic use in intraocular surgery has rarely been reported, and is usually discussed in injection surgery. The reported rate of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery and intravitreal injections was 0.07–0.4% and 0.038–0.065%, respectively. Surgical risk factors associated with endophthalmitis after PPV include inadequate wound closure, a postoperative hypotonic state, vitreous incarceration at a sclerotomy site, and aqueous intraocular tamponade. The related factors for antibiotic regimens are training (60.1%) and personal experience (58.1%), which was reported by a survey study that comprised 782 oculoplastic surgeons in 43 countries. The occurrence of endophthalmitis is often related to the patients' own condition; patients who are immunocompromised or taking preoperative topical steroids often have an elevated risk of endophthalmitis after PPV.

To date, few clinical studies have focused on bacterial detection by culturing the tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment tube after it was opened. The present study provides a chronological report of the pathogens in the eye ointment tube after being opened. All tested samples over 7 days were negative, but it cannot be ruled out that there are bacteria in tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment after being opened. A detection rate of positive bacteria in eye ointment of 30–50% has been reported by several studies. Therefore, another implication of the present study is that doctors should be cautious regarding the use of tobramycin-dexamethasone eye ointment at the end of intraocular surgery, as well as the consequence of increasing the risk of endophthalmitis after surgery. In the future, attention should be paid to the cautious use of antibiotic eye drops at the end of intraocular surgery.

### Efficacy of adding sodium hyaluronate eye drops to tobramycin and dexamethasone in the treatment of post-cataract surgery dry eye disease: a retrospective analysis and prospective questionnaire assessment [^6b81e7f6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our investigation into the management of post-phacoemulsification DED has yielded substantial insights. The integration of sodium hyaluronate eye drops with tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, demonstrating markedly superior efficacy outcomes when compared to the use of tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops alone.

The observed enhancements encompassed various facets of treatment response, including a higher percentage of cure, elevated levels of high effectiveness, and a notable decrease in the percentage of ineffectiveness. This signifies not only the immediate impact on DED symptoms but also hints at the potential for long-term benefits. Continued research, including larger-scale randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-ups, will be pivotal in further validating these results and elucidating the nuanced mechanisms underlying the observed improvements.

### Steroid-induced glaucoma: an avoidable cause of irreversible blindness [^82d25942]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his 70s on regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist for 10 years presented with blurry vision in his right eye for 4days. He was diagnosed with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) bilaterally 18 months earlier and treated with antiglaucoma eye-drops. On direct questioning, he admitted to using fixed combination tobramycin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% eye-drops frequently to relieve ocular redness and discomfort in both eyes for 3.5 years without his ophthalmologist's knowledge. Examination disclosed markedly elevated IOP, advanced optic disc cupping and tunnel vision due to steroid-induced glaucoma bilaterally. After cessation of the eye-drops and 2weeks of antiglaucoma therapy, his IOP returned to normal and his visual field remained stable for 4years. Our case highlights the danger of habitual self-treatment of prescription medications containing corticosteroids and the importance of taking a detailed medication history in the diagnosis and management of steroid-induced glaucoma.

### Efficacy of adding sodium hyaluronate eye drops to tobramycin and dexamethasone in the treatment of post-cataract surgery dry eye disease: a retrospective analysis and prospective questionnaire assessment [^0feca9b0]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of using a combination of antibiotic and corticosteroid eye drops to using the same combination in addition to sodium hyaluronate eye drops.

Patients and Methods

This study included patients who underwent phacoemulsification for age-related cataract and presented to the ophthalmology department or outpatient clinic of the two hospitals in the study with DED during the period from January 2020 to January 2023. The study involved a two-pronged approach in which we retrospectively analyzed the prospectively maintained data of the patients and prospectively called the patients for an evaluation of the dry eye impact on vision-related function. The study patients were recruited from two hospitals. During the study period, patients who were treated with a combination of antibiotic and corticosteroid eye drops were enrolled in Group A, and those who were treated with the same combination with sodium hyaluronate eye drops were enrolled in Group B.

Results

The present study included 143 patients with post-phacoemulsification DED. Group A included 70 patients, and Group B included 73 patients. There was statistically significant improvement 4 weeks after treatment (p < 0.05) in the two groups. Comparing the two groups showed statistically significant improvements in group B compared to group A (p < 0.05). Assessment of the overall efficacy outcome revealed a statistically significant high percentage of cure (35.6% vs 1.4%) and high effectiveness (42.5% vs 13.6%) and a low percentage of effectiveness (21.9% vs 74.3%) and ineffectiveness (0.0% vs 5.7%) in Group B compared to Group A (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Combining sodium hyaluronate eye drops with tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops yielded obviously better efficacy outcomes compared to using tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops alone.

### Appropriate dose of intravitreal ranibizumab for ROP: a retrospective study [^281d13f2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Research method

We retrospectively studied the ROP patients who underwent intravitreal injection of ranibizumab between January 2014 and May 2020 in the Department of Neonatology, Hainan General Hospital and the patients were followed up till the corrected age of 50 weeks or the retinal vessels reaching the temporal ora serrata. All 82 cases who received intravitreal injection of ranibizumab between January 2014 and August 2017 were included in the conventional-dose group. All 59 cases who received intravitreal injection of ranibizumab between September 2017 and May 2020 were included in the high-dose group.

According to the standard procedure of intravitreal injection, antibiotic eye drops (Tobramycin eye drops) should be used for 3 days before intravitreal injection. Since the patients with type 1 ROP in this study underwent the operation within 24 hours of diagnosis, they received eye drops 6–8 times the day before operation in accordance with the "Expert advice on the standardization of perioperative infection prevention measures for cataract. Intravitreal injection was performed in a sterile operating room. Before injection, proparacaine hydrochloride eye drops were used for surface anesthesia of each eye to be injected, and a 10% povidone-iodine solution was used to disinfect the skin around the eye. Then, push the drug to the dose scale of the required injection in advance. Open the eye with a blepharostat, instill 5% povidone-iodine eye drops into the conjunctival sac of the eye. After 90 seconds, the conjunctival sac was rinsed with normal saline. Next, ranibizumab was injected at 1.5 mm posterior corneal limbus. After the injection, a sterile cotton swab was used to press the top of the injection site for 1 minute. If the other eye was to be treated, all surgical instruments were replaced. After the operation, the operated eye was given tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment and covered with gauze, which was removed the day after surgery, and the operated eye was instilled with antibiotic eye drops four times a day for 3 days. On the first postoperative day, the fundus was examined under pupillary dilation using an indirect ophthalmoscope to observe whether there was central retinal artery occlusion, retinal or vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tear or detachment, or lens injury. The fundus was examined weekly in the first month after operation, once every 2 weeks in the second month, and once a month from the third month until the complete vascularization of the retina or the termination of retinal vessels in zone II or III without pathological vascular hyperplasia or retinal proliferation. The operation and follow-up examinations were performed by the same ophthalmologist.

### Netilmicin / dexamethasone fixed combination in the treatment of conjunctival inflammation [^5d6919e4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of 0.1% dexamethasone/0.3% netilmicin (Netildex), with that of 0.1% dexamethasone/0.3% tobramycin (Tobradex) in the treatment of external ocular inflammation requiring antibiotic therapy.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind study, 139 subjects with conjunctival inflammation associated with signs of ocular infection were treated with Netildex (n = 71) or Tobradex (n = 68) four times daily for 6 days. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the percentage of patients with at least a 50% decrease in conjunctival hyperemia at the endpoint visit (Day 6 [± 1]) with respect to baseline (responder rate). An equivalence margin of 20% was set for this study. A follow-up visit was performed at Day 14 (± 1). Other efficacy parameters were: conjunctival edema, conjunctival discharge, lid hyperemia, lid edema, presence of ocular infection, and symptoms of ocular discomfort. Safety evaluations included intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and adverse events.

Results

At Day 6, a decrease of conjunctival hyperemia was observed in 87.3% and 90.9% of the patients treated with Netildex and Tobradex, respectively. The 95% confidence interval for the difference between groups (-15.3 ÷ 8.0) satisfied the equivalence hypothesis. Subjects treated with Netildex had a better control of lid hyperemia (P = 0.016), tearing (P = 0.001), burning (P = 0.007), and stinging (P = 0.004). No adverse reactions were observed during the study except one case of keratitis in the Tobradex group.

Conclusion

Netildex was as effective and safe as Tobradex in reducing signs and symptoms in patients with conjunctival inflammation when ocular infection was suspected.

### Interocular anatomical and visual functional differences in pediatric patients with unilateral cataracts [^9c8f1ea2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Intraoperative and postoperative procedures

All patients underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery by two experienced cataract surgeons (Y.Z.L. and W.R.C.). General anesthesia was administered prior to surgery. After a temporal clear corneal incision was made, DuoVisc and a soft-shell technique were used to reform and stabilize the anterior chamber and protect the corneal endothelium. A 5.5–6.0 mm central continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis was created using a bent 26-gauge disposable needle. Hydro-dissection was performed using a balanced salt solution, and a standard phacoemulsification was performed to completely remove the lens. A 3-piece monofocal acrylic IOL with a 6.5-mm optic diameter (Sensar AR40e, AMO, Inc. CA, USA) was placed via in-the-bag implantation following lens removal.

Postoperative topical therapy included the administration of 0.3% tobramycin and 0.1% dexamethasone eye drops (Tobradex, Alcon Laboratories, Inc, Texas, USA) four times per day and 0.3% tobramycin and 0.1% dexamethasone eye ointment (Tobradex, Alcon Laboratories, Inc, Texas, USA) every night for 1 month.

### Comparison of topical tobramycin-dexamethasone with dexamethasone-neomycin-polymyxin and neomycin-polymyxin-gramicidin for control of inflammation after cataract surgery: results of a multicenter, prospective, three-arm, randomized, double-masked, controlled, parallel-group study [^312dc2b9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Intraocular inflammation is typically treated with a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-infective drugs. Tobramycin-dexamethasone (TD) has not been associated with any serious adverse events, indicating good tolerability.

Objective

The aims of this study were the following: (1) to demonstrate noninferiority of TD compared with dexamethasone-neomycin-polymyxin (DNP) in terms of anti-inflammatory efficacy, (2) to compare the anti-inflammatory efficacy of TD and DNP with that of a "placebo" control (antibiotic without anti-inflammatory agent), and (3) to provide additional safety data on TD.

Methods

This prospective, double-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 22 ophthalmology clinics across Europe and Brazil. Patients aged > 18 years undergoing cataract surgery were randomly assigned, in a 2:2:1 ratio, to receive tobramycin 3 mg/mL plus dexamethasone 1 mg/mL, dexamethasone 1 mg/mL plus neomycin sulfate 3500 IU/mL plus polymyxin B sulfate 6000 IU/mL, or neomycin sulfate 3500 IU/mL plus polymyxin B sulfate 7500 IU/mL plus gramicidin 20 microg/mL. All treatments were given as 1 drop instilled in the operated eye q.i.d. for 21 days. The primary efficacy end point, intraocular inflammation (determined using the sum of scores on anterior chamber cells and aqueous flare), was assessed at days 3, 8, 14, and 21 after surgery.

Results

A total of 271 patients were enrolled (158 women, 113 men; age range 42–90 years) (TD, 104 patients; DNP, 110 patients; and neomycin-polymyxin-gramicidin [NPG], 57 patients). Intraocular inflammation was similar in the TD and DNP groups at all time points. At days 8, 14, and 21, inflammation scores were significantly lower with TD than with NPG (all, P < 0.05). At day 8, the inflammation score was significantly lower with DNP than with NPG (P < 0.05). A greater number of patients receiving NPG experienced treatment-related ocular allergic reactions compared with patients receiving TD (P < 0.05). One patient receiving TD (1.0%) and 5 given NPG (9.0%) were withdrawn due to ocular allergic reactions. None of the patients experienced an increase in intraocular pressure ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline.

Conclusions

In this study of patients undergoing cataract surgery combination therapy with TD was noninferior to DNP and was well tolerated.

### Accelerated epithelium-off corneal collagen cross-linking for keratoconus: 12-month results [^1d301a05]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical Technique

Epithelium-off accelerated technique was used. The procedure was performed in the operating room under complete aseptic conditions. After topical anesthesia with benoxinate hydrochloride (Benox, EIPICO Ophthalmics, Egypt) eye drops four times 2 mins apart, a blunt spatula was used to debride the central 9 mm of the corneal epithelium. Riboflavin (0.1%solution VibeX; Avedro Inc. Waltham, MA) drops were instilled over the de-epithelized cornea four times every 2 mins. Exposure to 365 nm UVA by the Avedro's KXL ® system (Avedro Inc. Boston, MA) was performed with a total surface dose of 7.2 joules which was pulsed (1 s on, 1 s off) for 5 mins and 20 s, achieving a total delivery of 120 mWatt. A bandage contact lens was then applied.

Following the procedure, moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox, Alcon, USA) eye drops were prescribed four times daily for 1 week, lubricant eye drops (Systane, Alcon, USA) five times daily for 1 month, and tobramycin/dexamethasone combination eye drops (TobraDex, Alcon, USA) three times daily for the first 2 weeks then replaced by fluorometholone acetate (0.1%, Efemyo, Orchidia Pharmaceutical, Egypt) four times daily, which was then tapered over 2 weeks.

Postoperative Evaluation

Patients were examined from the first day postoperatively and after 1 week for assessment of corneal re-epithelization where contact lens was removed. At 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure, patients were examined according to the study protocol. UCVA, BCVA, refraction, and corneal topography and aberrations were tested and recorded at each visit starting from 3rd month postoperatively to 12th month. Data collected during follow-up periods were used for comparison with baseline preoperative values.

Data Collection And Analysis

Data were collected from 4 maps refractive analysis and Zernike analysis of corneal topography preoperatively and postoperatively for all patients. Statistical analysis was performed using a commercially available software program (SPSS 18; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Values were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Data were explored for normality using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normality. Paired (dependent) t -test was used to compare preoperative and postoperative values. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### One week of levofloxacin plus dexamethasone eye drops for cataract surgery: an innovative and rational therapeutic strategy [^7a2ed251]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cataract surgery is the most common operation performed worldwide. A fixed topical corticosteroid-antibiotic combination is usually prescribed in clinical practice for 2 or more weeks to treat post surgical inflammation and prevent infection. However, this protracted schedule may increase the incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse events and notably promote antibiotic resistance.

Methods

This International, multicentre, randomized, blinded-assessor, parallel-group clinical study evaluated the non-inferiority of 1-week levofloxacin/dexamethasone eye drops, followed by 1-week dexamethasone alone, vs. 2-week gold-standard tobramycin/dexamethasone (one drop QID for all schedules) to prevent and treat ocular inflammation and prevent infection after uncomplicated cataract surgery. Non-inferiority was defined as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) around a treatment difference > -10%. The study randomized 808 patients enrolled in 53 centres (Italy, Germany, Spain and Russia). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without anterior chamber inflammation on day 15 defined as the end of treatment. Endophthalmitis was the key secondary endpoint. This study is registered with EudraCT code: 2018-000286-36.

Results

After the end of treatment, 95.2% of the patients in the test arm vs. 94.9% of the control arm had no signs of inflammation in the anterior chamber (difference between proportions of patients = 0.028; 95% CI: -0.0275/0.0331). No case of endophthalmitis was reported. No statistically significant difference was evident in any of the other secondary endpoints. Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Non-inferiority of the new short pharmacological strategy was proven. One week of levofloxacin/dexamethasone prevents infection, ensures complete control of inflammation in almost all patients and may contain antibiotic resistance.

### Tobramycin ophthalmic solution [^190f0afc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.

Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection.

Information for Patients

Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution.

Pregnancy

Reproduction studies in 3 types of animals at doses up to 33 times the normal human systemic dose have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tobramycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from tobramycin ophthalmic solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing the infant or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months has not been established.

Geriatric Use

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

### Neomycin polymyxin b sulfates and dexamethasone [^e806bda8]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS SECTION

General

The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 20 mL should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as a slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated.

As fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term corticosteroid applications, fungal invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate.

If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored (see WARNINGS).

Prolonged use of topical anti-bacterial agents may give rise to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi.

Information for Patients:

If inflammation or pain persists longer than 48 hours or becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to discontinue use of the medication and consult a physician.

This product is sterile when packaged. To prevent contamination, care should be taken to avoid touching the bottle tip to eyelids or to any other surface. The use of this bottle by more than one person may spread infection. Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. Keep out of reach of children.

### NSAID-induced corneal melt as the first presentation of Sjögren's syndrome [^1c84e684]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A non-diabetic woman in her 80s presented 1week following uncomplicated left eye cataract surgery complaining of decreased vision, gritty sensation and photophobia in the same eye. Postoperative treatment included G. Acular (Ketorolac Tromethamine 0.5%, NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and G. Tobradex (Tobramycin 0.3% and Dexamethasone 0.1%, antibiotic and steroid, respectively) each prescribed four times a day for 2weeks. On examination, the patient had a corneal epithelial defect which progressed to a full-thickness perforation despite ceasing the NSAID drops. Cyanoacrylate glue application with a plastic drape patch failed to seal the perforation, and a full-thickness tectonic corneal transplant was performed. On investigation, the patient had positive anti-RO and anti-LA antibodies, suggesting a diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome. We advocate for careful preoperative assessment prior to cataract surgery, patient education, close follow-up and cautious medication use postoperatively including avoiding NSAID drops in patients with risk factors for postoperative dry eye disease.

### Dexamethasone-netilmicin: a new ophthalmic steroid-antibiotic combination. efficacy and safety after cataract surgery [^fc3bccc1]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate both efficacy and safety of a new ophthalmic steroid-antibiotic fixed combination containing dexamethasone and netilmicin in the postsurgical management of cataract surgery.

Methods

In total, 223 patients were randomly treated with dexamethasone 1 mg/ml plus netilmicin 3 mg/ml (n = 148), or dexamethasone 1 mg/ml plus tobramycin 3 mg/ml (n = 75, TOBRADEX) four times in a day for 7 ± 1 days starting immediately after surgery. Efficacy (anterior chamber (AC) inflammation, conjunctival hyperaemia, corneal and lid oedema, ocular infection, pain, photophobia and tearing) and safety (burning, stinging, blurred vision, intraocular pressure, and visual acuity) were analysed in the operated eye after 1 and 7 ± 1 days. A follow-up visit was performed at day 14 ± 2. The extent of AC inflammation, measured by slit-lamp according to a standard scoring system, was used as primary efficacy parameter.

Results

At the primary end point (day 7) both fixed combinations were equally effective in reducing postoperative inflammation. The safety profile of the dexamethasone/netilmicin combination was excellent with no evidence of poor local tolerance or adverse reaction.

Conclusions

A new fixed combination of dexamethasone and netilmicin was effective and safe in controlling ocular inflammation after cataract surgery.

### Effects of loteprednol / tobramycin versus dexamethasone / tobramycin on intraocular pressure in healthy volunteers [^0a6b5c44]. Cornea (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the steroid-induced intraocular pressure (IOP) and other ocular adverse effects of loteprednol etabonate 0.5% and tobramycin 0.3% ophthalmic suspension with those of dexamethasone 0.1% and tobramycin 0.3% ophthalmic suspension.

Methods

Three hundred six healthy volunteers received either loteprednol etabonate/tobramycin (n = 156) or dexamethasone/tobramycin (n = 150) at 4-hour intervals 4 times a day in both eyes for 28 days in this randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group trial. IOP, visual acuity (VA), and ocular health were assessed at all study visits (days 1, 3, 8, 15, 22, and 29), whereas undilated direct ophthalmoscopy was completed at the baseline and final visits. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed at all follow-up visits.

Results

The number of subjects experiencing IOP increases of ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline at any study visit for the loteprednol etabonate/tobramycin group (3 subjects, 1.95%) was significantly lower than that for the dexamethasone/tobramycin group (11 subjects, 7.48%; P = 0.0280), as were mean changes from baseline IOP (P < 0.05 at all visits). The lowest VA recorded for any subject at any visit was 20/40 and reductions of ≥ 2 lines at any visit were observed in 14 (4.55%) eyes for loteprednol etabonate/tobramycin and in 23 (7.82%) eyes for dexamethasone/tobramycin (P = 0.1257). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Loteprednol/tobramycin was significantly less likely to produce elevations in IOP than was dexamethasone/tobramycin in healthy subjects treated for 28 days. Both loteprednol etabonate/tobramycin and dexamethasone/tobramycin were well tolerated with low risks for systemic AEs and ocular AEs other than elevation in IOP for dexamethasone/tobramycin.

Distribution of LE/T daily dosing regimens reported among 115 treated eyes. All regimens were one drop per dose, except for one patient who received two drops BID. a "Other" (n = 5) included (all 1 drop per dose): QID X 2 weeks then BID for 2 weeks (n = 2 eyes/1 patient); every 2 hours (n = 1 eye); every one hour then taper to QID tomorrow (n = 1 eye); one drop every hour while awake today then QID starting tomorrow (n = 1 eye).

Per protocol, all 87 patients had one follow-up visit recorded; of these, 16 patients had two follow-up visits recorded. The mean time from the initial visit (when LE/T was prescribed) to first follow-up was 12 days (range, 1–72 days); the mean time from the initial visit to second follow-up was 20 days (range, 2–92 days). There were no AEs recorded. Among eyes for which IOP was recorded at both baseline and follow-up (n = 64), mean IOP (SD) at baseline was 15.2 (4.4) mm Hg. No significant changes from baseline were noted in the mean IOP at first follow-up (n = 64 eyes; mean change, −0.55 mm Hg; 95% CI: −1.481, 0.388; p = 0.25) or second follow-up (n = 8 eyes; mean change, −2.88 mm Hg; 95% CI: −7.101, 1.351; p = 0.15).

### New onset or recurrence of uveitis following COVID-19 infection [^3afcebac]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient 9 was a 31-year-old female who presented with gradual loss of vision in her left eye. It is worth noting that she was diagnosed with COVID-19 one week prior. The patient's primary COVID-19 symptoms included malaise, cough, and mild fever, and she had no significant medical history. HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis were ruled out. Complete blood count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were within normal limits. Chest X-ray was normal. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and SD-OCT examination showed no significant differences in the right eye. In the left eye, FAF revealed multiple, small, and widely distributed hyper-autofluorescent lesions in the outer retina (Fig. 2), and SD-OCT showed disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and hyper-reflective material extending through the EZ into the outer nuclear layer. FFA showed no significant lesions in the right eye, while diffuse high fluorescence of retinal lesions and optic disc fluorescence enhancement were observed in the left eye (Fig. 2). ICGA showed no significant lesions in the right eye, while multiple scattered weak fluorescence lesions were observed in the left eye (Fig. 2). These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of MEWDS, confirmed by further examinations and investigations. This patient received prednisolone acetate tablets at a daily dosage of 40 mg, which was subsequently reduced by 5 mg every four days. In addition to systemic steroid treatment, the patient received tobramycin dexamethasone eye drops four times a day for a duration of two weeks. After local and systemic steroid treatment for one month, the patient's vision improved to 1.0, and the white dot lesions in the fundus disappeared.

At the 9th day of follow-up for the right eye (in both eyes), the UDVA was 20/16, and the cornea was clear; the mean ECD of the central part increased to 1532 ± 257 cells/mm² (Fig. 3). In addition, a partial endothelial cell loss was still observed, but with a better endothelial cell morphology. IOP and vault for the right and left eyes were 16 and 13 mmHg and 1162 and 1083 μm, respectively.

The cataract surgery was performed by an experienced surgeon (Chen HC). Total US power and time was 15.05 mJ and 50.2 s with the same facility and model in case 1. Tobramycin 0.3% + dexamethasone 0.1% suspension and oral mefenamic acid 1 g were prescribed for prophylactic use and pain control. Her ECD was 2645 cells/mm² (OD) and 3067 cells/mm² (OS) 1 month before left cataract surgery which was in normal range (Fig. 3 a). Her ECD became 2659 cells/mm² (OD) and 1041 cells/mm² (OS) which was only 34.0% remained at the 1 st month after surgery (OS) (Fig. 3 b) and following ECD were 2772, 2902, 2909, 2876 cells/mm² (OD) and 1108, 1155, 1891, 2134 cells/mm² (OS) at the 4 th, 7 th, 9 th and 15 th month (Fig. 3 d-f).

### Topical administration of tacrolimus and corticosteroids in tapering doses is effective in preventing immune rejection in high-risk keratoplasty: a 5-year follow-up study [^f23a4d04]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Postoperative therapy

The treatment strategy used for systemic and topical corticosteroid therapy for all patients was consistent. During the first 5 days after the operation, all patients received intravenous methylprednisolone of 2 mg/kg/day. Then, the patients were treated with oral prednisolone, with an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day and the dose was gradually tapered over a period of 2 to 3 months. In addition, topical 1% prednisolone acetate eye drops were prescribed 4 times a day for 1 month postoperatively. Subsequently, 0.1% fluorometholone was administered 4 times daily for 6 months and then, it was replaced by 0.02% fluorometholone, which was used three times a day for at least 1 year. The combination of tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment was applied every night for 6 months and then the frequency was tapered to twice weekly. In addition, the patients were instructed to use 0.1% tacrolimus eye drops or 1% CsA eye drops 4 times a day for 1 month and then, the frequency was tapered to three times per day for 6 months and twice daily for at least 1 year (Fig. 1). For patients with dry eye disease, 0.3% sodium hyaluronate eye drops or carbomer gel was prescribed according to patient conditions.

Fig. 1
The flowchart of systemic and topical treatment strategy after high-risk keratoplasty

Antirejection therapy

The patients with transplant rejection received intravenous methylprednisolone of 2 mg/kg each day for 5 to 7 days, followed by oral prednisolone of 1 mg/kg daily and the dose was gradually tapered over a period of 1 to 2 months. For the first 3 days, tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops were given every 2 h and then tapered to 4 times daily for the next 2 to 3 weeks. Then, 0.02% fluorometholone eyedrops were administered 4 times per day. In addition, tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment was given every night for 1 month and then tapered to twice each week. At the same time, 0.1% tacrolimus eye drops or 1% CsA eye drops were used 4 times daily according to the patient's condition.

Main outcome measures

The patient history, demographic information, preoperative risk factors, onset time of immune rejection, symptoms, medication compliance, and days of interval (the time between discontinuation of the drugs and onset of immune rejection) were recorded. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure and slit-lamp examinations were performed.

### 3-day treatment with azithromycin 1.5% eye drops versus 7-day treatment with tobramycin 0.3% for purulent bacterial conjunctivitis: multicentre, randomised and controlled trial in adults and children [^73c64a47]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety of Azyter, azithromycin 1.5% eye drops, for 3 days with tobramycin 0.3% for 7 days to treat purulent bacterial conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a multicentre, randomised, investigator-masked study including 1043 children and adults with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis. Patients received either azithromycin 1.5% twice-daily for 3 days or tobramycin 0.3%, 1 drop every two hours for 2 days, then four times daily for 5 days. Clinical signs were evaluated and cultures obtained at D0, D3 and D9 (where D refers to "day"). Primary variable was the clinical cure at the Test-of-Cure (TOC)-visit (D9 ± 1), for patients with D0-positive cultures. The cure was defined as: bulbar conjunctival injection and discharge scores of 0.

Results

Among 471 patients with D0-positivity in the per protocol set, 87.8% of the azithromycin 1.5% group and 89.4% of the tobramycin group were clinically cured at the TOC-visit. Azithromycin was non-inferior to tobramycin for clinical and bacteriological cure. Clinical cure was significantly higher with azithromycin 1.5% at D3. The safety profile of azithromycin was satisfactory with a good patient and investigator's acceptability.

Conclusions

Azithromycin 1.5% for 3 days was as effective and as safe as tobramycin for 7 days. Furthermore, more azithromycin than tobramycin patients presented an early clinical cure at Day 3. Due to its twice daily dosing regimen for 3 days, azithromycin represents a step forward in the management of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis, especially in children.

### Topical corticosteroids for dry eye [^5e55a858]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dry eye disease (DED), arising from various etiologic factors, leads to tear film instability, ocular surface damage, and neurosensory changes. DED causes symptoms such as ocular dryness, burning, itching, pain, and visual impairment. Given their well-established anti-inflammatory effects, topical steroid preparations have been widely used as a short-term treatment option for DED. Because of potential risks of ocular hypertension, cataracts, and infections associated with the long-term use of topical steroids, published trials comparing the efficacy and safety of topical steroids (versus placebo) have mostly been of short duration (three to eight weeks).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids compared with no treatment, placebo, other steroidal or non-steroidal therapies, or a combination of therapies for DED.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), without restriction on language or year of publication. The date of the last search was 20 August 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which topical corticosteroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, were compared with no treatment, artificial tears (AT), vehicles, AT plus tobramycin, or cyclosporine A (CsA).

Data Collection and Analysis

We applied standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified 22 RCTs conducted in the USA, Italy, Spain, China, South Korea, and India. These RCTs reported outcome data from a total of 4169 participants with DED. Study characteristics and risk of bias All trials recruited adults aged 18 years or older, except one trial that enrolled children and adolescents aged between 3 and 14 years. Half of these trials involved predominantly female participants (median 79%, interquartile range [IQR] 76% to 80%). On average, each trial enrolled 86 participants (IQR 40 to 158). The treatment duration of topical steroids ranged between one week and three months; trial duration lasted between one week and six months. Eight trials were sponsored exclusively by industry, and four trials were co-sponsored by industry and institutional or governmental funds. We assessed the risk of bias of both subjective and objective outcomes using RoB 2, finding nearly half of the trials to be at high risk of bias associated with selective outcome reporting. Findings Of the 22 trials, 16 evaluated effects of topical steroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, as compared with lubricants (AT, vehicle), AT plus tobramycin, or no treatment. Corticosteroids probably have a small to moderate effect on improving patient-reported symptoms by 0.29 standardized mean difference (SMD) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.42) as compared with lubricants (moderate certainty evidence). Topical steroids also likely have a small to moderate effect on lowering corneal staining scores by 0.4 SMDs (95% CI 0.18 to 0.62) (moderate certainty evidence). However, steroids may increase tear film break-up time (TBUT) slightly (mean difference [MD] 0.70 s, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.34; low certainty evidence) but not tear osmolarity (MD 1.60 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -10.47 to 13.67; very low certainty evidence). Six trials examined topical steroids, either alone or in combination with CsA, against CsA alone. Low certainty evidence indicates that steroid-based interventions may have a small to moderate effect on improving participants' symptoms (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.15), but little to no effect on corneal staining scores (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.35) as compared with CsA. The effect of topical steroids compared to CsA alone on TBUT (MD 0.37 s, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.87) or tear osmolarity (MD 5.80 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -0.94 to 12.54; loteprednol etabonate alone) is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. None of the included trials reported on quality of life scores. Adverse effects The evidence for adverse ocular effects of topical corticosteroids is very uncertain. Topical corticosteroids may increase participants' risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio [RR] 5.96, 95% CI 1.30 to 27.38) as compared with lubricants. However, when compared with CsA, steroids alone or combined with CsA may decrease or increase IOP elevation (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.33). It is also uncertain whether topical steroids may increase risk of cataract formation when compared with lubricants (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.22), given the short-term use and study duration (four weeks or less) to observe longer-term adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence for the specified review outcomes was of moderate to very low certainty, mostly due to high risk of bias associated with selective results reporting. For dry eye patients whose symptoms require anti-inflammatory control, topical corticosteroids probably provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond lubricants, and may provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond CsA. However, the current evidence is less certain about the effects of steroids on improved tear film quality or quantity. The available evidence is also very uncertain regarding the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids on IOP elevation or cataract formation or progression. Future trials should generate high certainty evidence to inform physicians and patients of the optimal treatment strategies with topical corticosteroids in terms of regimen (types, formulations, dosages), duration, and its time-dependent adverse profile.

### Visual outcomes, footplate position and vault achieved with the visian implantable collamer lens for myopic astigmatism [^a10611b3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgical Protocol

The closest available lens power was chosen based on an age adjusted target postoperative hyperopic sphere, whereby the target spherical equivalent was +0.66 D for a 21 year old, linearly decreasing to plano for a 42 year old. A micro-monovision protocol was used for patients older than 45 years, where the target sphere is plano for the dominant eye and a myopic power closest to −1.50 D for the non-dominant eye after appropriate preoperative tolerance testing. The EVO+ lens was used if available for the lens power required otherwise the EVO was used. All procedures were performed monocularly with a minimum of 2 days between the first (non-dominant) and second (dominant) eye. Peribulbar anaesthesia was used for all cases. Implantation was performed through a 3.2 mm temporal incision placed according to the Verion Image Guided System, which was also used to optimize astigmatic axis alignment intraoperatively. Mydriatics were used at the end of the procedure before leaving the operating room. An immediate postoperative examination 1 hour after surgery was performed to ensure adequate intraocular pressure and sutureless wound sealing.

Postoperative Assessment

Patients were instructed to wear plastic shields while sleeping for 7 nights. Tobramycin & dexamethasone (Tobradex: Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA) and moxifloxacin (Moxivig: Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, London, UK) were applied four times daily for the first week, and moxifloxacin continued for 3 weeks for broad spectrum prophylaxis. The surgeon reviewed the patient 1 day, and 3–5 days postoperatively and an in-house optometrist examined the patient at the 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month visits. The complete set of postoperative tests and measurements performed is summarized in Table 1.

ICL central vault as well as ICL-induced anterior chamber angle dimensions were analyzed using OCT. Anterior chamber angle analysis was performed for the nasal and temporal angles (horizontal meridian). Lens haptic and footplate position was also evaluated using VHFDU. Change in endothelial cell count was performed using the SP-3000P specular microscope (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan).

### Efficacy of adding sodium hyaluronate eye drops to tobramycin and dexamethasone in the treatment of post-cataract surgery dry eye disease: a retrospective analysis and prospective questionnaire assessment [^49ff8fa2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While advancements in research, clinical practices, and technology often prioritize preventing sight-threatening complications, it is crucial not to overlook the importance of addressing and reducing less severe adverse events of cataract surgery. These events, although not sight-threatening, can greatly affect the patient's quality of life. An instance of this is dry eye disease, where the negative impacts of cataract surgery on the eye's surface can lead to the development or worsening of DED, both directly and by exacerbating any pre-existing conditions.

Patients with dry eye after cataract surgery have continuous discomfort that impairs their quality of life and hinders recovery from surgery. Tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops, being a combination of antibiotic and corticosteroid, have an anti-inflammatory effect that accelerates healing of the surgical incision and relieves the dryness symptoms. The composition of sodium hyaluronate shares key components with tears, facilitated the lubrication of the ocular surface and accelerating the adhesion of corneal epithelial cells, which helps restore the tear film's stability and alleviate the symptoms of dry eye. Nevertheless, there are scarce research studies assessing the clinical efficacy of combining sodium hyaluronate with conventional anti-inflammatory eye drops in the treatment of DED after surgery for cataract.

The present work showed that treatment in both groups resulted in significant improvement of the patients' condition, which ensured the anti-inflammatory effect of tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops. However, when sodium hyaluronate was added, a significantly better outcome was evident, with a complete cure in more than a quarter of patients after 4 weeks of treatment. A statistically significant difference was noted in the TBUT values, reflecting an obvious effect on the stability of the tear film. Similar results were shown for Schirmer I test results, denoting that sodium hyaluronate may be involved in tear secretion. A significantly lower FS score was shown in the sodium hyaluronate-added group. This indicates significantly fewer areas of damage or dryness in the corneas. Moreover, the OSDI scores, which were assessed after a mean period of more than one year after treatment, were significantly better in the sodium hyaluronate-added group. This indicates that sodium hyaluronate effectively alleviated dry eye symptoms, improved ocular surface health and comfort, and enhanced the overall well-being of the patients in that group.

### Observation of topical tacrolimus on high-risk penetrating keratoplasty patients: a randomized clinical trial [^fafe7405]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.1% and cyclosporine 1% on high-risk penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) patients.

Subjects/Methods

A series of 49 high-risk PKP patients (49 eyes), 20 males, 29 females from the age of 4 months to 74 years of age with the mean of 32.5 from 2012 to 2017 were recruited in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups by receiving either topical tacrolimus 0.1% or cyclosporine 1% respectively. Twenty five patients were treated with topical tacrolimus 0.1% and 24 patients with topical cyclosporine 1%. The traditional baseline management on these two groups were Tobramycin and Dexamethasone eye drops in the first 3 weeks and then tapered off. Clinical procedures and postoperative follow-up were documented.

Results

After 6–54 months follow-up, with the average of 24 months, 11 of 24 high-risk patients (11 eyes) had graft rejection, the rejection rate was 45.8% in topical cyclosporine 1% group. The rejections occurred from 35 days to 20 months after PKP. Three patients had irreversible rejection. On topical tacrolimus 0.1% group, the rejection occurred in four patients (four eyes) with rejection rate of 16%, and no irreversible rejection was observed. The graft rejection episodes were documented between 23 days and 24 months. As compared with the topical cyclosporine 1%, topical tacrolimus 0.1%, a key immunosuppressant, significantly decreased corneal graft rejection rate (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Topical tacrolimus 01% on high-risk PKP patients significantly prevented corneal graft rejection, and it had less adverse effects and was very safe to high-risk patients as to topical cyclosporine 1%. Further case controlled randomized clinical trial studies are needed to establish the best management option for these high-risk patients.

### Effect of intraoperative mitomycin C application at different concentrations on corneal densitometry after smartSurftransepithelial photorefractive keratectomy [^cc357d07]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical techniques

All surgeries were performed by a single experienced surgeon (LJZ) using the SCHWIND Amaris 1050RS excimer laser platform (1050-Hz frequency, SCHWIND eye-tech-solutions GmbH, Kleinostheim, Germany). The ablation algorithm was calculated using ORK-CAM software. Based on population statistics, the epithelial thickness profile was set for each treatment at 55 μm centrally and 65 μm peripherally. The epithelium and stroma were ablated in a single step, with a target optical zone diameter ranging from 6.0 to 6.5 mm.

Following stromal ablation, MMC were applied to the stromal bed for 30 s at concentrations of 0.02% (MMC 0.02 group), 0.01% (MMC 0.01 group), or omitted entirely (Control group). Residual liquid was removed using a cotton strip. The ablation surface was then irrigated with a balanced salt solution (BSS) and dried. After completing these steps, a drop of 0.3% tobramycin-0.1% dexamethasone (Tobradex; Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) was administered to both eyes, and a bandage contact lens (Acuvue Oasys; Johnson & Johnson Vision) was placed on the cornea for one week.

All patients were instructed to use 0.5% levofloxacin (Cravit; Santen, Inc.) eye drops four to six times daily for one week, and 0.3% tobramycin-0.1% dexamethasone eye drops four times daily for one week. Subsequently, patients transitioned to 0.1% fluorometholone (Allergan, Inc.) eye drops, applied four times daily in the first month, three times daily in the second month, twice daily in the third month, and once daily in the fourth month. The treatment continued for a total of four months to suppress early postoperative inflammation and prevent refractive regression. Moreover, 0.3% sodium hyaluronate (Hialid; Santen, Inc.) was administered four times daily for 2–3 months to alleviate postsurgical dry eye symptoms.

### The effect of preservative-free HP-guar on dry eye after phacoemulsification: a flow cytometric study [^c79602e8]. Eye (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effect of hydroxypropyl (HP)-Guar added to regular post-phacoemulsification treatment in dry eye signs and symptoms, and its influence on the expression of various inflammatory markers by flow cytometry (FCM) in impression cytology specimens.

Methods

This prospective, interventional, single-centre study included 48 eyes of 48 patients with age-related cataract. After phacoemulsification, patients were randomised to the usual treatment group (UT), with 21 patients who received tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops (Tobradex, Alcon Cusí, Spain), and the HP-Guar group, with 27 patients who received the UT plus preservative-free artificial tears (Systane UD, Alcon Cusí, Spain). Corneal and conjunctival staining with fluorescein and lissamine green, tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer's I test with anaesthesia (Jones test), tear clearance, and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) were assessed preoperatively and 1 month after surgery. Besides, conjunctival impression cytology was performed in order to investigate inflammatory markers (CD3, CD11b, and HLA-DR) using FCM.

Results

HP-Guar group shows statistical better results compared with the UT group in TBUT (6.4 ± 0.7 vs 9 ± 2.5, P = 0.0004), OSDI (11.5 ± 8.2 vs 3.3 ± 2.5, P = 0.0002), ocular symptoms subscale (7.3 ± 6.1 vs 1.7 ± 1.8, P = 0.0004), vision-related function subscale (2.2 ± 1.8 vs 0.4 ± 0.6, P = 0.0002), CD3 (2.5 ± 1.4 vs 1.1 ± 1.1, P = 0.011), and HLA-DR (6.8 ± 4.5 vs 1.8 ± 1.7, P = 0.0002).

Conclusion

The addition of HP-Guar to regular treatment after cataract surgery reduces ocular surface inflammation and dry eye signs and symptoms.

### Price differences between otic and ophthalmic drops [^a283cfbe]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Otic drops are one of the most frequently prescribed medications in otolaryngology. However, some forms of these drops can be very expensive, and ophthalmic formulations are sometimes used by practitioners to decrease the cost for their patients. The goal of this study is to determine the cost differential between otic and ophthalmic drops.

Methods

Pharmacies in New York City, Chicago, and Portland were surveyed in the span of 6 weeks by telephone to evaluate the current prices of various otic and ophthalmic drops commonly prescribed by otolaryngologists.

Results

A total of 83 pharmacies were surveyed. Surveyed drugs included ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone (cip/dex) otic, neomycin/polymyxin B sulfates/hydrocortisone (neo/poly/HC) otic, acetic acid (AA) otic, acetic acid/hydrocortisone (AA/HC) otic, ofloxacin otic, ofloxacin ophthalmic, and tobramycin/dexamethasone (tob/dex) ophthalmic. Per milliliter, cip/dex otic was consistently the most expensive, with a median price of $38.00 per milliliter. Among the antibiotic drops, neo/poly/HC otic was the least expensive formulation with a median price of $11.60 per milliliter. Ofloxacin ophthalmic was significantly less expensive than the otic formulation, at $11.00 and $31.00 per milliliter, respectively (adjusted p < 0.001). In general, otic and ophthalmic formulations were not significantly different according to manufacturing information, although ophthalmic drops were more often packaged in a sterile fashion and with less abrasive ingredients for use in the more sensitive tissue of the eye.

Conclusion

Significant and meaningful price differences exist between otic and ophthalmic drops. Given the safety of ophthalmic drops used in the ears, they may be a more cost-effective alternative to traditionally prescribed otic drops when clinically appropriate.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^b12ecab9]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis PPP — topical therapies and combination regimens — Topical perfluorohexyloctane was FDA approved in 2023 and is a prescription treatment that prevents tear evaporation and was shown to improve symptoms and corneal staining in patients with dry eye disease after 8 weeks of treatment. In meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), a phase 2 clinical trial reported significant improvements with selenium sulfide in glands secreting meibum and in a mean Ocular Surface Disease Index score compared with vehicle. For anterior blepharitis, a topical antibiotic ointment such as bacitracin or erythromycin can be prescribed and applied on the eyelid margins one or more times daily or at bedtime for a few weeks, and topical antibiotic treatment can be repeated on an intermittent basis using different medications to prevent resistant organisms. The clinical efficacy of topical tobramycin/dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension and azithromycin in a sustained release system has been evaluated in uncontrolled (off label) manufacturer-sponsored studies, and these topical treatments appear to reduce some of the signs and symptoms of blepharitis; additionally, topical administration of loteprednol etabonate 0.5%/tobramycin 0.3% has been shown to be safe when compared with dexamethasone due to less risk of elevated intraocular pressure rise.

### Dexamethasone / netilmicin eye drops and eye gel for the treatment of ocular inflammation after micro-incisional vitreoretinal surgery [^c9d5455a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of dexamethasone/netilmicin (dexa/net) fixed combination in the treatment of ocular inflammation after sutureless micro-incisional vitreoretinal surgery (MIVS).

Patients and Methods

This multicenter, open, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial was run in 6 sites in Italy. Treatment started the day of surgery and continued 4 times daily for 14 days. Patients were 1:1 randomized to dexa/net (eyedrops solution and eye gel) or dexamethasone/tobramycin (dexa/tobra) eyedrops suspension and ointment. Viscous formulations (gel or ointment) were used alone during the early post-operative phase; afterwards, a combination of eye drops during daytime and viscous formulations at bedtime was adopted. The primary efficacy parameter evaluated was bulbar conjunctival hyperemia. Additional efficacy and safety parameters (palpebral conjunctival hyperemia, anterior chamber flare and cells, symptoms of ocular discomfort and ocular tolerance, adverse events and intraocular pressure) were also evaluated. Control visits were performed at day 1, day 4 and day 14 after surgery; the endpoint of the study was set at 14 ± 2 days after surgery.

Results

A complete resolution of bulbar conjunctiva hyperaemia at the study end point was reached in 92.9% of patients treated with dexa/net and 75.0% of those treated with dexa/tobra (p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test). No differences were observed between treatments for other efficacy parameters. Statistically significant differences in favour of dexa/net (p < 0.0001, ANOVA) were observed for most of subjective tolerance variables examined (blurred vision, foreign body sensation, stickiness, burning) starting day 1 after surgery when only the viscous formulations were used. No increase in intraocular pressure or adverse events was observed during the study.

Conclusion

The combination dexa/net is safe and effective in the treatment of post-operative inflammation following sutureless MIVS. In particular, the use of eye gel formulation is characterized by a great tolerability.

### A prospective study on postoperative discomfort after 20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy [^d290d6b4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical technique

All pars plana vitrectomies in this study were performed using the same surgical technique by the same surgeon (FXA). After retrobulbar anesthesia, the 20G vitrectomy procedure began with three triangular incisions created using curved scissors in the conjunctiva at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock. A 20G microvitreoretinal blade, inserted through the conjunctiva at an angle of 10°–15°, was used to create a scleral tunnel located 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in phakic patients. The infusion cannula was inserted through the inferotemporal tunnel and was fixed with an 8–0 absorbable suture (Ethicon; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The 20G instruments were inserted into the other two tunnels that were placed at the superior quadrants. After vitrectomy, the sclerotomies and conjunctiva were closed with the 8–0 absorbable sutures, and dexamethasone (4.0 mg) and gentamicin (8.0 mg) were subconjunctivally injected. After the surgery, patients were given drops of antibiotics like ofloxacin eye ointment (3.5 g; Sinqi Co. Ltd. Shenyang, People's Republic of China) three times, once daily; recombinant human epidermal growth factor derivative eye drops (15,000 IU/3 mL; Watsin Genetech Co. Ltd. Shenzhen, People's Republic of China) four times, once daily; and corticosteroids like tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops (5 mL:15 mg:5 mg; Alcon-Couvreur nv, Rijksweg, Belgium) four times, once daily.

Postoperative follow-up

Patients were examined before surgery and 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 1 month, and 2 months postoperatively.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis [^5073bef3]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in a paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis.

Patients and Methods

This was a multicentre, international, randomised, investigator-masked study in 286 children with purulent discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection. Patients received either azithromycin 1.5% eye drops (twice daily for 3days) or tobramycin 0.3% eye drops (every 2h for 2days, then four times daily for 5days). Clinical signs were evaluated on day (D) 0, 3 and 7, and cultures on D0 and D7. The primary variable was the clinical cure (absence of bulbar conjunctival injection and discharge) on D3 in the worse eye for patients with positive cultures on D0.

Results

286 patients (mean age 3.2years; range 1day-17years) were included; 203 had positive cultures on D0. Azithromycin was superior to tobramycin in clinical cure rate on D3 (47.1% vs 28.7%, p = 0.013) and was non-inferior to tobramycin on D7 (89.2% vs 78.2%, respectively). Azithromycin treatment eradicated causative pathogens, including resistant species, with a similar resolution rate to tobramycin (89.8% vs 87.2%, respectively). These results were confirmed in a subgroup of patients younger than 24months old.

Conclusions

Azithromycin 1.5% eye drops provided a more rapid clinical cure than tobramycin 0.3% eye drops in the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children, with a more convenient twice-a-day dosing regimen.

### Rapid deterioration of mooren's ulcers after conjunctival flap: a review of 2 cases [^e2d4fd99]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Case 1

A 29-year-old man complained of pain and progressive blurred vision in his left eye for one month. Initially, the patient visited the local hospital and was administered antibiotic eye drops (tobramycin 0.3%, Alcon-Couvreur, Belgium), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops (diclofenac sodium 1%, Xingqi Pharma, China) and steroid eye drops (fluorometholone 0.1%, Santen Pharma, China) without obvious relief. He denied any history of ocular trauma, ocular surgery, diabetes, parasitic infections, rheumatoid arthritis and other associated diseases. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. A slit-lamp examination of his left eye revealed a peripheral corneal ulcer from 6:00 o'clock to 11:00 o'clock that had a grey, steep, overhanging leading edge that reached the central optical zone of the cornea (Fig. 1a). The conjunctiva adjacent to the corneal ulcer was severely congested, with new superficial big to small-sized blood vessels extending into the corneal ulcer area from the limbus. Within the ulcer, the thinnest area was less than 20% of the normal corneal thickness. An examination of the anterior segment of his right eye showed that it was normal. A systematic examination and laboratory tests were performed to rule out infectious keratitis, rheumatoid arthritis and other immune-associated diseases. Based on the clinical characteristics and medical history of the patients, a Mooren's ulcer was diagnosed. To prevent further corneal perforation, lamellar keratoplasty (LKP) was conducted in his local hospital. A "D" shaped lamellar graft was designed to correspond to the shape of the ulcer (Fig. 1b). A topical antibiotic and steroid (tobramycin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1%, Alcon-Couvreur, Belgium) were administrated postoperatively. One month later, the Mooren's ulcer had slightly recurred at the graft, and following treatment, a conjunctival flap was introduced in the patient by his local ophthalmologist. About several days after the performance of conjunctival flap, the ulceration rapidly progressed circumferentially and centrally, with a small island containing a transparent area eventually left in the temporal cornea (Fig. 1c, d). The patient ultimately underwent a full LKP in our hospital (Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, ZOC) (Fig. 2e). Postoperatively, tobramycin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops and ointment (Alcon-Couvreur, Belgium), Tacrolimus 0.05% eye drops (prepared by ZOC) and sodium hyaluronate 0.3% eye drops (Alcon-Couvreur, Belgium) were administered. There was no recurrence for one year following the second keratoplasty.

### Real-world use of loteprednol etabonate 0.5% / tobramycin 0.3% ophthalmic suspension for the treatment of ocular surface inflammatory conditions [^da5259e1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Use of a combination corticosteroid and antibiotic product is common in ocular surface inflammatory conditions for which corticosteroid therapy is indicated and there exists a risk of superficial bacterial infection. Topical corticosteroids have well-established efficacy in the management of ocular inflammation, but also carry potential risks including intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. The combination product loteprednol etabonate 0.5% plus tobramycin 0.3% ("LE/T"; Zylet ®, Bausch & Lomb Incorporated, Rochester, New York) combines a topical corticosteroid (loteprednol etabonate; LE) with an aminoglycoside antibacterial (tobramycin; T) in the form of an ophthalmic suspension.LE is a C-20 ester corticosteroid that is metabolized rapidly to inactive metabolites following corticosteroid receptor activation, a characteristic designed with the goal of enhanced safety.LE has been shown to be efficacious in a range of inflammatory ocular conditions along with a safety profile including a low risk of IOP elevation, even among known steroid responders. Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including efficacy against penicillinase-resistant staphylococcal organisms. In a recent in vitro study involving 487 unique bacterial isolates (14 genera; 67 species) commonly associated with blepharitis, tobramycin demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most isolates, including staphylococci (overall, as well as most methicillin-resistant strains).

The FDA-approved indication for LE/T is for use in steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection exists. While LE/T has been evaluated for the treatment of blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in two prospective clinical trials, and for blepharitis specifically in a pooled subanalysis, there has been limited reporting on real-world use of this combination product in a broader range of ocular inflammatory conditions. Thus, we designed a retrospective chart review study to assess the real-world use of LE/T in patients with ocular surface inflammatory conditions with a focus on dosing regimens used, IOP and other safety outcomes, and clinical disease resolution.

### Evaluation of timed dexamethasone eye drops to prevent proliferative retinopathy of prematurity: a study protocol for a randomized intervention, multi-centre, double-blinded trial (DROPROP) [^5c88ecf8]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we conduct this study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dexamethasone eye drops as a preventative therapy for preterm infants with severe ROP. The findings from our study aim to support clinical practice and national guidelines to provide the best care for this particularly vulnerable group of infants worldwide. We believe that our research has the potential to significantly benefit children by reducing the risk for visual impairments, thereby improving their quality of life.

We plan to publish the results of this study in peer-reviewed journals and present data at national and international conferences.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis [^f5471db0]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Combined with results from the previous study, more than 400 children with bacterial conjunctivitis have now been treated with the azithromycin 1.5% regimen. In this study, azithromycin was found to be safe and well tolerated in children as young as a few days old, with most AEs related to ocular discomfort (burning, stinging) upon instillation. More than 90% of patients/guardians found the azithromycin eye drops comfortable, and investigators assessed the antibiotic tolerability as favourable in more than 95% of treated patients. No corneal or anterior chamber inflammation was shown at slit lamp. This also confirmed the good safety profile of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops previously established in children with trachomatous conjunctivitis.

Patients/guardians regarded the azithromycin 1.5% regimen (one drop, morning and evening, for 3 days) a more convenient treatment, which was easier to comply with and had a significantly lower impact on daily activities in comparison to the tobramycin regimen (84.0% of patients/guardians in the azithromycin group reported their treatment as 'never' impacting on daily activities compared to 54.8% of patients/guardians in the tobramycin group, p < 0.001; data not illustrated). Moreover, taking into consideration a similar cost of eye drops (prices in Europe were found to range between 2.7 × P and 9.2 × P for azithromycin and between 1.0 × P and 11.4 × P for tobramycin; P is the lowest price), it is likely that reduced drop instillation regimen and faster resolution of conjunctivitis would result in overall cost saving (from parental time off work, loss of earnings), but this was not directly assessed during this prospective study. A major benefit of the simple, short and effective dosing regimen for azithromycin is therefore its compatibility with real life. Such a dosage regimen is also expected to improve compliance and avoid antibiotic misuse, thereby limiting the risk of bacterial resistance developing.

In summary, azithromycin 1.5% eye drops are an effective and safe therapeutic option for purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in paediatric patients, notably in the 0–2-year-old range. Azithromycin provided a superior clinical cure rate on D3 compared with tobramycin, combined with a more convenient dosage regimen. Simplification of the therapy is a major benefit of this short-term twice daily regimen, confirmed by this study in a paediatric subgroup in whom instillation can be tricky.

### Pediatric non-viral microbial keratitis: predisposing factors, microbiological profile, treatment modalities, and visual outcome [^0c80925b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Twenty-nine patients (49.2%) had used antibiotics before presentation. Antibiotics previously used included gatifloxacin (n = 2), a combination of tobramycin and dexamethasone (n = 3), moxifloxacin (n = 10), fusidic acid (n = 6), fortified cefazolin with vancomycin (n = 3), chloramphenicol (n = 1), fortified cefazolin with gentamycin (n = 3) and ciprofloxacin (n = 1).

After presentation, fortified antibiotics were used in 74.6% (n = 44) of all patients: cefazolin and ceftazidime (n = 24), vancomycin and ceftazidime (n = 19) and a combination of ceftazidime and gentamycin (n = 1). Fluoroquinolones were used in 20.3% (n = 12): moxifloxacin (n = 10), gatifloxacin (n = 1) and ciprofloxacin (n = 1). Two cases received fusidic acid besides fluoroquinolones. Three patients were kept on the same antibiotics that were used before presentation. Steroids were used in 55.9% (n = 33) of all cases and were initiated 2.1 ± 6.7 months after presentation.

Outcomes

The mean follow-up time was 23.4 ± 28.9 months (range: 0.10–114.1 months). Fifty-four patients (91.5%) showed good response to medical treatment, while poor response was seen in 8.5% (n = 5), predisposing factors in these cases were (n = 3), ocular disease (n = 1), and ocular surgery (n = 1).

Initial and final visual acuities were recorded in 78% (n = 46) and 74.6% (n = 44) of all cases, respectively. The mean corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 1.03 ± 1.09 LogMAR (Snellen: 20/214) at presentation and 0.30 ± 0.36 LogMAR (Snellen: 20/40) at the last visit, ie, vision improved seven lines in visual acuity (p < 0.001) [Table 4].

### Histologic findings of bevacizumab-treated human conjunctiva in Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^d679ebb2]. Cornea (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present the histopathologic findings of the conjunctiva of a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)-associated ocular surface neovascularization (OSN) after topical bevacizumab (TB) treatment.

Methods

A 40-year-old man with SJS and OSN received topical bevacizumab (25 mg/mL) for 12 months in 1 eye in addition to previously bilaterally administered tobramycin/dexamethasone eye drops. He subsequently underwent bilateral release of symblephara to relieve diplopia. Conjunctival samples from both eyes were obtained for histopathologic study.

Results

The TB-untreated conjunctiva manifested marked stromal vascularization (approximately 4–5 blood vessels per high-power field) and perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cells. The TB-treated eye manifested with markedly less stromal vascularization (approximately 1–2 vessels per high-power field) in the conjunctiva and absence of perivascular inflammatory cells.

Conclusions

These histopathologic findings provide evidence that TB penetrates the ocular surface, induces regression of OSN, and possibly moderates ocular inflammation. TB may be a useful additional treatment for OSN among patients with SJS.

### Bilateral idiopathic orbital pseudotumour in a child: a case report [^3c2f6f9e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic orbital pseudotumour is rare in children. We report a case of bilateral paediatric idiopathic orbital pseudotumour and review the characteristics of this case.

Case presentation

A 14-year-old female patient presented at our Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) with complaints of recurrent severe cold and cough for 3 weeks, which had been treated with an intravenous antibiotic. Meanwhile, the patient developed swelling of both eyelids during the period of cold and cough, but her symptoms did not improve after the ocular administration of tobramycin dexamethasone eye drops. The patient was referred from the respiratory medicine ward to our department because of gradually worsening ocular pain, visual deterioration, increased intraocular pressure and serious nausea/vomiting within 24 h of hospitalization. The diagnosis of bilateral idiopathic orbital pseudotumour was made ultimately because of the course of the disease, exclusion of diagnoses such as bacterial ocular infection or malignant tumours and subsequent evidence from orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Favourable progress in the ocular tension and eyelid swelling was achieved through treatment with intravenous dexamethasone. The binocular intraocular pressure gradually declined to approximately 15 mmHg, and there was favourable progression in the patient's vision to 20/40 in both eyes on the ninth day of hospitalization.

Conclusions

Our patient developed rapidly progressive acute orbital signs and symptoms and anterior inflammation, such as pain, proptosis, limited ductions, periorbital oedema, chemosis, vision loss and high intraocular pressure. This case highlights that idiopathic orbital pseudotumour is an uncommon but important cause of acute orbital syndrome in children.

### Risk factors for postoperative pain in pterygium surgery patients [^1c1b0491]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

General Information

A total of 145 pterygium patients (51 males and 94 females) treated at Shenzhen Eye Hospital from June 2020 to March 2021 were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) aged ≥ 18 years, sex unspecified; and 2) diagnosed with pterygium in one or both eyes and planning to undergo pterygium excision under local anesthesia. This retrospective study adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Shenzhen Eye Hospital Medical Ethics Committee (Approval number: 2022-057-01). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. No stipend was provided.

Treatment Methods

Three days before surgery, patients started using levofloxacin eye drops (Huide Likang, Heze, Shandong, China, specification: 5 mL: 24.4 mg per vial) four times a day in both eyes. After routine disinfection and draping, we performed surface anesthesia using proparacaine hydrochloride eye drops (Youniter Nanjing Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, specification: 0.5%) in combination with subconjunctival injection of lidocaine hydrochloride (Hubei Tiansheng Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Chongqing, China, specification: 5 mL:0.1 g) at a volume of 0.5 mL for infiltration anesthesia at the pterygium neck and subconjunctival body. Depending on the degree of adhesion and thickness of the pterygium, we adopted corresponding surgical excision methods. We aligned the conjunctival flap with the corneal edge on the corneal edge side and sutured the conjunctival flap to the shallow sclera. After surgery, we applied tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment (S. A. Alcon-Couvreur n.v. Antwerp, Belgium, specification: 3.5 g, containing 10.5 mg tobramycin and 3.5 mg dexamethasone) to the operated eye and bandaged it. After surgery, patients were treated with tobramycin-dexamethasone eye drops (S. A. Alcon-Couvreur n.v. Antwerp, Belgium, specification: 5 mL), levofloxacin eye drops, and sodium hyaluronate eye drops (Shentian Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, specification: 5 mL:15 mg) in the operated eye four times a day for one month.

### Comparison of optical quality and distinct macular thickness in femtosecond laser-assisted versus phacoemulsification cataract surgery [^1a057f22]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This observational prospective cohort study reviewed 100 patient records of FLACS and PCS cases performed by a single surgeon at Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University from January 2018 to September 2018. The study approved by the institutional ethics committee of Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University and was performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were willing to volunteer for the research and signed a written informed consent. We excluded the patients with previous ocular surgery, trauma and known macular alteration and all patients were given a complete ophthalmologic evaluation before surgery as our previously study. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) with subjective refraction performed by an optometrist using an LCD visual acuity chart preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively. Emery-Little classification was used to define the nuclear hardness. The Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) was used to define the lens opacities. The basic demographic of the study participant were listed in the Additional file 1: Table S1. All FLACS were performed by the same surgeon (H.J.G.) as our previously described. All PCS surgeries also were performed by the same surgeon (H.J.G.). Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Eye Drops (Tobradex, Alcon) were used four times daily after surgery until day 14. Tobramycin and Dexamethasone Eye Ointment (Tobradex, Alcon) was used one time a day after surgery for 30 days. Pranoprofen eye drops (Pranopulin, Senju Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) was used three times a day after surgery for 30 days.

Ray-tracing Aberrometry

A wavefront aberrometry scan was performed with a ray-tracing aberrometer (iTrace, Tracey Technologies, Houston, TX) preoperatively and at the final 1 month follow-up as previously described. Using the iTrace, we measured the optical quality parameters (MTF and SR) of the eye and DLI. For the MTF values measured at spatial frequencies, we selected 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cycles/degree (c/d). Pupils were dilated with a 6-mm size before measurement.

OCT measurements

OCT measurements (Cirrus HD-OCT 4000; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) were performed 1 day before surgery and post-operation at 1 month as our previously described.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis [^f6c484e3]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics

A total of 286 eligible patients were randomised (figure 1). Of these patients, 203 (71.0%) with baseline bacterial cultures at/above the pathogenic threshold in at least one eye were included in the MFAS. Seven patients on azithromycin (4.8%) and four patients on tobramycin (2.9%) withdrew from the study. In the MFAS, 8 azithromycin-treated patients and 11 tobramycin-treated patients had major protocol deviations and were excluded from the MPPS.

Figure 1
Study flow chart.

There was no notable between-group difference in the MFAS regarding baseline characteristics (table 1). The mean age was 3.0 ± 3.4 years, and 55.2% of patients were younger than 24 months old. Overall, 66.0% of patients had moderate to severe bulbar conjunctival injection in the worse eye at baseline, and 87.2% had moderate to severe purulent discharge. The severity of both these cardinal clinical signs was not significantly different between treatment groups at baseline (p = 0.559 and 0.729, respectively). Folliculo-papillary reaction was present in 52.2%, eyelid erythema in 41.9% and eyelid swelling in 38.4% of patients, without notable between-group difference in severity (p = 0.561, 0.673 and 0.548, respectively).

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^0ddd29e7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The bacteriological and clinical findings from this study have previously been reported, and the present results extend those findings. Clinical cure rate was reduced more rapidly by azithromycin than by tobramycin (41% vs 28.7% respectively on day 3, P = 0.013) and was noninferior at the end of the study (89.2% vs 78.2% respectively at day 7). Resolution of bacterial pathogens, including resistant species, was similar with the two treatments. As in the present study, the results were broadly equivalent in the sub-24 months of age subgroup.

Although bacterial conjunctivitis generally resolves without treatment, there are benefits to be gained, particularly in moderate to severe cases, by the more rapid improvements that can be achieved with topical antibiotic treatment. As well as the clinical benefits of avoidance of complications (particularly in younger children), earlier resolution of symptoms, and a reduction in the chance of contagion, nonclinical benefits such as an earlier return to school (and less loss of curriculum) and less disrupted work life for parents should be taken into account. A survey of 326 parents of children estimated that 54.2% of children missed 1.9 days of school and 28.6% of parents missed a mean of 1.5 days of work during a bout of infective conjunctivitis.

Despite the significant literature on topical antibiotic use in infective conjunctivitis, until relatively recently, there have been few studies on the use of topical ocular antibiotics in children, particularly newborns and infants who are at particular risk of bacterial conjunctivitis and who can suffer the most serious complications such as ophthalmia neonatorum. The current study recruited patients from hospitals rather than from general practice; since bacterial conjunctivitis in older children is generally managed in a community setting, this study included a significant population of newborns and infants. Because the study included a large population of these younger children (a population frequently underrepresented in similar clinical studies), the results in this group of patients are particularly noteworthy. Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and purulent discharge were lower in azithromycin- than in tobramycin-treated patients at both day 3 (by 14% for bulbar hyperemia and 20% purulent discharge respectively) and day 7 (by 20% for bulbar hyperemia and 18% for purulent discharge respectively); such differences are likely to be of clinical significance.

Patients and methods

Study design

This was a randomized, double-masked, parallel group and comparative Phase III study conducted at 29 different clinical practice sites across the United States. The study was conducted in compliance with all applicable governmental rules, ethical principles, Good Clinical Practice regulations, International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Consultants Review Committee Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Austin, TX, USA) and Coast IRB (Colorado Springs, CO, USA). It was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under the registry number NCT01408082.

All enrolled subjects were informed that the study drugs were being used for investigational purposes only. Written informed consent was obtained from all trial participants. Subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 years were required to provide written assent, and a parent or legal guardian was required to provide informed consent for all enrollees younger than 18 years.

### Evaluation of timed dexamethasone eye drops to prevent proliferative retinopathy of prematurity: a study protocol for a randomized intervention, multi-centre, double-blinded trial (DROPROP) [^a47ba75e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Study patients will be randomized to receive eyedrops with either dexamethasone 1 mg/ml (Dexafree®) in single-dose containers supplied by Thea Nordic or placebo, saline (Drop-it®) also in single-dose containers. Saline (Drop-it®) is a sterile, buffered saline without preservatives, with the same sodium chloride content as the tear film. The dose of dexamethasone has been adjusted to maintain efficacy while minimizing the medication dosage.

Based on the severity of ROP, the eye drops are administered at a dosage of one drop every other day to one drop daily in affected eyes, Table 1. The maximum intervention duration is 12 weeks. The dosage will be adjusted within the protocol's range if ROP regresses or progresses. When discontinuing intervention, drops are tapered over one week; if the infant receives one drop daily, the dosage should be reduced to one drop every other day for one week before discontinuing intervention. After laser treatment, the infant will receive dexamethasone 1 mg/ml to reduce post-laser inflammation; the dose and duration will be determined by the ophthalmologist in charge, based on local routines. If anti-VEGF treatment is planned, all eye drops will be stopped immediately to reduce the risk of infection and endophthalmitis in cases of dexamethasone intervention. To reduce systemic absorption of the medication, we inform caregivers to tilt the baby's head to the left when the left eye is given a drop and to the right when the right eye is being dropped and instantly wipe off the excessive fluid with a soft compress. Intervention will be given at several weeks of age and during a limited period.

### Relationship between dry eye and expressions of CXCR3 and CCR5 after ocular acid burn [^cccc55cb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The conjunctival sac of all injured patients was thoroughly rinsed with normal saline immediately after injury in the hospital, followed by topical antibiotic eye drops, eye ointment (levofloxacin eye drops, levofloxacin eye ointment) and eye drops that promote corneal repair (recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor eye drops). Local glucocorticoid eye drops (tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops) were administered within 1 week after injury, and amniotic membrane transplantation was performed in patients with grade III or higher burns.

### Persistent and severe mpox keratitis despite systemic and topical treatment [^fbe9ee84]. Cornea (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to report a case of peripheral ulcerative keratitis in a patient diagnosed with corneal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a positive mpox culture.

Methods

This is a case report.

Results

An immunocompetent 54-year-old man was diagnosed with conjunctivitis in his left eye 15 days after being diagnosed with mucocutaneous monkeypox. He received treatment with dexamethasone 0.1% and tobramycin 0.3% eye drops for 2 weeks. Two weeks after discontinuing this treatment, he developed peripheral ulcerative keratitis and a paracentral epithelial defect. Mpox keratitis was diagnosed by corneal culture and PCR. Corneal inflammation persisted for more than 6 months, manifested as corneal epithelial defect, limbitis, endotheliitis, neurotrophic changes, and trabeculitis. This persistence was observed alongside positive corneal PCR results, despite undergoing 2 courses of trifluorothymidine, 2 courses of oral tecovirimat, and intravenous cidofovir. An amniotic membrane transplantation was then performed.

Conclusions

Persistent corneal pain and replication are possible with the mpox virus, even in immunocompetent patients. Having received treatment with topical corticosteroids before antiviral treatment for the pox virus may have contributed to the severity and persistence of the clinical condition. Cycle threshold PCR values can be used to support the diagnosis and monitor treatment effectiveness.

### Hypersensitivity to inhaled TOBI following reaction to gentamicin [^a3c9d47a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal-recessive disease in Caucasians. Colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) of the CF airways causes deterioration of pulmonary status. TOBI (Tobramycin solution for inhalation) is an inhaled antibiotic that can improve the pulmonary disease. We report on a 9-year old boy with CF who developed a rash following a course of IV gentamicin. The rash resolved after its discontinuation. However, the rash returned all over his body, with the start of inhalation of TOBI therapy. We desensitized the patient using escalating doses of inhaled TOBI. He tolerated the procedure well, and continues to be on TOBI 9 months after desensitization on a once-a-day regimen.

### Evaluation of timed dexamethasone eye drops to prevent proliferative retinopathy of prematurity: a study protocol for a randomized intervention, multi-centre, double-blinded trial (DROPROP) [^de25e867]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This paper presents the DROPROP protocol: a prospective, randomized, multi-centre, double-blind trial designed to evaluate whether dexamethasone eye drops reduce the proportion of infants with severe ROP progressing to Type 1 ROP needing treatment compared to placebo. The findings of this study may impact the care of future preterm infants at risk of developing sight-threatening severe ROP worldwide.

As survival rates for preterm infants rise, the number of infants affected by sight-threatening ROP and needing ophthalmological expertise increases accordingly. There is a concerning shortage of ophthalmologists available for ROP screening and treatment in many countries. We believe that dexamethasone eye drops could be a simple and low-cost treatment to reduce ophthalmological complications and lifelong visual impairment in these vulnerable new survivors. Research including preterm infants is challenging as they are particularly vulnerable and frequently experience critical illness and have uncertain prognoses. Nevertheless, research is crucial, especially if it enhances our understanding or treatment of a medical condition. Historically, clinical misadventures have occurred due to insufficient paediatric clinical research and off-label use of medications.

### Neomycin, polymyxin b sulfates, dexamethasone (neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and dexamethasone) [^5ab6b1b6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

NOT FOR INJECTION. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of steroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex requires great caution; frequent slit lamp microscopy is recommended.

Prolonged use may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions or parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection.

In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids.

If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. IOP should be checked frequently.

The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation.

Products containing neomycin sulfate may cause cutaneous sensitization. Sensitivity to topically administered aminoglycosides, such as neomycin, may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such as erythema, itching, uticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If hypersensitivity develops during use of the product, treatment should be discontinued. Cross-hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides can occur, and the possibility that patients who become sensitized to topical neomycin may also be sensitive to other topical and/or systemic aminoglycosides should be considered.

### Tobramycin [^089ea01b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of tobramycin IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Therapeutic blood levels in the mother do not equate with safety for the fetus. Aminoglycosides should be considered potentially ototoxic and nephrotoxic to the fetus. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. The drug tobramycin IV is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

### Tobramycin sulfate (tobramycin) [^dab5394d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tobramycin injection should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug.

Concurrent and sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (e.g., amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin, should be avoided. Other factors that may increase patient risk are advanced age and dehydration.

Aminoglycosides should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue.

Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Ocular medicines in children: the regulatory situation related to clinical research [^f18b9453]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Moreover, the available guidelines on the pharmacological management of eye diseases in the paediatric population often recommend the use of medications not licensed or investigated in children, especially for the management of glaucoma (such as prostagliandin analogs) or acute bacterial conjunctivitis (such as steroids and antibiotics combinations). An effort to stimulate research and clinical development is therefore needed also for them, in order to guarantee medicines that have been proven to be of benefit also in paediatric patients.

Many good ethical and economical reasons exist for limiting paediatric clinical trials, while guaranteeing appropriate conclusions. Because of the characteristics of the paediatric population, limited information is also available regarding the side effects related to ocular medication use in children. As the number and variety of ocular medications has increased and the number of clinicians involved in their prescription has grown, the risk of systemic adverse reactions may also increase. When prescribing ocular medications in children, physicians should therefore carefully consider their risk/benefit profile, referring to details of labelling for paediatric use, such as the age of the child for whom the drug is approved, and be aware of their potentially serious systemic side effects.

### Postoperative complications and axial length growth after bilateral congenital cataract surgery: eyes with microphthalmos compared to a comparison group [^1e5cf474]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical technique

All surgeries were performed by the same experienced congenital cataract surgeon (Yun-e Zhao) under general anaesthesia using the Accurus or Centurion system (Alcon Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, TX, USA) with a cut-rate of 2000 per minute and vacuum of 350 mmHg. Two 0.8-mm precise corneal incisions were created at 10 and 2 O'clock using a MANI ophthalmic knife (MANI, Inc. Tochigi, Japan); lens aspiration was performed after anterior vitrectorhexis with a diameter of about 4.5–5.0 mm, followed by posterior vitrectorhexis about 3–3.5 mm and limited anterior vitrectomy with a 23-gauge vitrector and 23-guage irrigating cannula via two cornea incisions. The incisions were closed using 10–0 absorbable Vicryl sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). Peripheral iridectomy was performed prophylactically in several cases to decrease the possibility of a pupillary block and inflammatory peripheral anterior synechiae. Without primary IOL implantation, all patients remained aphakic after surgery. The interval between the binocular surgeries was within 7 days.

Postoperative topical treatment included:(1) levofloxacin (0.5%) eye drops (Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Japan) four times a day for two weeks,(2) tobramycin dexamethasone eye ointment (tobramycin 0.3%, dexamethasone 0.1%; Alcon Laboratories, Inc. USA) once a day for two weeks and (3) tobramycin dexamethasone eye drops (tobramycin 0.3%, dexamethasone 0.1%; Alcon Laboratories, Inc. USA) four times a day, which were tapered for 4–6 weeks postoperatively. Atropinesulfate ophthalmic gels (atropine 1.0%, Shenyang Xingqi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, China) were administered once a day for 1 week and later changed to tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops (Mydrin®-P, Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Japan) once a day for one month. Optical correction using aphakic spectacles was prescribed for all patients.
