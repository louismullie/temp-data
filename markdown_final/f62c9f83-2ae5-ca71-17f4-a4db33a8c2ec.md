## Question

38-year-old woman underwent partial thyroidectomy with inferior thyroid arteries ligated near the thyroid poles; presents 2 weeks later with hoarseness.

A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness. What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?

Answer Choices:
A. Internal laryngeal nerve injury
B. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
C. External laryngeal nerve injury
D. Laryngeal edema

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most likely cause of hoarseness two weeks after partial thyroidectomy, given that the inferior thyroid arteries were ligated close to the thyroid poles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the surgical anatomy and which nerves are at risk during inferior thyroid artery ligation. Then, I should verify the timing of postoperative hoarseness and how that maps onto neural injury patterns. Next, I will compare the differential diagnoses, including RLN injury, SLN injury, and non-neural causes like edema or intubation trauma. Finally, I will weigh the evidence and choose the most likely explanation, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the key anatomy and the operative maneuver. The recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends in the tracheoesophageal groove and has a highly variable relationship to the inferior thyroid artery, often coursing between its branches, which makes the RLN particularly vulnerable during ligation of the inferior thyroid artery near the thyroid pole. In contrast, the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve travels with the superior thyroid artery and is not in the field of inferior thyroid artery ligation, and the internal laryngeal nerve is a sensory branch that is likewise not typically endangered by inferior thyroid artery dissection [^2ba86aac] [^eff844ff].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of hoarseness. Two weeks postoperatively is a classic window for transient RLN neuropraxia to declare itself clinically, and contemporary series consistently show that a substantial fraction of RLN injuries are temporary, with many resolving over weeks to months. This timing profile fits RLN injury far better than edema, which typically manifests immediately after extubation and resolves within days, or intubation-related vocal fold injury, which also tends to present early and often improves within 1–2 weeks [^d26ae00f] [^e7a5d0e2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the differential. Internal laryngeal nerve injury would not cause hoarseness because it is sensory; it would alter sensation, not vocal fold motion, so Option A is anatomically inconsistent with the symptom. External laryngeal nerve injury would impair pitch and projection rather than produce classic hoarseness and is not in the operative field when ligating the inferior thyroid artery, making Option C less likely. Laryngeal edema can cause hoarseness, but it is usually immediate post-extubation and resolves within days, which mismatches the 2-week timeline here, so Option D is less compelling. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, even transient, produces hoarseness from vocal fold paresis or paralysis and fits the anatomy and timing, making Option B the most likely [^3a6751b6] [^11df77ff] [^e7a5d0e2].

> I need to ensure the mechanism is plausible. Ligating the inferior thyroid artery close to the thyroid pole risks traction, ischemia, or direct trauma to the RLN, especially given the nerve's variable relationship to the artery and its extralarygeal branching patterns. Guidelines and anatomical studies emphasize identifying and protecting the RLN and note that RLN injury is a leading cause of post-thyroidectomy hoarseness, with reported temporary rates around 9–10% and permanent rates around 2–3% in large series, which aligns with the clinical picture here [^d26ae00f] [^2ba86aac] [^eff844ff].

> But wait, what if the hoarseness is from intubation trauma rather than RLN injury? I should double-check that. Intubation-related vocal fold injury can cause hoarseness, yet it typically presents immediately and often improves within 1–2 weeks; by two weeks, persistent hoarseness in this context should still prompt evaluation for RLN dysfunction, and the operative field risk from inferior thyroid artery ligation makes RLN injury the more parsimonious explanation here [^e7a5d0e2] [^d26ae00f].

> Next, I should review what to do clinically. Persistent hoarseness beyond about 2–4 weeks warrants laryngoscopy to document vocal fold mobility and confirm the diagnosis, and early referral to a laryngologist supports timely voice therapy and, if needed, medialization options. This is standard post-thyroidectomy voice care and aligns with guideline recommendations for evaluating new dysphonia after thyroid surgery [^bef3f8e4] [^61e7b6a2].

> Final answer: The most likely cause is recurrent laryngeal nerve injury from inferior thyroid artery ligation near the thyroid pole, given the nerve's intimate relationship to the inferior thyroid artery, the classic 2-week timing of transient RLN dysfunction, and the mismatch of alternatives with anatomy and time course. Therefore, the correct choice is B. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury [^2ba86aac] [^eff844ff] [^d26ae00f].

---

The most likely cause of hoarseness 2 weeks after partial thyroidectomy with inferior thyroid artery ligation near the thyroid poles is **recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury** [^2ba86aac]. The RLN lies close to the inferior thyroid artery and is at risk during ligation, especially when performed near the thyroid pole [^eff844ff]. Injury can cause vocal fold paresis or paralysis, resulting in hoarseness, breathiness, and reduced vocal projection [^11df77ff]. Early postoperative hoarseness warrants **laryngoscopic evaluation** to confirm vocal fold mobility and guide management [^bef3f8e4] [^61e7b6a2].

---

## Anatomical relationship between the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery

The RLN ascends in the tracheoesophageal groove and typically passes **posterior to the inferior thyroid artery**, though the relationship is variable and can include anterior or between-branch courses [^eff844ff]. This variability increases the risk of **iatrogenic injury** during inferior thyroid artery ligation, particularly when performed close to the thyroid pole [^2ba86aac].

---

## Mechanisms of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury during inferior thyroid artery ligation

RLN injury during inferior thyroid artery ligation can occur via several mechanisms:

- **Direct trauma**: Clamp, ligature, or electrocautery injury to the nerve [^notfound].
- **Traction injury**: Excessive traction during artery mobilization or ligation [^notfound].
- **Ischemia**: Disruption of the nerve's blood supply from ligation of arterial branches [^notfound].

These injuries may be **transient (neuropraxia)** or **permanent (axonotmesis or neurotmesis)** [^d26ae00f].

---

## Clinical presentation of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

RLN injury typically presents with the following **symptoms**:

- **Hoarseness**: Most common symptom due to vocal fold paresis or paralysis [^11df77ff].
- **Breathiness**: Reduced vocal fold closure causing air escape [^11df77ff].
- **Reduced vocal projection**: Difficulty raising voice or singing [^11df77ff].
- **Aspiration**: Risk of liquids entering the airway due to impaired vocal fold function [^da164850].

---

## Incidence and risk factors for recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

The incidence of RLN injury varies with surgical experience, goiter size, and operative technique. Temporary RLN injury occurs in approximately 1–2% of thyroidectomies, while **permanent injury** occurs in less than 1% in experienced hands [^f60b0629]. Risk factors include:

- **Large or substernal goiters**: Distorted anatomy and increased manipulation [^notfound].
- **Revision surgery**: Scar tissue obscuring planes [^322ff577].
- **Inexperienced surgeons**: Higher complication rates with low-volume operators [^8f1fe87a].

---

## Differential diagnosis of post-thyroidectomy hoarseness

While RLN injury is the most likely cause, other etiologies should be considered:

| **Etiology** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury | Direct trauma, traction, ischemia | - Hoarseness <br/> - Breathiness <br/> - Reduced projection [^11df77ff] |
| Superior laryngeal nerve injury | Injury to external branch during superior pole dissection | - Pitch reduction <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Difficulty with high notes [^11df77ff] |
| Laryngeal edema | Trauma from intubation or surgical manipulation | - Hoarseness <br/> - Stridor <br/> - Respiratory distress [^notfound] |
| Vocal fold hematoma | Trauma from intubation or surgical instruments | - Hoarseness <br/> - Pain <br/> - Hemorrhagic appearance on laryngoscopy [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Persistent hoarseness beyond 2 weeks warrants **evaluation**:

- **Laryngoscopy**: Gold standard to assess vocal fold mobility and confirm RLN injury [^bef3f8e4] [^61e7b6a2].
- **Voice assessment**: Subjective and objective measures of voice quality and function [^443f32f2].
- **Imaging**: Rarely indicated unless recurrent disease or structural abnormalities are suspected [^8d350c08].

---

## Management of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

Management depends on severity and chronicity:

- **Observation**: Many transient injuries resolve spontaneously over 3–6 months [^d26ae00f].
- **Voice therapy**: Essential for functional improvement and compensation [^d1edbaa5].
- **Surgical intervention**: Medialization thyroplasty or injection laryngoplasty for persistent paralysis with significant dysphonia or aspiration [^5c72391f].

---

## Preventive strategies

To minimize RLN injury risk, surgeons should:

- **Identify and dissect the RLN**: Visual identification is the gold standard [^2383dd50] [^e6e8bd64].
- **Use intraoperative nerve monitoring**: Adjunctive tool, especially in complex cases [^4f93c451].
- **Ligate arteries close to the thyroid capsule**: Reduces risk of nerve injury [^2ba86aac].

---

The most likely cause of hoarseness 2 weeks after partial thyroidectomy with inferior thyroid artery ligation near the thyroid poles is **recurrent laryngeal nerve injury** due to the close anatomical relationship between the nerve and the artery [^2ba86aac]. Early laryngoscopic evaluation and appropriate management are essential for optimal recovery [^bef3f8e4].

Thyroidectomy exposure and superior pole management include removal of prelaryngeal nodes when malignancy is suspected and protection of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) by technique and monitoring. The prelaryngeal "Delphian" lymph node(s) if present should be removed in cases of suspected or known malignancy and sent for pathologic review; the EBSLN may be visually identified at the inferior edge of the inferior constrictor muscle; if a nerve monitor is being used, fibers considered for transection may be stimulated prior to dividing the superior pole vasculature; and Recommendation 25 states the superior pole vessels should be ligated close to the thyroid capsule to avoid potential EBSLN injury (Strong recommendation, insufficient evidence).

Pearls of surgical technique — in large substernal goiters the recurrent laryngeal nerve is generally in its normal position in the tracheoesophageal groove, although in a posterior mediastinal goiter the nerve may be displaced anterior to the posterior extension of the thyroid; in large bilateral goiters, a total thyroidectomy is considered rather than subtotal resection, but a thyroid lobe may be preserved for ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve or parathyroid preservation, and if only one lobe is involved with a normal contralateral lobe a lobectomy may be considered to relieve tracheal compression with lower risk of complications. To avoid blood loss, prompt and direct control of the superior and inferior vascular pedicles is emphasized, and a plan should be in place for potential massive hemorrhage including type and crossmatch, packing with lap sponges, clamping and ligating the inferior thyroid pole first, and consulting another surgeon. Delivery through a cervical incision can be performed with blunt or sharp dissection and mobilization with a spoon or Deaver retractor, and sequential placement of sutures, Babcock forceps, or Allis clamps can help hoist the remaining substernal component; this delivery must be accomplished first before the recurrent laryngeal nerve can be identified; and a drain in the resection bed can be considered in select situations, but the placement of a drain has never been shown to reduce the risk of life-threatening neck hematoma.

Critical steps of thyroid dissection describe typical planes, vessel control, and anatomic preservation. In general, thyroidectomy proceeds through tissue planes that deepen from a ventral to dorsal direction, while the overlying strap muscles are dissected in a medial to lateral direction away from the underlying thyroid capsule toward the carotid sheath; the middle thyroid vein on the ventral lobe surface is ligated and divided to improve medial mobility and expose the tracheoesophageal groove; as the lobe is mobilized and rotated medially, its ancillary blood supply is isolated and divided; the inferior parathyroid is usually seen on or near the inferior thyroid capsule and typically resides anterior and medial to the RLN; and it should be dissected away from the thyroid capsule with care to preserve the parathyroid capsule, lateral attachments, and blood supply.

American Thyroid Association nodule ablation — peri-procedural complication management — If vocal hoarseness or a sudden cough raises concern for recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, thermal injury, or esophageal injury, ablation should be halted and a bolus of cold D5W can be injected into the perithyroidal region to dissipate heat, with any further ablation avoiding the area of voice change; hemorrhage is usually self-limited with compression, but for large arterial hemorrhage direct ablation of the injured artery is the treatment of choice and more profuse bleeding requires endovascular or surgical intervention; to minimize lidocaine toxicity, it is recommended to use < 4.5 mg/kg of 1% lidocaine, and treatment of mild toxicity includes consideration for lipid emulsion therapy with lipofundin 20% with escalation of care as appropriate.

### Two concomitant right nonrecurrent laryngeal nerves encountered during thyroidectomy (type 4 course): reported for the first time [^7433f672]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recurrent laryngeal nerve gains its name because after branching from the vagus nerve, it turns superiorly (recur) around the subclavian artery on the right and around the ligamentum arteriosum on the left, the nonrecurrent nerve has a straight direct course to the larynx and doesn't follow this course. It presents mostly on the right side. The presence of this variation places the nerve at higher risk of injury during neck surgery especially thyroid operations.

Case Presentation

A 45-year-old lady presented with painless thyroid enlargement for 1 year. Thyroid examination showed a 3-cm firm nodule at the right thyroid lobe with normal thyroid function tests. Right thyroid lobectomy was done and the histopathology showed a benign follicular lesion. During surgery, we discovered 2 nonrecurrent laryngeal nerves at the right side which were arising from the vagus nerve and both were entering the larynx.

Conclusion

Failure in identification of the nerve or overlooking the possibility of the non-recurrent laryngeal nerve may result in a serious sequelae of nerve damage, ipsilateral injury may lead to permanent hoarseness and bilateral injury may result in severe dyspnea or aphonia. Currently, there are 3 types of nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve courses. Type 1 passes near to the superior thyroid vessels. Type 2 (2A) passes parallel to the inferior thyroid artery and has a transverse course above it. Type 3 (2B) passes parallel to the inferior thyroid artery and transversely between branches of or under the inferior thyroid artery, we can add to this classification type 4, which are 2 nonrecurrent laryngeal nerves (double nerves) passing above and parallel to the inferior thyroid artery.

### Intraoperative laryngeal nerve monitoring during thyroidectomy… [^de625c6f]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Objective To determine whether nerve integrity monitor testing during thyroidectomy predicts recurrent larygeal nerve function after surgery. Design Prospective cohort outcomes study Patients The study included 210 consecutive patients with thyroid abnormalities who underwent thyroidectomy. Methods. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is one of the most concerning complications after thyroid surgery. Symptoms range from dysphonia to severe airway compromise. Reported rates of RLN injury range from 1% to 8%, with cases involving reexploration, radiation exposure, and large goiters resulting in a higher incidence of injury. Pathology reports and information regarding patients' preoperative and postoperative vocal cord mobility were reviewed and documented. Permanent vocal cord paralysis was defined as impaired mobility at 3 to 4 months after surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using a t test for continuous data. Statistical significance was set at P ≤.
05.

The final pathology report documented 92 multinodular goiters, 63 benign adenomas, 40 papillary carcinomas, 5 follicular cell carcinomas, 8 cases of Hashimoto thyroiditis, and 2 cases of Graves disease. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis or paresis was confirmed in 10 patients at 1 week after surgery. Five of 10 patients did not return beyond their 1 week postoperative appointment. Vocal cord dysfunction resolved in 4 of the 5 patients who did return, and 1 patient's dysfunction persisted at the 6-month follow-up visit. Analysis of the 10 cases of abnormal vocal cord mobility after surgery revealed 1 patient with an adenoma, 2 patients with papillary carcinoma, and 7 patients with multinodular goiter. The incidence of permanent paresis and/or paralysis of the RLN after thyroidectomy is low; however, such a condition causes serious sequelae and is the most common reason for legal claims.

Although intraoperative nerve monitoring was proposed more than 30 years ago, the prevalence of its use is low compared with facial nerve monitoring in parotid surgery. Postoperative laryngeal examinations are necessary to determine mobility of the RLN. Normal vocal quality does not ensure symmetrical vocal cord movement. The importance of intraoperative visual identification and adequate dissection of the nerve was also suggested by our study. Although only a statistical trend was observed, the normally functioning nerves were dissected to a greater length than the nerves that presented with paralysis or paresis 1 week after surgery.

Conclusion

Tracheal injury associated with thyroidectomy is very rare, but when it occurs, it can be dangerous. Tracheal perforation is generally not considered a complication as such but rather a technical occurrence during surgery that requires expeditious attention. A literature review revealed very few cases treated in different ways. Nevertheless, it would be good to standardise the treatments. Tracheal perforation, if encountered, needs to be managed appropriately in centres of expertise with a high volume of thyroidectomies.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^24e0d9ed]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Hoarseness/voice change after thyroid cancer surgery — incidence, risks, and referrals: Voice change has been reported in over 30% of patients in the long term even without nerve injury; after thyroid surgery, Dhillon et al. reported a 2.9% incidence of temporary and 0.2% permanent vocal fold paralysis in nerves that could be preserved in a single high-volume surgeon's hands. When a patient has a voice change that impacts quality of life, referral should be made to a laryngologist who works in tandem with a speech language pathologist to help achieve the best voice possible. Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury may result in dyspnea and the need for a tracheostomy, and every effort should be made to avoid this by avoiding a total thyroidectomy when a known recurrent laryngeal nerve injury follows initial lobe removal.

Discussion

Complication rates from total thyroidectomy are low. At present, mortality for this procedure is approximately 0%, and the overall complication rate is less than 3%. Major complications include wound infection (0.02–0.5%), haematoma (0.3–4.3%), transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (1–2%), permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (< 1%), transient hypoparathyroidism (1.6–50%) and permanent hypoparathyroidism (0–13%). During the period between 1997 and 2016, we performed 2150 thyroidectomies with the following percentage of complications: wound infection (0.002%), haematoma (1.3%), transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (1.5%), permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (0.2%), transient hypoparathyroidism (5.9%) and permanent hypoparathyroidism (0.3%).

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^3137338e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury and vocal fold paralysis rates — Estimates can be as high as 13% for thyroid cancer operations and as high as 30% for revision thyroid surgery; when the nerve is spared, incidence rates range from 0% to 5% based on the number of nerves at risk; following carotid endarterectomy, RLN injury rates range from 4% to 7% with permanent injury ranging 3% to 4%; and in anterior approaches to the cervical spine surgery RLN injury occurs in 1.5% to 6.4% of patients. Traditionally, surgeons report low rates (1%) of vocal fold paralysis after thyroid surgery, but a review of 27 articles reviewing over 25,000 patients undergoing thyroidectomy found an average temporary vocal fold paralysis rate of 9.8%, and European and UK quality registers have quoted rates between 2.5% and 4.3%, with administrators deeming these rates to be severely underestimated.

Thyroidectomy — patient discussion points for postoperative voice changes emphasize that voice changes can be significant, may include hoarseness or breathiness and breathing or swallowing symptoms, can suggest a vocal fold weakness, may not fully recover for over a year, should be discussed with a physician, and that early treatment and a range of options from noninvasive therapy to operations exist. Voice changes can be a significant problem after thyroidectomy. Voice changes may consist of hoarseness, weakness or breathiness of voice, or difficulty adjusting your volume or pitch. You may have noisy breathing, shortness of breath, tire easily from speaking, or a persistent cough or choking when swallowing. These voice changes may suggest that you have a weakness of a vocal fold. The voice may stabilize in a few months, but laryngeal nerves may take over a year to completely heal, and may never fully recover. Any voice change should be discussed with your physician. Some data suggest that an early treatment helps improve long-term healing. Treatments range from noninvasive voice therapy to operations.

### Complications of thyroid and parathyroid surgery [^48308083]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Today most complications of thyroid and parathyroid surgery are related to either metabolic derangements or injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Other complications include superior laryngeal nerve injury, infection, airway compromise, and bleeding. Although the principal goal of thyroid and parathyroid surgery is the prevention of these complications, prompt recognition and intervention will minimize morbidity and provide the patient with the best chance of a satisfactory outcome.

### What is the treatment of tracheal lesions associated with traditional thyroidectomy? Case report and systematic review [^e4bc5fe3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroidectomy is one of the most common surgical operations performed in endocrine surgery for benign and malignant thyroid disease. Complication rates from total thyroidectomy are low. At present, mortality for this procedure is approximately 0%, and the overall complication rate is less than 3%. These most commonly include vocal fold paresis or paralysis, hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcaemia, haematoma and wound infection. Tracheal injury associated with thyroidectomy is rare (less than 1%). The trachea may be perforated or lacerated intraoperatively, often recognised and repaired immediately with little patient morbidity. However, unrecognised injury or delayed rupture secondary to tracheal necrosis can present up to 2 weeks postoperatively. Because this complication occurs in less than one patient for most thyroid surgeons, it is unlikely that any individual will gather sufficient data to report the management in a series. There are no published reports describing the management of inadvertent tracheal perforation during thyroid surgery. Nevertheless, tracheal perforation, if encountered, needs to be managed appropriately. The aim of the present study was to review the literature with a focus on the various treatments based on time of injury and on different surgeons' personal experience.

Benign thyroid nodules — TA versus conventional thyroidectomy (meta-analysis): A meta-analysis of 7 studies involving 1289 patients compared TA with conventional thyroidectomy for benign thyroid nodules, finding TA was safer with significantly lower incidence of hoarseness, hypothyroidism, and postoperative pain, shorter hospitalization time, and better postoperative cosmetic effect, with no statistical difference for symptom improvement.

### True aneurysm of the inferior thyroid artery: a case report and literature review [^5a0b7ed4]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Aneurysms of the inferior thyroid artery (ITA) are extremely rare and potentially determine severe sequelae. We report a case of true ITA aneurysm in a 45-year-old Caucasian woman treated with endovascular embolization; postoperative course was uneventful and, at 6-month follow-up, the aneurysm is completely thrombized. A systematic review of the literature has been also performed to identify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics and diagnostic and operative options of this disease. Size alone is not able to predict the fate of the aneurysm and an aggressive treatment seems to be justified because of the high risk of complications in case of rupture. In an emergency setting, the endovascular procedures associated to hematoma evacuation or open surgery should be rapidly performed to save patient life.

### Laryngeal complications after thyroidectomy… [^e7a5d0e2]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Studies performed on large groups of patients show a prevalence for permanent palsy of the recurrent nerve ranging from 0% after primary surgery to 20% after revision surgery. 1–5 Tracheal intubation can lead to hoarseness as well. 6, 7 The incidence of laryngeal injuries caused by intubation is considered to be about 6% to 70% after surgical procedures not adjacent to the larynx. 6, 8–13 To date, there are few data concerning injuries to the vocal folds after surgery in close relationship to the larynx. Although Musholt et al14 and Lombardi et al15 report that hoarseness is increased and videolaryngoscopy was performed in patients undergoing thyroidectomy, the descriptions of vocal fold injury are missing. In smaller groups of patients undergoing thyroidectomy, laryngeal dysfunction was noted by Stojadinovic et al16 in 2 of 15 symptomatic and 2 of 30 asymptomatic patients and by de Pedro Netto et al17 in 28 of 100 patients.

In the present study, we sought to determine the incidence and characteristics of intubation-related vocal fold injuries after thyroidectomy in a large group of patients. All of these conditions resulted in incomplete closure of the rima glottidis or changes in the amplitude of the vocal fold vibration or movements of the mucosa wave and, therefore, caused hoarseness. 6, 9–14, 16, 19 Apart from these complications, weakness and paralysis of the recurrent nerve were considered separately because their origin after thyroidectomy is still unclear. Similar to other studies, 6, 10, 12 the most common finding in our study was thickening of the mucosa in the posterior parts of the vocal folds, followed by hematoma. Whether these alterations are caused by laceration or by gastroesophageal reflux remains unclear. It has been suggested that vocal fold injuries are frequently noted in the first days after surgery but that they heal quickly.

6, 8 Peppard and Dickens13 described healing of glottal hematomas within 4 weeks in 21 of 22 patients. Analysis of hoarseness with acoustic or perceptive measurements14-17 cannot be offered because of the large number of patients. However, because of the risk of persisting alterations with long-term impairment of the voice, we recommend laryngologic follow-up examinations for patients who use their voice professionally.

### Preoperative embolization of thyroid arteries in a patient with a large cervicomediastinal hyperfunctioning goiter [^198bd1fc]. Thyroid (2007). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 61-year-old male patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a large cervicomediastinal multinodular hyperfunctioning goiter that made thyroidectomy a daunting task, especially considering the risk of intraoperative bleeding. The preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan showed the right thyroid lobe very deeply rooted in the mediastinum, below the horizontal plane passing through the aortic arch. The thyroid mass imprinted the arterious and venous innominate trunks. To avoid a median sternotomy and remove the enlarged thyroid through a cervical approach alone, we decided to reduce the goiter in volume preoperatively by embolizing the thyroid arteries. We embolized the superior and inferior left, and the inferior right thyroid arteries. We spared the superior right thyroid artery because its blood supply contributed little to thyroid perfusion. After embolization, the patient was treated with antithyroid agents and corticosteroid drug therapy. At the same time, severe leukocytosis developed, thyroid hormone values increased, and a CT scan obtained 7 days after embolization showed the thyroid unchanged in volume. We therefore discharged the patient and were waiting for his laboratory blood chemical findings to return to normal. Thirty days later the patient was readmitted to hospital, and a new CT scan showed that the thyroid mass had diminished to half its initial volume. We could therefore perform a total thyroidectomy through a cervical approach alone. The only problem arose in dissecting tight right inferior laryngeal nerve adhesions to the thyroid capsule, probably sequelae of postembolization thyroiditis. Even though preoperative thyroid-artery embolization cannot be considered a routine technique in cervicomediastinal goiter surgery, in a rare patient who presents with a voluminous goiter such as the one we describe here, it is a useful procedure.

### Type I thyroplasty revision 1 year after a window was mistakenly created on the cricoid cartilage [^5c72391f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Unilateral vocal fold paralysis causes glottic incompetence and can result in significant morbidity. To prevent such morbidity, surgeons treat affected patients with vocal fold medialization techniques; type I thyroplasty medialization surgery is widely used for this purpose. In this procedure, a window is opened on the thyroid cartilage to allow for placement of a silicon prosthesis to medialize the vocal fold. A 38-year-old woman presented to our clinic for evaluation of hoarseness and a low-pitched voice, which we diagnosed as being caused by left vocal fold paralysis. Two years earlier, she had undergone a thyroidectomy for the treatment of benign thyroid disease. One year after that, she underwent type I thyroplasty medialization surgery at another center. During that operation, the surgeon had mistakenly created the window on the cricoid cartilage rather than the thyroid cartilage. When he inserted the silicon prosthesis into the cricoid window, the patient developed acute respiratory obstruction. At that point, the prosthesis was removed and the operation was terminated. One year later, she presented to us, and we performed a revision type I thyroplasty. Intraoperatively, we discovered that the original window had been opened on the cricoid cartilage instead of the thyroid cartilage, which was intact. We left the cricoid window untouched, opened a new window on the thyroid cartilage, and completed the type I thyroplasty in the usual fashion. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and she was doing well at 5 years of follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, no case of a thyroplasty window being opened on a cricoid cartilage has been reported in the literature.

Nonrecurrent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) — occurrence and surgical implications: Nonrecurrent RLN occurs in less than 1% of cases, is seen during right-sided thyroidectomy when it occurs, and arises directly from the cervical vagus; given its aberrant course, such a nerve may be more likely injured during thyroidectomy. It often occurs with an anomalous (retro-esophageal) right subclavian artery, and if a CT scan for a thyroid/neck mass notes a retro-esophageal subclavian artery, the surgeon should be on the lookout for a nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve; thyroidectomy surgeons should be intimately familiar with potential aberrations of these nerves.

### Partial thyroidectomy with incidental metastatic lymph nodes… [^e283df47]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Is completion thyroidectomy necessary for patients with incidental metastatic lymph nodes following partial thyroidectomy. Findings In this retrospective case series of 74 patients who underwent partial thyroidectomy and had incidental metastatic lymph nodes on final pathologic analysis, only 1 patient had regional recurrence after a median follow-up of 48 months. Completion thyroidectomy may be avoidable in appropriately selected patients with incidental metastatic lymph nodes after partial thyroidectomy for localized well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients found to have incidental metastatic lymph nodes on final pathologic analysis following partial thyroidectomy. Table 4 compares the histopathologic features of patients in the main cohort with the separate subset of patients who underwent immediate completion thyroidectomy.

Patients who underwent immediate completion thyroidectomy were more likely to have tall-cell PTC, multifocality, microscopic ETE and positive margins compared with patients who were observed. For patients who were followed up clinically and did not proceed with immediate completion thyroidectomy, the median follow-up was 48. 15 months. Three of 74 patients underwent delayed completion thyroidectomy at a median of 45 months due to increasing nodularity of the remaining contralateral thyroid lobe on surveillance ultrasonography. Two were found to be have benign nodules and 1 had a 2-mm microscopic PTC. No patients had adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment. The effect of incidentally found metastatic lymph nodes in the central neck on pathologic analysis following partial thyroidectomy is not well addressed in the literature.

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze outcomes of small-volume incidental perithyroidal metastatic lymph nodes on final pathologic analysis after partial thyroidectomy. In this study, only 1 patient experienced regional recurrence, which occurred at 41 months and involved both central and ipsilateral lateral cervical lymph nodes. Notably, this patient had tall-cell PTC with microscopic ETE and negative resection margins. The presence of tall-cell PTC may have played a role in this patient's outcome.

Laryngology — vocal fold dysfunction (VFD) definitions and incidence after thyroidectomy — VFD can be partial (paresis), complete (paralysis), temporary (resolves within 6 months of surgery), permanent (no resolution 12 mo after surgery), and unilateral and/or bilateral. A 2010 meta-analysis including more than 25,000 patients undergoing thyroidectomy reported a temporary VFD rate of 9.8% (range 1.4%–38%) and a permanent rate of 2.3% (0%–18.6%). Less commonly, VFD may be due to intubation alone; in a large retrospective study of 31,217 patients undergoing elective surgery, 0.077% experienced vocal fold paralysis believed to be due to intubation alone.

### Cervical hemorrhage due to spontaneous rupture of the superior thyroid artery: case report and review of the literature [^cb211741]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Beneath the different reasons for cervical masses, a spontaneous hemorrhage presents a rare and life-threatening condition.

Methods and Results

We present the rare case of a 62-year-old man who was presented with a dramatically enlarging cervical mass causing respiratory distress because of upper airway compression. An endotracheal intubation was lifesaving and avoided tracheotomy. A CT scan revealed a hematoma in the region of the left external carotid artery. An emergency angiography embolized a ruptured branch of the superior thyroid artery and surgery evacuated the hematoma. We discuss the rarity of the condition, reasons for a spontaneous rupture of the artery, and the diagnostic and treatment strategy. In addition, we review the literature on spontaneous thyroid artery hemorrhages, which, up to now, have been described only for the inferior thyroid artery.

Conclusion

We conclude that the optimal management for cases of cervical hematoma is intubation, diagnosis, and angiography before surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^d1edbaa5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroid surgery voice outcomes — core recommendations: The guideline development group made a strong recommendation that the surgeon should identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve(s) during thyroid surgery. The group made recommendations that the clinician or surgeon should document assessment of the patient's voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery; examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, if the patient's voice is impaired and a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery; examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery if the patient's voice is normal and the patient has (a) thyroid cancer with suspected extrathyroidal extension or (b) prior neck surgery that increases the risk of laryngeal nerve injury (carotid endarterectomy, anterior approach to the cervical spine, cervical esophagectomy, and prior thyroid or parathyroid surgery), or (c) both; educate the patient about the potential impact of thyroid surgery on voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery; inform the anesthesiologist of the results of abnormal preoperative laryngeal assessment in patients who have had laryngoscopy prior to thyroid surgery; take steps to preserve the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve(s) when performing thyroid surgery; document whether there has been a change in voice between 2 weeks and 2 months following thyroid surgery; examine vocal fold mobility or refer the patient for examination of vocal fold mobility in patients with a change in voice following thyroid surgery; refer a patient to an otolaryngologist when abnormal vocal fold mobility is identified after thyroid surgery; and counsel patients with voice change or abnormal vocal fold mobility after thyroid surgery on options for voice rehabilitation.

### Surgical management of anterior mediastinal tumors of thyroid origin: a comprehensive analysis of approaches, techniques, and outcomes [^e6e8bd64]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Some of the reported postoperative complications are tracheal collapse, RLN injury, prolonged mechanical ventilation, secondary hypoparathyroidism/hypocalcemia, hemorrhage, and wound infection. Tracheomalacia presents with low incidence (0–2%) after resection of substernal goiters. Other authors stated, that transient hypocalcemia occurs in 11.9%. Rates of permanent RLN injury following substernal goiter surgery are 2–4%. In our study, the intraoperative complications were present in 25% of patients (5/20) and the most common early postoperative complications (65%) were unilateral transient recurrent nerve paresis or paralysis and dysphonia (5/20, 25%). Our team used RLN identification as the well-accepted gold standard during thyroidectomy. There are four different surgical approaches (lateral, inferior, superior, and medial) that help in intraoperative identification of RLN. To note, the anatomical position of the nerve is commonly distorted, it must be identified at the cricothyroid junction or near the inferior thyroid artery, and careful management of Berry's ligament is necessary, because of its proximity to the RLN. Laryngeal electromyography (EMG) monitoring during surgery was not used by our team, because its effectiveness in AMTTO is controversial and our facility lacks the relevant equipment. Moreover, some articles stated that presently there is no conclusive data for the superiority or inferiority of IONM over intraoperative RLN visualization only for the prevention of RLN damage. We attribute the relatively high complication rate to the large dimensions of the tumors, long-standing disease history, mediastinal tumor position, and the predominantly used cervical approach, which hinders the view of dissection.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^0f93d6fa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroid surgery voice outcomes — surgeon/patient education discussion points specify that the surgeon should inquire about any preoperative voice change or hoarseness and that the surgeon/educator should complete a voice assessment preoperatively. The surgeon/educator should discuss risk factors for voice change following thyroid surgery, for example that in patients with large multinodular goiter, known extra thyroidal extension or re-operation in an area of previous neck surgery may increase risks of voice change, and should discuss possible surgical risks including injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN), division of the strap muscles, and potential intubation trauma. The surgeon/educator should discuss the potential benefits and need for preoperative laryngoscopy, and surgeons that use intraoperative nerve monitoring should discuss the rationale for use and the potential that bilateral surgery might not be completed based on information gained from monitoring. Postoperatively, patients should be instructed to notify providers if voice change lasts for more than 2 weeks, should have an assessment of their voice, and should be counseled that there are techniques to potentially improve voice and that early recognition of persistent voice change is important to success.

### Trans-oral video-assisted neck surgery (TOVANS). A new transoral technique of endoscopic thyroidectomy with gasless premandible approach [^ed397919]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

After arrival at the subplatysmal layer of the anterior neck skin, the platysma is separated from the strap muscles approximately at the level of the larynx, extending up to the suprasternal notch. Laterally, this dissection can be continued up to the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the tumor side and up to the opposite-side border of the trachea in the case of lobectomy. In the case of total or near-total thyroidectomy, lateral dissection is performed up to the medial borderline of the sternocleidomastoid muscles on both sides. After dissection of the subplatysmal plane, two Kirschner wires with a diameter of 1.2 mm are inserted horizontally in the subplatysmal layer of the anterior cervical area (Figs. 1 B, 3). Kirschner wires are lifted up by the retracting wire system fixed to the L-shaped pole above the patient's neck (Fig. 1 B). This anterior neck-skin lifting method without CO 2 insufflation creates an effective working space and provides an excellent view, avoiding postoperative subcutaneous emphysema.

Fig. 3
Dotted line shows detachment area and blue lines are Kirschner wires. Neck skin is lifted up mechanically by two Kirschner wire (Color figure online)

Avoiding the sternothyroid muscles laterally, the thyroid gland is revealed. The isthmus is transected with a Harmonic scalpel after blunt dissection of the thyroid gland from the trachea. Following the dissection of the upper pole, the superior thyroid artery and vein are divided (Fig. 4). The medial thyroid vein is also cut off by the Harmonic scalpel. After preparation of the retrothyroidal area, the recurrent laryngeal nerve is confirmed with certainty and the inferior thyroid artery is divided. The Berry ligament is then carefully divided while avoiding damage to the recurrent nerve, and thereafter the thyroid gland is removed (Fig. 5). In a total or near-total thyroidectomy, we perform this procedure in both sides. To be on the safe side, a slender drainage tube is placed beside the trachea (Fig. 6). Incisions in the mouth are closed with absorbable sutures.

### What is the treatment of tracheal lesions associated with traditional thyroidectomy? Case report and systematic review [^e0197ee3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Second scenario: trachea injury identified after the surgery

The second setting, which includes delayed tracheal rupture after a thyroid surgical procedure, seems to be less rare, but it too has only been described in case reports. As reported by Mazeh et al. in this setting, the thermal injury during the initial procedure is not recognised by the surgeon, and over the course of several days, tracheal necrosis surrounding the thermal injury results in an air leak to the surrounding tissues. These can lead to extensive subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema and severe dyspnoea. It can also adversely affect venous return to the heart. In addition, tracheal rupture may cause neck infections, which may lead to mediastinitis, mediastinal abscess and death. In addition to the above mentioned generic risk factors, the damage to the tracheal wall and possible development of a haematoma may create an environment in which bacteria can seed, resulting in infection and necrosis. Careful elicitation of history may reveal strenuous coughing or sneezing as a precipitating factor. Typically, these patients present on varying postoperative days with either subcutaneous emphysema or wound infection. Other symptoms may include neck or facial swelling, haemoptysis, retrosternal pain or hoarseness. Respiratory compromise may follow. The diagnosis is clinical and should be confirmed with a CT scan that rules out other causes of subcutaneous emphysema (such as spontaneous pneumothorax). CT may demonstrate the tracheal defect and provide localization. Of importance, a normal tracheal outline does not exclude the diagnosis. Flexible or rigid bronchoscopy may also locate the tracheal rupture. Nevertheless, some injuries may not be identified. Airway control should be a priority. Equipment should be on hand for performing an emergent tracheostomy if necessary. Rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia and orotracheal intubation with placement of the cuff distal to the site of injury is usually sufficient to control the airway. The management of delayed tracheal rupture after thyroidectomy should not differ from that of any other delayed tracheal injury. Despite past assumptions that surgical treatment is indicated in all cases, recent studies have identified a subset of patients who could and should be managed conservatively. If necessary, surgery must not be delayed. Potential patient morbidity can include neck abscess, mediastinitis, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade and tension pneumomediastinum. Mortality has been reported. By review of literature data in this setting, we found 15 case reports (Table 1). Five case reports reported patients affected by Grave's disease. The other five patients were affected by malignant disease of the thyroid gland and only one by bilateral adenoma. The diagnosis of tracheal injury occurred between the 1st and 15th postoperative day. In most of these patients, necrosis was found, and culture revealed bacterial infection in 3/15 patients by Beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus. The management depends on the authors and was very different among them. In all cases where necrosis was present, debridement of the devitalized trachea was necessary. Primary conservative treatment (bed rest, antibiotic and cough suppressants) was attempted by Conzo et al. with success and by Mazeh et al with failure. The first was a very small laceration (1.5 mm). Primary closure of the wound with absorbable suture, with or without drains, was attempted first by different authors and Mazeh et al. after conservative treatment failure. Bertolaccini et al and Sanna et al opted for a muscle flap stitched with an absorbable suture on the defect. There was no necrosis or infection in these patients, and this procedure was successful. Other authors reported good results with primary sutures with a patch of fibrinogen-thrombin-coated collagen or a myovascular transposition flap in conjunction with a Tisseel tissue-bonding agent after conservative treatment failure. In contrast, large extension of a tracheal tear and a wide necrosis or infection contraindicated a primary repair. Golger et al, after debridement, chose to partially close the trachea around a no. 11 Montgomery T-tube with adjacent strap muscles that were removed after 3 months. Jacqmin et al preferred circumferential tracheal excision with anastomosis. Chauhan et al, after debridement, chose tracheostomy (removed 14 days postoperative) and a drain. Finally, Han et al. proposed a tracheal stent that was implanted to cover the entire lesion complicated by abscess. Use of a covered tracheal stent for treatment of tracheal rupture represents a minimally invasive technique that can be performed under local anaesthesia by interventional radiologists. The procedure is likely to be especially suited to patients with poor general condition. The implantation can be performed quickly (usually 3–5 min) and results in effective and instant coverage of the site of tracheal rupture.

### Recurrent multinodular goitre and primary hyperparathyroidism due to adenoma arising in a parathyroid autotransplant more than 20 years after near-total thyroidectomy [^9d29596b]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The patient is a female in her 60s with a remote history of a near-total thyroidectomy in 1997 for multinodular goitre. At the initial operation, she sustained a left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. A devascularised parathyroid gland was autotransplanted into the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. She had been off of thyroid hormone for long periods, and her most recent levothyroxine requirement had fallen to only 25 mcg daily. The patient presented more than 20 years after her thyroidectomy with hoarseness, fatigue and dyspnoea. Laboratory studies suggested primary hyperparathyroidism. Imaging demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli and bulky thyroid tissue extending into her mediastinum. She underwent a completion thyroidectomy with the removal of a parathyroid adenoma arising in the autotransplanted parathyroid. This case illustrates the possibility of regrowth of benign thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of a parathyroid adenoma arising from autotransplantation of a normal parathyroid.

A 42-yr-old woman presented with hyperthyroidism and a large, firm, irregular goiter. Within a few weeks she became hypothyroid. Five months later she developed increasingly severe neck pain and compressive symptoms. The goiter had become rock hard. A fine needle aspiration biopsy showed features of chronic thyroiditis and fibrosis. She partially responded to a course of glucocorticoids. Tamoxifen was added, with marked improvement in goiter size and pain. Both medications were tapered off. Two months later the patient experienced paresthesias of the fingertips, perioral numbness, and a seizure. She was found to have spontaneous primary hypoparathyroidism. Three months later the patient became hoarse and experienced difficulty in breathing. She was found to have a massively enlarged thyroid with compression of the right internal jugular vein and encasement of the right carotid artery as well as tracheal narrowing. She also had right vocal cord paralysis due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement. Because of airway compromise, an emergency isthmusectomy was performed, and the patient was given a postoperative course of glucocorticoids with gradual improvement. Postoperative diagnosis was Riedel's thyroiditis. Two months later she presented with near-syncope and was found to have bradycardia, hypotension, and right Horner's syndrome, presumably due to compression of the right carotid sheath. She was given i.v. glucocorticoids and tamoxifen. Six months later and 18 months after her initial presentation, the patient is doing remarkably well. Her goiter has regressed by more than 50%, and she no longer has any pain or difficulty breathing. She remains a little hoarse and has persistent hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. She is taking prednisone (5 mg, this is being tapered very slowly) and tamoxifen (20 mg) daily. This case illustrates the protean manifestations of Riedel's thyroiditis, a rare but fascinating disease. The epidemiology of this disease, its pathophysiology and complications, and the roles of surgery and medical therapy are reviewed.

Statement 6. Protection of superior laryngeal nerve — thyroid surgery: The surgeon should take steps to preserve the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve(s) when performing thyroid surgery. Recommendation based on preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, with Benefit described as Preserves vocal projection and high frequencies, Risk, harm, cost noted as May leave superior pole thyroid tissue, and Benefit-harm assessment stated as Preponderance of benefit, with Policy level: Recommendation. The thyroid surgeon should exercise surgical techniques to preserve the EBSLN, which include identification and/or stimulation of the superior pedicle, and at the very least, the surgeon should ensure that the EBSLN is not injured at the time of dividing tissue at the superior pole by identification of its course or excluding its presence in the divided tissue visually or by nerve monitoring. Supportive evidence cited on-page includes that in 1992 Cernea et al reported a randomized controlled trial of 76 patients in which neuromonitoring of the EBSLN was associated with the best 30 day results, and a randomized control trial done in 2009 showed that nerve monitoring of both RLN and EBSLN resulted in reduced risk of early phonation changes, but at 3 months, these changes become insignificant.

Secondary endpoints analysis

The anatomical variability of the EBSLN found in this study according to Cernea classification (Fig. 2) is presented in Table 2. Identification rate of all types of EBSLN was significantly improved among patients operated with the use of the IONM system, including type 2A and type 2B, which are particularly prone to injury during dissection and ligation of the superior pole thyroid vessels (by 6.7% and 7.6%, respectively).

On functional voice assessment, the following differences were found at 2–3 weeks after surgery for operations without vs. with IONM: a 10% or higher decrease in phonation parameters was found in 10% vs. 2% patients for MPT (p = 0.018), 13% vs. 2% for VL (p = 0.003), and 9% vs. 1% for Fo (p = 0.03), and a change in the GRBAS scale > 4 points in 7% vs. 1% (p = 0.03), respectively (details in Table 4). The majority of patients with decreased voice parameters at 2–3 weeks after surgery improved their voice performance at 3 months after operation and the initially observed differences between both study groups became nonsignificant.

### New operative surgical concept of two fascial layers enveloping the recurrent laryngeal nerve [^63fbda2d]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Avoiding recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury is aided by a precise anatomical understanding of the RLN before entry into the larynx where it is at greatest risk.

Methods

A literature review and study of 977 RLNs at operation have been used to describe the last 2 cm of the anatomical course of the extralaryngeal RLN.

Results

The tertiary branches of the inferior thyroid artery pass in a superficial vascular fascial layer anterolateral to the RLN. The tubercle of Zuckerkandl and the superior parathyroid glands lie within this superficial vascular fascial covering layer. The RLN lies on a deeper layer of more fibrous tissue, the ligament of Berry. In all 977 RLNs, the RLN was sandwiched between an anterolateral vascular layer and a medial layer, the ligament of Berry.

Conclusions

The site of greatest risk during thyroidectomy to the RLN is in the 2-cm course of the extralaryngeal nerve above the trunk of the inferior thyroid artery where tension forms an artificial genu of the nerve. Once the superficial vascular fascial and Berry's ligament layers are released, the nerve falls back into the tracheoesophageal groove and adopts a serpiginous appearance, indicating completeness of the dissection of the lobe from the lateral trachea and division of the ligament of Berry.

### Variable relationship of the recurrent laryngeal nerve to the inferior thyroid artery: a meta-analysis and surgical implications [^eff844ff]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and inferior thyroid artery (ITA) is highly variable and traceable back to embryological life.

Methods

Comprehensive database searches were conducted, followed by judgment of eligibility, assessment, and extraction of data concerning the RLN/ITA relationship. The data were pooled into a meta-analysis and subjected to sex, side-based, geographic origin of study, and study modality subgroup analyses.

Results

Seventy-nine studies (n = 14,269 nerves) reported data on the relationship of the RLN to the ITA. The left versus right-sided comparison revealed stark differences: RLNs were predominantly posterior (62.6% vs 37.0%) and anterior (17.2% vs 37.1%) on the left and right sides, respectively.

Conclusion

Symmetry of neurovascular relationships should not be assumed. Extra care should be taken during procedures on the right side, because the nerves are significantly more likely to present in patterns (anterior and between) associated with greater risk of iatrogenic injury. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### American Thyroid Association statement on optimal surgical management of goiter [^b69e0a89]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association surgical management of goiter — postoperative care and complications are outlined as follows: When airway problems such as stridor occur after large goiter resection, the best option is to "evaluate the vocal cords with fiberoptic endoscopy and reintubation", and "Tracheostomy can usually be avoided until re-evaluation of the patient 24–48 hours later", with "Strong consideration should be given to observing patients for a period of time after resection of a large goiter". Complications are similar to standard thyroid surgery and "include bleeding, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hoarseness of voice, inability to raise the voice, and temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism". Regarding tracheomalacia, "severe tracheomalacia requiring tracheal resection is a rare condition" and "Special management of tracheomalacia such as Silastic rings or tracheopexy is rarely necessary in patients with large goiters". If parathyroids are devascularized, "frozen-section examination of a portion can be utilized to confirm the presence of parathyroid tissue and then local parathyroid autotransplantation into neck muscle can be performed". Postoperatively, levothyroxine is initiated — "The usual dose is 1.4–1.6 μg/kg per day (of actual body weight), with plans for TSH testing 4–6 weeks postoperatively and titration as needed" — and "A follow-up appointment with the surgeon and/or endocrinologist should be included as well".

### Extra-laryngeal branching of recurrent laryngeal nerve: a possibility thyroid surgeons need to keep in mind to prevent inadvertent nerve injury [^91ee0f9a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 45-year-old woman presented with a neck swelling since the past 6 years. The swelling was painless but slowly and progressively increasing in size. On examination, a thyroid swelling of size approximately 6×4cm was seen on the left side. Ultrasonography revealed the size to be 6×5cm with microcalcifications. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed the mass to be papillary carcinoma. She was planned for total thyroidectomy with central compartment clearance. Preoperative assessment including thyroid hormone profile was normal and the patient was taken for surgery after proper anaesthesia clearance. During the surgery, it was found that there was a branching of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The branching was confirmed with nerve monitor and careful dissection was done to prevent injuries. The surgery was completed successfully without any nerve damage and the postoperative period was uneventful. Follow-up assessments revealed no signs of nerve injury like hoarseness of voice. Possibility of abnormal branches and duplication of nerves though uncommon should not be underestimated and extra vigilance and caution must be exercised when operating near a nerve, even by an experienced surgeon familiar with the local anatomy. Any doubts arising during the surgery must be clarified immediately, and nerve monitors should be used to check suspected branching and duplications before proceeding further.

### The necessity for a thoracic approach in thyroid surgery… [^05f72b90]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Symptoms of compression, including respiratory distress, dyspnea, hoarseness, dysphagia, and persistent cough, at the thoracic inlet were the most common presenting symptoms. Two patients required emergency hospitalization for respiratory distress. Both of these patients had recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis and severe tracheal compression from the mediastinal mass. Twenty-two of these patients had normal results on thyroid function studies. Four patients were hyperthyroid, manifested only by a suppressed thyrotropin level with no overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism. One patient had a suppressed thyrotropin level, elevated levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine, severe symptoms of hyperthyroidism, dysphagia, hoarseness, and a large mediastinal mass. Patients with hoarseness or even severe hoarseness did not always demonstrate loss of vocal cord function.

Three patients with hoarseness and 2 with severe hoarseness and marked tracheal compression demonstrated normally functioning vocal cords. The voice in each of these patients returned to normal with removal of the mediastinal mass and correction of the tracheal compression. A paralyzed vocal cord was demonstrated preoperatively in 4 patients. Three of these patients had a malignant neoplasm, and 1 had a benign tumor. Five patients in this study required a partial sternotomy at the initial surgery for deep extension of a benign anterior mediastinal mass. In all 5 of these patients, the mass extended inferiorly to the level of the pericardium. All 5 patients had a multinodular colloid goiter. The other patient who developed a recurrence after initial surgery at our institution underwent a total thyroidectomy and paratracheal and thymic node dissection for a papillary carcinoma that recurred at the site of the original tumor 3 years after the initial surgery.

Dense scar from the previous surgery; inability to medially rotate the thyroid to identify the recurrent nerve; and adherence to the mediastinal pleura, vascular structures, or both were the technical reasons that necessitated a thoracic approach in this group of patients. Two patients had recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis. Both of these patients had a malignant neoplasm. This complication occurred at the initial surgery in 1 of these patients and at reoperative surgery in the other. Two patients with a papillary carcinoma and bilateral paratracheal node metastasis experienced permanent hypoparathyroidism.

### An unusual case of stridor after thyroidectomy [^10613f94]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Twelve days after subtotal thyroidectomy, an air pocket developed in a patient's neck. The pressure in this pocket had gradually increased as small amounts of air, probably associated with coughing, came out of a tiny hole in the trachea to form a pneumocoele. This produced limited surgical emphysema, causing venous congestion and oedema of the soft tissues of the larynx, which in turn led to increasing airway obstruction. We believe that this is the first reported case of a pneumocoele that gradually increased in size, causing airway obstruction that was almost certainly due to secondary laryngeal oedema.

### Vocal fold paresis and paralysis: what the thyroid surgeon should know [^6d760225]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The thyroid surgeon must have a thorough understanding of laryngeal neuroanatomy and be able to recognize symptoms of vocal fold paresis and paralysis. Neuropraxia may occur even with excellent surgical technique. Patients should be counseled appropriately, particularly if they are professional voice users. Preoperative or early postoperative changes in voice, swallowing, and airway function should prompt immediate referral to an otolaryngologist. Early recognition and treatment may avoid the development of complications and improve patient quality of life.

### Innervation of the cricothyroid muscle by extralaryngeal branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve [^b995e2be]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

We report here the presence of extralaryngeal branches of the RLN that inversely innervated the CTM, which has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. These patients carried a high risk of paralysis of these branches during thyroid surgery, possibly undergoing voice changes following thyroid surgery. The clinical implications and the incidence of this phenomenon remain to be clarified.

Patients with aortic arch malformations may present with recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve abnormalities that require special attention. Herein, we reported a case of thyroid surgery in a patient with a right aortic arch. The left inferior laryngeal nerve was presumed to be the right inferior laryngeal nerve by confirming the location of the aortic arch and subclavian artery, and the presence of the ductus arteriosus on preoperative computed tomography.

### A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve in a patient with right-sided aorta, truncus arteriosus communis, and an aberrant left innominate artery [^d71fc633]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

The identification and prevention of injury to the inferior laryngeal nerve is one of the main issues in thyroid surgery. Sound knowledge of anatomic variants of the nerve is of major importance. In rare cases the nerve does not run the recurrent way and it is therefore difficult to identify the nerve. Abnormal developments of the aortic arch during embryogenesis include malformation of the great vessels and can be the reason for anatomic abnormalities. A cause for a nonrecurrent nerve on the right side is the so-called lusorian artery, a right retroesophageal subclavian artery. Left-sided nonrecurrent nerves are seldom if ever documented. Only two cases have been published so far of patients with situs inversus viscerum, where left nonrecurrent nerves were associated with inverse, left-sided lusorian arteries.

Step 6: Recurrent laryngeal nerve identification and dissection

After proper tracheal exposure and division of the inferior thyroid veins, gentle medial and upward traction of the target lobe will bring the inferior parathyroid gland in full sight.

Careful gentle downward dissection of the inferior parathyroid gland off the true thyroid capsule is then attempted with preservation of the delicate blood supply to the parathyroid gland. After competition of this step, the inferior thyroid artery glandular branches could be visualized. Gentle dissection in plane below or between these branches will expose the RLN which is then followed cephalad for a short distance till approaching the berry's ligament (Fig. 5 b).

Step 7: Identification and protection of the superior parathyroid gland

Dissection is then shifted toward the upper aspect of the target lobe. With good medial traction of the upper part of the target lobe, the superior parathyroid gland with its sentinel fat pad could be identified and preserved (Fig. 5 c).

Step 8: Proper exposure of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and upper pole dissection and division

This is another cornerstone step in the procedure, in which we follow the lower border of the upper thyroid pole by dissecting the loose areolar tissue in this region with sealing of the small, encountered blood vessels until the fibers of inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle (IPCM) of the pharynx is identified (Fig. 6 a).

### Patient-reported dysphagia after thyroidectomy… [^0f306419]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Of 26 patients surveyed, 80% perceived dysphagia 2 weeks after thyroidectomy; 42% at 6 weeks; and 17% at 6 months after total thyroidectomy. In contrast, few patients had any abnormalities found by clinical assessment or instrumental swallowing evaluation that warranted further follow-up, and these few abnormalities occurred only at the 2-week follow-up, not beyond. Symptoms of dysphagia and related effects on quality of life elicited through grounded theory analysis of semistructured interviews with patients after thyroidectomy designed to foster an open-ended, patient-driven discussion. Results. Thyroid cancer rates have increased at least 3-fold across the last few decades, 1, 2 with over 63 000 incident cases diagnosed annually. 3 The primary treatment modality for thyroid cancer is total thyroidectomy.

4–8 Swallowing complaints are common after surgery, but patients are generally counseled that symptoms should spontaneously resolve within the immediate 2-week postoperative period. 9 Mechanistically, postoperative swallowing dysfunction can affect the oropharyngeal and pharyngoesophageal phases, 5, 10 often resulting in globus sensation, choking, psychological stress, and reduced quality of life. 5, 8, 10, 11. The most commonly reported individual symptoms identified 2 weeks postoperatively were "lump in throat", "coughing", and "trouble swallowing". At both 6 weeks and 6 months, "lump in throat" was the most commonly identified symptom from the prompts. Our findings suggest that dysphagia symptoms are more common than previously reported5-7 and that they can persist for months following surgery.

Specifically, we found that at least 80% of patients had dysphagia symptoms 2 weeks postoperatively and, while that percentage reduced over the 6-month study period, dysphagia symptoms persisted in some cases, suggesting that further surveillance of these symptoms may be required. Interestingly, these symptoms rarely had objective correlates on instrumental swallowing assessment. Thus, the best way to understand these symptoms is by surveying and listening to patients using qualitative approaches.

### Microsurgical anatomy of the laryngeal nerves as related to thyroid surgery [^2ba86aac]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives were to explore microsurgical anatomy of the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves and their importance in thyroid surgery, and to examine areas of potential morbidity, means of identification, and arterial supply of the laryngeal nerves.

Study Design

Descriptive analysis of anatomical features.

Methods

Twenty-one adult cadavers, some perfused with colored silicon, were dissected for the study project.

Results

The right recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) branches off the vagus at the level of the subclavian artery and the left one at the level of the aorta. Both ascend parallel to the tracheoesophageal groove and innervate trachea, esophagus, and the inferior pharyngeal constrictors en route. The RLN has the highest probability to pass between the branches of the inferior thyroid artery on the right side and posterior to them on the left side. The RLN always passes posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The RLN is supplied by the branches of the inferior thyroid artery. The superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) branches into internal and external branches deep to the carotid bifurcation. The internal branch passes deep to the superior thyroid artery and descends toward thyrohyoid membrane. The external branch travels deep and parallel to the superior thyroid artery to innervate cricothyroid muscle. The internal branch is supplied by the superior laryngeal artery, and the external branch by the cricothyroid artery.

Conclusions

The only consistent location of the RLN is when it passes posterior to the cricothyroid joint. Because of extreme variability of the inferior thyroid artery and the RLN, it is suggested that the artery be ligated either proximally or at its tertiary branches on thyroid capsule. The internal branch of the SLN is not potentially at risk during thyroidectomy unless the superior thyroid artery is ligated proximally. The external branch of the SLN accompanies the superior thyroid artery for most of its course and is at potential risk if the trunk of the superior thyroid artery is ligated outside the pretracheal fascia.

Surgical complications — frequency, examples, and impact of surgeon volume are summarized: The most common significant complications of thyroidectomy are hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, which occur more frequently after total thyroidectomy, and transient clinical hypoparathyroidism postoperatively is common in adults undergoing total thyroidectomy. One study reported hypocalcemia in 5.4% of patients immediately after total thyroidectomy, persisting in only 0.5% of patients 1 year later, while another study reported a 3.4% incidence of long-term recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and a 1.1% incidence of permanent hypocalcemia. Superior laryngeal nerve injury is under-reported and negatively impacts voice projection and high pitch range. A study of 5860 patients found that surgeons who performed more than 100 thyroidectomies a year had the lowest overall complication rate (4.3%), whereas surgeons who performed fewer than 10 thyroidectomies a year had four times as many complications.

Results

The mean age was 66.8 years (34–84 years) and the majority of patients were female (15/20, 75%).

AMTTO caused symptoms in 18/20 (90%) of patients. The major complaints were neck swelling (17/20, 85%), shortness of breath, and fatigue (each in 14/20, 70%) (Fig. 1). Less common symptoms include chest tightness and pain (4/20, 20%), superior vena cava syndrome (edema, collaterals of the head, neck, upper limbs, and anterior chest wall) (4/20, 20%), cough (3/20, 15%), hoarseness (2/20, 10%), palpitations (1/20, 5%), upper limb swelling (1/20, 5%), dysphagia (1/20, 5%), limb pain and pathological fracture due to primary hyperparathyroidism (1/20, 5%). In 2 patients the disease was asymptomatic and was detected on prophylactic ultrasound thyroid follow-up.

Fig. 1
Symptoms in patients with AMTTO

Physical examination revealed a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with a nodular surface, painless on palpation, dense-elastic consistency, poor mobility, and mediastinal descendance. Stridor and hoarseness were present in 4 patients (20%). The majority of patients were euthyroid (19/20, 95%), and 1 patient was with hypothyroidism. It should be noted that 1 patient was with hyperparathyroidism.

The most common concomitant disease was arterial hypertension (14/20, 70%). In 5 patients (25%) a recurrent disease was diagnosed after previous surgery: 3 — nodular goiter; 1 — adenoma of a parathyroid gland; 1 — paraganglioma. In 2 patients (10%) a synchronous tumor was detected (1 — carcinoma of the left auricle; 1 — breast cancer).

American Thyroid Association — dysphonia evaluation in goiter includes laryngoscopy. Preoperative laryngoscopy to assess laryngeal vocal cord function should be considered for patients undergoing thyroidectomy for goiter, especially in the setting of prior thyroid or other anterior neck surgery. Indirect or fiberoptic laryngoscopy should be performed for patients with dysphonia to evaluate laryngeal nerve function and/or causes such as laryngeal neoplasm or other causes.

Completion thyroidectomy — In the absence of imaged structural disease, there is no indication for reoperative prophylactic central neck dissection for any thyroid cancer histology. Recommendation 64 states to consider completion thyroidectomy for high risk disease and/or when postoperative radioiodine (RAI) therapy is indicated (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 65 states that total thyroidectomy should be performed for patients undergoing prophylactic thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid cancer (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Voice assessment should always occur prior to completion thyroidectomy, and if recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction is present, options include deferring completion thyroidectomy until function has improved or 2-stage ablation of the remaining lobe with RAI.

Graves' disease (GD) — high-volume thyroid surgeon referral (Recommendation 28) states that if surgery is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, the patient should be referred to a high-volume thyroid surgeon, with a strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Outcomes data indicate that surgeons who perform more than 25 thyroid surgeries per year have superior outcomes, and complication rates are 51% higher with low-volume surgeons; in high-volume hands, permanent hypoparathyroidism has been determined to be < 2% and permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury occurs in < 1%. The frequency of bleeding necessitating reoperation is 0.3%–0.7%, mortality following thyroidectomy is between 1 in 10,000 and 5 in 1,000,000, and the surgeon should be thoroughly trained in the procedure and have performed a significant number of thyroidectomies with a low frequency of complications.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^44d53c19]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Preoperative voice evaluation in thyroidectomy — When evaluating patients for thyroidectomy the surgeon should assess voice function and quality, and most cases simple auditory assessment by the surgeon to be an acceptable initial method. In a retrospective review of 464 patients, surgeon assessment combined with knowledge of prior neck surgery was more sensitive than patient-reported voice change, although voice quality was not assessed using a validated instrument. In a meta-analysis, only 3% of patients reporting preoperative dysphonia had VFD after thyroidectomy, whereas documented VFD occurs with incidences ranging from 0%–87% when patients report no changes in voice quality.

### Intrathyroidal carotid artery and nonrecurring right recurrent laryngeal nerve: a case report [^21dbc60f]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Background

When performing thyroidectomy, knowledge of normal anatomy and variants is vital to avoid injuring nearby structures. Typically, the bilateral carotids course posterolateral to the thyroid gland. We describe a rare variant of an intrathyroidal carotid artery, not previously described in the literature.

Methods

A 23-year-old woman with a strong family history of thyroid cancer presented with a left thyroid nodule, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealing papillary thyroid carcinoma. She underwent total thyroidectomy.

Results

Intraoperatively, the carotid was found coursing centrally through the right lobe parenchyma, associated with an ipsilateral nonrecurrent recurrent laryngeal nerve (NRLN) entering the cricothyroid joint superolaterally.

Conclusion

This is, to our knowledge, the first report of such an anatomic variant in the medical literature. Aberrant carotid artery anatomy may potentially cause life-threatening surgical complications and should be considered preoperatively. Furthermore, recognition of concurrent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) anomalies with vascular variations allows identification of nonrecurrent nerves.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^3a6751b6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) anatomy and function — neural pathways and sensory-motor roles: Cortical representation of the larynx projects to bilateral brainstem nuclei (including nucleus ambiguous), which then projects to the ipsilateral larynx. The RLN carries branchial efferents to the inferior constrictor, cricopharyngeous, and all laryngeal intrinsic muscles except the cricothyroid muscle; laryngeal motor fibers within the RLN have a 4 to 1 adductor to abductor ratio, and the RLN also contains afferent fibers that mediate sensation from the vocal folds and below including the upper esophagus and trachea.

### Ten-year follow-up of a randomized clinical trial of total thyroidectomy versus dunhill operation versus bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy for multinodular non-toxic goiter [^6e0f4243]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical technique

All the operations were performed by one of the three experienced endocrine surgeons involved in the study. Each of them performed approximately one-third of the operations in each study arm. In the TT group, the operation consisted of extracapsular total thyroidectomy, and in the DO group, the operation consisted of unilateral extracapsular total thyroidectomy and contralateral subtotal thyroid lobe resection (leaving a thyroid stump of approximately 2 g of normal remnant tissue), whereas in the ST group, the operation consisted of bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy (leaving thyroid stumps of approximately 2 g of normal remnant tissue each on both sides of the neck). In each group, efforts were made to identify and remove the entire pyramidal thyroid lobe. In each patient, the recurrent laryngeal nerves were exposed and the branches of the superior and inferior thyroid arteries were divided close to the thyroid capsule (peripheral ligation). Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) was not used for initial surgery in this study. However, IONM was utilized for 15 of 20 (75%) revision operations for recurrent goiter in this study, depending on individual surgical preferences. A lateral approach was routinely used for all reoperative cases. The surgical technique of reoperation for recurrent goiter was described in detail in our previous publication. The parathyroid glands were meticulously dissected from the thyroid gland, and effort was made to identify all the four parathyroid glands and preserve as many as possible "in situ". Any inadvertently removed parathyroid gland found on inspection to be lying on the thyroid capsule, any gland that was anatomically impossible to be preserved, as well as any devascularized gland were electively reimplanted into the sternocleidomastoid muscle using the standard technique of parathyroid autotransplantation as described by Wells et al.

### Outpatient thyroidectomy: is it safe? [^7b915a46]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Outpatient thyroid surgery is controversial because of concerns over life-threatening cervical hematoma. Despite this concern, outpatient thyroidectomy is becoming increasingly common, especially among high-volume endocrine surgeons. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that careful patient selection combined with surgeon experience can result in successful and safe surgery without a full inpatient admission. This article reviews the data on safety and outcomes for outpatient thyroidectomy and discusses several techniques used to minimize risk to patients.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^35cf66c5]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Goiter and thyroiditis — indications for surgery are outlined: Most asymptomatic goiters in euthyroid patients can be safely observed, but many surgeons consider surgery for goiters causing dyspnea, dysphagia, tracheal or esophageal compression, or thoracic outlet syndrome, as well as for nodular goiter with substantial cosmetic concern. Although most patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are managed medically, surgery is occasionally necessary in hypothyroid patients with significant compressive symptoms, progressive enlargement, or suspicion of malignancy. Commonly, progressive enlargement of a nontoxic goiter may prompt consideration of resection to prevent future development of symptoms, and some asymptomatic patients may request thyroidectomy because their goiter is cosmetically unappealing.

When examining problems occurring within the first 24 h after surgery, it was found that patients experienced pain, difficulty swallowing, throat pain, dry mouth, nausea/vomiting, tingling and hoarseness, Chvostek's sign, tremors (tetany), Trousseau's sign, and bleeding. In studies investigating early and late complications after thyroidectomy, investigating early and late complications after thyroidectomy, hoarseness was observed in 33.3% of patients, difficulty swallowing in 32.8%, and hematoma formation in 0.53% of patients in another study. Kwon et al. reported no bleeding in any patients after thyroidectomy, while transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy occurred in 11.5% and permanent in 2.3%.

In the study by Reizian et al. (2023) examining postoperative pain, all patients in the control group and 90% of patients in the intervention group experienced neck pain within the first 24 h. This was observed in 100% and 83.3% of patients before discharge. One week after surgery, neck pain was observed in 83.3% of the intervention group and most of the control group (90%). In another study examining pain, it was reported that the median pain score for patients was 5, with 53% of them transitioning to chronic pain. In an experimental study investigating the effect of neck exercises on postoperative pain conducted by Türkmen et al. (2022), the mean pain score on the first day after surgery was 2.20 ± 2.22 for the intervention group and 3.00 ± 2.10 for the control group, with no statistically significant difference found.

### Airway management of a life-threatening post-thyroidectomy haematoma [^08a25ce9]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Neck haematomas are rare but potentially life-threatening complications of thyroid surgery. Postoperative monitoring, early diagnosis and immediate management are critical, as this condition can rapidly lead to compression and obstruction of the upper airway. We present a case of a 69-year-old woman who suffered respiratory failure resulting from a post-thyroidectomy haematoma with airway obstruction and severe haemodynamic compromise, presenting a difficult anaesthetic challenge. Following development of a likely 'cannot intubate, cannot ventilate' situation despite haematoma evacuation, the patient underwent emergency cricothyroidotomy, before rapid sequence intubation and subsequent surgical haemostasis.

Total thyroidectomy has significantly changed over the years from a morbid procedure to one that is performed routinely on an outpatient basis. This article reviews the history of thyroid surgery with regard to hemostasis, discusses surgical vascular anatomy, and describes the methods of hemostasis. It compares traditional hemostatic surgical techniques with newer techniques such as the Harmonic Scalpel and LigaSure hand pieces. The use of adjunctive hemostatic agents and indications for a drain in thyroid are discussed.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^f7d2b50b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroid surgery voice outcomes — burden and target population: About 1 in 10 patients experience temporary laryngeal nerve injury after surgery, with longer lasting voice problems in up to 1 in 25. The purpose of this guideline is to optimize voice outcomes for adult patients aged 18 years or older after thyroid surgery and applies to any setting in which clinicians may interact with patients before, during, or after thyroid surgery. Children under age 18 years are specifically excluded from the target population, and patients undergoing concurrent laryngectomy are also excluded, while although this guideline is limited to thyroidectomy, some of the recommendations may extrapolate to parathyroidectomy as well.

### Clinical trials of active surveillance of papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid [^cf7367d2]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

However, the incidences of unfavorable events such as temporary VCP, temporary hypoparathyroidism, and permanent hypoparathyroidism were significantly higher in the immediate surgery group than in the active surveillance group (4.1 vs. 0.6%, p < 0.0001; 16.7 vs. 2.8%, p < 0.0001; and 1.6 vs. 0.08%, p < 0.0001, respectively). Unfortunately, 2 (0.2%) of the immediate surgery group incurred permanent VCP postoperatively. One was caused by accidental transection of the RLN. Transected nerve ends were anastomosed immediately; however, the vocal cord on that side remained immobile. The other was accidental ligation of the RLN. The ligation thread was released, but VCP persisted. These operations were performed by well-experienced endocrine surgeons at Kuma Hospital, Center for Excellence in Thyroid Care. You might think that surgeries for PMC are simple and easy. However, human errors can occur even while performing simple and easy actions. This is the reality. If surgeries had been done by less experienced surgeons, the incidences of these unfavorable events would have been much higher.

A 49-year-old woman came to see me after she underwent hemithyroidectomy and neck dissection for PMC that was detected by a thyroid cancer screening examination. The surgery was done at another hospital in other prefecture. Immediately after the operation, she got bilateral VCP. Several years later when she caught a cold, pneumonia developed and she required a tracheostomy. None of our patients on the active surveillance developed even unilateral VCP during the observation. The tragedy of bilateral VCP would never have occurred during active surveillance for appropriately selected patients.

Figure 4 shows sonograms of a woman with PMC at her presentation when she was 46-years old and those taken 18 years later. Although the qualities of the pictures differ each other because of the improvement of ultrasound machine during this long interval, the size and shape of PMC show very little change. This was a very common finding of the active surveillance.

### Recurrent laryngeal nerve liberations and reconstructions: a single institution experience [^74eea780]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical techniques for RLN reparation

Surgical approach was through standard neck skin incision for thyroidectomy. Exploration of thyroid bed and central neck compartment was performed through median approach or via "back door" in reoperations. After visually identifying the RLN and the injury mechanisms, liberations or reconstructions were performed.

RLN liberation technique

As a part of reoperations for above-listed indications, visual identification of RLN was achieved via "back door" approach and sharp dissection. Misplaced ligation on the intact RLN was observed adjacent to neurovascular crossing of the RLN and the inferior laryngeal artery. By meticulous removing of the ligation, RLN was deliberated and its integrity was visually confirmed. In two patients, granulomas formed around surgical suture near the RLN compressed the RLN at the laryngeal entry point, and thus, these were sharply removed. This technique of RLN liberation was originally presented by the first author (RD), as well as published in the form of abstract).

Direct, "end-to-end" RLN anastomosis

In primary surgeries, after transection of RLN, immediate reconstruction was performed by a direct, "end-to-end" anastomosis of neural stamps, by three to four perineural stitches of 7–0 nylon thread, using microsurgical instruments. In reoperations, after transection due to severe adhesions or after "back door" identification of previously transected RLN, distal and proximal stumps were sutured in the same way.

Ansa cervicalis to RLN anastomosis (ARA, Miyauchi's technique)

First, we identified ansa cervicalis on the surface of the internal jugular vein, and branches to the sternothyroid muscles were dissected. The proximal end of the major branch was anastomosed to the distal RLN stump. Ipsilateral ansa cervicalis was used for reinnervation in all patients but one, in whom it was resected during previous lateral neck dissection performed in other hospital. Here, contralateral ansa cervicalis was used.
