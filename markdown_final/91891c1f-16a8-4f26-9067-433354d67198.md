## Question

what is dyslexia definition

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the definition of dyslexia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype and how it is described across sources. Then, I should verify exclusionary criteria that distinguish dyslexia from other causes of reading problems. Next, I will review the dominant cognitive mechanism, weigh neurobiological and genetic evidence, and confirm epidemiology and course. Finally, I will synthesize a precise definition and self-check it against the strongest references, correcting any inconsistencies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the primary clinical characteristics. Across pediatric and neurocognitive sources, dyslexia is consistently described as a disorder of learning to read with unexpected difficulties in accurate and fluent word recognition, deficient decoding, impaired spelling, and often reduced reading fluency and comprehension, which reflects a receptive, language-based learning disability rather than a vision disorder [^111uYhXT] [^115zj7nU] [^1142zHS4].

> Hold on, I should verify the exclusionary boundaries to avoid misclassification. The reading impairment occurs despite at least average intelligence, intact vision and hearing, no focal neurological or primary psychiatric disorder, and adequate educational opportunity; vision problems can co-occur but are not causal, and vision therapies lack evidentiary support for treating dyslexia itself [^111uYhXT] [^112juUe7] [^116J8djM].

> Next, I will examine the core cognitive mechanism. I need to ensure the phonological deficit account remains central while acknowledging heterogeneity. The weight of evidence supports a fundamental impairment in the phonological component of language, affecting phoneme awareness, phoneme–grapheme mapping, and often rapid automatized naming, which together degrade decoding and fluent word recognition; these phonological weaknesses can be detected before formal reading instruction in at-risk children, supporting a causal role rather than a downstream effect of poor reading experience [^111uYhXT] [^1118VtMY] [^112mpMq7] [^113vcB1S].

> Wait, let me verify the neurobiological substrate next. Convergent neuroimaging work indicates dysfunction of the left-hemisphere language network with abnormalities in temporo-parietal and occipito-temporal systems, and white matter connectivity differences within core reading pathways; these effects are observed across writing systems, suggesting shared neural underpinnings regardless of orthography depth, though language-specific demands can modulate typical reading activation patterns [^111Dmyvd] [^1178MVFA] [^112WMZbs].

> I should confirm the heritable, neurodevelopmental nature. Family and imaging studies indicate dyslexia is highly heritable, with identifiable risk loci and candidate genes such as ROBO1 and CEP63, and with brain differences detectable prior to reading instruction, reinforcing that many neural deviations precede formal literacy rather than arise solely from limited reading experience [^113WMutA] [^111MB96d] [^113e2FLj].

> Let me consider epidemiology and longitudinal course. Prevalence estimates commonly fall around 5–10% of school-aged children, with persistence into adulthood; although some accuracy can improve, rate-dependent measures such as reading speed, fluency, and spelling remain disproportionately impaired over time, consistent with a lifelong neurodevelopmental profile [^1151Aibo] [^115FNeBg] [^1142zHS4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and conflate developmental dyslexia with acquired alexia. I need to check that we distinguish developmental origins from post-stroke alexia phenotypes; contemporary stroke literature emphasizes process-level reading impairments in alexia, which are etiologically distinct from developmental dyslexia, supporting the need to keep these constructs separate in a clinical definition [^114E7ua7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially read one protocol referencing DSM-V; I should double-check the nomenclature. The correct current terminology is DSM-5 "specific learning disorder with impairment in reading", and although some sources use DSM-V language, the definitional elements they cite are consistent with DSM-5's emphasis on persistent reading accuracy/fluency deficits not better explained by other disorders or inadequate instruction, so the content remains aligned even if the numeral formatting differs [^111vpzm7].

> I will now synthesize the definition, but first I need to ensure each component is supported by convergent evidence. The phenotype, phonological mechanism, exclusionary criteria, neurobiological substrate, heritability, cross-linguistic generalizability, and developmental course all converge across pediatric, cognitive, and neuroimaging sources, strengthening confidence in the integrated clinical definition [^111uYhXT] [^111Dmyvd] [^113WMutA] [^112WMZbs] [^1178MVFA] [^1151Aibo].

> Final synthesized clinical definition: Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental, language-based specific learning disorder characterized by unexpected difficulties in accurate and/or fluent word recognition with impaired decoding and spelling, often limiting reading comprehension, arising primarily from a core deficit in the phonological component of language that disrupts mastery of the alphabetic principle; these difficulties occur despite at least average intelligence, intact sensory function, absence of other primary neurological or psychiatric explanations, and adequate educational opportunity, and are associated with dysfunction of left-hemisphere reading networks and atypical white matter connectivity, show heritable risk with identifiable genetic contributors, are observed across writing systems, and typically persist across the lifespan with disproportionate impairment in reading speed and fluency [^111uYhXT] [^111Dmyvd] [^113WMutA] [^1178MVFA] [^112WMZbs] [^111MB96d] [^1151Aibo] [^1142zHS4].

> Let me reconsider clinical implications briefly to ensure completeness. Early identification of phonological and related preliteracy deficits and referral for evidence-based, explicit instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics-based decoding improves outcomes and should be prioritized; vision therapies should not be recommended for dyslexia treatment given the lack of efficacy evidence and the non-visual etiology of the reading impairment [^113WMutA] [^111uYhXT] [^115vzSFG] [^112juUe7].

Dyslexia is a **neurodevelopmental disorder** [^111Dmyvd] characterized by **persistent difficulties** with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, decoding, and spelling [^116J8djM], despite normal intelligence, adequate instruction, and the absence of sensory or neurological deficits [^111uYhXT]. It is primarily due to a **phonological processing deficit** [^1118VtMY] that impairs letter-sound mapping [^1114d4YQ] and often presents with slow reading, poor spelling, and reduced reading comprehension [^111uYhXT]. Dyslexia is heritable, with genetic and neurobiological factors affecting left-hemisphere language networks [^111BDF9Q] [^111Dmyvd]; it is not caused by vision problems [^112juUe7] or low intelligence [^111uYhXT]. Early identification [^113WMutA] and evidence-based, **phonologically focused instruction** [^115vzSFG] are essential for **effective management** [^111uYhXT].

### Learning disabilities, dyslexia, and vision [^111uYhXT]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Learning disabilities constitute a diverse group of disorders in which children who generally possess at least average intelligence have problems processing information or generating output. Their etiologies are multifactorial and reflect genetic influences and dysfunction of brain systems. Reading disability, or dyslexia, is the most common learning disability. It is a receptive language-based learning disability characterized by difficulties with decoding, fluent word recognition, rapid automatic naming, and/or reading-comprehension skills. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonologic component of language, making it difficult to use the alphabetic code to decode the written word.

Early recognition and referral to qualified professionals for evidence-based evaluations and treatments are necessary to achieve the best possible outcome. Because dyslexia is a language-based disorder, treatment should be directed at this etiology. Remedial programs should include specific instruction in decoding, fluency training, vocabulary, and comprehension. Most programs involve daily intensive individualized instruction that explicitly teaches phonemic awareness and the application of phonics.

Vision problems can interfere with the process of reading, but children with dyslexia or related learning disabilities have the same visual function and ocular health as children without such conditions. Currently, there is inadequate scientific evidence to support the view that subtle eye or visual problems cause or increase the severity of learning disabilities.

### Developmental dyslexia [^111Dmyvd]. Lancet (2012). Low credibility.

Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by slow and inaccurate word recognition. Dyslexia has been reported in every culture studied, and mounting evidence highlights cross-linguistic similarity in its neurobiological and neurocognitive bases. Much progress has been made across research specialties spanning the behavioral, neuropsychological, neurobiological, and causal levels of analysis in the past 5 years. From a neuropsychological perspective, the phonological theory remains the most compelling, although phonological problems also interact with other cognitive risk factors.

Research confirms that, neurobiologically, dyslexia is characterized by dysfunction of the normal left hemisphere language network and also implicates abnormal white matter development. Studies accounting for reading experience demonstrate that many recorded neural differences show causes rather than effects of dyslexia. Six predisposing candidate genes have been identified, and evidence shows gene-environment interaction.

### Reintroducing dyslexia: Early identification and implications for pediatric practice [^113WMutA]. Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that renders children susceptible to poor health outcomes and various elements of socioeconomic difficulty. It is often undiagnosed until a child has repeatedly failed to learn to read in elementary school; this late diagnosis not only places the child at an academic disadvantage but also can be a precursor to psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Genetic and neuroimaging research has revealed that dyslexia is heritable and is underpinned by brain differences present even before reading instruction begins.

Cognitive-behavioral research has shown that there are early literacy skill deficits that represent red flags for dyslexia risk and can be measured at a preschool age. Altogether, this evidence points to dyslexia as a disorder that can be flagged by a pediatrician before school entry, during a period of heightened brain plasticity when interventions are more likely to be effective. In this review, we discuss the clinical implications of the most recent advances in dyslexia research, which converge to indicate that early identification and screening are crucial to the prevention or mitigation of adverse secondary consequences of dyslexia. We further highlight evidence-based and practical strategies for the implementation of early risk identification in pediatric practice so that physicians can be empowered in their ability to treat, educate, and advocate for their patients and families with dyslexia.

### Joint statement — learning disabilities, dyslexia, and vision [^112juUe7]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Learning disabilities, including reading disabilities, are commonly diagnosed in children. Their etiologies are multifactorial, reflecting genetic influences and dysfunction of brain systems. Learning disabilities are complex problems that require complex solutions. Early recognition and referral to qualified educational professionals for evidence-based evaluations and treatments seem necessary to achieve the best possible outcome. Most experts believe that dyslexia is a language-based disorder. Vision problems can interfere with the process of learning; however, vision problems are not the cause of primary dyslexia or learning disabilities. Scientific evidence does not support the efficacy of eye exercises, behavioral vision therapy, or special tinted filters or lenses for improving the long-term educational performance in these complex pediatric neurocognitive conditions. Diagnostic and treatment approaches that lack scientific evidence of efficacy, including eye exercises, behavioral vision therapy, or special tinted filters or lenses, are not endorsed and should not be recommended.

### Developmental outcomes for children at high risk of dyslexia and children with developmental language disorder [^113vcB1S]. Child Development (2019). Low credibility.

Retrospective analyses focus on preschool precursors (t 1, t 2) and school-age differences (t 3, t 4) between children classified with dyslexia and/or developmental language disorder (DLD) at t 5. In these analyses, as in most previous family risk (FR) studies, we took the "normal reader" comparison group as typically developing (TD) controls from t 1, because they were recruited as at low risk of dyslexia and DLD, excluding any child with dyslexia or DLD at outcome. In the sections that follow, data are presented graphically, showing the effect size of the deficits in performance of the three outcome groups relative to this TD control group. The complete data set is provided in Appendix S1. These tables include the performance of the children who are typical readers at t 5, including those who were initially at risk.

- **Deficits in language and reading-related skills for children with dyslexia and DLD**: Figure 2 shows the difference between the TD control group and the three outcome groups on language and phonological tasks between t 1 and t 5 (see Table S2 for group means and standard deviations). On measures of both language and phonology, the group with dyslexia-only shows medium to large deficits relative to the TD controls. In contrast, the DLD-only group shows large deficits in phonology and very large deficits in language. The dyslexia + DLD group shows very large deficits in both language and phonology, with effect sizes (d) ranging from 1.8 to over 3.

Refer to Figure 2 for the effect size, with 95% confidence intervals, of group deficits in language and phonology measures at t 1–t 5 for dyslexia and developmental language disorder.

### Meaning for reading: The neurocognitive basis of semantic reading impairment after stroke [^114E7ua7]. Brain (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of alexia has historically focused on syndromes such as surface alexia, which capture discrete patterns of reading deficits observed in some patients but do not describe the breadth of reading deficits observed in practice. Aphasia research has recently shifted focus to language process impairments rather than syndromic classifications. A similar shift in focus to reading process impairments might improve our diagnostic approach to alexia. Behavioral evidence suggests that semantic processing influences reading aloud and that semantic deficits in the context of semantic dementia underlie surface alexia.

Because stroke rarely causes loss of semantic knowledge and surface alexia as a syndromic diagnosis is unusual after stroke, semantic reading deficits in stroke alexia have not previously been examined systematically. Semantic reading deficits in stroke may not relate to semantic deficits per se, but rather an inability to use semantics to support reading. Imageability, the degree to which a word brings to mind an image, is one index of semantic influences on reading. High-imageability words are read more quickly by healthy persons and more accurately following brain damage.

Here, we test whether deficits of semantic reading after stroke, as indexed by reduced imageability effects, result from semantic or post-semantic processes. Examining non-verbal semantic processing, semantics-phonology mapping, and semantic control in 56 left-hemisphere stroke survivors, only better semantics-phonology mapping ability predicted better accuracy on high-imageability words.

### Disrupted white matter connectivity underlying developmental dyslexia: A machine learning approach [^1178MVFA]. Human Brain Mapping (2016). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia has been hypothesized to result from multiple causes and exhibit multiple manifestations, implying a distributed multidimensional effect on the human brain. The disruption of specific white-matter (WM) tracts/regions has been observed in dyslexic children. However, it remains unknown if developmental dyslexia affects the human brain WM in a multidimensional manner.

The multivariate machine learning approach, being a natural tool for evaluating this hypothesis, was applied in this study to compare 28 school-aged dyslexic children with 33 age-matched controls. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired to extract five multitype WM features at a regional level: white matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity.

A linear support vector machine (LSVM) classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.61% using these MRI features to distinguish dyslexic children from controls. Notably, the most discriminative features that contributed to the classification were primarily associated with WM regions within the putative reading network/system (e.g. the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, thalamocortical projections, and corpus callosum), the limbic system (e.g. the cingulum and fornix), and the motor system (e.g. the cerebellar peduncle, corona radiata, and corticospinal tract). These results were well replicated using a logistic regression classifier. These findings provide direct evidence supporting a multidimensional effect of development.

### Developmental outcomes for children at high risk of dyslexia and children with developmental language disorder [^112mpMq7]. Child Development (2019). Low credibility.

For the group with dyslexia, language deficits are small in preschool, appear to increase with age, and are large after school entry. The DLD‐only and the dyslexia + DLD groups started with poorer language, and difficulties also increased over time. For phonology, the group with dyslexia only shows large deficits from preschool onwards, but the deficit is somewhat variable over time (d = 0.75–1.09); the dyslexia + DLD group shows larger deficits (d = 2.02–2.36). Although the DLD‐only group also shows large phonological deficits relative to typically developing (TD) controls, the deficit appears to lessen over time (d = 1.93– > 1.3).

Figure 3 shows the effect sizes of differences between the TD control group and the three outcome groups in phonological awareness (PA), rapid naming (RAN), and letter knowledge (GPC) over the course of the study. In preschool, all three clinical groups show large deficits in these skills, and differences between the performance of the two groups with DLD and the dyslexia-only group are not statistically significant. However, from age 5½ years onwards, the DLD‐only group tends to show smaller deficits on these foundational skills than either of the two groups with dyslexia.

- **Figure 3**: Effect size (with 95% confidence intervals) of group deficits in letter knowledge (upper panel), phonological awareness (middle panel), and rapid naming (lower panel) from ages corresponding to t2 through t5 for dyslexia, developmental language disorder (DLD), and comorbid groups.

In summary, children with dyslexia show phonological deficits from early in preschool before reading instruction begins. This is also true of the DLD-only group.

### Do the reading disabilities of children with cleft fit into current models of developmental dyslexia [^1156HPEy]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reading problems of children with cleft fit models of developmental dyslexia. The study compared children with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate who had reading disability (n = 46) with those who did not have reading disability (n = 46). The children were matched for age, sex, and grade. The two groups were compared using t-tests on measures of verbal expression, phonemic awareness, and rapid naming. Additionally, regression analyses compared the relative relationships of these variables to reading disability.

Children were selected from 154 patients who were originally screened. The results showed that children with reading disabilities scored significantly lower on rapid naming and verbal expression, with no differences found in phonemic awareness. Rapid naming was shown to have the most significant association with reading disability.

In conclusion, children with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate exhibit symptoms similar to a naming-memory deficit model of developmental dyslexia. Therefore, reading treatment should avoid sight word approaches and focus on oral phonics treatment.

### Reading disability is characterized by reduced print-speech convergence [^1142zHS4]. Child Development (2024). Low credibility.

Reading disability (RD) is a significant reading impairment despite appropriate cognitive ability, learning motivation, and educational opportunities, affecting about 7% of people across different languages. Individuals with RD exhibit abnormal brain function in the three reading regions. There is reduced brain activation in the left occipitotemporal and temporoparietal areas in RD readers compared to typical readers, suggesting deficient orthographic and phonological processing, respectively. For the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), findings are inconsistent, with some research indicating reduced activation and others showing increased activation in RD readers compared to typical readers. This inconsistency may be due to variations in task difficulties and the ages of participants across studies.

In the literature, unexpectedly few studies have focused on the developmental perspective of RD beyond the end of formal schooling. In the few behavioral studies that have directly compared children and adults with RD, it was found that for some reading skills, such as decoding accuracy, readers with RD eventually catch up in adulthood. However, for other reading skills, such as decoding speed, reading fluency, spelling, and phonological awareness, persistent deficits remain. Furthermore, a meta-analysis study suggests that adults with RD show persistent deficits in almost all reading and writing measures, with a greater deficit in speed measures than in accuracy.

### The genetic basis of dyslexia [^111BDF9Q]. The Lancet Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Dyslexia, a disorder of reading and spelling, is a heterogeneous neurological syndrome with a complex genetic and environmental etiology. Individuals with dyslexia vary in their profiles across a range of cognitive, physiological, and behavioral measures related to reading disability. Some or all subtypes of dyslexia may have partly or wholly distinct genetic causes. Understanding the role of genetics in dyslexia could enhance the diagnosis and treatment of susceptible children more effectively and rapidly than is currently possible, accounting for their individual disabilities. This knowledge will also provide new insights into the neurobiology of reading and language cognition. Genetic linkage analysis has identified regions of the genome that might harbor inherited variants causing reading disability. In particular, loci on chromosomes 6 and 18 have shown strong and replicable effects on reading abilities. These genomic regions contain tens or hundreds of candidate genes, and studies aimed at identifying specific causal genetic variants are underway.

### Chronic pediatric diseases and risk for reading difficulties: A narrative review with recommendations [^113Si8z4]. Pediatric Research (2022). Low credibility.

The methods section categorized medical conditions based on these criteria: (1) prevalence in children, (2) diagnosis typically before age 6, when formal reading instruction begins, (3) not stemming from an isolated neurological insult (e.g. head trauma), and (4) not part of broader developmental delays or genetic syndromes (e.g. autism, Trisomy-21). Extreme prematurity and hearing loss, though linked to reading difficulties, were excluded. The former is not a distinct diagnosis and involves varied health implications, while the latter is extensively covered in existing literature.

Searches were executed in PubMed and Google Scholar via a thematic approach by specialists collaborating with the lead and senior authors. Search terms entailed each medical condition coupled with relevant keywords: "literacy", "emergent literacy", "reading", "reading difficulties", "reading delay", "cognitive", "language", "kindergarten", "readiness", "school", "health literacy", and "transitioning". Additional inclusion criteria were: (1) children under age 18 constituted the study population, (2) articles published in English, (3) a peer-reviewed format, (4) accessibility via journal access at host institutions (CCHMC and the University of Cincinnati), and (5) a publication year post-1990. Qualitative, quantitative, and meta-analytic designs were permitted. Inclusion decisions were by unanimous agreement among specialists and the senior author, focusing particularly on relevance to reading.

### Phonological deficits in specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia: towards a multidimensional model [^114koNzL]. Brain (2013).

Research conducted explored the relationship between phonological deficits in individuals with specific language impairment (SLI) and developmental dyslexia. The study aimed to develop a multidimensional model to better understand these deficits.

### The use of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques to improve reading difficulties in dyslexia: A systematic review [^113FT2sf]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

To sum up, studies at the time of writing have targeted different areas with different stimulation protocols (except for those studies performed by the same group with overlapping participants), and none of the combined reading and NIBS intervention studies has included a control group without reading training. Therefore, more studies are needed to identify the optimal length and intensity of behavioral interventions combined with NIBS and the duration of the induced after-effects. Since the overall number of studies is scarce, it is necessary for future studies to identify the relevance of specific regions for reading processes, test larger samples, and combine stimulation with different forms of behavioral interventions.

From a methodological viewpoint, most studies applied tDCS and are, therefore, clearly limited in spatial resolution. Using high-definition tDCS or TMS could help to overcome this issue. Even if TMS studies in children are not easy to realize due to safety precautions, it seems equally promising to use well-designed studies in dyslexic adults to enrich our understanding of the reading-impaired brain. Additionally, recent advances in biophysical modeling of the NIBS-induced currents in the brain may help to optimize electrode montages for tDCS interventions and coil positions for TMS application [e.g. Opitz, Fox, Craddock, Colcombe, & Milham; Weise, Numssen, Thielscher, Hartwigsen, & Knösche]. Finally, the use of rhythmic TMS or tACS may offer the possibility to further target and modulate specific atypical oscillatory patterns in dyslexia, and link these to reading.

### Nrsn1 associated grey matter volume of the visual word form area reveals dyslexia before school [^1142cwv9]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Literacy learning depends on the flexibility of the human brain to reconfigure itself in response to environmental influences. At the same time, literacy and disorders of literacy acquisition are heritable and thus to some degree genetically predetermined. Here, we used a multivariate non-parametric genetic model to relate literacy-associated genetic variants to grey and white matter volumes derived by voxel-based morphometry in a cohort of 141 children.

Subsequently, a sample of 34 children attending grades 4 to 8, and another sample of 20 children, longitudinally followed from kindergarten to first grade, were classified as dyslexics and controls using linear binary support vector machines. The NRSN1-associated grey matter volume of the 'visual word form area' achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 73% in literacy-experienced students and distinguished between later dyslexic individuals and controls with an accuracy of 75% at kindergarten age. These findings suggest that the cortical plasticity of a region vital for literacy might be genetically modulated, thereby potentially preconstraining literacy outcome.

Accordingly, these results could pave the way for identifying and treating the most common learning disorder before it manifests itself in school.

### Learning disabilities: Definitions, epidemiology, diagnosis, and intervention strategies [^115FNeBg]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Learning problems occur in about 5% of school-aged children. Learning disabilities are specific and life-long but present with different school problems at different ages, depending on factors such as age, medical history, family history, and intelligence quotient. Proper individualized diagnosis and treatment plans are necessary to remediate these problems and to offer adequate coping strategies. Many children who have learning problems can be classified into one of two major categories: the dyslexia group or the nonverbal learning disability group. The role of the medical professional is important to guide parents in the diagnostic and therapeutic process.

### Multimodal intervention in 8- to 13-year-old French dyslexic readers: Study protocol for a randomized multicenter controlled crossover trial [^115L5kS3]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

**Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a}**: The statistical analysis will first include a descriptive analysis of the study population and the parameters studied, both globally and by training group. This will involve an assessment of absolute and relative frequencies (and their 95% confidence intervals) for categorical variables, as well as an assessment of means and standard deviations, medians, and interquartiles for quantitative variables. A flowchart will present the number of eligible participants, the number of participants randomized into each group, and the number of participants included in the final analysis. The characteristics of participants lost to follow-up during the study will be described. As recommended in the CONSORT guidelines, participant characteristics will be compared between the two groups at inclusion from both a clinical and statistical perspective. Prior to each analysis, the conditions of application of the tests used will be verified. Different tests will be considered significant at the 5% threshold (first species risk).

### Putative protective neural mechanisms in prereaders with a family history of dyslexia who subsequently develop typical reading skills [^112gm3LQ]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

**Methods**: The study was based on two longitudinal projects conducted at our lab: the "Boston Longitudinal Dyslexia Study" (BOLD) and "Research on the Early Attributes of Dyslexia" (READ), which took place at Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively. In both projects, children were enrolled at the end of the prekindergarten year or the beginning of kindergarten, prior to learning to read, referred to as prereaders. During this initial phase, children completed both behavioral and imaging sessions, with further details provided below. Participants were subsequently contacted and invited to attend a behavioral session annually to monitor their reading development until the end of second grade for READ and fourth grade for BOLD. No intervention was administered between these annual assessments.

### Neural dissociation of visual attention span and phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia: A hub-based white matter network analysis [^114XjTgD]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

This study uses a data-driven, hub-based white matter subnetwork approach to demonstrate that distinct white matter hubs and subnetworks correspond to visual attention span (VAS) and phonological processing performance in developmental dyslexia. Brain-behavior analyses reveal three distinct hubs:

- **Left superior occipital gyrus (SOG)**: Connects with visual occipital-parietal subnetworks and accounts for individual differences in VAS but not phonological processing in dyslexic children.
- **Left middle temporal gyrus**: Connects with temporal-occipital-parietal subnetworks and accounts for phonological processing accuracy but not VAS.
- **Medial orbital superior frontal gyrus**: Connects with frontal subnetworks and accounts for phonological processing accuracy but not VAS.

These findings suggest that VAS and phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia are supported by distinct neural networks.

The present work represents a methodological advance over previous diffusion studies in dyslexia. By applying a data-driven, hub-based network analysis approach, this study examines white matter subnetworks corresponding to visual and phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia. The hub-based subnetwork approach allowed for the first-time identification of hubs whose structural connectivity is associated with cognitive skills deficient in dyslexia, namely, phonological deficit and VAS deficit. Specifically, it tests how the connectivity of structural networks surrounding hub regions is involved in a specific cognitive deficit in dyslexia.

One of the main results of the present study was the observation of an independent subnetwork corresponding to these deficits.

### Dyslexia and dyscalculia: Which neuropsychological processes distinguish the two developmental disorders [^113t2KyR]. Child Neuropsychology (2024). Low credibility.

This study analyzes the specific neuropsychological profiles of children with dyslexia and/or dyscalculia, focusing on phonological awareness, lexical access, working memory, and numerical processing. Four groups were selected through a screening process that used strict criteria from 1,568 children aged 7–10 years: 90 with typical development, 61 with dyslexia, 13 with dyscalculia, and 14 with both dyslexia and dyscalculia.

Children with dyslexia show deficits in phonological processing, lexical access, and verbal working memory, particularly with alphabetic stimuli. Those with developmental dyscalculia exhibit deficits in phonological processing, verbal working memory with digits, and visual-spatial working memory. Additionally, they experience impairments in spatial representation of numbers and in the automatic access to numerical semantics to a greater extent than those with both disorders.

Children with both dyslexia and dyscalculia generally display a combination of the deficits associated with each disorder, although they demonstrate a lower deficit in access to numerical semantics and mental representation of numbers.

### Dyslexia and cognitive impairment in adult patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1: A clinical prospective analysis [^115djQ5V]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

There are only a few studies about the dyslexic phenomenon in DM1 patients. The case report by Macniven presents a DM1 patient with progressive dyslexia followed for more than 10 years. Dyslexia is a partial performance failure in reading and spelling, not solely caused by delayed development in cognition or intelligence. Even in the normal population, about 5% of children and adolescents are affected by dyslexia. Chief symptoms of a reading disorder include a significantly slow reading speed, leading to difficulties in understanding the content. As the association of individual letters with their corresponding sounds is affected, people with reading disorders tend to interchange or skip single letters, especially in complex, polysyllabic, and rare words, as well as in stressful situations.

A spelling disorder is characterized by a noticeable increase in the number of spelling errors. Moreover, patients with a spelling disorder try to avoid words they might not spell correctly to minimize errors. Dyslexia typically affects young people; however, adults can also be involved. Most diagnostic test manuals are not designed for all ages. Only a few standardized tests, such as the 'Salzburger Lese- und Rechtschreibtest' (SLRT II), can be partially used for dyslexia diagnosis in adulthood. Normative values for spelling performance in adults do not exist in German test measurements. Comparing the patient's test results with the performance of people in the same age group or school year leads to a percentage ranking (PR).

### Evaluation of children with reading difficulties [^115vzSFG]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Reading difficulties are common and associated with poor long-term academic achievement. Evaluation of a child's developmental, educational, and family histories in conjunction with standardized screening tests (e.g. Ages and Stages Questionnaires, Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status, Safety Word Inventory and Literacy Screener) can increase recognition of risk factors for reading difficulties. Validated, office-based, standardized screening tests and school-administered standardized achievement tests (e.g. California Achievement Tests, Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Metropolitan Achievement Tests, Stanford Achievement Test) can be used to assess school-age children with reading difficulties.

Reading difficulties in children often are caused by environmental and organic risk factors. However, many children have reading or learning disabilities and will have lifelong difficulties with reading despite adequate intervention. Children with substantial reading difficulties should receive a full educational assessment. There is good evidence that individualized instruction emphasizing increased phonologic awareness can have a favorable long-term effect on academic achievement.

### Language and reading impairments are associated with increased prevalence of non-right-handedness [^111ZagUs]. Child Development (2023). Low credibility.

The inconsistency across results conducted for both reading and language impairment may be due to the different criteria and designs used across studies. Meta‐analyses are a valid approach to extract the most consistent patterns from published studies, although it must be acknowledged that this approach is affected by potential publication biases.

We invited cohorts from the GenLang consortium to participate in this confirmatory study. GenLang is an international collaboration that facilitates large‐scale meta‐analyses in relation to speech, language, reading, and related skills. The association between hand preference and language/reading abilities has not been investigated before in these cohorts. Thanks to the availability of raw data, we were able to apply criteria set a priori for defining reading and language impairments to reduce heterogeneity across cohorts. Handedness categories were defined as non‐right (NRH) or right‐handedness (RH) based on the preferred hand for writing or drawing.

We report handedness frequency in 10 different cohorts (N = 2503 cases with reading and/or language impairment). Eight of these cohorts met the inclusion criteria and entered the meta‐analysis (N = 1994 cases).

### Effects of a developmental dyslexia remediation protocol based on the training of audio-phonological cognitive processes in dyslexic children with high intellectual potential: Study protocol for a multiple-baseline single-case experimental design [^116whkLf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Studies on learning disabilities in children with high intellectual potential (HIP) are underrepresented in the scientific literature, although the number of such studies has been increasing gradually over the years. The high prevalence of HIP children in the school-age population — approximately 2.3% of French school children — and the high rate of comorbidity with learning disabilities have increased the demand for speech and language therapy care. Some studies claim that the prevalence of HIP among dyslexic readers is higher than the prevalence of HIP among normal readers.

For instance, Toffalini et al. reported a proportion of 5.06% HIP children among dyslexic readers compared to 1.82% HIP children among normal readers. Pradeille indicates a proportion of 10% HIP children within a sample of 209 dyslexic readers. According to Winner, dyslexia is the most frequent developmental disorder associated with HIP. However, the diagnosis and rehabilitation of children with high intellectual potential and developmental dyslexia (HIP-DD) remain difficult due to the coexistence of both cognitive features.

### The axon guidance receptor gene ROBO1 is a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia [^111MB96d]. PLoS Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Dyslexia, or specific reading disability, is the most common learning disorder with a complex, partially genetic basis, but its biochemical mechanisms remain poorly understood. A locus on Chromosome 3, DYX5, has been linked to dyslexia in one large family and speech-sound disorder in a subset of small families. We found that the axon guidance receptor gene ROBO1, orthologous to the Drosophila roundabout gene, is disrupted by a chromosome translocation in a dyslexic individual.

In a large pedigree with 21 dyslexic individuals genetically linked to a specific haplotype of ROBO1 (not found in any other chromosomes in our samples), the expression of ROBO1 from this haplotype was absent or attenuated in affected individuals. Sequencing of ROBO1 in apes revealed multiple coding differences, and the selection pressure was significantly different between the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla branch as compared to orangutan. We also identified novel exons and splice variants of ROBO1 that may explain the apparent phenotypic differences between human and mouse in heterozygous loss of ROBO1.

We conclude that dyslexia may be caused by partial haplo-insufficiency for ROBO1 in rare families. Thus, our data suggest that a slight disturbance in neuronal axon crossing across the midline between brain hemispheres, dendrite guidance, or another function of ROBO1 may manifest as a specific reading disability in humans.

### Anatomical and behavioural correlates of auditory perception in developmental dyslexia [^112NG6mo]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia is typically associated with difficulties in basic auditory processing and manipulating speech sounds. However, the neuroanatomical correlates of auditory difficulties in developmental dyslexia and their contribution to individual clinical phenotypes are still unknown. Recent intracranial electrocorticography findings associate processing of sound amplitude rises and speech sounds with posterior and middle superior temporal gyrus (STG), respectively.

We hypothesize that regional STG anatomy will relate to specific auditory abilities in developmental dyslexia and that auditory processing abilities will relate to behavioral difficulties with speech and reading. One hundred and ten children (78 with developmental dyslexia and 32 typically developing, aged 7–15 years) completed amplitude rise time and speech-in-noise discrimination tasks. They also underwent a battery of cognitive tests. Anatomical MRI scans were used to identify regions in which local cortical gyrification complexity correlated with auditory behavior.

Behaviorally, amplitude rise time but not speech-in-noise performance was impaired in developmental dyslexia. Neurally, amplitude rise time and speech-in-noise performance correlated with gyrification in posterior and middle STG, respectively. Furthermore, amplitude rise time significantly contributed to reading impairments in developmental dyslexia, while speech-in-noise only explained variance in phonological awareness. Finally, amplitude rise time and speech-in-noise performance were not correlated, and each task was correlated with distinct neural structures.

### Do developmental dyslexia and congenital amusia share underlying impairments [^111QPZWk]. Child Neuropsychology (2023). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia and congenital amusia have common characteristics, yet their possible association in some individuals has been addressed only scarcely. Recently, two converging studies reported a sizable comorbidity rate between these two neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the reason for their association remains unclear. Here, we investigate the hypothesis of shared underlying impairments between dyslexia and amusia. Fifteen dyslexic children with amusia (DYS+A), 15 dyslexic children without amusia (DYS-A), and two groups of 25 typically developing children matched on either chronological age (CA) or reading level (RL) were assessed with a behavioral battery aiming to investigate phonological and pitch processing capacities at auditory memory, perceptual awareness, and attentional levels.

Overall, our results suggest that poor auditory serial-order memory increases susceptibility to comorbidity between dyslexia and amusia and may play a role in the development of the comorbid phenotype. In contrast, the impairments observed in the DYS+A children for auditory item memory, perceptual awareness, and attention might be a consequence of their reduced reading experience combined with weaker musical skills. Comparing DYS+A and DYS-A children suggests that the latter are more resourceful and/or have more effective compensatory strategies, or that their phenotype results from a different developmental trajectory. We will discuss the relevance of these findings for delving into…

### Impaired tuning of a fast occipito-temporal response for print in dyslexic children learning to read [^115zj7nU]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia is defined as a disorder of learning to read. It is thus critical to examine the neural processes that impair learning to read during the early phase of reading acquisition, before compensatory mechanisms are adapted by older readers with dyslexia. Using electroencephalography-based event-related imaging, we investigated how tuning of visual activity for print advances in the same children before and after initial reading training in school. The focus was on a fast, coarse form of visual tuning for print, measured as an increase of the occipito-temporal N1 response at 150–270 ms in the event-related potential (ERP) to words compared to symbol strings.

The results demonstrate that the initial development of reading skills and visual tuning for print progressed more slowly in those children who became dyslexic than in their control peers. Print-specific tuning in 2nd grade strongly distinguished dyslexic children from controls. It was maximal in the inferior occipito-temporal cortex, left-lateralized in controls, and reduced in dyslexic children. The results suggest that delayed initial visual tuning for print critically contributes to the development of dyslexia.

### Neural dissociation of visual attention span and phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia: A hub-based white matter network analysis [^113e83KB]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that developmental dyslexia may have two dissociable causes: a phonological deficit and a visual attention span (VAS) deficit. Yet, neural evidence for such a dissociation is still lacking. This study adopted a data-driven approach to white matter network analysis to explore hubs and hub-related networks corresponding to VAS and phonological accuracy in a group of French dyslexic children aged from 9 to 14 years.

A double dissociation in brain-behavior relations was observed. The structural connectivity of the occipital-parietal network surrounding the left superior occipital gyrus hub accounted for individual differences in dyslexic children's VAS, but not in phonological processing accuracy. In contrast, structural connectivity of two networks — the temporal-parietal-occipital network surrounding the left middle temporal gyrus hub and the frontal network surrounding the left medial orbital superior frontal gyrus hub — accounted for individual differences in dyslexic children's phonological processing accuracy, but not in VAS.

Our findings provide evidence in favor of distinct neural circuits corresponding to VAS and phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia. The study points to connectivity-constrained white matter subnetwork dysfunction as a key principle for understanding individual differences in cognitive deficits in developmental dyslexia.

### The role of visual attention in dyslexia: Behavioral and neurobiological evidence [^113g6obw]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

Following enrollment in the study, participants underwent cognitive and reading assessments that included executive function (EF), language, reading, and visual attention tasks. After completing the behavioral assessment, which took approximately two hours, they participated in an fMRI session while performing a reading task where visual attention was manipulated (see Section 2.4). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the experimental procedure was approved by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center USA Institutional Review Board.

- **Cognitive testing**:

	- **Reading measures**: Distinct reading abilities were assessed during the behavioral testing session:

		- (a) Orthographical abilities were measured using the timed Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE II), specifically the Sight Word Efficiency (SWE), and the non-timed Letter-Word Identification subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson.

		- (b) Decoding was assessed using the timed Phonetic Decoding Efficiency (PDE) subtest of the TOWRE II and the non-timed Word Attack subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson.

		- (c) Reading fluency and comprehension were tested using the Gray Oral Reading Test (GORT) and the Test Of Silent Reading Efficiency and Comprehension (TOSREC).

		- (d) Phonological processing was assessed using the Elision and Blending subtests of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP).

		- (e) Naming abilities were measured using the Rapid Naming tasks.

### Dyslexic brain activation abnormalities in deep and shallow orthographies: A meta-analysis of 28 functional neuroimaging studies [^1114d4YQ]. Human Brain Mapping (2016). Low credibility.

A similar issue concerns the difficulty of the in-scanner activation tasks. As evident from supporting information, the mean accuracy was similar for DO and SO studies, t(23) = 0.994, p = 0.330, with 79.1% and 85.6% correct responses, respectively. It is reasonable to assume that the majority of the dyslexic participants were able to manage the in-scanner activation tasks and that there are no systematic differences between the studies in DO and SO. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind the issues related to task type and performance when interpreting meta-analytic differences between two sets of studies. Especially, findings in regions commonly associated with error-related activation (e.g. anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex) have to be interpreted with caution.

With respect to the diagnosis of dyslexia in the included studies of DO, some participants received a clinical diagnosis according to DSM-IV [American Psychiatric Association, 2000] or ICD-10 [World Health Organization, 1992], whereas others were classified as dyslexic when they had a documented history of reading difficulty in school or their reading performance (based on accuracy and/or speed) was about a standard deviation below the norm of a standardized reading test (see supporting information). In contrast, the majority of included studies of SO categorized dyslexics based on a marked reading speed impairment (below 10th percentile), which is considered the core criterion for diagnosing German dyslexic readers [Wimmer et al. 2000]. Thus, the diagnosis is based on poor reading accuracy and speed in DO.

### Effects of a developmental dyslexia remediation protocol based on the training of audio-phonological cognitive processes in dyslexic children with high intellectual potential: study protocol for a multiple-baseline single-case experimental design [^111vpzm7]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Concerning developmental dyslexia (DD), the DSM-V defines it as a severe and persistent disorder that affects reading acquisition, despite normal intelligence and the absence of neurological or psychiatric pathology, visual and auditory sensory deficits, or socio-educational deficiencies. Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that disturbs the automatization of associations between written linguistic units (graphemes) and oral linguistic units (phonemes). This alphabetic decoding disorder leads to an identification disorder of written words, which can have severe consequences on school learning, daily and professional life, and the self-esteem of the patients.

The phonological causal hypothesis is currently the most widespread. However, over the last few years, the single cause theory has been criticized in favor of a multi-factorial causal theory involving multiple underlying cognitive deficits (UCD). The two types of UCD most described in the literature are audio-phonological deficits and visuo-attentional deficits. In 2019, Ziegler et al. acknowledged the multifactorial nature of dyslexia but concluded that phonological deficits tended to prevail over other types of UCD.

According to Saksida's study, in the non-HIP dyslexic population, the most frequent UCD concerns phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN). PA is a cognitive process that allows individuals to manipulate language syllables, rhymes, or phonemes. In the dyslexic population, it is mainly the manipulation of phonemes that is affected and is thus referred to as phonological awareness deficits.

### Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children [^116yfV9J]. Health Psychology Research (2015). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with various symptoms and conditions. These include a little or no sense of danger, inattention, excessive talking, epilepsy, injury, excessive physical movement, OCD, dyslexia, impulsivity, and anxiety related to school or work. Genetic abnormalities, alcohol consumption, premature labor, and cigarette smoking are also linked. Additional challenges include restlessness, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, hyperactivity, acting without thinking, an inability to sit still, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, depression, and interruptions during conversations.

- **Learning and behavioral manifestations**: The condition is marked by constantly fidgeting, learning difficulties in school, and personality disorders.

### Editorial: Time to recognize nonverbal learning disability to foster advances in its research [^114ttatG]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

The definitions of most of the currently recognized neurodevelopmental disorders and the criteria used to identify them have undergone significant changes since their inclusion in diagnostic classification systems. For instance, the definitions of specific learning disorders and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been revised in successive versions of the DSM. Our understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders is continuously updated in light of new research findings. However, this evolution has not extended to nonverbal learning disability. More than 50 years since it was first described, there is still no consensus on the merits of identifying it as a separate disorder or using a clear and acknowledged diagnostic label.

Instead of trying to establish why nonverbal learning disability has yet to be included in the diagnostic manuals, this editorial examines why recognized criteria for the condition would improve research in this field. Establishing shared criteria would also help avoid the negative consequences of continuing to conduct research without adopting such criteria.

### Developmental dyslexia in Chinese and English populations: Dissociating the effect of dyslexia from language differences [^112WMZbs]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that developmental dyslexia has a different neural basis in Chinese and English populations because of known differences in the processing demands of the Chinese and English writing systems. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we provide the first direct statistically based investigation into how the effect of dyslexia on brain activation is influenced by the Chinese and English writing systems. Brain activation for semantic decisions on written words was compared in English dyslexics, Chinese dyslexics, English normal readers, and Chinese normal readers, while controlling for all other experimental parameters. By investigating the effects of dyslexia and language in one study, we show common activation in Chinese and English dyslexics, despite different activation in Chinese versus English normal readers.

The effect of dyslexia in both languages was observed as less than normal activation in the left angular gyrus and in the left middle frontal, posterior temporal, and occipitotemporal regions. Differences in Chinese and English normal reading were observed as increased activation for Chinese relative to English in the left inferior frontal sulcus, and increased activation for English relative to Chinese in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus. These cultural differences were not observed in dyslexics, who activated both the left inferior frontal sulcus and the left posterior superior temporal sulcus, consistent with the use of culturally independent strategies when reading is less efficient.

### Rehabilitation of hemianopic dyslexia: Are words necessary for re-learning oculomotor control [^11732CYq]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Unilateral homonymous visual field disorders after brain damage are frequently associated with a severe impairment of reading, called hemianopic dyslexia. A specific treatment method has been developed which allows patients to regain sufficient reading performance by re-learning eye-movement control in reading through systematic oculomotor practice. However, it is still unclear whether the treatment effect associated with this training procedure critically depends on using text material. We therefore evaluated the effectiveness of systematic oculomotor training with non-text material (Arabic digits) in comparison with conventional oculomotor training using text material (words) in 40 patients with unilateral homonymous visual field disorders and hemianopic dyslexia. Non-text training was found to be as effective as conventional text training in improving reading performance and associated eye-movements in these patients. Our results suggest that using words is not critical to the treatment effect of this training procedure. Thus, lexical-semantic processes seem not to be necessary for re-learning eye-movement control in hemianopic dyslexia.

### Reading in the brain of children and adults: A meta-analysis of 40 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies [^1137uRE8]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

Some potentially relevant studies were not eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis because they only provided coordinates for the comparison between dyslexic and normal readers [Blau et al. 2010; Kronbichler et al. 2006; Meyler et al. 2008; Richlan et al. 2010; Schulz et al. 2008, 2009; Wimmer et al. 2010]. Furthermore, to clearly differentiate between children and adults, studies with adolescents were excluded [e.g. Grünling et al. 2004; Landi et al. 2010]. Several potentially interesting studies could not be included in the meta-analysis because reading-related activation was not reported separately for young and older readers [Brown et al. 2005; Schlaggar et al. 2002; Turkeltaub et al. 2003], or not in terms of 3-D coordinates in standard stereotactic space on the whole-brain level [e.g. Holland et al. 2001; Shaywitz et al. 2002, 2007], or not for an alphabetic language [Chinese: Cao et al. 2009; Chou et al. 2009; Tan et al. 2000; Siok et al. 2003; or Japanese: Nakamura et al. 2000, 2002; Miura et al. 2005]. This specific study selection was intended to improve the quality and accuracy of the meta-analytic results. Studies requiring reading aloud were mostly excluded in favor of studies on silent visual word processing because the additional requirements of overt articulation were not the focus of the present meta-analysis. Additionally, reading aloud is more susceptible to causing motion artifacts in fMRI investigations, leading to potentially lower data quality. As an exception, the study by Binder et al. [2005] was included in the set of adult studies.

### Phonological deficits in specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia: Towards a multidimensional model [^1118VtMY]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Dyslexia is a difficulty in learning to read alongside similar exclusionary criteria as SLI. There is widespread agreement that children with dyslexia have phonological impairments. Indeed, dyslexic children perform poorly on phonological awareness tasks such as phoneme manipulation and have poor verbal short-term memory as measured by tasks like digit span and non-word repetition. They are also slow at rapid automatized naming tasks, which index speed of access to familiar lexical items and their phonological representations.

There is substantial heterogeneity in both groups. Furthermore, many children diagnosed with SLI are also dyslexic and vice versa.

Phonological deficits play a prominent role in theories of both dyslexia and SLI. Within the literature on dyslexia, there is widespread agreement that phonological deficits are the direct cause of the reading impairment, at least for a majority of dyslexic children. Even alternative theories acknowledge a phonological deficit as a crucial mediator between other factors and reading impairment. With respect to SLI, at least two prominent theories rely on phonological deficits: either as a mediator between disrupted auditory processing and broader language impairment, or in the form of a verbal short-term memory deficit affecting morphosyntactic processing and lexical learning. Alternatively, some theories of dyslexia and of SLI do not feature a phonological deficit as a necessary ingredient of these disorders. The question of the prevalence, nature, and causal role of phonological deficits remains open for discussion.

### Neural dissociation of visual attention span and phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia: A hub-based white matter network analysis [^116J8djM]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia is characterized by significant and persistent difficulties in reading acquisition, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.3% to 17.5%. It is a common learning disorder that cannot be accounted for by intellectual disability, sensory (vision or hearing) or neurological impairment, lack of availability of education, or psychosocial adversity.

Dyslexia is widely acknowledged as a neurodevelopmental disorder with specific neural origins. A variety of neuroimaging studies have investigated the "neurobiological biomarkers" of dyslexia. Despite this, dyslexic brains show varying patterns of cortical abnormalities, suggesting multiple pathways to dyslexia, depending on which subset of reading-related cognitive networks is affected. This implies the involvement of different neural pathways in the significant variability of reading deficits observed in children with dyslexia.

Focal cortical abnormalities in individuals with dyslexia may disrupt the development of specific cognitive functions that would normally recruit those areas. For example, a study demonstrated a specific relation between the integrity of the left arcuate fasciculus and performance on phoneme awareness and speech perception. Additionally, a connection exists between the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and orthographic processing in dyslexia. The study aimed to explore whether different neural pathways are involved in these two areas of importance.

### The neurological basis of developmental dyslexia: An overview and working hypothesis [^1151Aibo]. Brain (2000). Low credibility.

Five to ten percent of school-age children fail to learn to read despite having normal intelligence, adequate environments, and educational opportunities. Developmental dyslexia (hereafter referred to as dyslexia) is defined as such and is usually considered to be of constitutional origin. However, its actual mechanisms remain mysterious and are currently the subject of intense research in various neuroscientific areas and theoretical frameworks.

This article reviews evidence accumulated at the time of writing that supports a dysfunction of neural systems known to participate in the normal acquisition and achievement of reading and other related cognitive functions. Historically, the first arguments for a neurological basis of dyslexia stemmed from neuropathological studies of brains from dyslexic individuals. Despite criticism, these early studies first highlighted the possibility of an abnormality in specific stages of prenatal maturation of the cerebral cortex and suggested a role for atypical development of brain asymmetries.

This has prompted substantial subsequent work using in vivo imaging methods. However, these latter studies have yielded less clear-cut results than expected, though they have generally confirmed some subtle differences in brain anatomy, the exact significance of which remains under investigation. Neuropsychological studies have provided substantial evidence that the main mechanism leading to these children's learning difficulties is phonological in nature — a basic defect in segmenting and manipulating phoneme constituencies.

### The use of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques to improve reading difficulties in dyslexia: A systematic review [^114ZBP4x]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

Regarding multiple session interventions, studies provide evidence that repeated sessions of tDCS combined with reading interventions can successfully improve reading performance. In these studies, anodal tDCS over the left TPC, and cathodal tDCS over the right TPC, combined with reading training (mostly phonology‐based interventions), improved several reading measures such as pseudoword or low-frequency word reading. Although these results have been observed only at the behavioral level so far, it has been argued that the inhibition of the right TPC and the simultaneous facilitation of the left TPC changed an underlying imbalance that could be at the core of dyslexia. However, it remains yet to be explored how stimulation of these areas alters network-level plasticity and activation/deactivation in the core reading areas during reading processing.

When looking at the single studies targeting other regions, it becomes clear that several other areas and stimulation protocols bear the potential to alleviate reading difficulties in dyslexia. A major problem, however, is determining which reading process can be modulated by which protocol and which area should be targeted, considering the large inter-individual differences on the neural level, which remain underexplored at the time of writing.

Finally, it should be noted that the observed heterogeneity between studies might be partly explained by differences in stimulation parameters. The optimal stimulation intensity for TMS, tDCS, and tACS in the study of reading and dyslexia (and other cognitive functions) is unknown and varies in the existing literature.

### Developmental dyslexia [^117Kxacj]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Reading skills progress in a stage-like manner. There is no evidence that reading, unlike language, develops without direct instruction. Failing to develop preceding skills has a dramatic impact on the development of more sophisticated cognitive skills. For example, children who have poor phonemic sensitivity struggle to develop phonetic decoding; poor word recognition and word decoding skills negatively impact reading comprehension. Primary care physicians need to be aware of reading problems and frequent comorbid conditions. Recognition of risk factors can help physicians direct children early to badly needed resources, which, at the least, decreases the risk for and minimizes the impact of one additional challenge for these children.

### The use of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques to improve reading difficulties in dyslexia: A systematic review [^112M66Xy]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

**Modulating the auditory system through transcranial electrical stimulation**: From a neurophysiological perspective, acoustic information at the phonematic scale is highly dependent on lower gamma oscillations (25–45 Hz), which are also the dominant endogenous activation pattern in the auditory cortex. It was suggested that impaired auditory sampling and a lack of hemispheric specialization for gamma oscillations, as found in adult dyslexics, might affect the perception of acoustic cues and sensitivity to linguistic stimuli. Modulating the auditory system could, hence, lead to higher precision and lower variability in categorical phoneme perception, which might, in turn, impact phonological processing and thus reading. So far, three studies have used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the aim of modulating temporal aspects of word processing and phoneme perception in dyslexia.

### The use of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques to improve reading difficulties in dyslexia: A systematic review [^114ftL6f]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia, henceforth referred to as dyslexia, is a hereditary learning disorder characterized by severe impairments in reading and writing despite normal intelligence. The official diagnosis is "specific learning disability with impairments in reading and written expression" according to DSM V by the American Psychiatric Association. These impairments manifest as delays and increased difficulties during the acquisition of reading and writing, and they may persist into adulthood.

Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been extensively used in the study of language and recently, the focus has shifted to investigating how NIBS studies inform the neurobiology of reading. Although NIBS protocols provide unique tools to explore the underlying reading network and gain insight into the contribution of core reading areas to reading-related processes in dyslexics, only a handful of studies have addressed these issues so far. Compared to the plethora of neuroimaging studies on dyslexics, NIBS studies aiming to improve reading performance in individuals with reading impairments remain scarce.

The aim of this systematic review is to provide a state-of-the-art synthesis of NIBS studies involving dyslexics to enhance understanding of the neurobiology of impaired reading. Furthermore, we aim to elucidate the potential of NIBS for treatment purposes. To this end, we evaluate specific reading interventions used in these studies and discuss their success and applicability. Finally, we pinpoint challenges and potential future research directions.

### The axon guidance receptor gene ROBO1 is a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia [^112GVESc]. PLoS Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Dyslexia, or specific reading disability, is the most common learning disorder with a complex, partially genetic basis, but its biochemical mechanisms remain poorly understood. A locus on Chromosome 3, DYX5, has been linked to dyslexia in one large family and speech-sound disorder in a subset of small families. We found that the axon guidance receptor gene ROBO1, orthologous to the Drosophila roundabout gene, is disrupted by a chromosome translocation in a dyslexic individual.

In a large pedigree with 21 dyslexic individuals genetically linked to a specific haplotype of ROBO1 (not found in any other chromosomes in our samples), the expression of ROBO1 from this haplotype was absent or attenuated in affected individuals. Sequencing of ROBO1 in apes revealed multiple coding differences, and the selection pressure was significantly different among the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla branches as compared to orangutan. We also identified novel exons and splice variants of ROBO1 that may explain the apparent phenotypic differences between human and mouse in heterozygous loss of ROBO1.

We conclude that dyslexia may be caused by partial haplo-insufficiency for ROBO1 in rare families. Thus, our data suggest that a slight disturbance in neuronal axon crossing across the midline between brain hemispheres, dendrite guidance, or another function of ROBO1 may manifest as a specific reading disability in humans.

### Language and reading impairments are associated with increased prevalence of non-right-handedness [^114AJkNz]. Child Development (2023). Low credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of the literature have been inconclusive (Bishop; Eglinton & Annett; Somers et al.) and studies that applied different definitions of dyslexia found inconsistent results in the same dataset (Di Folco et al.). When applying the DSM-5, which is more closely in line with the criteria adopted here, Di Folco and colleagues found an association between handedness and dyslexia that was very similar to our study (OR = 1.24, p = .003). The effect disappeared when applying the ICD-11 definition, which is based on IQ discrepancy. Di Folco and colleagues concluded that the original effect was not specific to reading but mediated by IQ. Such a conclusion was supported by the observation that "non-right-handers scored on average 2 IQ points lower than right-handers". When comparing IQ between NRH and RH cases in the present study, we observed no significant differences with the exception of the UKDYS cohort (uncorrected p = .03). Our observation is in line with meta-analyses investigating the associations between handedness and cognitive abilities, which reported that right-handers had only marginally higher scores compared with left-handers (Ntolka & Papadatou-Pastou).

### Using our current understanding of dyslexia to support early identification and intervention [^111a1VAe]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

One of the major risk factors for reading disability is difficulty learning to read words in text in an accurate and fluent manner. This is apparent when a child at risk of dyslexia first starts to attempt to read. Dyslexic children struggle to grasp and automate the alphabetic principle — i.e. they cannot "sound out" words or use phonemic decoding strategies — and therefore have difficulty deciphering unfamiliar words that they have not encountered before. Even though many of these words are part of the child's oral vocabulary, the child cannot recognize them in printed form. As a result, reading can be extremely laborious and time-consuming, fraught with errors, and altogether an unrewarding, aversive experience.

To be an efficient reader, one must be able to rapidly and effortlessly recognize many words by sight, and for a child to acquire this facility requires multiple exposures to these words. The difficulty that dyslexic children have in developing reliable and efficient phonemic decoding ability makes the acquisition of a lexicon of sight words a much slower process than it is for the average reader. Several other factors can affect a child's ability to read, which are reviewed herein. However, early recognition and treatment of deficient phonologic awareness are an extremely important step in the prevention of a reading problem in the child who is at risk of dyslexia.

### Mutation in CEP63 co-segregating with developmental dyslexia in a Swedish family [^113e2FLj]. Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia is the most common learning disorder in children. Problems in reading and writing are likely due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors, resulting in reduced power of studies of the genetic factors underlying developmental dyslexia. Our approach in the study was to perform exome sequencing of affected and unaffected individuals within an extended pedigree with a familial form of developmental dyslexia. We identified a two-base mutation, causing a p.R229L amino acid substitution in the centrosomal protein 63 kDa (CEP63), co-segregating with developmental dyslexia in this pedigree. This mutation is novel and predicted to be highly damaging for the function of the protein.

3D modelling suggested a distinct conformational change caused by the mutation. CEP63 is localised to the centrosome in eukaryotic cells and is required for maintaining normal centriole duplication and control of cell cycle progression. We found that a common polymorphism in the CEP63 gene had a significant association with brain white matter volume. The brain regions were partly overlapping with the previously reported region influenced by polymorphisms in the dyslexia susceptibility genes DYX1C1 and KIAA0319. We hypothesise that CEP63 is particularly important for brain development and might control the proliferation and migration of cells when those two events need to be highly coordinated.

### Children who read words accurately despite language impairment: Who are they and how do they do it [^115apx1L]. Child Development (2009). Low credibility.

Some children learn to read accurately despite language impairments (LI). Nine- to ten-year-olds were categorized as having LI only (n = 35), dyslexia (DX) only (n = 73), LI + DX (n = 54), or as typically developing (TD; n = 176). The LI-only group had mild to moderate deficits in reading comprehension. They were similar to the LI + DX group on most language measures, but rapid serial naming was superior to the LI + DX group and comparable to the TD group.

For a subset of children seen at four and six years, early phonological skills were equally poor in those later classified as LI or LI + DX. Poor language need not hinder the acquisition of decoding as long as rapid serial naming is intact; however, reading comprehension is constrained by LI.

### Neuroanatomical precursors of dyslexia identified from pre-reading through to age 11 [^115zUTdp]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia is a common reading disorder that negatively impacts an individual's ability to achieve literacy. Although the brain network involved in reading and its dysfunction in dyslexia have been well studied, it is unknown whether dyslexia is caused by structural abnormalities in the reading network itself or in the lower-level networks that provide input to the reading network. In this study, we acquired structural magnetic resonance imaging scans longitudinally from 27 Norwegian children, from before formal literacy training began until after dyslexia was diagnosed. Thus, we were able to determine that the primary neuroanatomical abnormalities that precede dyslexia are not in the reading network itself but rather in lower-level areas responsible for auditory and visual processing and core executive functions. Abnormalities in the reading network itself were only observed at age 11, after children had learned how to read. The findings suggest that abnormalities in the reading network are the consequence of having different reading experiences, rather than dyslexia per se, whereas the neuroanatomical precursors are predominantly in primary sensory cortices.

### Children who read words accurately despite language impairment: Who are they and how do they do it [^114Gp5pE]. Child Development (2009). Low credibility.

Children's reading and language status was coded after first excluding 49 children (13% of the sample) whose Block Design scaled scores were more than 1.33 SD above or below the mean (i.e. all those included had IQs in the range of 80–120). The exclusion of children with low nonverbal ability is a standard approach to ensure language or literacy deficits are not simply part of generally low ability. In this study, high-ability children were also excluded to minimize nonverbal differences between the four groups. One further child was excluded because of incomplete data.

- **Dyslexia**: We followed the customary procedure of defining dyslexia in terms of accuracy of reading single words and nonwords. To ensure that our definition did not include children whose accuracy was achieved only by very slow reading, we used the timed subtests of the TOWRE (sight word efficiency and phonetic decoding efficiency), taking a cutoff of an average score on the two subtests of 83 (i.e. below the 13th percentile).

- **LI**: LI was coded on the basis of 9-year-old test scores, where the child had at least two scores more than 1.33 SD below the normative mean on five core language measures (WASI Vocabulary, WJ Understanding Directions, ERRNI Comprehension, ERRNI MLU, NEPSY Repeating Sentences). This is a similar criterion to that adopted by. See for discussion of this diagnostic approach.

Four groups were formed: 73 children with dyslexia but normal language (DX-only), 35 children with impaired language but normal reading (LI-only), 54 children with both language…

### Developmental dyslexia in Chinese and English populations: Dissociating the effect of dyslexia from language differences [^115yVQKQ]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

- **Research context**: This study explores the differences in developmental dyslexia between Chinese and English populations. The aim is to distinguish the effects of dyslexia itself from those arising due to language-specific factors.
- **Methodology**: The research examines a cohort of participants from both language groups, employing neuroimaging techniques alongside cognitive assessments to identify commonalities and differences in dyslexic profiles.
- **Findings**: Preliminary results suggest that while there are shared neurological underpinnings of dyslexia across languages, there are also distinct language-based variances. These distinctions underscore the importance of considering language-specific educational strategies in addressing dyslexia.
- **Implications for practice**: The study advocates for tailored approaches in dyslexia intervention programs, taking into account linguistic context, which may enhance the effectiveness of educational methodologies for dyslexic individuals in varying language environments.

### Multimodal intervention in 8- to 13-year-old French dyslexic readers: Study protocol for a randomized multicenter controlled crossover trial [^115jtgBq]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The statistical analysis will assess the gains for each dependent variable (reading, spelling, and reading comprehension scores) in each group (groups 1 and 2) and for the total sample. This will involve calculating the mean difference and confidence intervals for several phases: between T1 and T2 (Phase 1 without training), between T2 and T4 (Phase 2 after 16 weeks of training), between T4 and T5 (Phase 2 after 24 weeks of training), and between T5 and T6 (Phase 3 after 8 weeks without training).

The gains between T1 and T2 will be compared to the gains between T2 and T4, T4 and T5, and T5 and T6. This will determine if the differences between T2 and T4, T4 and T5, and T5 and T6 represent a significantly greater gain compared to the no-training phase (T1 to T2).

To measure the effect of each type of training, we will calculate the effect size, using Cohen's d or η², from the gains of each dependent variable. Cohen's d scores of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 are considered to represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.

To determine whether the order of PHO/VA versus VA/PHO training leads to different effects, we will conduct a repeated ANOVA with crossover between groups. This will compare the gains between T2 and T4 of each group, controlling for gains between T2 and T1 without training. This analysis will also help us determine if there is a significant difference between the effects of 8 weeks of phonological training and 8 weeks of visual-attentional training between T2 and T3.

Exploratory factor analysis will be used to verify whether all the items in the questionnaires (pre-test and post-test Likert scale) or, failing that, some of them…

### Developmental dyslexia in Chinese and English populations: Dissociating the effect of dyslexia from language differences [^115QFMKi]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

The English part of the study was approved by the National Hospital and Institute of Neurology's joint ethics committee. All Chinese subjects signed a formal consent as required by the Institute of Linguistics, Xuzhou Normal University. All participants were adolescents (13–16 years of age), right-handed, monolingual with good educational opportunities, and no history of sensory, neurological, or psychiatric impairment or attention deficit disorder.

- **English participants**: Our initial sample included 45 English participants. Among them, 28 had a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia from a prior educational assessment, and 17 were normal readers with no history of learning difficulties. All 45 participants were re-assessed at the time of the experiment using standardized assessments. Reading and spelling were assessed with the Wechsler Objective Reading Dimensions (Rust et al.). Phonological skills were assessed using the Phonological Assessment Battery (Frederickson et al.). Verbal and non-verbal IQ scores were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) [Wechsler]. We excluded four dyslexics whose full-scale IQ on the WISC-III was below 80 (i.e. they were not consistent with our definition of dyslexics) and seven dyslexics whose scores on the reading, spelling, or Phonological Assessment Battery assessments were within the range of our control subjects (i.e. they were not dyslexic according to our assessment). Following functional MRI data collection and analysis, we also excluded six dyslexics and seven controls because: (i) perfo

### Dyslexia and cognitive impairment in adult patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1: A clinical prospective analysis [^112s1X7x]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of dyslexia in our study was based on the guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of children and adolescents with dyslexia 2015 (S3-guideline). There are two criteria used in this study as provided by the guideline: (1) criterion of the deviation from age level and (2) criterion of IQ deviation. The first criterion is met by patients with a reading performance at least 1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean of the same age level. Additionally, the guideline presents the criterion of IQ deviation, which can only be used for patients with a below-average reading performance (> 1 SD below normal range). Depending on the patients' IQ, an appropriate percentile rank (PR) is expected for reading performance. Patients with reading difficulties reaching a PR that is 1 SD below the expected PR fit the criterion of IQ divergence. In general, test results of the SLRT II being at least 1 SD below the average can be interpreted as reading difficulties (cutoff value PR ≤ 16, e.g. ≤ 96 correctly read words and ≤ 55 pseudo-words).

The data of this study were statistically analyzed with SPSS Statistics 25. For the characterization of the DM1 cohort, the assessment of dyslexic features, and the calculation of reading difficulties, descriptive and explorative testing was used. Further statistical analysis was explored with the t-test, comparing the mean values of two independent groups.

### Putative protective neural mechanisms in prereaders with a family history of dyslexia who subsequently develop typical reading skills [^117CSUoi]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

Developmental dyslexia (dyslexia) is a neurodevelopmental learning disability characterized by difficulties with the speed and accuracy of word reading, deficient decoding abilities, and poor spelling (IDA, 2007). Dyslexia has been associated with functional and structural alterations in primarily left-hemispheric reading network components. These components comprise the frontal, temporo-parietal, and occipito-temporal areas that underlie typical reading abilities. Children with dyslexia often experience severe difficulties in their academic and personal lives, as well as mental health issues, due to the importance of reading in school curricula and in society.
