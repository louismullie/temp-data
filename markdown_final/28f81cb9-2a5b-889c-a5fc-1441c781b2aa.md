## Question

A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset palpitations and mild chest discomfort that started 30 minutes ago. She is alert and oriented, with a blood pressure of 128/76 mmHg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and no signs of heart failure. Her ECG shows a regular, narrow-complex tachycardia consistent with orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Vagal maneuvers are attempted but fail to terminate the arrhythmia. The patient has no known drug allergies and no history of heart failure.

What is the next recommended pharmacologic intervention for this patient, and what should be considered if this intervention fails to terminate the tachycardia?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next recommended pharmacologic intervention for a 27-year-old woman with orthodromic AVRT after failed vagal maneuvers, and what to do if that intervention fails. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and hemodynamic stability. Then, I should verify the first-line pharmacologic choice and dosing. Next, I will consider what to do if adenosine fails, including second-line agents and when to escalate to synchronized cardioversion. Finally, I should review special precautions, monitoring, and documentation needs to ensure safe, guideline-concordant care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and stability. The ECG shows a regular, narrow-complex tachycardia at 190 bpm consistent with orthodromic AVRT, the patient is alert with a blood pressure of 128/76 mmHg, and there are no signs of heart failure, which means she is hemodynamically stable and suitable for pharmacologic therapy rather than immediate cardioversion [^0c217444] [^62608ce1].

> Next, I should review the first-line pharmacologic recommendation. Wait, let me verify the dosing range. The ESC guideline recommends intravenous adenosine 6–18 mg as a rapid bolus with a saline flush, typically starting with 6 mg and escalating to 12 mg if needed, and up to 18 mg if the second dose fails, with success rates around 90–95% for AVNRT/AVRT, which aligns with contemporary summaries and ACLS guidance for regular narrow-complex tachycardias [^0c217444] [^760582d2] [^7b840777] [^e3581309].

> I need to ensure proper administration technique. Adenosine should be delivered through a proximal IV site as a rapid bolus followed immediately by a 10–20 mL saline flush to achieve transient AV nodal blockade and interrupt the reentrant circuit; continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring are essential during administration to detect transient bradyarrhythmias or other adverse effects [^25b0ada7] [^508cf5ec].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without context. Adenosine can precipitate atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in patients with concealed accessory pathways, so I should confirm that synchronized cardioversion capability is available and that the team is prepared if AF with pre-excitation emerges; this is a key precaution emphasized in guideline and pharmacology consensus statements [^e3581309] [^dbebadde].

> If adenosine fails after appropriate dosing and technique, I should consider second-line agents. Let me think about the hierarchy. IV nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil) or IV beta-blockers (esmolol or metoprolol) are reasonable next steps in hemodynamically stable patients without decompensated heart failure, with diltiazem or verapamil often favored for their efficacy and relatively rapid onset; I should double-check that these are not used in wide-complex tachycardias of uncertain mechanism or in pre-excited atrial fibrillation, where they may be harmful [^3c41217a] [^62608ce1] [^c1931ef6].

> I should confirm dosing and precautions for these second-line agents. For diltiazem, a typical approach is 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes with a second dose of 0.35 mg/kg if needed, while monitoring for hypotension; for verapamil, 5–10 mg IV over 1–2 minutes with repeat dosing if needed, again with close hemodynamic monitoring; for esmolol, 500 mcg/kg IV bolus over 1 minute followed by a 50–300 mcg/kg/min infusion with titration; for metoprolol, 2.5–5 mg IV every 5–10 minutes up to three doses, watching for bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm, especially in patients with reactive airway disease or decompensated heart failure [^508cf5ec] [^7bbb8068] [^a7e053e3].

> But wait, what if the rhythm converts briefly and then recurs, or if the patient becomes unstable during therapy. I should reassess hemodynamics after each intervention; if instability emerges or if pharmacologic therapy fails, synchronized cardioversion is indicated, with appropriate sedation and energy selection for narrow-complex SVT, and I should remember that cardioversion is not appropriate for rhythms that break and recur spontaneously, which would instead prompt alternative strategies or expert consultation [^62608ce1] [^39222f77] [^5d267fcc].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. For stable orthodromic AVRT, the sequence is vagal maneuvers, then adenosine, then IV diltiazem/verapamil or IV beta-blockers if adenosine fails, and then synchronized cardioversion if drugs fail or instability develops; I should also plan for observation after conversion, document the rhythm diagnosis, and arrange cardiology follow-up to discuss curative ablation, given its high success and low complication rates for AVRT [^0c217444] [^62608ce1] [^d6adb685].

---

The next recommended pharmacologic intervention is **IV adenosine 6 mg rapid bolus** with a 12 mg bolus if needed [^760582d2] [^c1931ef6]. If adenosine fails, **IV diltiazem or IV beta-blocker** (esmolol or metoprolol) are appropriate second-line options [^3c41217a] [^62608ce1]. If the patient becomes unstable or drug therapy fails, proceed to **synchronized cardioversion** [^39222f77] [^62608ce1].

## Recommended pharmacologic intervention

### Intravenous adenosine

- **First-line therapy**: IV adenosine is the recommended first-line pharmacologic intervention for hemodynamically stable orthodromic AVRT when vagal maneuvers fail [^0c217444] [^62608ce1].

- **Dosage and administration**: Administer 6 mg IV rapid bolus followed by a 12 mg IV rapid bolus if the initial dose fails to terminate the arrhythmia. Each dose should be followed by a rapid saline flush [^508cf5ec].

- **Mechanism of action**: Adenosine temporarily blocks the AV node, interrupting the reentrant circuit and restoring sinus rhythm [^63e77dbc].

- **Efficacy**: Adenosine is effective in terminating orthodromic AVRT in approximately 90–95% of cases [^e3581309].

- **Precautions**: Adenosine may cause transient bradycardia, flushing, chest discomfort, or bronchospasm. It should be administered with continuous ECG monitoring and resuscitation equipment readily available [^e3581309].

## Alternative pharmacologic interventions if adenosine fails

If adenosine fails to terminate the arrhythmia, **second-line pharmacologic options** include:

| **Medication** | **Dosage and administration** | **Mechanism of action** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Diltiazem | 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes; repeat once if needed | Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that slows AV nodal conduction | - Hypotension <br/> - Bradycardia <br/> - Avoid in severe LV dysfunction or HFrEF [^772efc22] |
| Esmolol | 500 mcg/kg IV bolus over 1 minute; infusion 50–300 mcg/kg/min | Short-acting beta-blocker that slows AV nodal conduction | - Hypotension <br/> - Bradycardia <br/> - Avoid in reactive airway disease or decompensated HF [^7bbb8068] |
| Metoprolol | 2.5–5 mg IV bolus every 5 minutes; maximum 15 mg | Beta-blocker that slows AV nodal conduction | - Hypotension <br/> - Bradycardia <br/> - Avoid in reactive airway disease or decompensated HF [^a7e053e3] |

## Non-pharmacologic intervention if pharmacologic therapy fails

If pharmacologic therapy fails or the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, **synchronized cardioversion** is indicated [^39222f77]. Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment of hemodynamically unstable patients with supraventricular tachycardia, including orthodromic AVRT, when pharmacological therapy is ineffective or contraindicated [^62608ce1] [^c1931ef6].

---

## Summary of recommended management sequence

- **Vagal maneuvers**: First-line intervention [^a9bbb78e].

- **IV adenosine**: 6 mg rapid bolus, followed by 12 mg if needed [^0c217444].

- **Second-line therapy**: IV diltiazem or IV beta-blocker (esmolol or metoprolol) if adenosine fails [^3c41217a].

- **Synchronized cardioversion**: If pharmacologic therapy fails or the patient becomes unstable [^39222f77].

---

The next recommended pharmacologic intervention for a hemodynamically stable 27-year-old female with orthodromic AVRT after failed vagal maneuvers is **IV adenosine 6 mg rapid bolus**, with a 12 mg bolus if needed. If adenosine fails, IV diltiazem or IV beta-blocker (esmolol or metoprolol) are appropriate second-line options. If pharmacologic therapy fails or the patient becomes unstable, proceed to synchronized cardioversion.

Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) acute treatment — vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and these maneuvers should be performed with the patient in the supine position; the practice of applying pressure to the eyeball is potentially dangerous and has been abandoned. Adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and can be considered as both a therapeutic and diagnostic agent in narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias; it will acutely terminate AVNRT in approximately 95% of patients and will unmask atrial activity in arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or AT. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT when adenosine and vagal maneuvers do not terminate the tachycardia or are not feasible, and synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when pharmacological therapy does not terminate the tachycardia or is contraindicated. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT, whereas oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT. Intravenous amiodarone may be considered for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated.

### Common types of supraventricular tachycardia: diagnosis and management [^ab580a4b]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is an abnormal rapid cardiac rhythm that involves atrial or atrioventricular node tissue from the His bundle or above. Paroxysmal SVT, a subset of supraventricular dysrhythmias, has three common types: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. Presenting symptoms may include altered consciousness, chest pressure or discomfort, dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, or palpitations. Diagnostic evaluation may be performed in the outpatient setting and includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, electrocardiography, and laboratory workup. Extended cardiac monitoring with a Holter monitor or event recorder may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Acute management of paroxysmal SVT is similar across the various types and is best completed in the emergency department or hospital setting. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, synchronized cardioversion is first-line management. In those who are hemodynamically stable, vagal maneuvers are first-line management, followed by stepwise medication management if ineffective. Beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers may be used acutely or for long-term suppressive therapy. When evaluating patients for paroxysmal SVTs, clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to a cardiologist for electrophysiologic study and appropriate intervention such as ablation. Clinicians should use a patient-centered approach when formulating a long-term management plan for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Catheter ablation has a high success rate and is recommended as the first-line method for long-term management of recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal SVT, including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Atrioventricular-nodal-reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is a form of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that is relatively common in the emergency department (ED). It is rarely indicative of underlying electrical or structural pathology.

Objective

This review evaluates the literature and controversies concerning treatment of AVNRT in the ED.

Discussion

For treatment of narrow-complex tachycardia, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines recommend the use of vagal maneuvers, followed by adenosine. Recent literature suggests that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil and diltiazem, may be as effective as adenosine, without the negative short-term side effects. Multiple studies have demonstrated that although adenosine is rapid acting, there is no statistically significant difference in conversion rate between adenosine and calcium channel blockers. Both medications result in a conversion rate above 90%, but there are significantly more minor adverse effects, such as flushing or chest discomfort, with adenosine. Calcium channel blockers are a viable option for treatment for AVNRT, especially in refractory states. Beta-blockers have been evaluated but should not be used routinely due to lower efficacy. AVNRT is the most common tachydysrhythmia in pregnancy, and vagal maneuvers and adenosine are first line. Electrical cardioversion should be utilized for hemodynamically unstable patients. Most patients with AVNRT may be discharged with appropriate follow-up.

Conclusion

Several studies demonstrate that nondihydropyridine calcium channels (verapamil and diltiazem) are equally as efficacious as adenosine in converting AVNRT to sinus rhythm, without the negative (albeit short-lived) side effects. If given over 20 min, the risk for hypotension is low.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^d6adb685]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), defined as tachyarrhythmias that originate from or conduct through the atria or atrioventricular node with abrupt onset, affects 168 to 332 per 100 000 individuals. Untreated PSVT is associated with adverse outcomes including high symptom burden and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

Observations

Approximately 50% of patients with PSVT are aged 45 to 64 years and 67.5% are female. Most common symptoms include palpitations (86%), chest discomfort (47%), and dyspnea (38%). Patients may rarely develop tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy (1%) due to PSVT. Diagnosis is made on electrocardiogram during an arrhythmic event or using ambulatory monitoring. First-line acute therapy for hemodynamically stable patients includes vagal maneuvers such as the modified Valsalva maneuver (43% effective) and intravenous adenosine (91% effective). Emergent cardioversion is recommended for patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Catheter ablation is safe, highly effective, and recommended as first-line therapy to prevent recurrence of PSVT. Meta-analysis of observational studies shows single catheter ablation procedure success rates of 94.3% to 98.5%. Evidence is limited for the effectiveness of long-term pharmacotherapy to prevent PSVT. Nonetheless, guidelines recommend therapies including calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, and antiarrhythmic agents as management options.

Conclusion and Relevance

Paroxysmal SVT affects both adult and pediatric populations and is generally a benign condition. Catheter ablation is the most effective therapy to prevent recurrent PSVT. Pharmacotherapy is an important component of acute and long-term management of PSVT.

### Emergency department management of the pediatric patient with supraventricular tachycardia [^2f56ff40]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common tachyarrhythmia that necessitates treatment in children. It is characterized by a rapid and regular heart rate, which generally exceeds 180 beats per minute in children and 220 beats per minute in adolescents. Supraventricular tachycardia results from conduction of electrical impulses along an accessory connection from the atrium to the ventricle (atrioventricular reentry tachycardias: orthodromic or antidromic) or conduction within the atrioventricular node (atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia). Emergency department management of SVT depends on the patient's clinical status. Treatment of a stable patient with SVT includes vagal maneuvers and adenosine, whereas treatment of an unstable patient requires synchronized cardioversion. This article presents an overview of the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of SVT and discusses the emergency department management of an infant or child with SVT.

Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) — management states that "Catheter ablation, due to its high efficacy, is recommended for the majority of patients with AVNRT and AVRT". Until ablation is available, patients "may respond to vagal manoeuvres, carotid massage, or adenosine", though "Adenosine should be used with caution because it may provoke AF with a rapid ventricular response in the presence of pre-excitation" and can "induce or worsen myocardial ischaemia" in severe coronary stenosis. In pre-excitation, AV nodal–slowing agents "are discouraged", "Class IC AADs (flecainide, propafenone) are contraindicated in the presence of structural heart disease (especially after myocardial infarction)", and "Class III drugs are discouraged for the treatment of SVT (although they may be effective) because of their toxicity and the potential of proarrhythmias (e.g. TdP)".

### High-dose adenosine for treatment of refractory supraventricular tachycardia in an emergency department of an academic medical center: a case report and literature review [^478d2cbf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Symptomatic tachycardia is a common admission diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). This can be a life-threatening condition and requires immediate attention. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is commonly treated with adenosine, and successful treatment is limited to atrioventricular (AV) node-dependent SVTs as adenosine causes a transient heart block. However, there are limited data available for instances when the recommended dosing regimen (6 mg, 12 mg, 12 mg) fails to terminate SVT.

Case Report

A 33-year old man was evaluated in the ED with an electrocardiogram revealing a regular narrow complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 180 beats/min and a rhythm consistent with SVT. He reported experiencing 3 days of fatigue, myalgias, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, but was otherwise hemodynamically stable. Attempts at chemical cardioversion with standard doses of adenosine (6 mg, 12 mg, and 12 mg) were given without success. After consultation with the cardiology service, additional doses of 24 mg and then 36 mg of adenosine were administered. The last dose of 36 mg produced sustained conversion and return to a normal sinus rhythm. The patient later underwent radiofrequency ablation of a left-sided orthodromic reciprocating accessory pathway. After 3 months of medical management, the patient had an implantable cardiac defibrillator placed for prevention of sudden cardiac death. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Each case of SVT demands immediate attention from an emergency physician. It is imperative that providers be aware of the limitations of adenosine and when it may be appropriate to deviate from standard dosing recommendations. This is in addition to collaborating with an expert in cardiac electrophysiology when initial management tactics are not successful.

### Common types of supraventricular tachycardia: diagnosis… [^29c53477]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Classically, the term paroxysmal SVT includes most tachycardias, except ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, with paroxysmal SVT comprising a subset that is characterized by a regular tachycardia having abrupt onset and termination. The prevalence of paroxysmal SVT is 2. 29 per 1, 000 people in the general population. 9 The most serious manifestation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is sudden cardiac death secondary to atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation that conducts rapidly to the ventricle over the accessory pathway resulting in ventricular fibrillation. Of note, concealed accessory pathways conduct only in the retrograde direction and therefore do not produce delta waves. Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia can occur without the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome pattern when the accessory pathway is retrograde and/or does not create a delta wave.

ECG typically shows a ventricular rate ranging from 150 to 250 beats per minute, a narrow QRS complex, inverted P waves, and an RP interval that is usually less than one-half of the tachycardia RR interval. In the antidromic form of atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, premature atrial beats are blocked by the atrioventricular node but have anterograde conduction through the accessory pathway causing ventricular depolarization. After conduction through the ventricles, the impulse travels in the retrograde direction through the His bundle and atrioventricular node to the atria, completing the reentrant loop. ECG shows a ventricular rate ranging from 150 to 200 beats per minute, a wide QRS complex, inverted P waves, an RP interval that is usually more than one-half of the tachycardia RR interval, and a short PR interval. 11 A variety of symptoms have been associated with paroxysmal SVT and may provide the first diagnostic clue.

Table 3 includes the differential diagnosis for narrow complex tachycardia. In some patients, particularly young women, paroxysmal SVT may be misdiagnosed as panic or anxiety attacks leading to a delay in diagnosis. An underlying psychiatric history has also been associated with a delay in appropriate diagnosis of paroxysmal SVT. 4, 13. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION The in-office evaluation of paroxysmal SVT should include a physical examination and ECG.

### Vagal termination of ventricular tachycardia in a pediatric patient [^39c34f40]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia is a rare clinical entity in pediatric patients and typically requires chemical and/or electrical intervention to convert into a sustained sinus rhythm. However, for certain forms originating from the right ventricular outflow tract, conversion with adenosine and vagal maneuvers has been demonstrated in adult patients. In this case, we suggest that pediatric patients with right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia who are hemodynamically stable may benefit from a trial of vagal maneuvers.

### Novel vagal maneuver technique for termination of supraventricular tachycardias [^3389455c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Hemodynamically unstable patients with supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) should be treated with electrical cardioversion. If the patient is stable, acute termination of tachycardia can be achieved by vagal maneuvers or medical therapy. The Valsalva maneuver, carotid massage, and ice to the face are the most common vagal maneuvers. In our experience with patients, we observed that vagal stimulation increases with lying backward. Our suggested maneuver is based on quickly lying backward, from a seated position. Then, a short and powerful vagal stimulation occurs. Thus, SVT episodes can be terminated. Here we present our experience of a new maneuver for terminating SVT, with cases.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in the perioperative/critical care setting — acute diagnosis and therapy: SVT is usually a regular narrow-QRS tachycardia (less than 120 ms) in the absence of pre-existing bundle branch block. Vagal manoeuvres may help differentiate AVNRT and AVRT from AT by stopping AVNRT and AVRT; if vagal manoeuvres fail, intravenous adenosine should be administered for arrhythmia termination in haemodynamically stable patients. In narrow-QRS tachycardia, adenosine, calcium channel blockers (verapamil), or beta-blocking agents are the drugs of first choice, with adenosine having the advantage of its rapidity of onset and short half-life. In wide QRS tachycardia (greater than 120 ms), if the diagnosis is not possible the tachycardia should be treated as a VT. Flecainide may be used intravenously in AVRT or AT but is contra-indicated in case of low LVEF or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and amiodarone may be necessary in case of impaired LVEF or heart failure.

The goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.

### ECG clues for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia mechanism [^c1b7e0ba]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms underlie the initiation and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia: automaticity, triggered activity, and reentry. As straightforward as these mechanisms are, assessing which mechanism is operative in a particular patient's ventricular tachycardia can be difficult. The optimal treatment strategy for ventricular tachycardia in a given patient can be influenced by the mechanism underlying the ventricular tachycardia. Appropriately counseling patients, choosing the optimal pharmacologic agent that maximizes efficacy while minimizing undesirable side effects, risks, and toxicities, as well as recommending and timing ablative therapy all hinge on identifying the probable mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. Much has been published regarding invasive electrophysiologic maneuvers that allow for correct diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia mechanism. The aim of this clinical review is to provide insight into VT mechanisms based on ECG clues of spontaneous arrhythmia events and the response to pharmacologic manipulation prior to invasive electrophysiologic evaluation.

### Diagnosis and management of common types of supraventricular tachycardia [^406cd9d3]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia refers to rapid rhythms that originate and are sustained in atrial or atrioventricular node tissue above the bundle of His. The condition is caused by reentry phenomena or automaticity at or above the atrioventricular node, and includes atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. Most persons with these tachyarrhythmias have structurally normal hearts. Sudden onset of an accelerated heart rate can cause palpitations, light-headedness, chest discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea, or fatigue. The history is important to elicit episodic symptoms because physical examination and electrocardiography findings may be normal. A Holter monitor or event recorder may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Vagal maneuvers may terminate the arrhythmia; if this fails, adenosine is effective in the acute setting. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil) or beta blockers (metoprolol) can be used acutely or as long-term therapy. Class Ic antiarrhythmics (flecainide or propafenone) can be used long-term. Class Ia antiarrhythmics (quinidine, procainamide, or disopyramide) are used less often because of their modest effectiveness and adverse effects. Class III antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol, or dofetilide) are effective, but have potential adverse effects and should be administered in consultation with a cardiologist. Catheter ablation has a success rate of 95% and recurrence rate of less than 5%, and causes inadvertent heart block in less than 1% of patients. It is the preferred treatment for symptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common tachyarrhythmia in young adults, children, and infants. Treatment of SVT is based on the patient's hemodynamic stability. The vagal maneuvers and/or pharmaceutical therapy are recommended for hemodynamically stable patients. Studies have reported the effectiveness of vagal maneuvers (carotid sinus massage) in SVT termination to be around 19%–54%. The relatively low success rate of vagal maneuvers makes adenosine crucial in terminating SVT.

The standard guidelines for management of SVT state that adenosine should be the first medication therapy if vagal maneuvers fail to terminate SVT. A recent systematic review showed that adenosine was not only equally efficacious in treating SVT but was also safer than intravenous calcium channel blockers (CCB). Furthermore, another study found adenosine to be a safe and effective treatment for SVT in pre‐hospital settings. It has a success rate of over 90% for terminating SVT.

Pediatric SVT — supportive evidence for vagal maneuvers and adenosine — Vagal maneuvers are noninvasive, have few adverse effects, and effectively terminate SVT in many cases; exact success rates for each type of maneuver are unknown, and although improved success rates have been reported with a postural modification to the standard Valsalva maneuver in adults, published pediatric experience with this technique is very limited; upside-down positioning may be an additional form of a vagal maneuver that is effective in children. IV adenosine remains generally effective for terminating re-entrant SVT within the first 2 doses, a Cochrane review showed that either adenosine or calcium channel blockers can be used for quick termination of SVT, and given the fast onset of action, short half-life, and favorable side effect profile, adenosine is preferred for infants and children.

### When adenosine does not work: apparent and real adenosine-resistant tachycardia [^d402bc63]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common arrhythmia in the pediatric population. Adenosine is widely accepted as the first-line pharmacological treatment for hemodynamically stable SVT, constituting a class I recommendation in the 2020 American Heart Association guidelines for pediatric life support (2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care). As most pediatric SVTs are dependent on the atrioventricular node (AVN) for their propagation, and adenosine acts primarily on the AVN, adenosine will frequently terminate the arrhythmia. The term "adenosine failure" is often used to describe when its administration does not result in sustained termination of the tachycardia. Because of its very short half-life, there is confusion between improper delivery, failure to have any effect on the tachycardia, or transient termination. There are some pediatric SVTs, which are not AVN dependent, and which truly are refractory to adenosine. Simultaneous electrocardiogram recording during administration can provide important information to differentiate between adenosine resistance and transient adenosine effect, thus guiding further management.

### Management of common arrhythmias: part I. supraventricular arrhythmias [^6aed112d]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter patients with symptoms that could be related to cardiac arrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardias. The initial management of atrial fibrillation includes ventricular rate control to provide adequate cardiac output. In patients with severely depressed cardiac output and recent-onset atrial fibrillation, immediate electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice. Hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation for more than two days or for an unknown period should be assessed for the presence of atrial thrombi. If thrombi are detected on transesophageal echocardiography, anticoagulation with warfarin for a minimum of 21 days is recommended before electrical cardioversion is attempted. Patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias may be treated with adenosine, a calcium channel blocker, or a short-acting beta blocker to disrupt reentrant pathways. When initial medications are ineffective, radiofrequency ablation of ectopic sites is an increasingly popular treatment option.

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia — clinical considerations for acute management note that electrical cardioversion is always indicated for hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, and monomorphic VT is usually related to a structural abnormality such as MI scarring but is mechanistically heterogeneous; some "idiopathic" VTs respond well and terminate with intravenous verapamil or adenosine, and if these unique VT entities cannot be recognized with confidence, it is prudent to assume that one is dealing with VT related to structural heart disease. Timely termination is usually desirable even if VT is well tolerated, this can be achieved with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques, and DC cardioversion even at early stage or as a "first line" is reasonable; caution needs to be exercised if the patient also has concurrent AF (e.g., double tachycardia), and if such is the case, the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation need to be followed when feasible. Initial treatment often includes the administration of intravenous antiarrhythmic medication, with advantages including the lack of necessity for anesthesia and ready availability and disadvantages including delay in termination, failure to terminate in some patients, and adverse effects including hypotension and proarrhythmia; only intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, and amiodarone are widely available and intravenous ajmaline is used frequently in some European countries. Intravenous amiodarone loading has proved useful in unstable and recurrent VT and it is also reasonable in patients in whom oral amiodarone is required after the intravenous phase; although intravenous amiodarone has an early effect on AV nodal conduction, the effects on myocardial conduction and refractoriness are gradual in onset and maximum effect may not be seen for weeks or months, so intravenous amiodarone is not ideal for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT, whereas intravenous procainamide is more appropriate when early slowing of the VT rate and termination of monomorphic VT are desired; close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status is recommended in the presence of congestive HF or severe LV dysfunction as intravenous procainamide can cause transient hypotension, and lidocaine is effective when VT is thought to be related to myocardial ischemia.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia mechanisms on the 12-lead ECG — classification by regularity and atrioventricular relationships: For a patient presenting in SVT, the 12-lead ECG can potentially identify the arrhythmia mechanism and the tachycardia should first be classified as having a regular or irregular ventricular rate; an irregular ventricular rate suggests atrial fibrillation (AF), multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), or atrial flutter with variable AV conduction, and with a rapid ventricular response AF can be misdiagnosed as a regular SVT. If the atrial rate exceeds the ventricular rate, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia (AT) is usually present, though rare cases of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) with 2:1 conduction have been described. If the SVT is regular, this may represent AVNRT with 1:1 conduction or an SVT that involves the AV node; junctional tachycardias can be regular or irregular with variable atrial conduction, in typical AVNRT the terminal P wave lies at the end of the QRS (pseudo S in inferior leads and pseudo R' in V1), and in orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) the P wave is usually seen in the early ST‑T segment. Typical AVNRT and AVRT have a "short RP" with a 1:1 P‑QRS relationship, whereas unusual AVNRT (such as "fast‑slow") and the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) have a long RP; a long RP interval is typical of AT.

### Rationale for and design of a multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study to assess efficacy and safety of intranasal etripamil for the conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^48fa7257]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Presently, acute pharmacological termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) unresponsive to patient-initiated vagal maneuvers requires in-hospital intervention. Etripamil, a fast-acting, nondihydropyridine, L-type calcium channel blocker, is formulated as an intranasal spray to rapidly terminate atrioventricular (AV) nodal-dependent PSVT in a medically unsupervised setting. The NODE-301 study did not meet its prespecified primary end point of PSVT conversion over 5 hours following a single dose of etripamil 70 mg. However, analysis at earlier time points demonstrated etripamil treatment effect during the first 30 minutes, consistent with its expected rapid onset and short duration of action. This led to the design of the RAPID study, which includes a new dosing regimen (up to 2 etripamil 70 mg doses separated by 10 minutes) to increase the exposure and pharmacodynamic effect of etripamil. The primary objective of RAPID (NCT03464019) is to determine if etripamil self-administered by patients is superior to placebo in terminating PSVT in an at-home setting. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of etripamil when self-administered by patients without medical supervision. Additional efficacy end points include the proportion of patients requiring additional medical intervention in an emergency department to terminate PSVT and patient-reported outcomes. After successfully completing a test dose to assess the safety of 2 70 mg doses of etripamil during sinus rhythm, approximately 500 patients will be randomized 1:1 to etripamil or placebo to accrue 180 positively adjudicated AV nodal-dependent PSVT events for treatment with the study drug. Etripamil may offer a new alternative to the current in-hospital treatment modality, providing for safe and effective at-home termination of PSVT.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^a9bc288b]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2 lists the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the individual features calculated over the total population. Termination with adenosine and a typical SVT EKG had the highest sensitivity and PPV (85%–95%). Termination with vagal stimulation had a high PPV (85%) but a low NPV (21%), reflecting the fact that vagal stimulation is often insufficient to terminate SVT. A monitored event lasting ≥ 30 s had a moderate PPV and NPV (76% and 49%), reflecting the sporadic nature of SVT events. Pre‐excitation was highly predictive of an ablation being performed, but only modestly predictive of SVT induction.

Table 2
Statistical parameters.

We generated a point‐based score system for estimating the preoperative probability that SVT will be induced or ablated (Figure 6B). The score reflects the relative predictive strength of each feature. Patients with any score ≥ 3 (i.e. any individual feature except pre‐excitation) have a probability of SVT induction and ablation of at least 60%. Other scoring systems based on patient questionnaires agree that those who report documentation of tachycardia, termination with medications or vagal maneuvers, or longer symptomatic episodes are more likely to have SVT induced.

In many respects our findings corroborate what would be expected from clinical intuition. One common thread is that longer duration tachycardia episodes predict successful SVT induction and ablation. We found that the cutoff duration of a monitored episode that best distinguishes inducible from noninducible patients is 30 s (Figure 4D). Some of other positively predictive features also reflect longer duration episodes. For example, to have a 12 lead EKG taken during SVT or to be given adenosine, the patient's tachycardia would have to last long enough for them to seek medical attention and undergo at least a rudimentary evaluation.

Termination of tachycardia by adenosine strongly suggests that the arrhythmia is a form of SVT that uses the AV node as part of the circuit, such as AVNRT or AVRT. Adenosine also suppresses triggered activity and can terminate the majority of FATs, many of which have a triggered mechanism. Adenosine causes only transient slowing of other common narrow complex tachycardias such as sinus tachycardia, AF, or AFL. Vagus nerve stimulation also slows AV conduction and suppresses triggered activity, but not to the same extent as adenosine.

We discuss the current knowledge on the subject, using the cases and the figure as a framework.

Case 1

Although AV(N)RT in pregnancy are usually well tolerated, they can become symptomatic or cause haemodynamic instability, especially in the presence of underlying heart disease. After primary examination with appropriate workup, vagal manoeuvres, pharmacological treatment with adenosine intravenously are the first choice of treatment in the acute setting in haemodynamically stable patients (figure 5). In case of insufficient effect or haemodynamic compromise, ECV is indicated, especially as in pregnancy some medication may be harmful.

### Approach to the diagnosis and initial management of the stable adult patient with a wide complex tachycardia [^94472ce5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The initial electrocardiographic evaluation of every tachyarrhythmia should begin by addressing the question of whether the QRS complex is wide or narrow. The most important cause of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is ventricular tachycardia. However, supraventricular tachycardia can also manifest with a wide QRS complex. The ability to differentiate between supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS due to aberrancy or preexcitation and ventricular tachycardia often presents a diagnostic challenge. The identification of whether WCT has a ventricular or supraventricular origin is critical because the treatment for each is different, and improper therapy may have potentially lethal consequences. In conclusion, although the diagnosis and treatment of sustained WCT often arise in emergency situations, this report focuses on a stepwise approach to the management of WCT in relatively stable adult patients, particularly the diagnosis and differentiation of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex on standard 12-lead electrocardiography.

### Verapamil hci [^0c7e3741]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including:

- Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to Verapamil administration.

- Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, except when the atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes).

In controlled studies in the U.S., about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. About 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate respond with a decrease in heart rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after Verapamil hydrochloride and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, since the conversion rate after placebo was similar. The effect of a single injection lasts for 30–60 minutes when conversion to sinus rhythm does not occur.

Because a small fraction (< 1.0%) of patients treated with Verapamil hydrochloride respond with life-threatening adverse responses (rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation with an accessory bypass tract, marked hypotension, or extreme bradycardia/asystole — see Contraindications and Warnings), the initial use of intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride should, if possible, be in a treatment setting with monitoring and resuscitation facilities, including DC-cardioversion capability (see Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions). As familiarity with the patient's response is gained, an office setting may be acceptable.

### Atrial tachycardia mimicking atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia [^1d5f5d60]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The term supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is used to describe tachydysrhythmias that require atrial or atrioventricular nodal tissue for their initiation and maintenance. SVT can be used to describe atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, atrioventricular reentry tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia (AT). AT is the least common of these SVT subtypes, accounting for only 10% of cases. Although the suggested initial management of each SVT subtype is different, they all can present with similar symptoms and electrocardiographic findings.

Objective

Discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AT as compared with other types of SVT.

Case Report

We report a 56-year-old woman with symptoms and electrocardiographic findings consistent with SVT. Although standard treatment with intravenous adenosine failed to convert the SVT, it revealed AT as the cause of the tachydysrhythmia. The AT was successfully terminated with beta-blockade and the patient eventually underwent successful radioablation of three separate AT foci.

Conclusions

AT frequently mimics other more common forms of SVT. AT might be recognized only when standard treatment of SVT has failed. Identification of AT in this setting is crucial to allow for more definitive therapy.
