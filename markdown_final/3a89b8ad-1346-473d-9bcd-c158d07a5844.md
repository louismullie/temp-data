## Question

Is unusual to have a high osmol gap and a high anion Gap metabolic acidosis with a low urine specific gravity of less than 1. The anion gap is 29. There is also hypocalcemia, sodium, potassium, and albumin are also low. Acetaminophen overdose and Keto-acidocis can be ruled out. There's no abnormalities involving ketones for this patient. No protein or ketones were found in the urine, though there was Trace amounts of blood found in the urine. Sepsis seems unlikely and no possible source of a potential cause of sepsis was found either. The patient had rapid-onset, acute, kidney and liver damage. His baseline troponin (with high-sensitivity TROPONIN assays)-on admission was 15 and it climbed up to 400 by the second day but has been treading downward since then. Lactic acid results have been sporadic But ultimately any lactic acidosis has resolved at this point. Nurses have had difficulty with intubation mostly do too persistent tremors from the patient and vent compliance difficulty.
The patient also has prolonged QT-syndrome.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is unusual to have both a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and an elevated osmolal gap alongside very low urine specific gravity, and wants help interpreting these findings (with associated hypocalcemia and prolonged QT) to develop a focused differential and immediate management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the acid-base pattern and whether the anion gap is truly elevated after albumin correction. Then, I should verify the osmolal gap calculation and its differential. Next, I will examine the electrolyte abnormalities and their cardiac implications, especially hypocalcemia and QT risk. After that, I need to integrate the low urine specific gravity with the renal and hepatic injury pattern. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and test it against the data. Finally, I will outline immediate management priorities, including arrhythmia mitigation, acid-base and electrolyte correction, and indications for renal replacement therapy, while double-checking for pitfalls and ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and pathophysiology [^115oS1GG] [^115VvaKe] [^115ASp9R].

> Let me first confirm the acid-base disorder and the anion gap. The reported anion gap is 29, which is clearly elevated above the usual 8–12 mEq/L range, but wait, I should verify the albumin-corrected anion gap because hypoalbuminemia lowers the baseline anion gap and can mask a high gap; with low albumin, the corrected anion gap is likely even higher than 29, reinforcing a true high anion gap metabolic acidosis rather than a mixed pattern, and I should double-check the delta gap to assess for a superimposed non–anion gap process as well [^115oS1GG] [^113JDFth].

> Next, I should review the osmolal gap. An elevated osmolal gap suggests unmeasured osmoles such as toxic alcohols or propylene glycol; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — early toxic alcohol ingestions can show a high osmolal gap before metabolism generates acids, and later the gap may fall as metabolites accumulate, so timing matters; I need to calculate the osmolal gap using the standard formula and consider serial measurements if the initial value is borderline or discordant with the clinical picture [^111QBddX] [^115BQ8FH].

> I will now examine the electrolyte abnormalities and their cardiac implications. Hypocalcemia is a major driver of prolonged QT and torsades risk, and I should confirm ionized calcium because total calcium can be misleading in the setting of low albumin; hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia further amplify arrhythmia risk, so I need to check and correct these urgently in parallel with acid-base management; the combination of acidosis, hypocalcemia, and electrolyte shifts in AKI markedly increases the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, so continuous telemetry and readiness to treat TdP are essential [^1114qAWd] [^1175DvPq] [^115Mu5An].

> Let me consider the low urine specific gravity in context. Initially, I thought this might reflect osmotic diuresis from unmetabolized alcohols, but wait, I should verify whether that fits the timeline and the current acid-base state; with established AKI and likely concentrating defect, a low specific gravity more plausibly reflects intrinsic renal injury and impaired concentrating ability rather than ongoing osmotic diuresis, so I should not overinterpret this single finding without integrating creatinine trends and urine output [^notfound].

> Now, I need to construct and prioritize the differential for high anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated osmolal gap. Toxic alcohols remain high on the list: ethylene glycol classically causes high anion gap acidosis, hypocalcemia from calcium oxalate complexation, and an elevated osmolal gap early, with calcium oxalate crystals sometimes seen on urinalysis; methanol causes formate accumulation with optic toxicity; propylene glycol from sedative infusions can cause a high anion gap acidosis with osmolal gap and AKI; isopropanol elevates the osmolal gap but causes a non–anion gap acidosis, which makes it less likely here; I should also keep pyroglutamic acidosis in mind if there is chronic acetaminophen exposure, though that typically lacks an osmolal gap; finally, I must not forget that severe AKI/uremia can itself contribute unmeasured anions and a modest osmolal gap, so I should correlate with BUN and creatinine kinetics [^115BQ8FH] [^113fRp4K] [^115MCQyK] [^111sbUtx] [^111QBddX].

> Hold on, I should verify medication and infusion exposures that could supply propylene glycol. Sedatives such as lorazepam, diazepam, and some phenytoin preparations are solubilized in propylene glycol; prolonged or high-dose infusions, especially with renal or hepatic dysfunction, can precipitate propylene glycol toxicity with high anion gap acidosis, osmolal gap, and AKI, so I need to check the ICU infusion history carefully and consider drug-induced etiologies early [^115MCQyK] [^114J8xrK].

> Let me integrate the hepatic and renal injury pattern. Rapid-onset AKI with rising creatinine and concurrent transaminase elevation suggests a systemic toxin or severe ischemic–toxic injury; ethylene glycol causes direct renal tubular injury and crystal nephropathy, while propylene glycol and other toxins can cause hepatorenal dysfunction; the troponin rise could reflect demand ischemia in the setting of acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, and tachyphylaxis or catecholamine surge, so I should interpret troponin in clinical context rather than assuming a primary ACS unless there is supportive evidence [^115BQ8FH] [^115Mu5An].

> I should double-check the acid-base chemistry for hidden mixed disorders. Using the delta gap approach, if the rise in anion gap does not match the fall in bicarbonate, that implies a superimposed non–anion gap acidosis or a metabolic alkalosis; given low albumin and possible bicarbonate shifts, I need to calculate the delta ratio and reassess for a mixed process that could alter management priorities, especially if renal bicarbonate losses are contributing [^115oS1GG] [^114Pok4Z].

> Next, I should review immediate management priorities. First, stabilize the airway and breathing, but wait, persistent tremors complicate ventilator synchrony and may reflect hypocalcemia or drug withdrawal; I should prioritize correcting ionized calcium while optimizing sedation to improve ventilator compliance and reduce oxygen consumption; second, initiate aggressive electrolyte optimization with IV magnesium, cautious potassium repletion to a target of 4.5–5.0 mEq/L, and calcium gluconate/chloride to stabilize the myocardium; third, start specific therapy if toxic alcohol ingestion is suspected — fomepizole to block alcohol dehydrogenase, obtain toxic alcohol levels if available, and prepare for urgent hemodialysis; fourth, correct acidosis supportively with sodium bicarbonate if pH is less than about 7.1 or if there is hemodynamic instability, while recognizing the risks of hypernatremia and paradoxical intracellular acidosis; fifth, arrange early nephrology consultation for renal replacement therapy given severe AKI, refractory acidosis, and electrolyte instability [^1114qAWd] [^1175DvPq] [^113fRp4K] [^11396iuA] [^1122Vno1].

> But wait, what if the osmolal gap is only modestly elevated or the labs are delayed. I should confirm the osmolal gap calculation and, if toxic alcohols remain suspected, treat empirically with fomepizole while awaiting confirmatory testing, because delays worsen outcomes; if propylene glycol toxicity is suspected from sedative infusions, the treatment is cessation of the culprit infusion and hemodialysis for severe cases; if pyroglutamic acidosis is a concern due to chronic acetaminophen use, I should check for 5-oxoproline and consider N-acetylcysteine, though this will not correct the acidosis acutely [^115BQ8FH] [^113fRp4K] [^115MCQyK] [^111sbUtx].

> I need to ensure arrhythmia surveillance is tight. Continuous ECG monitoring with frequent QTc checks, readiness with IV magnesium for torsades, and overdrive pacing or isoproterenol if bradycardia-dependent TdP recurs are essential; I should also avoid or discontinue QT-prolonging drugs wherever possible and document a medication reconciliation to remove hidden offenders that could perpetuate QT prolongation [^1114qAWd] [^1175DvPq].

> Let me reconsider the role of bicarbonate. While sodium bicarbonate can temporize severe acidemia, it may lower ionized calcium and precipitate arrhythmias, so I should use small, carefully titrated doses with close hemodynamic and calcium monitoring and prioritize definitive toxin removal and renal replacement when indicated; if I initially thought to give a large bicarbonate bolus, I should verify that this will not worsen hypocalcemia and QT dynamics before proceeding [^11396iuA] [^1114qAWd].

> Finally, I should confirm disposition and escalation triggers. Given the severity of acidosis, AKI, electrolyte derangements, and prolonged QT, the patient belongs in a critical care setting with continuous monitoring, early nephrology involvement, and cardiology consultation for arrhythmia risk stratification; if QT prolongation persists or TdP recurs despite correction of reversible factors, guideline-directed long QT therapy including beta-blockade and consideration of ICD candidacy should follow once the acute metabolic crisis is controlled [^1122Vno1] [^1114qAWd] [^114EdpLJ].

The most likely diagnosis is **ethylene glycol poisoning** [^113fRp4K] given the combination of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated osmolal gap, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury [^113fRp4K]. The low urine specific gravity likely reflects **early renal concentrating defect** from tubular injury [^notfound]. The prolonged QT is explained by **hypocalcemia** and acidosis [^114uY6WL]. Immediate management includes fomepizole, hemodialysis, and aggressive correction of electrolytes and acid-base disturbances [^113fRp4K] [^1122Vno1].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for high anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated osmolal gap includes:

- **Ethylene glycol poisoning**: Causes high anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated osmolal gap, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury [^116vxs4Q].

- **Methanol poisoning**: Causes high anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated osmolal gap, but typically presents with visual disturbances [^1159ttJW].

- **Propylene glycol toxicity**: Associated with high anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated osmolal gap, often due to medication excipients [^114J8xrK].

- **Lactic acidosis**: Can cause high anion gap metabolic acidosis but typically does not cause an elevated osmolal gap [^notfound].

Given the clinical presentation, **ethylene glycol poisoning** is the most likely diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of ethylene glycol poisoning

Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolaldehyde, then by aldehyde dehydrogenase to glycolic acid, and finally to oxalic acid. Glycolic and oxalic acids cause a **high anion gap metabolic acidosis** [^notfound]. Oxalic acid also complexes with calcium, causing **hypocalcemia** and calcium oxalate crystal deposition in the kidneys, leading to acute kidney injury [^113fRp4K]. The parent compound transiently elevates the **osmolal gap** before metabolism [^111QBddX].

---

## Explanation of laboratory findings

| **Laboratory finding** | **Explanation in ethylene glycol poisoning** |
|-|-|
| High anion gap metabolic acidosis | Accumulation of glycolic and oxalic acids [^notfound] |
| Elevated osmolal gap | Presence of unmetabolized ethylene glycol [^111QBddX] |
| Hypocalcemia | Calcium complexation by oxalic acid [^notfound] |
| Acute kidney injury | Calcium oxalate crystal deposition in renal tubules [^notfound] |
| Low urine specific gravity | Early renal concentrating defect due to tubular injury [^notfound] |
| Prolonged QT interval | Hypocalcemia and acidosis affecting cardiac repolarization [^114uY6WL] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Ethylene glycol poisoning is a **medical emergency** requiring immediate intervention:

- **Antidote therapy**: Fomepizole inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing further metabolism of ethylene glycol to toxic metabolites [^notfound].

- **Hemodialysis**: Removes ethylene glycol and its metabolites, corrects acid-base disturbances, and manages acute kidney injury [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Aggressive correction of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia to prevent cardiac arrhythmias [^113rsZSk].

- **Supportive care**: Management of acute kidney injury, acid-base disturbances, and respiratory support as needed [^1122Vno1].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **ethylene glycol poisoning**, explaining the high anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated osmolal gap, hypocalcemia, acute kidney injury, and prolonged QT interval. Immediate management with fomepizole, hemodialysis, and electrolyte correction is essential to prevent further complications and mortality [^114iHNUk].

### Phosphate restriction prevents metabolic acidosis and curbs rise in FGF23 and mortality in murine folic acid-induced AKI [^1175MLgB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

P i -induced reduction in α -Klotho, which is well-documented and reproduced in this work, may foster a permissive environment for an enhanced inflammatory response as α -Klotho has a well-characterized anti-inflammatory role. This may have also contributed to the observed diet-dependent difference in inflammatory status. However, while several studies have suggested that FGF23 may promote inflammation by upregulating TNF and IL-6, our results do not lend credence to this mechanism, at least at a systemic scale: the absence of Pth reduced the rise in plasma FGF23 in FA-AKI without a change in proinflammatory cytokines.–

We showed that P i restriction improved 14-day survival after FA-AKI despite comparable kidney impairment, renal fibrosis, and urine osmolality. The disparate mortality between the diet groups may have incorporated a survival bias. Indeed, mice from the 48-hour experiment — marking the onset of mortality — clearly showed that P i restriction curtailed FA-induced renal injury by abrogating the development of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis due to higher dietary P i acid load. The aggravating effect of acid loads on coexisting renal dysfunction is a well-established phenomenon: For instance, dietary protein has been shown to decrease GFR in 5/6 nephrectomized rats via metabolic acidosis, CKD patients with metabolic acidosis have an increased risk to develop AKI, and ammonium chloride ingestion in rats exacerbates renal damage and mortality in the ischemia/reperfusion injury model. –

Moreover, hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia may have affected cardiac function. Hyperkalemia developed due to worse renal function and was conceivably escalated by a vicious cycle of mutual-augmentation between hyperkalemia and acidosis, as hyperkalemia has been shown to induce and be induced by acidosis. – Hypocalcemia developed likely due to the increased complexation of Ca and P i and led to a prolonged QTcm interval, a hallmark of hypocalcemia that increases the risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. – In fact, each of acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia are implicated in adverse cardiac effects that may precipitate in arrhythmias and death. – Moreover, the symptomatic constellation of severe acute hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis is reminiscent of the clinical manifestation of tumor lysis syndrome, in which 25% of patients suffer from cardiac arrhythmia. In pediatric patients with tumor lysis syndrome, the administration of P i binders lowered plasma P i suggesting a dietary contribution to the hyperphosphatemia.

### Hypocalcemia: a pervasive metabolic abnormality in the critically ill [^1144Uj2y]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia has been reported in critically ill patients, most commonly in association with sepsis syndrome. However, the severity and incidence of hypocalcemia in nonseptic but critically ill patients has not been well defined. Therefore, the goal of this study was to identify and compare the frequency and degree of hypocalcemia in critically ill patients with differing underlying illnesses (those admitted to medical, surgical, trauma, neurosurgical, burn, respiratory, and coronary intensive care units [ICUs]; group A; n = 99). Results were compared with the frequency and degree of hypocalcemia in non-critically ill ICU patients (initially admitted to an ICU but discharged within 48 hours; group B; n = 50) or hospitalized non-ICU patients (group C; n = 50). Incidences of hypocalcemia (ionized calcium [Ca] < 1.16 mmol/L [less than normal]) were 88%, 66%, and 26% for groups A, B, and C, respectively (P: < 0.001). In group A, the frequency of hypocalcemia did not depend on the ICU setting or presence of sepsis. However, the occurrence of hypocalcemia correlated with both Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (r = -0.39; P: < 0.001) and patient mortality (eg, hazard ratio for death, 1.65 for Ca decrements of 0.1 mmol/L; P: < 0.002). Hypomagnesemia, number of blood transfusions, and presence of acute renal failure were each associated with depressed Ca levels. A weak association (r = -0.12; P: = 0.09) was noted between serum Ca level and QT interval. Clinical concern stemming from hypocalcemia was underscored by the substantial use of intravenous (IV) Ca therapy (approximately 2 to 3 g IV). We conclude that hypocalcemia is extremely common in hospitalized patients (up to 88%) and correlates with severity of illness, but not with a specific illness per se. Whether it directly impacts patient survival remains unknown. Resolution of this issue appears to be critical because of the frequency with which it leads to high-dose IV Ca therapy.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Unmeasured anions in metabolic acidosis: unravelling the mystery [^116uJP48]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

In the critically ill, metabolic acidosis is a common observation and, in clinical practice, the cause of this derangement is often multi-factorial. Various measures are often employed to try and characterise the aetiology of metabolic acidosis, the most popular of which is the anion gap. The purpose of the anion gap can be perceived as a means by which the physician is alerted to the presence of unmeasured anions in plasma that contribute to the observed acidosis. In many cases, the causative ion may be easily identified, such as lactate, but often the causative ion(s) remain unidentified, even after exclusion of the 'classic' causes. We describe here the various attempts in the literature that have been made to address this observation and highlight recent studies that reveal potential sources of such hitherto unmeasured anions.

### Emergency department management of acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and renal replacement therapy in the critically ill [^1122Vno1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common sequela of critical illness. Clinical manifestation of AKI varies and can include electrolyte abnormalities, anion gap, or non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment strategies require careful identification of the cause of the AKI, relying on both clinical history and laboratory data. Once the cause has been identified, treatment can then target the underlying cause and avoid further insults. Conservative management should first be attempted for patients with AKI. If conservative management fails, renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis can be used.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

A woman in her 20s presented with rapidly progressive muscle weakness and a 1-month preceding history of fatigability, nausea and vomiting. She was found to have critical hypokalaemia (K + 1.8 mmol/L), a prolonged corrected QT interval (581ms) and a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH 7.15) due to zonisamide-induced distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for potassium replacement and alkali therapy. Clinical and biochemical improvement ensued, and she was discharged after a 27-day inpatient stay.

### Hypokalaemic paralysis as the initial clinical presentation of Sjögren's syndrome induced distal renal tubular acidosis [^115ezYvx]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 41-year-old woman presented by ambulance with a 1-day history of new-onset paralysis and nausea and vomiting ongoing for 48 hours. She had no history of any similar episodes. Biochemical analysis showed profound hypokalaemia with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Her initial serum chloride was within the normal range. She had significant electrocardiographic changes on admission with ST depression, U waves and a prolonged QT interval. Urinary anion gap supported the diagnosis of a distal renal tubular acidosis. Subsequent connective tissue disease serology confirmed previously undiagnosed Sjogren's syndrome. Successful recovery for this patient required multidisciplinary input from the intensive care, nephrology and neurology teams.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning [^113fRp4K]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Ingestion of ethylene glycol may be an important contributor in patients with metabolic acidosis of unknown cause and subsequent renal failure. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment will limit metabolic toxicity and decrease morbidity and mortality. Ethylene glycol poisoning should be suspected in an intoxicated patient with anion gap acidosis, hypocalcemia, urinary crystals, and nontoxic blood alcohol concentration. Fomepizole is a newer agent with a specific indication for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Metabolic acidosis is resolved within three hours of initiating therapy. Initiation of fomepizole therapy before the serum creatinine concentration rises can minimize renal impairment. Compared with traditional ethanol treatment, advantages of fomepizole include lack of depression of the central nervous system and hypoglycemia, and easier maintenance of effective plasma levels.

### Approach to the patient with a negative anion gap [^11362PDQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

When anion gap calculation generates a very small or negative number, an explanation must be sought. Sporadic (nonreproducible) measurement errors and systematic (reproducible) laboratory errors must be considered. If an error is ruled out, 2 general possibilities exist. A true anion gap reduction can be generated by either reduced concentrations of unmeasured anions such as albumin or increased concentrations of unmeasured cations such as magnesium, calcium, or lithium. This teaching case describes a patient with aspirin (salicylate) poisoning whose anion gap was markedly reduced (-47 mEq/L). The discussion systematically reviews the possibilities and provides the explanation for this unusual laboratory result.

### The conundrum of the complex relationship between acute kidney injury and cardiac arrhythmias [^115Mu5An]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rapid increase in serum creatinine levels, reduced urine output or both. Death may occur in 16–49% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe AKI. Complex arrhythmias are a potentially serious complication in AKI patients with pre-existing or AKI-induced heart damage and myocardial dysfunction, with fluid overload, especially electrolyte and acid-base disorders, representing the pathogenetic mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis. Cardiac arrhythmias, in turn, increase the risk of poor renal outcomes, including AKI. Arrhythmic risk in AKI patients receiving kidney replacement treatment may be reduced by modifying dialysis/replacement fluid composition. The most common arrhythmia observed in AKI patients is atrial fibrillation. Severe hyperkalaemia, sometimes combined with hypocalcaemia, causes severe bradyarrhythmias in this clinical setting. Although the likelihood of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias is reportedly low, the combination of cardiac ischaemia and specific electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities may increase this risk, particularly in AKI patients who require kidney replacement treatment. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available epidemiological, pathophysiological and prognostic evidence aiming to clarify the complex relationships between AKI and cardiac arrhythmias.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^111CMi7g]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown that the concentration of anions normally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are elevated in appreciable quantities in patients with a metabolic acidosis. We propose that they may play a significant role in generating the anion gap. Further work in this laboratory is currently underway to explore the clinical implications of these findings.

### Tumor lysis syndrome and acute kidney injury: evaluation, prevention, and management [^111XiWH8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) describes a constellation of biochemical and clinical abnormalities resulting from rapid and massive tumor cell death. TLS is frequently associated with hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hypocalcemia that may lead to serious clinical complications, including acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest. Identification of tumor- and patient-specific risk factors for TLS and early recognition of laboratory and clinical TLS based on established criteria are essential for preventing TLS and forestalling acute kidney injury. Early collaboration between oncologists and nephrologists will help improve assessment of patients' kidney function and risk factors, paving the way for timely and efficacious interventions.

### Recognition, treatment, and prevention of propylene glycol toxicity [^115MCQyK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Propylene glycol is a commonly used solvent for oral, intravenous, and topical pharmaceutical preparations. Although it is considered safe, large intravenous doses given over a short period of time can be toxic. Underlying renal insufficiency and hepatic dysfunction raise risk for toxicity. Toxic effects include hyperosmolality, increased anion gap metabolic acidosis (due to lactic acidosis), acute kidney injury, and sepsis-like syndrome. Treatment of toxicity includes hemodialysis to effectively remove propylene glycol. Prevention is best achieved by limiting the dose of propylene glycol infused.

### Early anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen overdose [^112Dze4N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical significance of early high (> 15 mEq/L) anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen (APAP) overdose.

Methods

A retrospective review of a cohort of 74 patients presenting within 24 hours of APAP overdose was conducted.

Results

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was present in 41% of patients on admission and persisted for 1.5 ± 0.1 days. The anion gap was associated with an elevated lactate level (4.5 ± 1 mmol/L) (r(2) = 0.66, P < .05), which persisted for 1 day. The lactate level increased in proportion to the APAP concentration (r(2) = 0.75, P < .05). Patients with increased anion gap had a higher incidence of confusion (48% vs 3%; P < .001) and lethargy (39% vs 6%; p = 0.003). Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was found in the absence of shock or liver failure. All patients were treated with N-acetylcysteine and, despite the early high anion gap metabolic acidosis, none developed hepatic failure or hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis in patients with APAP overdose is self-limited and does not predict clinical or laboratory outcomes. Persistent or late metabolic acidosis in the absence of liver failure is not likely due to APAP and should prompt a search for other causes of metabolic acidosis. Finally, APAP overdose should be considered in patients presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status, as this is a treatable condition when detected early.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145sbzR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Much research has focussed on the prognostic value of serum lactate estimation in critically ill patients; however, in the context of work in low resource settings we have noted that facilities for lactate and blood gas analysis are frequently not available, prompting a search for alternative risk stratification tools. The anion gap (AG) is an easily calculated marker of metabolic acidosis based on analytes typically available from routine chemistry analysis. It may have potential as a risk stratification tool to identify sick patients at risk of deterioration, who would benefit from further management whilst pathophysiological processes are still reversible. The AG reflects the concentration of unmeasured anions as calculated by the formula Na + - (Cl − + HCO 3 −). Inclusion of potassium in the formula is recommended where its concentration is abnormally high or low. In healthy subjects, the unmeasured anions or "gap" is mostly made up of albumin; however, hypoalbuminaemia, commonly observed in critically ill patients, can lower the AG and mask an acidosis. Feldman and colleagues therefore recommended that the AG should be corrected for albumin.

### Lactate gap as a tool in identifying ethylene glycol poisoning [^116vxs4Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Ethylene glycol toxicity is a known cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis, with the presence of an osmolar gap and the right clinical context suggesting to the diagnosis. Rapid recognition and early treatment is crucial. Unfortunately, ethylene glycol levels are not readily available and must be performed at a reference laboratory. We present a case where recognising the significance of the 'lactate gap' assisted in identifying ethylene glycol poisoning.

### Beating the odds – surviving extreme hyperkalemia [^112Tu5op]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Severe hyperkalemia (> 7 mmol/L) is a medical emergency because of possible fatal arrhythmias. We here report the case of a 58-year-old woman surviving extreme hyperkalemia (> 10 mmol/L). The patient with a history of congestive heart failure, a DDD pacemaker and mild chronic renal insufficiency was admitted with progressive weakness and sudden onset of hypotension and bradycardia in the absence of any pacemaker action. Laboratory tests revealed an extreme serum potassium level of 10.1 mmol/L, with a slightly elevated serum creatinine of 149 μmol/L. Treatment with norepinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, and insulin improved both the hemodynamic situation and the serum potassium with subsequent regaining pacemaker actions even before additional hemodialysis normalized the potassium level. A thorough investigation demonstrated that several mechanisms contributed to the extreme potassium level: urinalysis and a low transtubular potassium gradient in the presence of metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap pointed to preexisting interstitial nephritis, with renal tubular acidosis type IV as the predisposing factor, whereas several drugs and acute impairment of renal function contributed to the dangerous situation. Despite the odds for fatal outcome, the patient recovered completely, and long-term management was initiated to prevent recurrent hyperkalemia.

### Two gaps too many, three clues too few? Do elevated osmolal and anion gaps with crystalluria always mean ethylene glycol poisoning? [^116FVrMP]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old African-American man with a medical history significant for heavy alcohol abuse, hypertension, delirium tremens, nephrolithiasis and seizure disorder was brought to the hospital with altered mental status. He was found to have high anion gap metabolic acidosis with significantly elevated lactate along with an elevated osmolal gap and calcium oxalate crystals in his urine. With this combination of findings, ethylene glycol poisoning was high in the differential. This case report describes why ethylene glycol poisoning was not the diagnosis in this patient despite the presence of these three classic laboratory findings, therefore emphasising the fact that these findings should not be taken at face value because they can be seen collectively in a patient yet each have a different cause.

### Increased anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid): a role for acetaminophen [^111sbUtx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The endogenous organic acid metabolic acidoses that occur commonly in adults include lactic acidosis; ketoacidosis; acidosis that results from the ingestion of toxic substances such as methanol, ethylene glycol, or paraldehyde; and a component of the acidosis of kidney failure. Another rare but underdiagnosed cause of severe, high anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults is that due to accumulation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid). Reported are four patients with this syndrome, and reviewed are 18 adult patients who were reported previously in the literature. Twenty-one patients had major exposure to acetaminophen (one only acute exposure). Eighteen (82%) of the 22 patients were women. Most of the patients were malnourished as a result of multiple medical comorbidities, and most had some degree of kidney dysfunction or overt failure. The chronic ingestion of acetaminophen, especially by malnourished women, may generate high anion gap metabolic acidosis. This undoubtedly is an underdiagnosed condition because measurements of serum and/or urinary 5-oxoproline levels are not readily available.

### Continuous kidney replacement therapy in critically ill children: heparin vs citrate [^113r7tip]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Citrate is an anticoagulant that is injected in the extracorporeal circuit avoiding the systemic anticoagulant effects of heparin. It is both a weak acid and a buffer, and its buffer capacity depends on the proportion of strong cations present in its solution, usually trisodium citrate. The strong ion difference (SID) of trisodium citrate is zero, and its accumulation in humans can induce mild metabolic acidosis. Since the ionized calcium normally increases in acidosis, a low ionized calcium with acidosis suggest that citrate metabolism is impaired. Sodium-citrate is infused before the filter, acting as an anticoagulant by chelating ionized calcium. The calcium-citrate complexes (CCC) are then removed by filtration and dialysis, and calcium is replaced via an infusion post-filter in the blood returning to the patient. However, CCC can escape into the circulation, where citrate is metabolized to bicarbonate releasing sodium, which further increases the SID and may cause metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia. Although citrate accumulation is the most frequent complication of RCA, its most feared side effect is hypocalcemia, which can induce hypotension, convulsions, arrhythmias, respiratory muscle weakness and death. Citrate also chelates magnesium, which should be monitored. In patients with liver failure or poor tissue perfusion, citrate is not metabolized well and may cause a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Since citrate is not toxic per se, these changes are due to the primary illness that induce the malfunction of the Krebs cycle affecting the metabolism of citrate and pyruvate and leading to the generation of lactate. Citrate associated toxicity is suspected by the presence of low ionized calcium, a total/ionized calcium ratio > 2.5, a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, or whenever more calcium is needed to maintain the desired blood calcium levels. However, recent studies suggested that the Total/ionized calcium ratio is not a reliable indicator to either confirm or rule out citrate accumulation, since changes in albumin, phosphate, lactate, and circulating unmeasured anions can affect this ratio. Although RCA is avoided in children with liver failure, some pediatric studies showed that after proper adjustments and close monitoring it could be used safely in children with liver injury.

### Demystifying normal-anion-gap metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, aetiology, evaluation and diagnosis [^111Prjk7]. Internal Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Among other possible causes, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by toluene poisoning, acute diarrhea, posthypocapnic acidosis, chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, proximal renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, pancreatic fistula, Addison's disease, ileostomy and complications of ureterosigmoidostomy. In addition, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as acetazolamide and cholestyramine.

### Keeping a high index of suspicion: lessons learned in the management of methanol ingestion [^1159ttJW]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Methanol ingestion is an uncommon form of poisoning that can cause severe metabolic disturbances and potentially fatal and often irreversible organ/tissue damage. The diagnosis is sometimes elusive and requires a high index of suspicion. Because extent and irreversibility of the damage caused by formic acid is time sensitive, methanol poisoning should be recognised promptly so that it can be treated. Metabolic acidosis associated with an increased anion gap and osmolar gap is an important laboratory finding but is not always present. A case of severe methanol poisoning is presented that demonstrates the unique challenges in the diagnosis and management, and the lack of readiness of the health care system for such cases. We highlight some of the diagnostic difficulties associated with treating a patient with a reduced level of consciousness and severe metabolic acidosis. We also review the pitfalls of using laboratory tests to rule out alcohol ingestion and discuss the definitive management of methanol poisoning.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^112TJxzN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical evidence supporting the use of loop diuretics in this setting is sparse and composed primarily of case reports. As such, it cannot be interpreted with any confidence. Although loop diuretics have been shown to reduce metabolic demand and oxygen consumption by the proximal tubular cells, they have also been shown to worsen renal afferent arteriole vasoconstriction, acidify urine, and promote aggregation of the Tamm-Horsfall protein within the tubular lumen. Taken together, the pathophysiologic consequences of loop diuretics may potentiate precipitation of myoglobin and worsen the distal tubular obstruction. Additionally, hypokalemia due to loop diuretic use has been reported to result in hypokalemic myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

What electrolyte abnormalities should be expected and what are the optimal methods for management?

Recommendation

Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia are electrolyte abnormalities most commonly encountered when treating rhabdomyolysis. Correcting biochemical equilibrium and electrolytes during rhabdomyolysis should proceed meticulously to avoid complications from treatment. Hyperkalemia is the electrolyte abnormality that requires timely correction to reduce risk of cardiac arrhythmia.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### A life-threatening double gap metabolic acidosis [^114J8xrK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Double gap metabolic acidosis represents the high anion gap metabolic acidosis combined with raised serum osmolal gap due to retention of unmeasured osmole with accompanied metabolite. We describe a 62-year-old man diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia undergoing continuous sedation in the context of asynchronous mechanical ventilation. High anion gap metabolic acidosis coupled with high plasma osmolal gap was noted with resultant severe bradyarrhythmia. D-Lactic acidosis and high serum concentration of propylene glycol (PG) eventually established the diagnosis of lorazepam-induced PG intoxication. Discontinuation of lorazepam followed by emergent long-extended hemodialysis effectively resolved the metabolic derangement without further recurrence. Serum osmolal gap is a sensitive and convenient surrogate for both early bedside detection and monitoring the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, PG intoxication must be considered in the differential diagnosis of double gap metabolic acidosis. Early recognition with prompt hemodialysis intervention can avoid a life-threatening catastrophe.

### The anion gap [^112mhVzE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1977). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Serum Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Anion Gap Calculator measures the difference between cations (Na⁺) and anions (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻) in blood to evaluate metabolic acidosis. It identifies normal, elevated, or low anion gaps, aiding in diagnosing acid-base disorders.

The Anion Gap calculator provides a way to assess metabolic acidosis by analyzing the concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in the blood. Here's how it works:

You start with three key inputs, measured in mmol/L:
- Sodium: Typically falls within a range of 120 to 160.
- Chloride: Ranges from 70 to 130.
- Bicarbonate: Generally between 10 and 40.

With these values, the anion gap is determined using the formula:
Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate)

This simple calculation yields an output, the anion gap, which is measured in mmol/L and usually falls within a physiological range, though theoretically it can extend from 0 to 10,000.

Interpreting the anion gap provides valuable clinical insights:

- A normal anion gap is typically between 8 and 12 mmol/L. This range suggests there are no significant unmeasured anions affecting the blood plasma.
- A high anion gap, generally above 12 mmol/L, may signal conditions such as ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or the ingestion of particular toxins like methanol or ethylene glycol.
- A low anion gap is less frequent and could be linked to hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia, or other more rare conditions.

By entering the values for sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the calculator, you can compute the anion gap and interpret the results to identify possible metabolic disturbances based on these guidelines.

### Treatment of extreme hypercalcaemia: the role of haemodialysis [^116TCRBq]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A patient with extremely high calcium level of 23.9mg/dL (5.97mmol/L) was admitted to our department unconscious with pathological ECG recording, demonstrating shortening of QT interval. The patient was treated by fluid resuscitation, bisphosphonates, salmon calcitonin and steroids. Haemodialysis with low calcium bath had been promptly provided with improvement of consciousness and calcium level. ECG changes disappeared. Subsequent investigations revealed hyperparathyroidism and a large parathyroid adenoma was then surgically removed. Extreme and rapid calcium elevation (parathyroid crisis) is rarely seen in primary hyperparathyroidism and usually is distinctive for malignancy. In the context of acute kidney injury and refractory hypercalcaemia with life-threatening complications (coma, ECG changes with impending danger of arrhythmia), haemodialysis may effectively decrease calcium levels. It should be pointed out that dialysis is an efficient method of treatment of refractory hypercalcaemia, parathyroid crisis, but it is rarely used due to its invasive nature.

### Zonisamide [^115vKWcS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Kidney Stones subsection). Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) — prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is presented as an algorithm that labels "QT prolonging drugs/ hypokalemia/ hypomagnesemia (Class III: Harm)" and for patients with "QTc ≥ 470 ms and/or symptomatic" provides "Beta blocker (Class I)", with escalation for "Persistent symptoms and/or other high-risk features†" to "Treatment intensification, additional medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation and/or an ICD (Class I)", while "Asymptomatic and QTc ≥ 500 ms" maps to "Treatment intensification, additional medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation and/or an ICD (Class IIb)". High-risk patients with LQTS include those with "QTc ≥ 500 ms, genotypes LQT2 and LQT3, females with genotype LQT2, < 40 years of age, onset of symptoms at < 10 years of age, and patients with recurrent syncope", and "ICD candidacy as determined by functional status, life expectancy, or patient preference".

### Severe multifactorial metabolic alkalosis in the emergency department: a case report [^114x95Ni]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis is an uncommon clinical entity resulting from a wide variety of underlying etiologies including gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and metabolic causes. It is a typically clinically silent condition; however, severe cases can be life-threatening, mandating both a systematic investigative approach and an early aggressive management strategy.

Case Report

We present a case of a 58-year-old man with severe, multifactorial metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.72, HCO 3–42 mmol/L, pCO 2 31 mm Hg) resulting from refractory vomiting, severe hypokalemia (2.0 mmol/L), and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 20 g/L). WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Severe metabolic alkalosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential underlying causes in these cases, as well as how to delineate between chloride- and non-chloride-depleted states, which dictates initial treatment. We provide a pragmatic summary of the evaluation, pertinent investigations, and early management of these cases.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^113rsZSk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Identifying causes and risk for QT prolongation

If patients have QTc prolongation, correctable causes should be identified. First, electrolytes should be measured and any abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) should be corrected before treatment. Patients with cancer specifically are at risk for electrolyte imbalance, especially during cancer treatment, because of the following: (1) poor oral intake and conditions that promote loss of potassium and/or magnesium, like salt‐losing nephropathy secondary to platinum salts; (2) diarrhea or emesis from mucositis; (3) fever with sweating; (4) treatment with laxatives; (5) alcohol abuse; and (6) treatment with corticosteroids. Drugs with potentially synergistic effects with cancer therapy to prolong QTc should be identified and modified or stopped. Table 3 provides a selective list of commonly used noncancer treatment drugs that prolong QTc and some safer alternatives, and an exhaustive list can be obtained fromand is updated frequently. 188 Other causes of baseline QTc prolongation include structural heart disease 189 and genetic inherited arrhythmias, including Brugada syndrome, congenital long QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These patients should be evaluated by a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist before cancer therapy with potential QT‐prolonging drugs. A comprehensive review of all medications that need to be avoided or the strategy for monitoring during the treatment should be defined carefully in these patients before cancer therapy. 190

### Successful management of hypercalcemic crisis by continuous renal replacement therapy with regional citrate anticoagulation and surgery: a case report [^115KwzT6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

CRRT with RCA has been a preferred anticoagulation method in critically ill patients, particularly those at high risk for bleeding. It chelates ionized calcium in the extracorporeal circuit, inhibiting the clotting cascade. Low-calcium or calcium-free dialysate enhances this process by maintaining low-calcium levels within the circuit. However, this method has potential safety issues that must be carefully managed, such as hypocalcemia and citrate accumulation. Hypocalcemia is the most common complication associated with RCA. Citrate binds ionized calcium in the blood. Therefore, if calcium supplementation through systemic infusion is inadequate, patients may experience symptoms of hypocalcemia, such as muscle spasms, paresthesia, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias. Severe hypocalcemia can lead to life-threatening complications, such as asystole. To prevent hypocalcemia, real-time monitoring of both systemic and circuit-ionized calcium levels is essential. The systemic ionized calcium levels should be maintained within the normal range (1.0–1.25 mmol/L), while the circuit calcium concentration should be kept below 0.35 mmol/L to ensure effective anticoagulation. Citrate accumulation can occur when the patient's ability to metabolize citrate is overwhelmed, leading to an accumulation of citrate in the bloodstream. This is more likely in patients with severe liver dysfunction, where the hepatic metabolism of citrate is impaired, and shock or poor perfusion state. Citrate accumulation manifests as metabolic acidosis, total calcium/ionized calcium ratio > 2.5, and persistent hypocalcemia despite adequate calcium infusion. This condition requires immediate intervention, such as reducing citrate infusion rates, increasing dialysate and replacement rates, or discontinuing RCA if necessary. Therefore, clinicians must ensure vigilant monitoring and timely adjustments to calcium infusion and citrate rates, following established protocols and tailoring care to individual patients to mitigate the risks associated with hypocalcemia and citrate toxicity. Besides, the comparative efficacy and safety of RCA and Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) for CRRT have been studied in patients with severe hypercalcemia. According to Yu et al.RCA offers some advantages over LMWH. RCA had more efficacy in reducing ionized calcium levels than LMWH, with the mean ionized calcium reduction rates after first 4 h was 0.138 ± 0.098 mmol/L/h in the RCA group compared to 0.079 ± 0.033 mmol/L/h in the LMWH group (p = 0.033). RCA showed prolonged filter lifespan (> 72 h vs 24 h, interquartile range 15–26, p = 0.012) and minimizing adverse events, such as bleeding.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^113ErRxx]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiologic mechanism that leads to this serious metabolic disorder has been previously described. Accumulation of ketoacids in DKA, typically results in high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis complicating diabetic ketoacidosis during the recovery phase has been well documented; however, its contribution at presentation of euglycemic DKA has been only recently recognized. Furthermore, typical DKA commonly occurs in the presence of additional conditions (i.e. trauma, surgery or infection) that per se may lead to other coexisting types of metabolic acidosis (e.g. lactic, hyperchloremic). Herein, we describe a patient with T2DM under SGLT-2 treatment who 5 days post-surgery presented with severe acidosis and only mildly elevated anion gap, mild hyperglycemia and ketonuria. A traditional diagnostic approach based on serum glucose levels and the anion gap in this patient could have seriously misled us from the correct diagnosis.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114omyyE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

A rise in the AG in critically ill patients was long thought to be predominantly due to lactic acidosis, yet several studies reported poor sensitivity of the AG in detecting hyperlactataemia defined by a lactate threshold of 2.5 mmol/l. The AG was an excellent predictor of severe hyperlactataemia defined as lactate above 4 mmol/l or 5 mmol/l; however, Nichol and colleagues found that a higher lactate concentration even within a normal reference range of 2 mmol/l independently predicts mortality. The AG may thus miss patients at risk of mortality, as a considerable degree of hyperlactataemia is required to push the AG outside its normal reference range if the baseline AG is low. This is in keeping with the extreme difference in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors observed in the study reporting the highest predictive value of AG. Other studies reported smaller, albeit mostly statistically significant, differences in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Anion-gap metabolic acidemia: case-based analyses [^112agy4M]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. The serum anion gap is calculated as [Na+]-([Cl -]+[HCO 3 -]) = Unmeasured anions-Unmeasured cations. The normal gap is mostly due to negatively charged albumin: (Normal range: 8–12meq/l) as the unmeasured anions, since albumin is usually reported in grams per liter (not meq/l). For diagnostic purposes, calculating the serum anion gap allows determination of coexisting acid-base processes in a patient. Assuming a 1:1 fall in bicarbonate compared with rise in anion gap in a usual gap acidosis, one can compare the Δ anion Gap/ΔHCO 3 -: Δ gap = observed anion gap-normal anion gap and the Δ HCO 3 - = normal HCO 3 - -observed HCO 3 -. A ratio of 1 suggests a simple anion gap acidosis; if < 1 a superimposed non-gap acidosis is lowering HCO 3 - and if > 1 a superimposed metabolic alkalosis is raising HCO 3 -. Comparing the anion gap and osmolar gap can narrow the differential diagnosis to include toxic alcohol ingestions with acidic metabolites such as ethylene glycol and methanol. Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. This review will consider the generation of anion-gap acidoses through case discussions.

### The serum anion gap in the evaluation of acid-base disorders: what are its limitations and can its effectiveness be improved? [^111MVjpb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap has been utilized to identify errors in the measurement of electrolytes, to detect paraproteins, and, most relevant to the nephrologist, to evaluate patients with suspected acid-base disorders. In regard to the latter purpose, traditionally an increased anion gap is identified when it exceeds the upper limit of normal for a particular clinical laboratory measurement. However, because there is a wide range of normal values (often 8–10 mEq/L), an increase in anion concentration can be present in the absence of an increased anion gap. In addition, the type of retained anion can affect the magnitude of the increase in anion gap relative to change in serum [HCO3(-)] being greater with lactic acidosis compared with ketoacidosis. This review examines the methods of calculation of the serum anion gap in textbooks and published literature, the effect of perturbations other than changes in acid-base balance, and its effectiveness in identifying mild and more severe disturbances in acid-base balance. Limitations of the present methods of determining the normal anion gap and change in the anion gap are highlighted. The possibility of identifying the baseline value for individuals to optimize the use of the calculation in the detection of metabolic acidosis is suggested.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Zonisamide (Zonisade) [^1169N7mt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Metabolic Acidosis

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

AHA/ACCF scientific statement on prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings — Cardiac arrest due to torsade de pointes (TdP) in acquired drug-induced long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is described as "a rare but potentially catastrophic event in hospital settings". Administration of a QT‑prolonging drug to hospitalized patients "may be more likely to cause TdP" than in outpatients because hospitalized patients often have additional risk factors, including being "elderly people with underlying heart disease" and having "renal or hepatic dysfunction, electrolyte abnormalities, or bradycardia", with possible rapid intravenous administration. In units with continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs), "the possibility of TdP may be anticipated by the detection of an increasing QT interval and other premonitory ECG signs of impending arrhythmia", after which "it then becomes possible to discontinue the culprit drug and manage concomitant provocative conditions (eg, hypokalemia, bradyarrhythmias) to reduce the occurrence of cardiac arrest". The statement "is to raise awareness among those who care for patients in hospital units about the risk, ECG monitoring, and management of drug-induced LQTS" and reviews "methods to monitor QT intervals in hospital settings, and immediate management of marked QT prolongation and TdP". The term torsade de pointes "was coined by Dessertenne in 1966" as "a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a pattern of twisting points", with a typical ECG feature being "a change in the amplitude and morphology (twisting) of the QRS complexes around the isoelectric line".

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Discussion and conclusions

SGLT2i block the SGLT2 co-transporter of sodium and glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidney, thereby reducing glucose reabsorption. This seemingly simple mechanism of action results in a new, somewhat unstable metabolic equilibrium with increased ketone bodies formation and their renal elimination. Precipitating factors such as surgery, acute illness, starvation or insulin deficiency can trigger highly complex metabolic and renal processes that can result in life-threatening metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1). Among the most important are increased ketogenesis, decreased renal ammoniogenesis and H + excretion, and decreased renal reabsorption of filtered ketones. As documented by our case, the term euglycemic ketoacidosis is somewhat misleading, as the major component of the acidosis may be hyperchloremic.

Increased ketogenesis

SGLT2i lowers blood glucose, leading to decreased insulin secretion and increased glucagon secretion. Similar to starvation, a low insulin-to-glucagon ratio stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes and ketone bodies formation and gluconeogenesis in the liver. However, concomitant stress related precipitants, some form of insulin deficiency or reduced caloric intake are required to promote ketogenesis. The two-hit hypothesis proposes that elevated stress-related hormones glucagon, cortisol and catecholamines stimulate ketogenesis in the setting of relative insulin deficiency due to low plasma glucose induced by SGLT2i.

Metabolic renal dysfunction

In the classic DKA, most of the acidosis can typically be explained by pure ketoacidosis with high anion gap. However, hyperchloremia may develop and even predominate in some patients later in the course of DKA, due to urinary loss of ketones and the treatment with normal saline. In contrast, patients with equally severe SGLT2i-associated acidosis had a markedly lower anion gap. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration varied substantially in several published cases. In our case, the anion gap was only 18 and the beta-hydroxybutyrate 3.2 mmol/l, despite pH of 6.85 and base excess − 29. Sampani reported a similar case with only a slightly elevated anion gap despite very low pH (Table 1). Compared with DKA, a concomitant metabolic renal dysfunction and slower development of ketosis modify the development of acidosis and enhance the hyperchloremic component. The main renal abnormalities associated with SGLT2i are impaired H + secretion in the proximal tubule, impaired ammoniogenesis and loss of ketoacid salts in the urine.

Tumor lysis syndrome

Tumor lysis syndrome is more likely with the first dose of cancer treatment and is a potentially life-threatening emergency that can occur either spontaneously or because of cell death from cancer treatments. Tumor lysis syndrome of any grade was reported in 3% of patients in the InO arm compared with 2% of patients receiving standard therapy in the INO-VATE study. Prompt detection and management of tumor lysis syndrome is important to prevent potentially fatal complications such as acute renal failure, arrhythmias, seizures, and death.

Recommendations

Patients receiving InO should be monitored for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome and treated accordingly (Table 4). Cytoreduction before the first InO dose is recommended in patients with > 10,000/mm 3 circulating lymphoblasts. In patients who have baseline uric acid levels > 7.5 mg/dl and in patients at high risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome, administration of rasburicase should be considered. Additional preventative measures (e.g. hydration, allopurinol) may also be considered if warranted.

Prolonged QT syndrome

Torsades de pointes, associated with QT prolongation, is a potentially sudden and fatal arrhythmia. Some common medications known to cause QT prolongation include antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone), antibiotics (e.g. macrolides, ketoconazole), antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole), antidepressants (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants), and antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol). In the INO-VATE trial, prolonged QT syndrome of any grade was reported in 2% of patients in the InO group and none of the patients in the standard-therapy group. Although QT prolongation is not commonly associated with InO, it is important to monitor for and attempt to prevent this potentially life-threatening syndrome.

Recommendations

Electrolyte levels and electrocardiogram results should be monitored before starting InO and periodically throughout treatment (Table 4). InO should be used with caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances or a history of prolonged QT syndrome and in recipients of medications known to prolong the QT interval.

### Lessons learned from the outbreak: the use of fomepizole in children with acute kidney injury due to ethylene glycol / diethylene glycol poisoning [^116CStGq]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients who continued to experience metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia despite receiving the complete fomepizole regimen, fomepizole administration was continued until both indicators were resolved. Multiple doses of fomepizole can result in a temporary increase in transaminase levels. We closely monitored the hepatic function of our patients and discovered that only one patient had normal AST and ALT levels on admission. Despite some patients showing elevated AST and ALT levels after the fourth maintenance dose, all patients demonstrated an overall improvement in their AST and ALT levels following fomepizole treatment. The elevated levels eventually returned to normal levels. Although two patients still had high AST and ALT levels, they were eligible for discharge and advised to undergo routine follow-up for further hepatic function evaluation.

Our findings differed from those of previous studies that reported only slight increases in AST and normal ALT levels after six days of fomepizole administration. In our study, one patient had a 5-fold increase in ALT levels but normal AST levels. These results suggest that fomepizole treatment may cause a temporary increase in transaminase levels in some patients. However, close monitoring of hepatic function and routine follow-ups can help detect and manage any potential adverse effects of treatment. Further investigation is necessary, as the mechanism of the increase in transaminase levels needs to be elucidated. Although formal statistical testing was not feasible due to sample size, a descriptive comparison between survivors and non-survivors suggested that lower admission pH, higher liver transaminases, and lower GCS scores may be associated with increased mortality. This supports previous findings that early severe acidosis and hepatic dysfunction are predictors of poor outcome in toxic alcohol ingestion. Further study with a larger cohort would be necessary to clarify these associations.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes — electrolyte optimization and medication precautions include that intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes of torsades de pointes without necessarily shortening QT, repeated doses may be needed, and the risk of magnesium toxicity is very small with the doses usually used to treat torsades de pointes, 1 to 2 g intravenously; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 mEq/L and 5 mEq/L shortens QT and may reduce the chance of recurrent torsades de pointes. QT-prolonging medications are not used in patients with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative or the benefit greatly exceeds the risk, episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by exposure to a QT-prolonging medication with increased risk when the QT is already prolonged from genetic and clinical risk factors, and implicated medication classes include antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antidepressants, antipsychotics, opiates, and anticancer agents.

### Cinacalcet [^114uY6WL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmia

Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia. Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet tablets.

Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to cinacalcet. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving cinacalcet.

Seizures

In clinical studies, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of cinacalcet-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients. While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear, the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Monitor serum calcium levels in patients with seizure disorders receiving cinacalcet tablets.

Concurrent Administration with Other Calcium-Lowering Drug Products

Concurrent administration of cinacalcet with calcium-lowering drugs including other calcium-sensing receptor agonists could result in severe hypocalcemia. Closely monitor serum calcium in patients receiving cinacalcet and concomitant therapies known to lower serum calcium levels.

Patient Education and Hypocalcemia Treatment

Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur.

If corrected serum calcium falls below the lower limit of normal or symptoms of hypocalcemia develop, start or increase calcium supplementation (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). Cinacalcet tablets dose reduction or discontinuation of cinacalcet tablets may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Clinical and biological profiles associated with the time of occurrence of citrate accumulation in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114qdR8i]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome in critically ill patients and severe AKI requires renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is often preferred in ICU and continuous anticoagulation of the circuit is mandatory to prevent premature hemofilter loss due to clotting. Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is recommended as first-line anticoagulation strategy and is increasingly used over heparin due to benefits in terms of extended filter lifespan and bleeding complications. Since citrate has a high affinity for the divalent calcium ion (Ca 2+), its administration results in the formation of citrate-calcium complexes (CCC) that decrease the level of ionized calcium (iCa). CCC are removed in the effluent or metabolized in the liver, muscle, and kidney within the citric acid cycle. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations suggest using RCA rather than heparin in patients who do not have contraindications for citrate. Such contraindications concern situations in which the citric acid cycle is not functional and include severely impaired liver function and shock with muscle hypoperfusion, since both represent a risk of citrate accumulation (CA).

CA occurs when the body's capacity to metabolize citrate is saturated, leading to CCC accumulation and resulting in plasma acidification and hypocalcemia. Although CA is a feared complication while using RCA-CRRT, data regarding CA in unselected cohorts of critically ill patients are scarce. The incidence of CA varies widely depending on the patient population studied and the definition used. An increased total to ionized calcium ratio (tCa/iCa) is a major criterion to diagnose CA as this demonstrates an increase in the serum level of anion-bound calcium, which is related to an increase in circulating CCC. Khadhzynov et al. used several criteria to define CA: decreased systemic iCa despite adequate calcium replacement, increased tCa/iCa ratio, metabolic acidosis, and increased anion gap. These criteria are now widely accepted to define CA in ICU patients.

### Metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular collapse after prolonged propofol infusion [^115g3393]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

The authors present the hospital course of a 13-year-old girl with a closed head injury who received a prolonged infusion of propofol for sedation and, subsequently, died as a result of severe metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular collapse. The patient had been treated for 4 days at a referring hospital for a severe closed head injury sustained in a fall from a bicycle. During treatment for elevations of intracranial pressure, she received a continuous propofol infusion (100 microg/kg/min). The patient began to exhibit severe high anion gap/low lactate metabolic acidosis, and was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at the authors' institution. On arrival there, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3 and this remained unchanged during her brief stay. The severe metabolic acidosis was unresponsive to maximum therapy. Acute renal failure ensued as a result of rhabdomyolysis, and myocardial dysfunction with bizarre, wide QRS complexes developed without hyperkalemia. The patient died of myocardial collapse with severe metabolic acidosis and multisystem organ failure (involving renal, hepatic, and cardiac systems) approximately 15 hours after admission to the authors' institution. This patient represents another case of severe metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular collapse observed after a prolonged propofol infusion in a pediatric patient. The authors suggest selection of other pharmacological agents for long-term sedation in pediatric patients.

### Ileal neobladder: an important cause of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis [^112pmYb7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis for a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is probably less well known than the differential diagnosis for an anion gap metabolic acidosis. One etiology of a non-anion gap acidosis is the consequence of ileal neobladder urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Case Report

We present a case of a patient with an ileal neobladder with a severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by a urinary tract infection and ureteroenterostomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Part of the ileal neobladder surgery includes ureteroenterostomy and predisposes patients to several clinically significant metabolic derangements, including a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These patients have an increased chronic acid load, bicarbonate deficit, and hypokalemia, which should be appreciated when resuscitating these patients.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

Table 1
Cancer and Non-Cancer Drugs Known to Cause Prolongation of the QTc

The molecular mechanisms by which these cancer drugs can lead to prolongation of the QTc are multifactorial. Arsenic trioxide and TKIs appear to exert effects on the QTc through interaction with human Ether-à-go-go-related gene which encodes for a protein that mediates I Kr, a potassium channel protein regulating repolarization of cardiomyocyte action potentials. Other reported mechanisms include cardiomyocyte-induced injury involving abnormal calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial injury, cardiac apoptosis, and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Acquired QTc prolongation may be exacerbated by simultaneous use of drugs that can inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme such as azole antifungals, macrolides, and certain antivirals. Patients with renal and liver disease may also cause delayed excretion of the QT-prolonging medications. Our patient was on several medications that could cause QT prolongation both by direct and indirect mechanisms including ondansetron, promethazine, voriconazole, moxifloxacin, and risperidone.

Structural heart disease can also contribute to QT prolongation. A retrospective analysis of 239 patients with QT prolongation (> 480 ms) found that one-quarter of the patients with acquired long QT syndrome had structural abnormalities. QT prolongation is thought to be caused by downregulation of potassium currents in hypertrophied and failing hearts.

Other non-cardiac systemic conditions, such as hypothyroidism, have also been associated with QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of electrolyte imbalances or other concurrent QT prolonging medications. Timely diagnosis and treatment with thyroid replacement hormone have been shown to correct QT prolongation in these patients.

In our patient, QT prolongation was most likely due to a combination of risk factors, including electrolyte abnormalities, drug interactions, structural heart disease, and hypothyroidism.

LEARNING POINTS
- Many commonly used cancer therapies can lead to QTc prolongation, particularly arsenic trioxide and TKIs.
- Adjunctive medications used to treat side effects caused by cancer therapies can affect the QTc.
- Structural heart disease and hypothyroidism can contribute to QT prolongation.

Case Continued

While on telemetry, the patient was noted to have ventricular bigeminy with short frequent runs of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia leading to a 20-s run of TdP. All nonessential QT-prolonging medications were discontinued, and electrolytes were corrected. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.

### Mannitol (Osmitrol) [^113Q2biz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity

Depending on dosage and duration, administration of OSMITROL may result in hypervolemia leading to or exacerbating existing congestive heart failure. Accumulation of mannitol due to insufficient renal excretion increases the risk of hypervolemia. Mannitol-induced osmotic diuresis may cause or worsen dehydration/hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Administration of OSMITROL may also cause hyperosmolarity [see Description (11)].

Depending on dosage and duration of administration, electrolyte and acid/base imbalances may also result from transcellular shifts in water and electrolytes, osmotic diuresis and/or other mechanisms. Such imbalances may be severe and potentially fatal.

Imbalances that may result from OSMITROL administration include:

Hypernatremia, dehydration and hemoconcentration
Hyponatremia, which can lead to headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, coma, cerebral edema, and death. Acute symptomatic hyponatremic encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency.
Hypo/hyperkalemia. The development of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) associated with mannitol administration may result in cardiac adverse reactions in patients receiving drugs that are sensitive to such imbalances (e.g., digoxin, agents that may cause QT prolongation, neuromuscular blocking agents) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].
Other electrolyte disturbances
Metabolic acidosis/alkalosis

Pediatric patients less than two years of age, particularly preterm and term neonates, may be at higher risk for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following OSMITROL administration due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and limited ability to concentrate urine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor fluid and electrolyte status and discontinue OSMITROL if imbalances occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

5.5 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor:

serum osmolarity, serum electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate) and acid base balance,
the osmol gap
signs of hypo- or hypervolemia, including urine output
renal, cardiac and pulmonary function
intracranial pressure

Discontinue OSMITROL if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see Contraindications (4)].

### Acetazolamide [^117GLUak]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

No specific antidote is known. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.

Electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic state, and central nervous effects might be expected to occur. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and blood pH levels should be monitored.

Supportive measures are required to restore electrolyte and pH balance. The acidotic state can usually be corrected by the administration of bicarbonate.

Despite its high intraerythrocytic distribution and plasma protein binding properties, acetazolamide is dialyzable. This may be particularly important in the management of acetazolamide overdosage when complicated by the presence of renal failure.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^113fhywy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

2.1 Hypocalcemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation. Calcium

reinfusion is required during use of REGIOCIT and blood calcium concentrations (ionized and total) must be monitored.

2.3 Hypomagnesemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no magnesium. Use of the REGIOCIT solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses. Magnesium levels must be monitored as infusion of magnesium may be necessary.

2.4 Hypoglycemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no dextrose. Administration of REGIOCIT solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels must be monitored regularly.

2.5 Hypokalemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT.

2.6 Metabolic Alkalosis

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Metabolization of 1 mol of citrate generates 3 mol of bicarbonate. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance. If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) or change the composition of the CRRT solution.

2.7 Metabolic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis may occur if metabolic clearance of citrate by the liver or skeletal muscle is impaired. If citrate accumulation develops and/or metabolic acidosis develops or worsens during therapy with REGIOCIT solution, the infusion rate may need to be decreased or its administration stopped.

2.8 Use in Patients with Mild to Moderate Hepatic Impairment

Metabolism of citrate (to bicarbonate) may be impaired in patients with hepatic impairment, resulting in accumulation of citrate. If REGIOCIT solution is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid–base imbalance.

2.9 Hypoosmolarity/Hypotonicity

REGIOCIT solution is hypoosmolar/hypotonic relative to standard CRRT replacement fluids and should be used with caution in patients with traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or increased intracranial pressure.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) — management recommendations state that in patients with drug-induced LQTS, removal of the offending agent is indicated (Level of Evidence: A). Class IIa recommendations are that management with intravenous magnesium sulfate is reasonable for patients who take QT-prolonging drugs and present with few episodes of torsades de pointes in which the QT remains long, and that atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol is reasonable for patients taking QT-prolonging drugs who present with recurrent torsades de pointes (Level of Evidence: B). Class IIb guidance is that potassium repletion to 4.5 to 5 mmol/L may be reasonable for patients who take QT-prolonging drugs and present with few episodes of torsades de pointes in whom the QT remains long (Level of Evidence: C).

### Acquired long QT syndrome: a focus for the general pediatrician [^114Qb2yu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder of cardiac repolarization most often due to specific drugs, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia that may precipitate torsade de pointes and cause sudden cardiac death. Common presentations of the LQTS are palpitations, presyncope, syncope, cardiac arrest, and seizures. An abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained while the patient is at rest is the key to diagnosis. The occurrence of drug-induced LQTS is unpredictable in any given individual, but a common observation is that most patients have at least 1 identifiable risk factor in addition to drug exposure. The cornerstone of the management of acquired LQTS includes the identification and discontinuation of any precipitating drug and the correction of metabolic abnormalities, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Most of the episodes of torsade de pointes are short-lived and terminate spontaneously. We propose a management protocol that could be useful for the daily practice in the emergency pediatric department to reduce the risk of acquired QT prolongation.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^11396iuA]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In our present study focused on severe metabolic and mixed acidemia, we report that, as opposed to the pH value upon ICU admission, the rapidity of pH recovery was associated with mortality (Table 3). Whether metabolic acidemia is an etiologic contributor to organ dysfunction or just a marker of illness has been debated. Recent findings demonstrate that severe metabolic acidemia is at least a contributory factor to organ dysfunction, favoring cardiac output decrease, arterial dilatation with hypotension, arrhythmia, altered oxygen delivery, respiratory muscle workload increase in spontaneously breathing patients, decreased ATP production and impairment of the immune response. Acidemia correction using the administration of a base, primarily in the form of sodium bicarbonate, has naturally become the mainstay of therapy, but its use continues to generate intense debate. In our study, we included patients with severe academia, and the prescription of sodium bicarbonate was heterogeneous between the participating ICUs and independent of the mechanism of academia, as shown by chloremia and corrected anion gap values upon ICU admission (Table 1). Lower PaCO 2, bicarbonatemia and base excess were associated with sodium bicarbonate prescription. Interestingly, our results are similar to those of a recent North American survey which reported that over 60% of intensivists and 80% of nephrologists would consider the use of buffer therapy for the treatment of lactic acidosis. To our knowledge, that survey and our present study are the only investigations that describe the pattern of sodium bicarbonate prescription for severe acidemia in critically ill patients.

When prescribing sodium bicarbonate in the critically ill, the potential side effects of severe acidemia must be balanced with complications related to sodium bicarbonate itself. Indeed, sodium bicarbonate may also be associated with complications such as a transient drop in blood pressure and cardiac output and a decrease in ionized calcium, thus sensitizing the heart to abnormal electrical activity and subsequent arrhythmia. Moreover, "paradoxical" intracellular acidosis may occur because generated CO 2 freely diffuses across the cell membrane. In addition, bicarbonate administration can be responsible for hypernatremia, volume overload, the release of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. In the present study, administration of sodium bicarbonate within the first 24 hours of acidemia was not associated with outcome (Tables 2 and 3).

In 2011, there is no human study that has reported any beneficial or detrimental effects of sodium bicarbonate administration when treating patients with severe mixed or metabolic acidemia. Therefore, attention should be first directed toward correcting the underlying basis for the acidemia.

### Treatment of metformin intoxication complicated by lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury: the role of prolonged intermittent hemodialysis [^1142xNVT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Metformin intoxication with lactic acidosis, a potentially lethal condition, may develop in diabetic patients when the drug dose is inappropriate and/or its clearance is reduced. Diagnosis and therapy may be delayed due to nonspecific symptoms at presentation, with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated serum creatinine values being the most prominent laboratory findings. Confirmation requires measurement of serum metformin by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, but this technique is available only at specialized institutions and cannot be relied on as a guide to immediate treatment. Thus, based on strong clinical suspicion, renal replacement therapy must be started promptly to achieve efficient drug clearance and correct the metabolic acidosis. However, because metformin accumulates in the intracellular compartment with prolonged treatment, a rebound in serum concentrations due to redistribution is expected at the end of dialysis. We report a case of metformin intoxication, severe lactic acidosis, and acute kidney injury in a diabetic patient with pre-existing chronic kidney disease stage 3, treated effectively with sustained low-efficiency dialysis. We discuss the pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment options and highlight specific pharmacokinetic issues that should be considered in selecting the appropriate modality of renal replacement therapy.

### How to diagnose and manage QT Prolongation in cancer patients [^113PDn3E]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

How do we manage QT prolongation in TdP?

Once QTc prolongation is identified, serum electrolyte levels should be obtained and abnormalities should be corrected. If a patient develops TdP, intravenous magnesium sulfate should be administered immediately. In patients without congenital long-QT syndrome, mexiletine, a Class Ib antiarrhythmic, has been shown to shorten the QT interval, halt episodes of TdP, and prevent recurrence of refractory TdP. If signs of electrical instability persist, transfer to the intensive care unit is recommended with initiation of beta-adrenergic agents such as isoproterenol or temporary pacing to increase the heart rate.

The European Society of Cardiology has offered an expert consensus on cancer treatments and cardiotoxicity. However, there are no generally accepted consistent criteria regarding discontinuation of cancer therapeutics for patients who develop QT prolongation. Oncologists and cardiologists must make case-by-case decisions of continuing potentially life-prolonging cancer therapy balanced by the risk for lethal arrhythmias.

LEARNING POINTS
- When QTc is elevated, check and correct electrolyte imbalances and perform a medication reconciliation to discontinue QT-prolonging agents.
- Patients who develop TdP should be treated as per advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol with intravenous magnesium sulfate and transfer to an intensive care unit for closer monitoring.

Case Continued

Before discharge, the patient had resolution of ventricular ectopy on telemetry. She was started on guideline-directed anti-remodeling medications. A repeat echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. A follow up 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm with a QTc of 442 ms.

### Cinacalcet hydrochloride [^114Jpd3J]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmia

Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia. Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet tablets. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to cinacalcet tablets. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving cinacalcet tablets.

Seizures

In clinical studies, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of cinacalcet-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients. While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear, the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Monitor serum calcium levels in patients with seizure disorders receiving cinacalcet tablets.

Concurrent Administration with Other Calcium-Lowering Drug Products

Concurrent administration of cinacalcet tablets with calcium-lowering drugs including other calcium-sensing receptor agonists could result in severe hypocalcemia. Closely monitor serum calcium in patients receiving cinacalcet tablets and concomitant therapies known to lower serum calcium levels.

Patient Education and Hypocalcemia Treatment

Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur. If corrected serum calcium falls below the lower limit of normal or symptoms of hypocalcemia develop, start or increase calcium supplementation (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). Cinacalcet tablet dose reduction or discontinuation of cinacalcet tablet may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Furosemide (toxicology medicated collection system) [^112qBbMr]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Excessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients. As with any effective diuretic, electrolyte depletion may occur during Furosemide tablets therapy, especially in patients receiving higher doses and a restricted salt intake. Hypokalemia may develop with Furosemide tablets, especially with brisk diuresis, inadequate oral electrolyte intake, when cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, licorice in large amounts, or prolonged use of laxatives. Digitalis therapy may exaggerate metabolic effects of hypokalemia, especially myocardial effects.

All patients receiving Furosemide tablets therapy should be observed for these signs or symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia): dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests (with abnormalities of the fasting and 2-hour postprandial sugar) have been observed, and rarely, precipitation of diabetes mellitus has been reported.

In patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. Thus, these patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment.

In patients at high risk for radiocontrast nephropathy Furosemide tablets can lead to a higher incidence of deterioration in renal function after receiving radiocontrast compared to high-risk patients who received only intravenous hydration prior to receiving radiocontrast.

In patients with hypoproteinemia (e.g., associated with nephrotic syndrome) the effect of Furosemide tablets may be weakened and its ototoxicity potentiated.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated.

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may also be allergic to Furosemide tablets. The possibility exists of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

As with many other drugs, patients should be observed regularly for the possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver or kidney damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions.

### Hyponatraemia in patients with crush syndrome during the wenchuan earthquake [^112maL3C]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The prevalence of hyponatraemia on ICU admission is between 13.7% and 17.7%. The risk of death during hospitalisation is increased in patients admitted to hospital with hyponatraemia compared with normonatraemia. Hyponatraemia present on admission to the ICU is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis.

Earthquake disasters result in a vast number of instant deaths owing to injuries to vital organs, and are also associated with a cluster of heavily wounded people, in whom crush injuries and prolonged compression of limbs are commonly found. Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle cell damage resulting from crushing and affects many organs, resulting in hypovolaemic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), arrhythmias, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and electrolyte disturbances. Crush injury-related electrolyte abnormalities that occur as a result of the release of cellular components include hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, high anion-gap metabolic acidosis and hypermagnesaemia. Hyponatraemia is seldom reported in patients with crush syndrome in hospital as it is one of the most common electrolyte disorders found.

On 12 May 2008, western Sichuan in China was devastated by a deadly earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale, which was named the Wenchuan earthquake. The earthquake caused 69 227 deaths, 17 923 people were lost and 96 544 wounded. The disaster also resulted in hundreds of patients with crush syndrome. The primary aim of this study is to describe the incidence of hyponatraemia and assess its effect on outcome in patients with crush syndrome. The study protocol was approved by the ethic committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital.

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^112rGfc5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Excessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients. As with any effective diuretic, electrolyte depletion may occur during LASIX therapy, especially in patients receiving higher doses and a restricted salt intake. Hypokalemia may develop with LASIX, especially with brisk diuresis, inadequate oral electrolyte intake, when cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, licorice in large amounts, or prolonged use of laxatives. Digitalis therapy may exaggerate metabolic effects of hypokalemia, especially myocardial effects.

All patients receiving LASIX therapy should be observed for these signs or symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia): dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests (with abnormalities of the fasting and 2-hour postprandial sugar) have been observed, and rarely, precipitation of diabetes mellitus has been reported.

In patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. Thus, these patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment.

In patients at high risk for radiocontrast nephropathy, LASIX can lead to a higher incidence of deterioration in renal function after receiving radiocontrast compared to high-risk patients who received only intravenous hydration prior to receiving radiocontrast.

In patients with hypoproteinemia (e.g., associated with nephrotic syndrome), the effect of LASIX may be weakened and its ototoxicity potentiated.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated.

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may also be allergic to LASIX. The possibility exists of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

As with many other drugs, patients should be observed regularly for the possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver or kidney damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions.

### Torsades de pointes in the PACU after outpatient endoscopy: a case report [^116CusDa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Follow-up and outcomes

During her hospital stay, the patient continued to have long QT syndrome and experienced two additional episodes of recurrent Torsades de Pointes (Fig. 3), pulseless ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation. These episodes occurred in the intensive care unit despite discontinuation of all QT prolonging medications and a normal electrolyte panel. Each episode responded to defibrillation with return to normal sinus rhythm. Interventional cardiology was consulted for further evaluation and treatment and she was transferred to the Cardiac Critical Care Unit. After failure of medical management and persistent prolonged QT syndrome, the diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome was made. This was acutely exacerbated by secretory diarrhea, electrolyte abnormalities, and QT prolonging medications. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed on day 8 of her hospital stay and she was discharged home on hospital day 10.

### Common pitfalls in the use of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate for cardiac toxic drug poisonings [^114we1TL]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is advocated for the treatment of sodium channel blocker poisoning, but its efficacy varies amongst different sodium channel blockers. This Commentary addresses common pitfalls and appropriate usage of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiotoxic drug poisonings.

Sodium Bicarbonate Works Synergistically With Hyperventilation

Serum alkalinization is best achieved by the synergistic effect of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation (PCO 2 ∼ 30–35mmHg [0.47–0.6kPa]). This reduces the dose of sodium bicarbonate required to achieve serum alkalinization (pH ∼ 7.45–7.55) and avoids adverse effects from excessive doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate.

Variability In Response To Sodium Bicarbonate Treatment

Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning responds well to sodium bicarbonate therapy, but many other sodium channel blockers may not. For instance, drugs that block the intercellular gap junctions, such as bupropion, do not respond well to alkalinization. For sodium channel blocker poisonings in which the expected response is unknown, a bolus of 1–2mmol/kg sodium bicarbonate can be used to assess the response to alkalinization.

Sodium Bicarbonate Can Exacerbate Toxicity From Drugs Acting On Multiple Cardiac Channels

Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate can cause electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia, leading to QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes in poisonings with drugs that have mixed sodium and potassium cardiac channel properties, such as hydroxychloroquine and flecainide.

The Goal For Hypertonic Sodium Bicarbonate Is To Achieve The Alkalinization Target (∼ph 7.5), Not Complete Correction Of Qrs Complex Prolongation

Excessive doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate commonly occur if it is administered until the QRS complex duration is < 100ms. A prolonged QRS complex duration is not specific for sodium channel blocker toxicity. Some sodium channel blockers do not respond, and even when there is a response, it takes a few hours for the QRS complex duration to return completely to normal. In addition, QRS complex prolongation can be due to a rate-dependent bundle branch block. So, no further doses should be given after achieving serum alkalinization (pH ∼ 7.45–7.55).

Maximal Dosing For Hypertonic Sodium Bicarbonate

A further strategy to avoid overdosing patients with hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is to set maximum doses. Exceeding 6mmol/kg is likely to cause hypernatremia, fluid overload, metabolic alkalosis, and cerebral oedema in many patients and potentially be lethal.

Recommendation For The Use Of Hypertonic Sodium Bicarbonate In Sodium Channel Blocker Poisoning

We propose that hypertonic sodium bicarbonate therapy be used in patients with sodium channel blocker poisoning who have clinically significant toxicities such as seizures, shock (systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg, mean arterial pressure < 65mmHg) or ventricular dysrhythmia. We recommend initial bolus dosing of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate of 1–2mmol/kg, which can be repeated if the patient remains unstable, up to a maximum dose of 6mmol/kg. This is recommended to be administered in conjunction with mechanical ventilation and hyperventilation to achieve serum alkalinization (PCO 2 ∼30–35mmHg [4–4.7kPa]) and a pH of ∼7.45–7.55. With repeated bolus doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, it is imperative to monitor and correct potassium and sodium abnormalities and observe changes in serum pH and on the electrocardiogram.

Conclusions

Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is an effective antidote for certain sodium channel blocker poisonings, such as tricyclic antidepressants, and when used in appropriate dosing, it works synergistically with hyperventilation to achieve serum alkalinization and to reduce sodium channel blockade. However, there are many pitfalls that can lead to excessive sodium bicarbonate therapy and severe adverse effects.

### Acetazolamide extended-release [^112hhRNi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE:

No specific antidote is known. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic state, and central nervous system effects might be expected to occur. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and blood pH levels should be monitored. Supportive measures are required to restore electrolyte and pH balance. The acidotic state can usually be corrected by the administration of bicarbonate.

Despite its high intraerythrocytic distribution and plasma protein binding properties, acetazolamide may be dialyzable. This may be particularly important in the management of acetazolamide overdosage when complicated by the presence of renal failure.

### Metabolic acidosis… [^113arnxS]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a serious electrolyte disorder characterized by an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance. Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes: increased acid production, loss of bicarbonate, and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids. Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia, which is defined as arterial blood pH that is lower than 7.
35. Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive – pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders; therefore, pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low to high. Signs and symptoms Symptoms are not specific, and diagnosis can be difficult unless patients present with clear indications for blood gas sampling.

Symptoms may include palpitations, headache, altered mental status such as severe anxiety due to hypoxia, decreased visual acuity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered appetite and weight gain, muscle weakness, bone pain, and joint pain. Chronic metabolic acidosis has non-specific clinical symptoms but can be readily diagnosed by testing serum bicarbonate levels in patients with chronic kidney disease as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel. Patients with CKD Stages G3–G5 should be routinely screened for metabolic acidosis. Diagnostic approach and causes Metabolic acidosis results in a reduced serum pH that is due to metabolic and not respiratory dysfunction. Typically the serum bicarbonate concentration will be < 22 mEq/L, below the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, the standard base will be more negative than -2 and the pCO~2~ will be reduced as a result of hyperventilation in an attempt to restore the pH closer to normal.

Occasionally in a mixed acid-base disorder where metabolic acidosis is not the primary disorder present, the pH may be normal or high. In the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis can be clinically diagnosed by analysis of the calculated serum bicarbonate level. Causes Generally, metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, there is a loss of bicarbonate from the blood, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. Chronic metabolic acidosis is most often caused by a decreased capacity of the kidneys to excrete excess acids through renal ammoniagenesis. The typical Western diet generates 75–100 mEq of acid daily, and individuals with normal kidney function increase the production of ammonia to get rid of this dietary acid.

As kidney function declines, the tubules lose the ability to excrete excess acid, and this results in buffering of acid using serum bicarbonate, as well as bone and muscle stores. There are many causes of acute metabolic acidosis, and thus it is helpful to group them by the presence or absence of a normal anion gap. Increased anion gap Causes of increased anion gap include:

- Lactic acidosis
- Ketoacidosis
- Chronic kidney failure
- 5-oxoprolinemia due to long-term ingestion of high-doses of acetaminophen with glutathione depletion.
- Massive rhabdomyolysis
- Isoniazid, iron, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, valproic acid, verapamil
- Topiramate
- Sulfates Normal anion gap Causes of normal anion gap include:

### High anion gap metabolic acidosis [^111wouAN]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

High anion gap metabolic acidosis is a form of metabolic acidosis characterized by a high anion gap. Metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. Several types of metabolic acidosis occur, grouped by their influence on the anion gap. The anion gap can be increased due to relatively low levels of cations other than sodium and potassium. An anion gap is usually considered to be high if it is over 12 mEq/L. High anion gap metabolic acidosis is typically caused by acid produced by the body. More rarely, it may be caused by ingesting methanol or overdosing on aspirin. The delta ratio is a formula that can be used to assess elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and to evaluate whether mixed acid base disorder is present.

The list of agents that cause high anion gap metabolic acidosis is similar to but broader than the list of agents that cause a serum osmolal gap. Causes The most common causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis are: ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, kidney failure, and toxic ingestions. Ketoacidosis can occur as a complication of diabetes mellitus, but can occur due to other disorders, such as chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. In these conditions, excessive free fatty acid metabolism results in the production of ketoacids, acetoacetic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Lactic acidosis results from excess formation and decreased metabolism of lactate, which occurs during states of anaerobic metabolism. It is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients. The most serious form occurs during various states of shock, due to episodes of decreased liver perfusion.

Kidney failure results in decreased acid excretion and increased bicarbonate excretion. Toxins that result in acidic metabolites may trigger lactic acidosis. Rhabdomyolysis, a muscle-wasting disease, is a rare cause of metabolic acidosis. Mnemonics Various mnemonics are used to assist clinicians in the detection and diagnosis of conditions that may result in high anion gap metabolic acidosis: The newer 2008 mnemonic "GOLD MARK" was proposed in The Lancet reflecting current causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis:

- G — glycols
- O — oxoproline, a metabolite of paracetamol
- L — L-lactate, the chemical responsible for lactic acidosis
- D — D-lactate
- M — methanol
- A — aspirin.
- R — renal failure
- K — ketoacidosis, ketones generated from starvation, alcohol, and diabetic ketoacidosis The mnemonic MUDPILES is commonly used to remember the causes of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis.
- M — Methanol
- U — Uremia
- D — Diabetic ketoacidosis
- P — Paracetamol, Propylene glycol.
- I — Infection, Iron, Isoniazid, Inborn errors of metabolism
- L — Lactic acidosis
- E — Ethylene glycol.
- S — Salicylates Another frequently used mnemonic is KARMEL.
- K — Ketoacidosis
- A — aspirin
- R — Renal failure
- M — Methanol
- E — Ethylene glycol
- L — Lactic acidosis Yet another frequently used mnemonic is KULT.

### Normal anion gap acidosis… [^111EDaLg]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

Normal anion gap acidosis is an acidosis that is not accompanied by an abnormally increased anion gap. The most common cause of normal anion gap acidosis is diarrhea with a renal tubular acidosis being a distant second. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of normal anion gap acidosis is relatively short:

- Hyperalimentation
- Chloride administration, often from normal saline
- Acetazolamide and other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
- Renal tubular acidosis.
- Diarrhea: due to a loss of bicarbonate. This is compensated by an increase in chloride concentration, thus leading to a normal anion gap, or hyperchloremic, metabolic acidosis.

The pathophysiology of increased chloride concentration is the following: fluid secreted into the gut lumen contains higher amounts of Na^+^ than Cl^−^; large losses of these fluids, particularly if volume is replaced with fluids containing equal amounts of Na^+^ and Cl^−^, results in a decrease in the plasma Na^+^ concentration relative to the Cl^−^concentration. This scenario can be avoided if formulations such as lactated Ringer's solution are used instead of normal saline to replace GI losses.
- Ureteroenteric fistula – an abnormal connection between a ureter and the gastrointestinal tract
- Pancreaticoduodenal fistula – an abnormal connection between the pancreas and duodenum.
- Spironolactone
- High ostomy output
- Hyperparathyroidism – can cause hyperchloremia and increase renal bicarbonate loss, which may result in a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Patients with hyperparathyroidism may have a lower than normal pH, slightly decreased PaCO2 due to respiratory compensation, a decreased bicarbonate level, and a normal anion gap. As opposed to high anion gap acidosis, normal anion gap acidosis involves either increased production/administration of chloride or increased excretion of bicarbonate. See also

### Anion gap [^116vzdA9]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Interpretation and causes Anion gap can be classified as either high, normal or, in rare cases, low. Laboratory errors need to be ruled out whenever anion gap calculations lead to results that do not fit the clinical picture. Methods used to determine the concentrations of some of the ions used to calculate the anion gap may be susceptible to very specific errors. For example, if the blood sample is not processed immediately after it is collected, continued cellular metabolism by leukocytes may result in an increase in the HCO^−^~3~ concentration, and result in a corresponding mild reduction in the anion gap. In many situations, alterations in renal function may modify the anion gap that may be expected to arise in a particular pathological condition. A high anion gap indicates increased concentrations of unmeasured anions by proxy.

Elevated concentrations of unmeasured anions like lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, PO^3−^~4~, and SO^2−^~4~, which rise with disease or intoxication, cause loss of HCO^−^~3~ due to bicarbonate's activity as a buffer. Thus, finding a high anion gap should result in a search for conditions that lead to excesses of the unmeasured anions listed above. High anion gap The anion gap is affected by changes in unmeasured ions. In uncontrolled diabetes, there is an increase in ketoacids due to metabolism of ketones. Raised levels of acid bind to bicarbonate to form carbon dioxide through the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation resulting in metabolic acidosis. In these conditions, bicarbonate concentrations decrease by acting as a buffer against the increased presence of acids. The bicarbonate is consumed by the unmeasured cation resulting in a high anion gap.

Causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis:

- Lactic acidosis
- Ketoacidosis
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Hazardous alcohol use
- Toxicants:

- Methanol
- Ethylene glycol
- Propylene glycol
- Lactic acid
- Uremia
- Aspirin
- Phenformin
- Iron
- Isoniazid
- Cyanide, coupled with elevated venous oxygenation.
- Kidney failure, causes high anion gap acidosis by decreased acid excretion and decreased HCO^−^~3~ reabsorption. Accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, urate, and hippurate accounts for the high anion gap. Note: a useful mnemonic to remember this is MUDPILES – Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection, Lactic Acidosis, Ethylene Glycol and Salicylates. Normal anion gap In patients with a normal anion gap, the drop in HCO^−^~3~ is the primary pathology.

Since there is only one other major buffering anion, it must be compensated for almost completely by an increase in Cl^−^. This is therefore also known as hyperchloremic acidosis.
- Gastrointestinal loss of HCO^−^~3~
- Kidney loss of HCO^−^~3~ also known as type 2 RTA).
- Renal hypoaldosterone characterized by elevated serum potassium. There are three types.
1. Low renin may be due to diabetic nephropathy or NSAIDS.
2. Low aldosterone may be due to adrenal disorders or ACE inhibitors.
3. Low response to aldosterone maybe due to potassium-sparing diuretics, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or diabetes.
- Ingestions
- Ammonium chloride and acetazolamide, ifosfamide.

### Delta ratio… [^114Pok4Z]. Wikipedia (2014). Low credibility.

In nephrology, the delta ratio, or "delta-delta", is a formula that can be used to evaluate whether a mixed acid–base disorder is present, and if so, assess its severity. The anion gap without potassium is calculated first and if a metabolic acidosis is present, results in either a high anion gap metabolic acidosis or a normal anion gap acidosis. A low anion gap is usually an oddity of measurement, rather than a clinical concern. Equation The equation for calculating the delta ratio is \.

where AG is the anion gap, AG = -, which reflects either an increase in the anion gap or a decrease in the bicarbonate concentration. Results The ratio gives one of four results:

1. < 0. 4 due to a pure NAGMA 2.
0. 4–0. 8 due to a mixed NAGMA + HAGMA 3.
0. 8–2. 0 due to a pure HAGMA
4. > 2. 0 due to a mixed HAGMA + metabolic alkalosis. Results 2 and 4 are the ones which have mixed acid–base disorders. Results 1. and
4. are oddities, mathematically speaking: Result 1: if there is a normal anion gap acidosis, the part of the equation will be close to zero, the delta ratio will be close to zero and there is no mixed acid–base disorder. Your calculations can stop here. A normal anion gap acidosis has more to do with a change in or concentrations. So the AG doesn't change; but to maintain electrical equilibrium, if goes up, must come down.

Hence, hyperchloremia always causes a metabolic acidosis as must fall; alternatively, if the rises, the must fall. For a list of the common causes of this change in bicarbonate or chloride, see normal anion gap acidosis. Results 2–4 all involve HAGMAs. A high anion gap metabolic acidosis usually occurs because of an increase in anions. So in the equation: \} \) it is the that is the cause. For a list of the common anions responsible, see high anion gap metabolic acidosis. KULT is probably the easiest of the mnemonics to use. Toxins are an uncommon cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis – a list of the commonest toxins is ACE GIFTs. Metformin as a pure toxicological cause is vanishingly rare.

Result 4: if the result of the ratio is greater than 2 in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, it is usually because there was a pre-existing higher than normal bicarbonate level. This is commonly found in people with chronic respiratory acidosis from chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who can't breathe off their excess carbon dioxide owing to poor lung function, and retain bicarb in order to counteract the acidosis caused by the retained CO~2~. Alternatively it could be caused by a concurrent metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting causing acid loss and hence alkalosis, or diuretic use with loss of and a compensatory bicarb retention in order to maintain plasma electrical neutrality. Mathematically this is reflected in a high anion gap, but because the bicarbonate was high to start, it will appear to fall only a small amount.
