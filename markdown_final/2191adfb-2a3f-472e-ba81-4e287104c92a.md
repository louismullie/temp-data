## Question

What does the Gleason score refer to?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the Gleason score refers to in prostate cancer pathology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and what exactly is being graded. Then, I should verify how the score is assigned on biopsy versus prostatectomy specimens. Next, I will review the grade patterns and practical score range, followed by the modern Grade Group system. After that, I need to consider clinical use in risk stratification and treatment decisions, and finally I should check key limitations and contemporary refinements like percent pattern 4/5 and tertiary pattern 5 reporting [^111KgRVz].

> Let me first confirm the definition: the Gleason score is a histopathological grading system for prostate adenocarcinoma based on glandular architectural patterns, not nuclear atypia, and it remains a central determinant of tumor behavior and prognosis in clinical decision-making; hold on, I should verify that focus on architecture and its prognostic primacy, which multiple pathology reviews and contemporary grading overviews consistently support [^112QFa5R] [^113MuQXg] [^111quf6Y].

> Next, I should review the morphological patterns to ensure I'm precise: patterns 1–3 represent well-formed, relatively well-circumscribed glands (with patterns 1–2 now essentially never used on needle biopsy), pattern 4 includes poorly formed, fused, cribriform, and glomeruloid glands, and pattern 5 reflects loss of glandular differentiation with solid sheets, single cells, cords, or comedonecrosis; wait, let me verify the current consensus descriptors to avoid overgeneralization, which align with ISUP-driven descriptions in modern reviews [^112QFa5R].

> I will now examine how the score is derived because the rules differ by specimen: on radical prostatectomy, the score is the sum of the two most predominant patterns, whereas on needle biopsy the score is the most common pattern plus the highest grade present anywhere, even if limited; hold on, I should verify that "include the highest grade" rule originates from ISUP consensus and is consistently applied in practice, which it is [^112QFa5R] [^116pwPjq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about the numeric range — initially I thought the scores might run 1 to 10, but I need to correct myself: the theoretical range is 2 to 10, yet in contemporary practice the lowest assigned score is 6 because patterns 1–2 are essentially not used on biopsy; let me confirm that the Grade Group framework maps 3+3 = 6 to Grade Group 1, 3+4 = 7 to Group 2, 4+3 = 7 to Group 3, 8 to Group 4, and 9–10 to Group 5, which is now widely adopted to clarify prognosis and patient communication [^113MuQXg] [^111dWtuf] [^114thmua] [^114aeXR1].

> I need to ensure I tie this to clinical decision-making: risk stratification for newly diagnosed localized disease uses Gleason score alongside PSA and clinical T stage, informing whether a patient is low-, intermediate-, or high-risk and guiding surveillance versus definitive therapy; let me verify that major guidelines explicitly embed Gleason-based grading in these frameworks, and confirm the clinically important distinction between 3+4 and 4+3 which carries different risks for progression and mortality [^111KgRVz] [^116FTRka] [^117CeFRK] [^115keeuc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about perfect reproducibility — I should review limitations: interobserver variability persists, especially around pattern 4 thresholds, though expert consensus processes and even deep-learning assistance can improve consistency; I should also double-check that biopsy often underestimates final grade at prostatectomy due to sampling, which affects active surveillance selection and counseling [^116pwPjq] [^116LGZ7g] [^1163u83h] [^1119GyE4] [^116umo2h].

> Let me consider contemporary refinements because they alter how we report and interpret the Gleason score: guidelines advocate reporting the percent pattern 4 (and 5) in appropriate settings, noting minor tertiary pattern 5 at prostatectomy, and documenting cribriform morphology given its prognostic weight; I need to check the GUPS recommendations and supportive outcome data indicating that quantifying high-grade components improves prognostication beyond Grade Group alone [^112ki6G3] [^111mXJEz] [^116PB8Gj].

> To synthesize, the Gleason score refers to an architecture-based grading of prostate adenocarcinoma calculated by summing two patterns (with specimen-specific rules), yielding a practical range of 6–10 that is now translated into five Grade Groups, and it remains foundational for prognosis and risk-adapted management; I should confirm that this summary aligns with current urology and oncology guideline usage before concluding, which it does [^111KgRVz] [^116FTRka].

The Gleason score is a **histologic grading system** for prostate cancer that sums the two most prevalent architectural patterns (each graded 1–5) [^112QFa5R], yielding a score of 6–10 that reflects tumor differentiation and aggressiveness [^1118TU8Z]. It is a cornerstone of **risk stratification and treatment planning** [^111KgRVz], with higher scores indicating more aggressive disease and worse prognosis [^116FTRka]. Refinements by ISUP and WHO introduced reporting as **Grade Groups 1–5** [^113MuQXg] to improve clinical communication and decision-making [^112ki6G3].

---

## Historical development and evolution

Developed by **Donald Gleason** in the 1960s [^114AbaQd], the system is based on architectural patterns. ISUP 2005 and 2014 refined pattern definitions and reporting, including the **introduction of Grade Groups** [^113MuQXg] [^114AbaQd]. ISUP/WHO-endorsed **Grade Groups 1–5** [^113MuQXg] are now standard in clinical practice [^112ki6G3].

---

## Methodology of gleason scoring

- **Grading**: Pathologists assign patterns 1–5 based on glandular architecture [^112QFa5R].
- **Scoring**: The two most prevalent patterns are summed (primary + secondary) [^1118TU8Z] to yield a score of 6–10.
- **Biopsy vs prostatectomy**: On biopsy, the most common and highest patterns are used [^112QFa5R]; on prostatectomy, the two most prevalent patterns are summed [^1118TU8Z].

---

## Clinical significance and prognostic value

The Gleason score is central to **risk assessment and treatment selection** [^111KgRVz] [^116FTRka]. Higher scores correlate with **increased recurrence, metastasis, and mortality** [^117CeFRK] [^116FTRka]. Grade Groups 1–5 enhance **prognostic accuracy** and communication [^117AXCnb] [^112ki6G3] [^113MuQXg].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Subjectivity leads to **interobserver variability** [^116pwPjq], especially in borderline cases [^1118TU8Z]. Biopsy may under- or overestimate grade due to **tumor heterogeneity** [^1156nYde] [^1119GyE4]. Ongoing refinements aim to **improve accuracy and reproducibility** [^113MuQXg] [^114AbaQd].

---

## Recent advancements and modifications

- **Grade groups**: ISUP/WHO Grade Groups 1–5 are now standard [^113MuQXg] [^112ki6G3].
- **Quantitative grading**: Reporting percent pattern 4/5 refines risk assessment [^112ki6G3] [^116PB8Gj].
- **AI**: Deep learning shows promise for reproducible grading [^116LGZ7g] [^1163u83h].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment decisions

- **Low-risk (GS 6)**: Active surveillance is often appropriate [^111KgRVz] [^1118TU8Z].
- **Intermediate-risk (GS 7)**: Treatment varies by 3+4 vs 4+3 [^117CeFRK] and percent pattern 4 [^112ki6G3].
- **High-risk (GS 8–10)**: Aggressive therapy is typically recommended [^111KgRVz] [^116FTRka].

---

The Gleason score remains a **foundational tool for prostate cancer prognosis and management** [^113MuQXg], with ongoing refinements — including Grade Groups and quantitative pattern reporting — **enhancing its clinical utility** [^114thmua].

### 4d pathology: translating dynamic epithelial tubulogenesis to prostate cancer pathology [^1118TU8Z]. Histopathology (2025). Low credibility.

The Gleason score is the globally used grading system for prostate cancer (PCa). It plays an essential role in estimating patients' prognosis and therapeutic decision-making. The Gleason score is assessed by adding the two most common Gleason patterns (GP) on radical prostatectomy specimens or the most common and highest patterns on biopsies. Men with a biopsy Gleason score of 6 (3 + 3) are candidates for surveillance, while those with higher scores are generally offered active treatment.

PCa grading is performed on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections. GP1, 2, and 3 consist of malignant, well-delineated tubules with well-formed round to oval lumens. GP4 encompasses poorly-formed, fused, cribriform, and glomeruloid structures, while GP5 is characterized by cords, single cells, solid fields, or the presence of comedonecrosis. A major shortcoming of the Gleason grading system is its substantial interobserver variability. For example, a study conducted among 337 European pathologists showed only 56% agreement on the Gleason score.

Recently, individual growth patterns, in particular a cribriform pattern, were recognized to have independent prognostic value and are now included as eligibility criteria for active surveillance in Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) patients. An overview of PCa growth patterns is provided in Table 1.

Gleason grading is entirely based on the assessment of 4–5 μm cross-sections of tissue samples, resulting in a two-dimensional representation of the disease.

Controversies and uncertainty persist in prostate cancer grading. The objective is to update grading recommendations by conducting a critical review of the literature along with pathology and clinician surveys.

- **Percent Gleason pattern 4 (%GP4)**:
	(1) Report %GP4 in needle biopsy with Grade Groups (GrGp) 2 and 3, and in needle biopsy on other parts (jars) of lower grade in cases with at least one part showing Gleason score (GS) 4 + 4 = 8; and
	(2) Report %GP4 as less than 5% or less than 10%, and increase in 10% increments thereafter.

- **Tertiary grade patterns**:
	(1) Replace "tertiary grade pattern" in radical prostatectomy (RP) with "minor tertiary pattern 5 (TP5)", and only use in RP with GrGp 2 or 3 with less than 5% Gleason pattern 5; and
	(2) Minor TP5 is noted along with the GS, with the GrGp based on the GS.

- **Global score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsies**:
	(1) When multiple undesignated cores are taken from a single MRI-targeted lesion, an overall grade for that lesion is given as if all the involved cores were one long core; and
	(2) If providing a global score, when different scores are found in the standard and the MRI-targeted biopsy, give a single global score factoring both the systematic standard and the MRI-targeted positive cores.

- **Grade Groups**:
	(1) Grade Groups (GrGp) is the terminology adopted by major world organizations; and
	(2) Retain GS 3 + 5 = 8 in GrGp 4.

- **Cribriform carcinoma**:
	(1) Report the presence or absence of cribriform glands in biopsy and RP with Gleason patterns.

### Grading of prostate cancer: a work in progress [^113MuQXg]. Histopathology (2019). Low credibility.

The ISUP 2014 grading of prostate cancer system, referred to here as ISUP grades, has been adopted by the European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline committee of prostate cancer. An important advantage of this grading system is its range from 1 to 5. ISUP grade 1 carcinoma terminology may encourage acceptance of active surveillance, as it is perceived as less ominous than Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) carcinoma. Another advantage is that the 2014 modification codifies the prognostic difference between Gleason scores 7 (3 + 4) and 7 (4 + 3), which was previously established.

Comparison with a four-tier Gleason score grouping (i.e. Gleason scores 6, 7, 8, 9–10) demonstrated the superior prognostic impact of the five-tiered ISUP grading for both clinical and pathological outcome parameters after prostatectomy. Commonly used clinical risk stratification systems, such as D'Amico, consider Gleason score 7 as a major criterion for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. These systems may now need to adapt their risk stratification based on ISUP grades. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on prostate cancer distinguish between favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk based, among others, on the distinction between ISUP grades 2 and 3. Similarly, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score for biopsies and prostatectomy specimens distinguishes ISUP grades 2 and 3.

A potential disadvantage of the ISUP 2014 grading system is not mentioned in the provided text.

### Prostate cancer growth patterns beyond the Gleason score: entering a new era of comprehensive tumour grading [^112QFa5R]. Histopathology (2020). Low credibility.

The Gleason grading system is important for determining prostate cancer prognosis and for clinical decision‐making. The Gleason score is entirely based on the classification of adenocarcinoma growth patterns. These patterns are assigned a Gleason grade from 1 to 5. As prostate cancer is such a heterogeneous disease, the Gleason score is determined by adding together the most common grade and the highest grade in biopsies, as well as the two most predominant grades in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.

- **Gleason patterns 1–3**: These encompass well-delineated glandular structures with variable interglandular distances and nodular circumscription. As no practical and prognostic differences exist between these three Gleason grades, the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has recommended that Gleason scores 2–4 should rarely, if ever, be used for biopsy specimens.

- **Gleason pattern 4**: This comprises poorly formed, fused, glomeruloid, and cribriform glandular structures.

- **Gleason pattern 5**: Growth patterns with essentially no glandular differentiation, such as single cells, cords, and solid fields, and the presence of comedonecrosis are classified here. Individual growth patterns have, in general, not been specified in pathology reports or in molecular–biological investigations.

However, recent studies have indicated that individual growth patterns have independent predictive value for clinical outcomes and facilitate more comprehensive interpretation of molecular–biological findings. The aims of this review are to summarize the clinicopathological aspects related to these findings.

### Prediction of the pathologic Gleason score to inform a personalized management program for prostate cancer [^1126DDSc]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Active surveillance (AS) is an alternative to curative intervention, but overtreatment persists. Imperfect alignment of prostate biopsy and Gleason score after radical prostatectomy (RP) may be a contributing factor.

- **Objective**: To develop a statistical model that predicts the post-RP Gleason score (pathologic Gleason score [PGS]) using clinical observations made in the course of AS.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Repeated prostate-specific antigen measurements and biopsy Gleason scores from 964 very low-risk patients in the Johns Hopkins Active Surveillance cohort were used in the analysis. PGS observations from 191 patients who underwent RP were also included.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: A Bayesian joint model based on accumulated clinical data was used to predict PGS in these categories: 6 (grade group 1), 3+4 (grade group 2), 4+3 (grade group 3), and 8–10 (grade groups 4 and 5). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration of predictions was assessed in patients with post-RP Gleason score observations.

- **Results and limitations**: The estimated probability of harboring a PGS > 6 was 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.81), and the mean absolute error was 0.022.

- **Conclusions**: Although the model requires external validation prior to adoption, PGS predictions can be used in AS to inform decisions regarding follow-up biopsies.

### Risk stratification of men with Gleason score 7 to 10 tumors by primary and secondary Gleason score: results from the SEARCH database [^116HVR4V]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the risk stratification of men with Gleason score 7 to 10 tumors based on primary and secondary Gleason scores. Gleason score 4+3 prostate cancer is known to be associated with worse clinicopathologic outcomes than Gleason score 3+4. However, whether the increased risk for Gleason score 4+3 disease equals that of Gleason score 4+4 or greater remains unclear.

Methods used in this study included a review of data from two cohorts from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database. The first cohort included 374 men with biopsy Gleason score 3+4 or greater disease, and the second cohort involved 636 men with radical prostatectomy (RP) Gleason score 3+4 or greater disease. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios for unfavorable surgical pathologic outcomes for each biopsy Gleason score category. A Cox proportional hazards regression model helped estimate the relative risk of biochemical progression for each biopsy and RP Gleason score category.

In the results from the biopsy Gleason score cohort, Gleason score 4+3 was linked to an increased risk of extracapsular extension (P = 0.01) and seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.10), except for higher grade pathologic tumors among men with a biopsy Gleason score of 4+4 or more (P = 0.001). After adjusting for several clinical characteristics, a biopsy Gleason score of 4+3 was found to be associated with an increased recurrence risk compared to a biopsy Gleason score of 3+4 (P = 0.001).

### Poorly differentiated prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: Long-term outcome and incidence of pathological downgrading [^11472axw]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with high-grade (Gleason score 8 to 10) prostate cancer on biopsy are at high risk for cancer recurrence after local treatment, such as radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. We examined long-term outcomes in patients with high-grade prostate cancer on biopsy who were treated with radical prostatectomy alone. We also investigated the impact on outcomes of changes in the radical prostatectomy Gleason score.

Of 5,662 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy during 20 years, 238 had a biopsy Gleason score of 8 to 10. We analyzed the rate of biochemical recurrence in this subgroup according to the Gleason grade of cancer in the radical prostatectomy specimen.

- **Results**: Ten-year biochemical recurrence-free probability in the cohort was 39%. However, 45% of patients (95% CI 38 to 51%) with Gleason score 8 to 10 cancer on biopsy had a Gleason score of 7 or less in the radical prostatectomy specimen. These patients had a 10-year biochemical recurrence-free probability of 56% compared to 27% in those with a final Gleason score that remained 8 to 10 (p = 0.0004). On multivariate analysis, neither prostate-specific antigen nor biopsy features, including total number of cores, number of cores with cancer, and percent of cancer in the cores, was a significant predictor of downgrading. However, clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score were significant, with 58% of cT1c and 51% of biopsy Gleason score 8 cancers downgraded. Almost 65% of cT1c Gleason score 8 cancers were downgraded compared to 11% of cT3 Gleason score 9 cancers.

### Importance of reporting the Gleason score at the positive surgical margin site: Analysis of 4,082 consecutive radical prostatectomy cases [^111po1ck]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Since 2010, pathologists at our institution have routinely been documenting the Gleason score at the margin and the length of the positive surgical margin after prostatectomy. In this study, we evaluate how the Gleason score and positive surgical margin length correlate with the grade and adverse pathological characteristics of the final specimen, and whether the positive surgical margin Gleason score affects the risk of early biochemical recurrence.

A total of 4,082 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection between 2010 and 2014 for localized prostate cancer were included in the study, of whom 405 had a Gleason score of 7 or greater of the primary nodule and a positive surgical margin with the length and Gleason score recorded at the margin. Concordance rates between the Gleason score at the margin and the final pathological specimen were compared. Logistic regression models were used to predict the risk of unfavorable pathology. Cox proportional hazards models controlling for Gleason score, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, pathological stage, and adjuvant radiation were used to predict biochemical recurrence, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival were calculated by Gleason score.

Among patients with positive margins, biochemical recurrence was identified in 22% (vs 5.6% without positive margins), metastases in 3% (vs 0.5%), and adjuvant radiation in 30% (vs 4.1%). The mean follow-up was 22 months (range 12 to 48). The Gleason score at the positive surgical margin was the same.

### Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^1153sM35]. Clinical Epigenetics (2016). Low credibility.

Better tools to identify, at the time of diagnosis, the subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients at the highest risk of recurrence are urgently needed. Our study provides new evidence that DNA methylation profiling has the clinical potential to improve risk prediction for PCa outcomes in patients with clinically localized disease, particularly in patients with Gleason score 7 tumors. These tumors have a variable clinical course and represent a substantial proportion of prostate cancer patients diagnosed worldwide each year.

### Importance and determinants of Gleason score undergrading on biopsy sample of prostate cancer in a population-based study [^1119GyE4]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

In this population-based study, we investigated the degree of concordance between Gleason scores obtained from prostate biopsies and those obtained from prostatectomy specimens, as well as the determinants of biopsy understaging.

- **Methods**: We considered for this study all 371 prostate cancer patients recorded at the Geneva Cancer Registry diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 who underwent a radical prostatectomy. We used the kappa statistic to evaluate the Gleason score concordance from biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. Logistic regression was used to determine the parameters that predict the undergrading of the Gleason score in prostate biopsies.

- **Results**: The kappa statistic between biopsy and prostatectomy Gleason score was 0.42 (p < 0.0001), with 67% of patients exactly matched, and 26% (n = 95) of patients had their Gleason score underestimated by the biopsy. In a multi-adjusted model, increasing age, advanced clinical stage, having less than ten biopsy cores, and a longer delay between the two procedures were all independently associated with biopsy undergrading. In particular, the proportion of exact match increased to 72% when the patients had ten or more needle biopsy cores. The main limitation of the study is that both biopsy and prostatectomy specimens were examined by different laboratories.

- **Conclusions**: The data show that concordance between biopsy and prostatectomy Gleason scores lies within the classic clinical standards in this population-based study. The number of biopsy cores appears to strongly impact the concordance between biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.

### Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^112eRwW4]. Clinical Epigenetics (2016). Low credibility.

In the present study, an epigenetic signature of the Gleason score was generated. The study showed that the signature predicted recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy.

Gleason score, or grade of the tumor, is the best predictor of prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis in patients with localized disease. While patients diagnosed with Gleason ≤ 6 tumors typically have a favorable prognosis, patients with Gleason 8–10 tumors are most likely to experience disease recurrence and progression. We therefore generated a signature by contrasting patients with high (8–10) versus low (≤ 6) Gleason score tumors. Importantly, the study showed that the signature significantly improved the prediction of recurrence in patients diagnosed with Gleason score 7 tumors. Compared to standard clinical-pathological parameters, the signature improved the AUC for recurrence by 12%, and for patients with 3+4 tumors, there was a 19% increase in AUC.

Patients with Gleason score 7 tumors are clinically heterogeneous. These patients have a variable prognosis, and predicting PCa outcomes is often challenging. The methylation signature may therefore have potential to further improve the prognostication of these patients and might have clinical utility to help guide clinical decision-making (e.g. adjuvant therapy) after radical prostatectomy. Further validation of the signature is, however, required.

### Limitations in predicting organ confined prostate cancer in patients with Gleason pattern 4 on biopsy: Implications for active surveillance [^116chn9X]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

In prostate cancer, biopsy Gleason score predicts stage and helps determine active surveillance suitability. Evidence suggests that small incremental differences in the quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 on biopsy stratify disease extent, biochemical failure following surgery, and eligibility for active surveillance. We explored the overall quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 levels and adverse outcomes in patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer to whom active surveillance may be offered under expanded criteria.

- **Materials and methods**: We analyzed the records of patients with biopsy Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) or 7 (3 + 4) who underwent radical prostatectomy from January 2008 to August 2015. Age, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4, overall percent positive cores (percent of prostate cancer), and clinical stage were explored as predictors of non-organ confined disease and time to failure after radical prostatectomy.

- **Results**: In 1,255 patients, biopsy Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) was associated with T3 or greater disease at radical prostatectomy in 35.0% compared with Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) in 19.0% (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, for each quantitative percent of Gleason pattern 4 increase, there were 2% higher odds of T3 or greater disease (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.04, p < 0.001). When stratified, patients with Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) only approximated the pT3 rates of Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) when prostate-specific antigen was less than 8 ng/ml and the percent of prostate cancer was less than 15%.

### Epigenome-wide tumor DNA methylation profiling identifies novel prognostic biomarkers of metastatic-lethal progression in men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer [^112PsjL6]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

Aside from Gleason sum, few factors accurately identify the subset of prostate cancer patients at high risk for metastatic progression. We hypothesized that epigenetic alterations could distinguish prostate tumors with life-threatening potential.

- **Experimental design**: Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in surgically resected primary tumor tissues from a population-based (n = 430) and a replication (n = 80) cohort of prostate cancer patients followed prospectively for at least 5 years. Metastasis was confirmed by positive bone scan, MRI, CT, or biopsy, and death certificates confirmed cause of death. AUC, partial AUC (pAUC, 95% specificity), and P value criteria were used to select differentially methylated CpG sites that robustly stratify patients with metastatic-lethal from non-metastatic tumors, and which were complementary to Gleason sum.

- **Results**: Forty-two CpG biomarkers stratified patients with metastatic-lethal versus non-metastatic prostate cancer in the discovery cohort, and eight of these CpGs replicated in the validation cohort based on a significant (P < 0.05) AUC (range, 0.66–0.75) or pAUC (range, 0.007–0.009). The biomarkers that improved the discrimination of patients with metastatic-lethal prostate cancer include CpGs in five genes (ALKBH5, ATP11A, FHAD1, KLHL8, and PI15) and three intergenic regions. In the validation dataset, the AUC for Gleason sum alone (0.82) significantly increased with the addition of four individual CpGs (range, 0.86–0.89; all P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Eight differentially methylated CpGs that distinguish patients were identified.

### Active surveillance: patient selection [^115rbbsC]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview of the approach to patient selection for active surveillance, including eligibility criteria, controversies, and the role of imaging.

Active surveillance is based on the premise that Gleason 6 prostate cancer is, in most cases, an indolent condition that poses little or no threat to the patient's life. Recent substantial data suggest that Gleason pattern 3 does not exhibit the molecular characteristics of malignancy. Some patients may harbor more aggressive disease missed during initial diagnostic biopsies, and a smaller group may progress over time to higher-grade disease. Active surveillance involves initial expectant management for patients with favorable risk disease, along with serial biopsy and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.

Most patients with Gleason 6 prostate cancer are candidates for active surveillance. Very low-risk patients meet the Epstein criteria, characterized by only one or two positive cores, no core with more than 50% involvement, and a PSA density of less than 0.15. Low-risk patients have Gleason 6 disease and a PSA of 10 or less but do not satisfy the Epstein criteria. A higher volume of Gleason 6 disease on biopsy indicates a higher likelihood of a higher grade cancer, but it should not automatically mandate treatment. Patients with Gleason 7 disease, in whom the extent of the Gleason 4 pattern is less than 10%, may also be considered as candidates. Additionally, patient age, comorbidity, and personal preferences must be taken into account.

Active surveillance is an effective and well-tolerated method to reduce the overtreatment commonly associated with screening.

### Overall and worst Gleason scores are equally good predictors of prostate cancer progression [^1123hT2G]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Gleason scoring has undergone several modifications during the past decade. So far, only one study has compared the prognostic abilities of worst (WGS) and overall (OGS) modified Gleason scores after the ISUP 2005 conference. Prostatic needle biopsies are individually paraffin-embedded in 57% of European pathology laboratories, whereas the rest of the laboratories embed multiple (2–6) biopsies per one paraffin block. Differences in the processing method can have a far-reaching effect because reporting of the Gleason score (GS) is different for individually embedded and pooled biopsies, and GS is one of the most important factors when selecting treatment for patients.

- **Methods**: The study material consisted of needle biopsies from 236 prostate cancer patients that were endocrine-treated in 1999–2003. Biopsies from the left side and right side were embedded separately. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides were scanned and analyzed on web-based virtual microscopy. Worst and overall Gleason scores were assessed according to the modified Gleason score schema after analyzing each biopsy separately. The compound Gleason scores (CGS) were obtained from the original pathology reports. Two different grade groupings were used: GS 6 or less vs. 7 vs. 8 or above; and GS 7(3 + 4) or less vs. 7(4 + 3) and 8 vs. 9–10. The prognostic ability of the three scoring methods to predict biochemical progression was compared with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.

- **Results**: The median follow-up time of the patients was 64.5 months (range 0–1).

### Gleason 6 prostate cancer: Translating biology into population health [^114qGH2o]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Gleason 6 (3+3) is the most commonly diagnosed prostate cancer among men with prostate-specific antigen screening. It is the most histologically well-differentiated and is associated with the most favorable prognosis. Despite its prevalence, considerable debate exists regarding its genetic features, clinical significance, natural history, metastatic potential, and optimal management.

- **Materials and methods**: Members of the Young Urologic Oncologists in the Society of Urologic Oncology conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed English medical literature on Gleason 6 prostate cancer. They specifically focused on the history of the Gleason scoring system, histological features, clinical characteristics, practice patterns, and outcomes.

- **Results**: The Gleason scoring system was devised in the early 1960s, widely adopted by 1987, and revised in 2005 with a more restrictive definition of Gleason 6 disease. There is near consensus that Gleason 6 meets pathological definitions of cancer, but controversy exists about whether it meets commonly accepted molecular and genetic criteria of cancer. Multiple clinical series suggest that the metastatic potential of contemporary Gleason 6 disease is negligible but not zero. Population-based studies in the U.S. suggest that more than 90% of men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer undergo treatment and are exposed to the risk of morbidity for a cancer unlikely to cause symptoms or decrease life expectancy. Efforts have been proposed to minimize the number of men diagnosed with or treated for Gleason 6 prostate cancer.

### Is there a difference in outcome after radical prostatectomy between patients with biopsy Gleason sums 4, 5, and 6? Results from the SEARCH database [^113Dc7Ld]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Fewer patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer today have biopsy Gleason sums < 6 compared to several years ago. Several tables and nomograms for predicting disease recurrence after definitive therapy provide little or no discrimination between biopsy Gleason sums 4, 5, and 6. We sought to examine the significance of biopsy Gleason sum for predicting biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy (RP) for men with biopsy Gleason sums of 4, 5, and 6.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined data from 988 men treated with RP between 1988 and 2002 who had biopsy Gleason sums of 4–6. Clinical and pathological variables, as well as outcome information, were compared between men with biopsy Gleason sums of 4–6. The log-rank and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to determine whether biopsy Gleason sum provided unique prognostic information for men with low biopsy Gleason sums undergoing RP.

- **Results**: There was a statistically significant, but overall weak, correlation between biopsy Gleason sum and Gleason sum of the RP specimen (Spearman's r = 0.277, P < 0.001). As the biopsy Gleason sum increased from 4 to 5 to 6, there was a steady rise (HR = 1.31 for each one-point increase in Gleason sum, Cox's model) in the risk of PSA failure (P = 0.025, log-rank). On multivariate analysis comparing biopsy Gleason sum, preoperative PSA, clinical stage, year of surgery, percent of biopsy cores positive, and age for their ability to predict time to biochemical recurrence, only PSA (HR 2.09, CI 1.56–2.80, P < 0.001) and biopsy Gleason sum (HR 1.33, CI 1.05–1.70, P = 0.019) were significant.

### Prostate cancer growth patterns beyond the Gleason score: entering a new era of comprehensive tumour grading [^115Bav9T]. Histopathology (2020). Low credibility.

The grading of IDC intermixed with invasive carcinoma has been controversial. Whereas the 2014 ISUP meeting did not make a recommendation on this issue, in 2016 the WHO stated that it should not be factored into grading. A consequence of the WHO recommendation is that basal cell immunohistochemistry should be performed in every case in which IDC cannot be distinguished from invasive disease and classification as either IDC or invasive carcinoma will alter the final Gleason score. Apart from additional turnaround time and costs, basal cell immunohistochemistry does not distinguish between IDC and invasive cribriform or solid carcinoma in every case. It is well known that foci of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia can lack basal cells, probably because of sampling artefact; as IDC glands are, by definition, distended, the chance of a false-negative basal cell immunohistochemical result is likely to be even larger, resulting in erroneous classification as an invasive cribriform pattern.

On the other hand, large irregular cribriform tumour fields substantially exceeding the pre-existing gland architecture and thus clearly invasive may have occasional basal cells, as has also been reported on rare occasions for low-grade invasive adenocarcinoma. As IDC is an adverse pathological parameter, and difficult or even impossible to distinguish from invasive carcinoma even with the use of basal cell immunohistochemistry, it was recommended at the latest 2019 ISUP consensus meeting that IDC intermixed with invasive carcinoma should be assigned a Gleason grade based on…

### Overall and worst Gleason scores are equally good predictors of prostate cancer progression [^116L8g6e]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

The median age of the patients was 73.8 years, with a range from 52.7 to 88.8 years. The median PSA at the time of diagnosis was 15.7 ng/ml, ranging from 2.4 to 10750.0 ng/ml. The median follow-up time was 64.5 months, ranging from 0 to 118 months. The distribution of the number of biopsy cores per side is as follows:

- **Distribution of needle biopsy cores**: The average number of cores per lobe was 4.5, with a median of 4 and a range from 1 to 9.

The differences in progression-free survival between different treatment forms were not assessed. Patients were not randomized, and there was bias since LHRH analogues were used in 72.5% of cases.

### Low Gleason score prostatic adenocarcinomas are no longer viable entities [^116hCywR]. Histopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Gleason scoring is the most powerful predictor of the behavior of prostatic adenocarcinoma. It was devised more than 30 years ago and is used by pathologists worldwide. However, advances in immunochemistry and the understanding of the biological potential of some tumors have made the diagnosis of tumors of grades 1 and 2, and hence low score (2–4), a rarity. It is suggested that Gleason score 2 (1 + 1) tumors, if they do exist, are so rare and so benign that they are a redundant entity and should not be identified as a malignancy. Similar problems revolve around the diagnosis of Gleason score 4 (2 + 2) tumors, and the criteria for their diagnosis are difficult to evaluate and revolve around reference to the score 2 (1 + 1) lesion.

The continued presence of low-grade tumors in the Gleason grading system leads to diagnostic confusion, potential error, and, more importantly, confusion for patients diagnosed with score 6 (3 + 3) tumors. I suggest that Gleason grade 1 (and therefore scores of 2 and 3) should be removed from the Gleason grading system. Gleason grade 2 (and therefore scores of 4 and 5) tumors require serious re-evaluation if they are to remain clinically useful diagnoses.

### Low-risk prostate lesions: An evidence review to inform discussion on losing the "cancer" label [^1163u83h]. The Prostate (2023). High credibility.

The reproducibility of the histopathological diagnosis of Gleason score 6 prostate lesions was examined in multiple studies. We screened the titles and abstracts of 235 articles identified through our database searches, along with an additional two articles identified in the reference list of an included article. This resulted in 120 full texts to screen, of which 112 were excluded (details are in the supporting information). We included eight studies in our narrative synthesis.

- **Reproducibility studies**: One study was rated at low risk of bias, and seven studies were rated at moderate risk of bias. The cross-sectional reproducibility study by Bulten et al. (published in 2020) was rated at low risk of bias. This study circulated a set of 100 prostate biopsies to 13 pathologists and two pathologists-in-training from 14 independent laboratories across 10 countries. Reference diagnoses were set by consensus between three expert uropathologists. Using diagnostic categories of GG 1−5, this study demonstrated a median interrater agreement with the consensus diagnoses (quadratic ϰ: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.73−0.87). In this study, a deep learning system performed at least as well as the participating pathologists (quadratic ϰ: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78−0.91).

### Predicting Gleason sum upgrading from biopsy to radical prostatectomy pathology: A new nomogram and its internal validation [^112zjZZE]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Univariate analysis revealed that PSA, PSAD, GPC, cT-stage, and PI-RADS score were predictors of GSU (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that PSA, GPC, cT-stage, and PI-RADS score were independent predictors of GSU (all P < 0.05). Additionally, regression analysis found no significant factors for downgrading. The nomogram was constructed based on four predictors of multivariable analysis. The AUC values for GPC, PSA, PI-RADS score, and cT-stage were 0.636, 0.589, 0.642, and 0.579, respectively. The AUC of the GSU model was 0.735, indicating good discrimination performance.

### Moving beyond Gleason scoring [^112UA4fC]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The combination of grading and staging is the basis of standard care for prediction of most cancers. D. F. Gleason created the prostate cancer (PCa) grading system, which has been modified several times. Molecular data have been added, and currently, all grading systems are cancer-cell based.

- **Objective**: To review the literature available on host response measures, such as reactive stroma grading and stromogenic carcinoma, and their predictive ability for PCa biochemical recurrence and PCa-specific death.

- **Data sources**: Our own experience has shown that reactive stroma grading and the subsequently binarized system (stromogenic carcinoma) can independently predict biochemical recurrence and/or PCa-specific death, particularly in patients with a Gleason score of 6 or 7. Stromogenic carcinoma has been validated by four other independent groups on at least three continents.

- **Conclusions**: Broders grading and Dukes staging have been combined to form the most powerful prognostic tools in standard care. The time has come for us to incorporate measures of host response (stromogenic carcinoma) into the arsenal of elements we use to predict cancer survival without abandoning what we know works. These data also suggest that our definition of PCa might need some revision.

### Standardization of Gleason grading among 337 European pathologists [^116pwPjq]. Histopathology (2013). Low credibility.

The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) modification of Gleason grading recommended that the highest grade should always be included in the Gleason score (GS) in prostate biopsies. We analyzed the impact of this recommendation on reporting of GS 6 versus 7.

- **Methods and results**: Fifteen expert uropathologists reached two-thirds consensus on 15 prostate biopsies with GS 6–7 cancer. Eighty-five microphotographs were graded by 337 of 617 members of the European Network of Uropathology (ENUP), representing 19 countries. There was agreement between expert and majority member GS in 12 of 15 cases, while members upgraded in three cases. Among members and the expert consensus, a GS > 6 was assigned by 64.5% and 60%, respectively. Mean member GS was higher than consensus GS in nine of 15 cases. A Gleason pattern (GP) 5 was reported by 0.3–5.6% in 10 cases. Agreement between consensus and member GS was 58.2–89.3% (mean 71.4%) in GS 6 cases and 46.3–63.8% (mean 56.4%) in GS 7 cases (P = 0.009).

- **Conclusions**: While undergrading of prostate cancer used to be prevalent, some now tend to overgrade. Minimum diagnostic criteria for GP 4 and 5 in biopsies need to be better defined. Image libraries reviewed by experts may be useful for standardization.

### Should the Gleason grading system for prostate cancer be modified to account for high-grade tertiary components? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Xtyvj]. The Lancet Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The Gleason system for grading prostate cancer assigns a score based on the most prevalent and second most prevalent grades. Several studies have investigated the clinical significance of a tertiary grade in radical prostatectomy samples. A systematic search of the published work identified seven studies that reported the prognostic value of a tertiary Gleason grade. Three studies correlated the presence of a tertiary grade with pathological stage, and six with prostate-specific antigen recurrence or clinical progression.

In the small number of studies available, the frequency of a tertiary grade was consistently higher in samples characterized by pathological variables associated with poor outcomes, such as extra-prostatic extension and positive surgical margins, but not lymph-node metastases.

In five studies, the presence of a tertiary grade increased the risk of prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy by a factor of 2.5. However, modification of the Gleason score to include a tertiary grade in Gleason 4+3 tumors might overestimate the risk of seminal-vesicle or lymph-node invasion. This systematic review has established the association of a tertiary grade with poorer outcomes than those associated with no tertiary grade.

A tertiary grade should, therefore, be included in the pathological reporting of prostate cancer and be considered in the interpretation and design of clinical trials. However, all studies assessed for this review were retrospective, potentially affected by selection bias, and based on radical prostatectomy samples or transurethral resection.

### Prognostic factors for survival of patients with pathological Gleason score 7 prostate cancer: Differences in outcome between primary Gleason grades 3 and 4 [^112qmy3E]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

We evaluated differences in clinical and pathological outcomes between Gleason 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 prostate cancer. The radical prostatectomy whole-mounted specimens from 263 men with pathological Gleason 7 tumors were identified. Gleason 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 tumors were compared regarding pathological variables and outcomes. The significance of clinical and pathological data on progression-free survival was analyzed.

Of the tumors, 34% had a primary Gleason grade of 4 and were more likely than those with primary grade 3 to have seminal vesicle involvement (34% versus 18%, p = 0.006), a higher pathological stage (pT3 55% versus 42%, N+ 13% versus 3%) (p = 0.001), extraprostatic extension (58% versus 38%) (p = 0.001), and higher median preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (13.5 versus 9.0 ng/ml, respectively, p < 0.001). Mean follow-up plus or minus standard deviation was 6.8 ± 1.9 years. The overall 10-year crude, cancer-specific, and progression-free survival rates were 83%, 99%, and 58%, respectively.

Primary Gleason grade was significantly associated with progression-free survival (risk ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.5, p = 0.02), but not with crude and cancer-specific survival. Univariately, primary Gleason grade 4 was associated with progression-free survival, as were percent Gleason 4, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, pT stage, margin status, DNA ploidy, preoperative PSA, cancer volume, and the extent of extraprostatic extension. Multivariately, only preoperative PSA (p < 0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (p < 0.001), and DNA ploidy were significant factors.

### The percentage of high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma in prostate biopsies significantly improves on grade groups in the prediction of prostate cancer death [^116PB8Gj]. Histopathology (2019). Low credibility.

It has been recommended that the percentage of high-grade (HG) Gleason patterns 4 and 5 should be quantified in prostate cancer. However, this has not been assessed in a cohort using prostate cancer death as an outcome, and there is debate as to whether the biopsy with the 'worst' percentage of HG disease or an 'overall' percentage of HG disease should be reported. Such data may assist in active surveillance decisions.

- **Methods and results**: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer diagnosed by needle biopsy from 1990 to 2003 were included. The endpoint was prostate cancer death. Clinical variables included Gleason score (GS), prostate-specific antigen level, age, clinical stage, and disease extent. Deaths were divided into those from prostate cancer and those from other causes, according to World Health Organization criteria. Nine hundred and eighty-eight biopsy cases were centrally reviewed according to criteria agreed at the Chicago International Society of Urological Pathology conference in 2014. Cores were given individual GSs and Grade Groups (GGs), and a percentage of each grade was given for each core. Both the worst percentage of HG disease seen in a biopsy series and overall percentage of HG disease were calculated. The overall percentage of HG disease was highly significant, with a hazard ratio of 4.45 for the interquartile range (95% confidence interval 3.30–6.01, P < 2.2 × 10^−16), and was similar to the percentage of HG disease seen in the worst core. In multivariate analysis, both were highly significant. GG2 cases with ≤ 5% Gleason pattern 4 showed

### Do Gleason patterns 3 and 4 prostate cancer represent separate disease states [^111HdGN7]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

The Gleason scoring system has been the traditional basis for studies on the assessment and treatment of prostate cancer. Recent reports of long-term prostate cancer outcomes stratified by Gleason score, based on the 2005 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) update, suggest that important aspects of the biology of prostate cancer correlate with commonly available histopathological information. In this review, we present a conceptual framework for the possible existence of distinct but interrelated developmental pathways in the context of the Gleason score, considering various biological and clinical aspects of prostate cancer. This may be useful in characterizing prostate cancer as an indolent condition in some, and an aggressive disease in others, aiding in decision-making for treatment and in the interpretation of the biological course and treatment outcomes.

A comprehensive review of clinical, pathological, and investigational biological literature on this topic was conducted. Additionally, the biological behavior of prostate cancer, as interpreted from this survey, was compared to that of other solid neoplasms in developing a schema for characterizing the pathogenesis of various forms of the disease.

The Gleason scoring system has been found to have fundamental value in predicting the behavior of prostate cancer and assessing treatment outcomes. Increasingly, the proportion of Gleason pattern 4 in a prostatectomy specimen is recognized as a critical factor in predicting the rates of biochemical recurrence.

### Grading of prostate cancer: a work in progress [^111dWtuf]. Histopathology (2019). Low credibility.

A lowest Gleason score of 6 was perceived as an anomaly, increasing unnecessary anxiety for men diagnosed with this low-risk prostate cancer who were now offered deferred treatment. By 2000, Gleason patterns 1 and 2, typical of low-grade transition zone carcinomas as encountered in transurethral resections, were hardly reported anymore in biopsies. Berney suggested in 2007 that the lower scores should be removed from the Gleason system. Several groups noted that the proportion of high-grade cancer might be more prognostic than the Gleason score per se. Subsequently, Stark et al. demonstrated convincingly that separating Gleason score 7 into two subsets, those with a predominant grade 3 component, i.e. 7 (3 + 4), and those with a predominant grade 4 component, i.e. 7 (4 + 3), strongly improved its prognostic impact. Over time, various combinations of Gleason score condensations were shown to be instrumental in the prediction of disease.

In 2013, Epstein and Partin updated their pathological staging nomogram with tumors grouped as per Gleason scores 6, 7 (3 + 4), 7 (4 + 3), 8, and 9–10. This five-tier 'prognostic grade grouping' was subsequently endorsed by the ISUP in 2014 and recommended by the WHO and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) system. Gleason scores ≤ 6 were compressed into ISUP grade (group) 1, and Gleason scores 9–10 into ISUP grade (group) 5, whereas Gleason score 7 was expanded to ISUP grade (group) 2, i.e. 7 (3 + 4), and ISUP grade (group) 3, i.e. 7 (4 + 3).

### The impact of the 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) consensus on Gleason grading in contemporary practice [^117JmZ7L]. Histopathology (2009). Low credibility.

To investigate the impact of the 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Gleason grading consensus in contemporary practice, we compared Gleason scores (GS) in two consecutive patient cohorts with matched biopsies and prostatectomies. The cohorts included:

- (i) 908 patients evaluated before the ISUP consensus (July 2000-June 2004)
- (ii) 423 patients evaluated after the ISUP consensus (October 2005-June 2007).

All biopsies and prostatectomies were performed and scored at one institution, where they were consistently sampled and processed. After the ISUP consensus, there was a higher percentage of biopsy and prostatectomy specimens with GS ≥ 7. Specifically, GS ≥ 7 was found in 32% of biopsies before the ISUP compared to 46% after, and in 53% of prostatectomies before the ISUP compared to 68% after (P-value not specified).

The findings suggest a shift towards higher GS on biopsy and prostatectomy in our practice following the ISUP consensus. However, there was no significant impact on the biopsy-prostatectomy Gleason agreement. The significance of this shift for patient management and prognosis remains uncertain.

### Screening for prostate cancer: Evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^113QHBKX]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Use of MRI and lesion-targeting biopsies substantially reduces the detection of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer and somewhat increases the detection of Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer compared with a systematic prostate biopsy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 5,831 patients from 26 clinical practice studies compared MRI and lesion-targeting biopsies with systematic biopsies and showed a relative detection rate of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.77) for Gleason score 6 and 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4) for Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer.

Recently, data from screening settings have also been reported. The population-based Stockholm-3-MRI study randomly allocated 1,532 men aged 50–75 years with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL to either a systematic biopsy only or an MRI and targeted plus systematic biopsies. Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer detection was similar in both groups. Gleason score 6 cancer was detected in 4% of the MRI group and 12% of the systematic biopsy group (8% difference, 95% CI 5% to 11%). Fifty-six percent of the men with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL had an unsuspicious MRI and avoided biopsy. Results from the Gothenburg-2 trial are reported below.

MRI has also been evaluated as the primary screening test. The IP-Prostagram study screened 403 men aged 50–69 years with PSA, transrectal ultrasound, and an MRI. All men with at least one positive screening test had a systematic biopsy; men with an MRI or ultrasound lesion also had a targeted biopsy. The diagnostic pathway with an MRI threshold of ≥ 4 on the 5-tier Prostate Imaging — Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score resulted in 10.6% positive.

### Outcome of Gleason 3 + 5 = 8 prostate cancer diagnosed on needle biopsy: Prognostic comparison with Gleason 4 + 4 = 8 [^111h6obE]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The International Society for Urologic Pathology (ISUP) and World Health Organization (WHO) have adopted prognostic grade groups 1 to 5 to simplify prostate cancer grading for prognosis. Grade group 4 encompasses Gleason score 8 cancer, which is heterogeneous, including Gleason scores 4 + 4 = 8, 3 + 5 = 8, and 5 + 3 = 8. The comparative prognostic implications of these various Gleason scores have not been adequately studied by urological pathologists following a re-review of slides.

Patients with a highest biopsy Gleason score of 3 + 5 = 8 or 4 + 4 = 8 were included in the study. Controls were cases with a highest Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 or 9–10. A total of 423 prostatic biopsy cases accessioned from 2005 to 2013 at 2 institutions were reviewed; clinicopathological findings and follow-up (median 33.4 months) were assessed.

Among Gleason score 8 cancers, the cancer status outcome in 51 men with Gleason score 3 + 5 = 8 was marginally worse than in 114 with Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 (p = 0.04). This was driven by a persistent nonmetastatic (after radiation/hormone therapy) cancer rate of 37% among Gleason score 3 + 5 = 8 cases versus 24% among Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 cases. Conversely, cancer-specific survival at 36-month follow-up was 97.8% in 3 + 5 cases versus 92.6% in 4 + 4 cases, but this was not significant (p = 0.089). Cancer-specific survival in the Gleason score 8 group was dichotomized by the presence of cribriform growth (p = 0.018). All Gleason score categories did not differ in the fraction of biopsy cores positive, clinical presentation, or pathological findings.

### A contemporary prostate cancer grading system: A validated alternative to the Gleason score [^114thmua]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite revisions in 2005 and 2014, the Gleason prostate cancer (PCa) grading system still has major deficiencies. Combining Gleason scores into a three-tiered grouping (6, 7, 8–10) is used most frequently for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The lowest score, assigned 6, may be misunderstood as a cancer in the middle of the grading scale, and 3+4 = 7 and 4+3 = 7 are often considered the same prognostic group.

- **Objective**: To verify that a new grading system accurately produces a smaller number of grades with the most significant prognostic differences, using multi-institutional and multimodal therapy data.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Between 2005 and 2014, 20,845 consecutive men were treated by radical prostatectomy at five academic institutions; 5,501 men were treated with radiotherapy at two academic institutions.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Outcome was based on biochemical recurrence (BCR). The log-rank test assessed univariable differences in BCR by Gleason score. Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores.

- **Results and limitations**: In the surgery cohort, we found large differences in recurrence rates between both Gleason 3+4 versus 4+3 and Gleason 8 versus 9. The hazard ratios relative to Gleason score 6 were 1.9, 5.1, 8.0, and 11.7 for Gleason scores 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9–10, respectively. These differences were attenuated in the radiotherapy cohort as a whole due to increased adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormones for patients with high-grade disease.

### Using the percentage of biopsy cores positive for cancer, pretreatment PSA, and highest biopsy Gleason sum to predict pathologic stage after radical prostatectomy: the Center for Prostate Disease Research nomograms [^113r55cp]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

To develop probability nomograms to predict pathologic outcome at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP) on the basis of established prognostic factors and prostate biopsy quantitative histology, researchers used information from the database of the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on 1510 men who had undergone transrectal ultrasound and biopsy for diagnosis and had radical prostatectomy as primary therapy. The variables considered included age, race, clinical stage, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason sum, and the percentage of biopsy cores positive for cancer (total number of cores positive for cancer divided by the total number of cores obtained). The percentages of biopsy cores positive were grouped as less than 30%, 30% to 59%, and greater than or equal to 60%. The three most significant variables were used to develop probability nomograms for pathologic stage.

PSA, biopsy Gleason sum, and percentage of cores positive were identified as the three most significant independent predictors of pathologic stage. The assigned percentage of biopsy core-positive subgroups, along with pretreatment PSA and highest Gleason sum, were utilized to develop probability nomograms for pathologic stage.

In conclusion, pretreatment PSA, highest biopsy Gleason sum, and the percentage of cores positive for cancer are the most significant predictors for pathologic stage after radical prostatectomy. Based on these findings, CPDR probability nomograms were developed to predict pathologic outcomes at the time of RP.

### Application of a prognostic Gleason grade grouping system to assess distant prostate cancer outcomes [^117AXCnb]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

There is growing enthusiasm for the adoption of a novel grade grouping system to better represent Gleason scores.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the ability of prognostic Gleason grade groups to predict prostate cancer (PCa)-specific mortality (PCSM) and bone metastatic progression.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We identified patients with PCa enrolled in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry across treatment strategies, including conservative and nondefinitive therapy.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: We examined the prognostic ability of Gleason grade groups to predict risk of PCSM and bone metastasis using the Kaplan-Meier method and unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.

- **Results and limitations**: We identified 10,529 men with PCa followed for a median of 81 months (interquartile range 40–127), including 64% in group I (< 3 + 4); 17% in group II (3 + 4); 9% in group III (4 + 3); 6% in group IV (4 + 4); and 4% in group V (≥ 4 + 5). Relative to grade group I, the unadjusted risks of PCSM and bone metastasis were significantly associated with prognostic grade groupings for both biopsy and prostatectomy samples (all p < 0.01). Pairwise comparisons within Gleason sums collapsed within grade group V were not significant; however, this analysis was limited by a small representation of men with Gleason pattern ≥ 4 + 5.

- **Conclusions**: The prognostic grade grouping system is associated with the risk of PCSM and metastasis across management strategies, including definitive therapy and conservative management.

### The percentage of high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma in prostate biopsies significantly improves on grade groups in the prediction of prostate cancer death [^111mXJEz]. Histopathology (2019). Low credibility.

Gleason grading of prostate cancer has been established for over 40 years. Although the basic grading categories have remained unchanged during this time, there have been numerous changes in the methodologies used to determine the Gleason score (GS) of prostate cancer over that period. At the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Chicago conference, the concept of Grade Groups (GGs) was accepted by a broad range of clinicians and pathologists, stratifying Gleason patterns into five separate prognostic GGs. These groupings have been validated in large radical prostatectomy cohorts, in biopsy-based cohorts treated with radiation, and also in a cohort of conservatively treated prostate cancers.

However, at this meeting, there was also a consultation on the reporting of the percentage of high-grade (HG) disease and the assignment of a GG. The reporting of HG disease was first suggested over 20 years ago, and a number of other articles have suggested that it is of clinical use in predicting biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy or in predicting prostate cancer death after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Recently, an exceptionally large cohort of 12,823 consecutive patients and 2,971 matched preoperative biopsies was used to validate the importance of assigning the percentage of Gleason pattern 4 and 5 with biochemical relapse. This has been validated in a number of other studies, and it has been suggested, for instance, that the percentage of grade 4 may be used to determine criteria for active surveillance.

### Decipher identifies men with otherwise clinically favorable-intermediate risk disease who may not be good candidates for active surveillance [^112623iz]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Men diagnosed with what has classically been termed "intermediate-risk" prostate cancer (PCa) — based on Gleason score 7, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10−20 ng/mL, and clinical stage T2b or 2c disease — have highly variable clinical behavior and prognosis and are considered a broad, heterogeneous cohort for whom management recommendations cannot be standardized. The literature provides strong evidence that not all Gleason sums of 7 have equal potential for progression. Men with a post radical prostatectomy (RP) Gleason 4 + 3 are more likely to develop metastasis and die from PCa than patients with a Gleason 3 + 4, and outcomes may vary further based on the quantified predominance of pattern 4 disease. As a consequence, contemporary Gleason grading has explicitly assigned score 4 + 3 to a higher grade group (grade group 3, GG3) than Gleason 3 + 4 (GG2) to address these levels of risk. Clinical T staging, meanwhile, has been shown frequently inaccurate, and less important than better markers of tumor volume, such as extent of biopsy core involvement.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now separates men with intermediate-risk PCa into favorable and unfavorable subgroups in their guidelines. Favorable-intermediate risk (F-IR) tumors are defined as GG1 or 2 tumors and no more than one NCCN intermediate-risk factor (PSA 10−20 ng/mL, cT2b/c, or GG2) and percentage of positive biopsy cores < 50%. The latter parameter was an arbitrary addition that makes clinical sense but has never been validated to be an optimal threshold, and in fact no other NCCN stratification exists for this measure.

### How accurately does prostate biopsy Gleason score predict pathologic findings and disease free survival [^1156nYde]. The Prostate (2001). Low credibility.

Due to the significant impact on prognosis by subgrouping of prostatectomy Gleason scores 7, we undertook this study to determine whether the biopsy Gleason score was as predictive of disease-free survival and to assess the correlation with the prostatectomy Gleason score in a modern prostatectomy series.

- **Methods**: An analysis of 1,031 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer was performed. All data were prospectively collected. The Gleason score was categorized into three different groups for biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. Disease-free survival was analyzed for each group, and discrepancies between scores and outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: Accurate correlation was noted in 54.8%, 66.8%, and 47.4% of Gleason scores, respectively. Overall accuracy was 58.3%. Both biopsy and prostatectomy Gleason scores correlated significantly with disease-free survival (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the classification of Gleason scores was highly significant (P = 0.001). Patients with prostatectomy Gleason scores less than 7 had better disease-free survival than those with prostatectomy Gleason scores greater than 7 (P = 0.02). The overall disease-free survival was similar among the patients with a Gleason score of 7 (P = 0.12).

- **Conclusions**: It appears that the biopsy Gleason score, although oftentimes not strongly correlating with the prostatectomy Gleason score, is an important prognostic indicator.

### Time trends in Gleason score distribution among Gleason score 8 and 9–10 cancers [^115NAezB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). High credibility.

Reporting of prostate cancer grades has shifted towards higher reported grades over the past decades. In prostate cancers diagnosed from needle biopsy in 172,112 men reported to the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden between 2000 and 2020, we noted a grade shift among high-grade cancers. We applied multinomial logistic regression to assess time trends.

- **ISUP grade 4 cancers**: Gleason score 3+5 increased from 8% in 2000 to 22% in 2020, while Gleason score 4+4 decreased from 88% to 77%.

- **ISUP grade 5 cancers**: Gleason scores 4+5 and 5+4 increased from 85% to 93%, while Gleason score 5+5 decreased from 15% to 7%.

This may be explained by a reluctance to assign Gleason scores composed of a uniform grade, following recommendations to include minimal components of higher grade in the scores. These changes are obscured by merging Gleason scores into ISUP grades.

### Gleason grade progression is uncommon [^113yavSh]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Gleason grade is universally used for the pathological scoring of the differentiation of prostate cancer. However, it is unknown whether prostate tumors initially arise well-differentiated and then progress to less differentiated forms, or if the Gleason grade is an early and largely unchanging feature. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has reduced the proportion of tumors diagnosed at an advanced stage, allowing assessment of this question on a population level. If Gleason grade progresses as stage does, one would expect a similar reduction in high-grade tumors.

This study examined 1,207 Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study participants diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982 to 2004 and treated with prostatectomy. It compared the distribution of grade and clinical stage across the pre-PSA and PSA screening eras, re-reviewing grade using the ISUP 2005 revised criteria. The proportion of advanced-stage tumors dropped more than six-fold, from the earliest period (12/1982–1/1993), with 19.9% stage ≥ T3, to the latest period (5/2000–12/2004), with 3% stage T3, and none at stage T4. The proportion of Gleason score ≥ 8 decreased substantially less, from 25.3% to 17.6%.

A significant interaction between stage and diagnosis date predicting grade (P = 0.04) suggests that the relationship between grade and stage varies by time period. As the dramatic shift in stage since the introduction of PSA screening was accompanied by a more modest shift in Gleason grade, these findings suggest that grade may be established early in tumor pathogenesis. This has implications for the understanding of tumor progression.

### Overall and worst Gleason scores are equally good predictors of prostate cancer progression [^114JN6ig]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Our earlier study analyzing biopsies from endocrine-treated patients indicated that the overall Gleason score (OGS) was the strongest independent prognosticator of all histopathological parameters. Gleason score assessment according to ISUP 2005, using the most aggressive pattern as a secondary Gleason grade even when it is present in only a small area, yielded the best prognostic classification using groupings < 7(4 + 3), 7(4 + 3)-8, and 9–10. In the present study, we examined whether the worst Gleason score (WGS) in a single biopsy core would improve prognostic accuracy when compared with OGS. We also evaluated the prognostic value of the compound Gleason score from the original pathology reports before the ISUP 2005 era.

### Does the tertiary Gleason pattern influence the PSA progression-free interval after retropubic radical prostatectomy for organ-confined prostate cancer [^112FyP4o]. European Urology (2005). Low credibility.

The Gleason sum is an important prognostic parameter for patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. However, frequently more than two predominant Gleason patterns are present in one specimen. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tertiary Gleason patterns in radical prostatectomy specimens.

Between 1994 and 2001, 277 patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for clinically localized prostate cancer in our institute. We collected information on Gleason score and cancer volume (CV) for all tumor localizations, clinical and pathological stage, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and extra capsular extension (ECE). In cases where one pattern was seen in more than 95% of the tumor, this pattern was used for both the primary and secondary Gleason patterns, and any other pattern (actually the secondary pattern) was called tertiary. Charts were examined retrospectively for clinical follow-up. PSA progression was defined as two subsequent rising PSA measurements above 0.10 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier time to PSA progression was compared between patients with and without a tertiary pattern.

Overall, of the 223 patients, 106 (48%) were found to have a tertiary pattern, which on average comprised 7% of the total tumor volume. Patients with a tertiary pattern had a 5-year risk of PSA progression of 37.3% versus 12.6% in cases where no tertiary Gleason pattern was present (log-rank p = 0.0002). There was no prognostic difference between patients with a higher-grade tertiary pattern compared to those without one.

### Will active surveillance for clinically localized prostate cancer survive in the era of individualized medicine [^116LycCX]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The challenge for the next few years will be to individualize prostate cancer treatment and to determine whether a cancer will be lethal based on molecular characteristics at the time of diagnosis. In this view, the need for active treatment would represent a failure of any conservative approach.

### Gleason score and lethal prostate cancer: Does 3 + 4 = 4 + 3 [^117CeFRK]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Gleason grading is an important predictor of prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes. Studies using surrogate PCa endpoints suggest outcomes for Gleason score (GS) 7 cancers vary according to the predominance of pattern 4. These studies have influenced clinical practice, but it is unclear if rates of PCa mortality differ for 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 tumors. Using PCa mortality as the primary endpoint, we compared outcomes in Gleason 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 cancers, and the predictive ability of GS from a standardized review versus original scoring.

Patients and methods involved three study pathologists conducting a blinded standardized review of 693 prostatectomy and 119 biopsy specimens to assign primary and secondary Gleason patterns. Tumor specimens were from PCa patients diagnosed between 1984 and 2004 from the Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Lethal PCa (n = 53) was defined as the development of bony metastases or PCa death. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated according to original GS and standardized GS. We compared the discrimination of standardized and original grading with C-statistics from models of 10-year survival.

For prostatectomy specimens, 4 + 3 cancers were associated with a three-fold increase in lethal PCa compared with 3 + 4 cancers (95% CI, 1.1 to 8.6). The discrimination of models of standardized scores from prostatectomy (C-statistic, 0.86) and biopsy (C-statistic, 0.85) were improved compared to models of original scores (prostatectomy C-statistic, 0.82; biopsy C-statistic, 0.72).

Conclusion: Ignoring the predominance of Gleason pattern 4 in prostate tumors significantly impacts the prediction of lethal PCa outcomes.

### The effect of limited (tertiary) Gleason pattern 5 on the new prostate cancer grade groups [^116Ln4RT]. Human Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

The risk of recurrence for prostatic adenocarcinoma after prostatectomy, as detected by prostate-specific antigen or other modalities, is based primarily on Gleason score along with pathologic tumor stage and surgical margin status. Recent large multi-institutional data spanning the last decade have supported modification of risk of recurrence stratification based on grade groups: grade group 1 (3+3 = 6), grade group 2 (3+4 = 7), grade group 3 (4+3 = 7), grade group 4 (4+4 = 8), and grade group 5 (Gleason scores 9 and 10).

This study examines, using currently accepted grading definitions of grade patterns and grading rules, how the introduction of a limited, less than 5%, Gleason pattern 5 component at prostatectomy affects prognosis and fits into the grade group schema and reporting. The aggregate data from two independent major academic medical centers comprising 7,606 patient records were analyzed with respect to biochemical recurrence-free survival.

- **Limited Gleason pattern in grade group 2 and 3**: The presence of a limited (tertiary) Gleason pattern 5 component in the context of Gleason scores 3+4 = 7 (grade group 2) and 4+3 = 7 (grade group 3) imparts an intermediate prognosis relative to the next highest grade group. We suggest that an additional comment and designation to the grade groups be provided, reflecting the increased risk of recurrence in such cases (such as grade group 2+ or 3+).

- **Limited Gleason pattern in grade group 4**: In contrast, the presence of limited (< 5%) Gleason pattern 5 in the context of Gleason score 4+4 = 8 imparts a poor prognosis equivalent to grade group 5 and therefore should be reported as grade group 5.

### Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: Implications for patient care [^111quf6Y]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The Gleason grading system is one of the most powerful predictors of outcome in prostate cancer and a cornerstone in counseling and treating patients. Since its inception, it has undergone several modifications triggered by a change in clinical practice and a better understanding of the cancer's histologic spectrum and variants, and their prognostic significance.

- **Objective**: To provide an overview of the implementation and the impact of the Gleason system as a predictive and prognostic tool in all available treatment modalities, and to compare the original and modified Gleason systems in major pathologic and clinical outcome data sets.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A comprehensive nonsystematic Medline search was performed using multiple Medical Subject Headings such as Gleason, modified, system, outcome, biopsy, prostatectomy, recurrence, prognosis, radiotherapy, and focal therapy, with restriction to the English language and a preference for publications within the last 10 years. All Gleason grade-related studies in the last three years were reviewed. For studies before this date, we relied on prior literature culling for various recent books, chapters, and original articles on this topic.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Using the modified grading system resulted in disease upgrading with more cancers assigned a Gleason score ≥ 7 than in the past. It also resulted in a more homogeneous Gleason score 6, which has an excellent prognosis when the disease is organ-confined. The vast majority of studies using both systems showed that Gleason grading of adenocarcinomas on needle biopsies…

### Stromal and epithelial transcriptional map of initiation progression and metastatic potential of human prostate cancer [^113vdHua]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

We successfully validated the association of the stromal Gleason signature with the Gleason score in TCGA data. Not surprisingly, the signature was more strongly associated with Gleason in tumors with lower purity that have a higher percentage of stromal tissue. The signature was also significantly associated with lethal disease in expression data from the Mayo Clinic cohort, although its prognostic power is likely to be suboptimal in this patient data set because the Mayo Clinic data was designed to be enriched for the epithelium. As the analysis of TCGA data suggests, we expect to observe stronger performance of the signature for prostate cancer prognosis in the stroma enriched specimens. A recently published study that utilized patient-derived xenograft models to develop a stromal signature of metastatic potential corroborates our findings that gene expression in stroma is predictive of prostate cancer outcome.

Interestingly, this Gleason signature was also borderline significantly different in stroma from benign areas of the prostates with high-grade and low-grade tumors. Additionally, when examining all gene expression data, we observed that benign stroma from men with high-grade tumors was more similar to cystoprostatectomy stroma than low-grade benign stroma, despite the fact that in our samples benign stroma from high-grade cases was physically closer to a tumor focus than in low-grade cases. This could suggest that there is a "prostate-wide" difference in the stroma of men who develop low-grade disease, which allows for the development of well-differentiated cancer with low aggressiveness.

### Prognostic significance of Gleason score 3+4 versus Gleason score 4+3 tumor at radical prostatectomy [^115keeuc]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

To determine the clinical significance of Gleason score 3+4 versus 4+3 on radical prostatectomy, a study was conducted involving 2390 men who underwent surgery by a single surgeon. Among them, 570 had Gleason score 7 tumors without lymph node metastasis, seminal vesicle invasion, or tertiary Gleason pattern 5. The patients were evaluated for biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen progression) and distant metastases.

Eighty percent of patients had Gleason score 3+4, while 20% had 4+3. The rate of established extraprostatic extension at radical prostatectomy for Gleason score 3+4 and 4+3 tumors was 38.2% and 52.7%, respectively (P = 0.008). With a mean follow-up of 4.6 years for men without progression, Gleason score 4+3 tumors had an increased risk of progression independent of stage and margin status (P < 0.0001). The 5-year actuarial risk of progression was 15% for Gleason score 3+4 tumors and 40% for 4+3 tumors. The mean time to progression was 4.4 years for Gleason score 3+4 tumors and 3.2 years for Gleason score 4+3 tumors.

Patients were stratified into four prognostic groups based on organ-confined status, margin status, and Gleason score (3+4 versus 4+3). The 5-year actuarial risk of progression for these groups was 10%, 35%, 45%, and 61%, with 10-year progression rates of 29%, 42%, 69%, and 84%, respectively. A total of 3.9% of patients with Gleason score 3+4 and 10.5% with Gleason score 4+3 tumors developed metastatic disease within a mean of 5.7 and 5.6 years, respectively. A Gleason score of 4+3 versus 3+4 was predictive of metastatic disease (P = 0.002).

### Clinical and molecular rationale to retain the cancer descriptor for Gleason score 6 disease [^111byzEk]. Nature Reviews Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment choices for men with indolent prostate cancer include active surveillance or definitive local therapy. Overtreatment of these patients is an important problem. Treatment decisions are often made jointly by the clinician and the patient, partly based on the tumour's Gleason score. To reduce the burden of overtreatment, the clinical significance of Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 prostate cancer has been questioned, and some have advocated that Gleason pattern 3 should be stripped of its cancer status.

However, removing the cancer descriptor would have far-reaching clinical consequences that might result in poor patient outcomes, as the evidence of a lack of malignancy is inconclusive in several areas. For example, molecular data suggest that the genomic instability underlying tumour progression precedes histologically visible changes, and the absolute risk of metastasis or mortality from Gleason score 6 prostate cancer is not zero. Extreme caution is required when weighing a decision to reclassify Gleason pattern 3 disease as a non-cancer.

### Importance and determinants of Gleason score undergrading on biopsy sample of prostate cancer in a population-based study [^116umo2h]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The Gleason grading system, based on architectural features of prostate cancer cells, is the most widely used histological grading method for prostatic adenocarcinoma. The Gleason score (GS) closely correlates with clinical behavior and provides an important index of prognosis. Furthermore, this score is one of the key determinants in treatment decision-making, together with stage, age, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Indeed, most models developed to predict the likelihood of disease extension beyond the prostate gland and to correlate pre-treatment findings with long-term outcomes incorporate biopsy GS.

Significant discrepancies exist between the GS determined by the prostate biopsy and the GS based on the pathologic specimen. It has been observed that the GS from needle biopsies underestimates the GS of the radical prostatectomy specimen in 19 to 57% of all cases, depending on the series and the periods examined. Such downgrading has a significant impact on treatment decisions and patient outcomes, particularly when the choice of treatment is between active surveillance and curative intent therapy.

Several factors can influence the likelihood that the biopsy GS underestimates the prostatectomy score, including the PSA level, the level of pathologist expertise, the patient's age, the results of the digital rectal examination, the prostate gland volume, the percentage of cancer cells in the biopsy sample, and the number of biopsies obtained. With reference to the last issue, it is worth mentioning that the European Association of Urologists provides guidance on the optimal number of biopsies.

### Management of low risk prostate cancer-active surveillance and focal therapy [^114w3JTV]. Nature Reviews. Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Low-risk prostate cancer, defined as Gleason score 6 or less with PSA < 10 ng/ml, is diagnosed in about half of men undergoing screening. Approximately 30% of men diagnosed with low-risk disease harbor high-grade cancer that is unrepresented on the biopsy. Moreover, a small percentage of low-grade cancers have molecular alterations that result in progression to aggressive disease.

Favorable-risk prostate cancer should be managed with close follow-up. Active surveillance is appropriate for most patients with low-risk disease, and radical treatment should be reserved for cases in which higher-risk disease is identified. In turn, focal therapy aims to preserve tissue and function in men who have been diagnosed with localized disease. It should be offered to men with higher risk disease at baseline, as an alternative to whole-gland radiation or surgery, or when the patient transitions from low-risk to higher-risk disease.

The two strategies should be viewed as complementary elements of care that can be applied in a risk-stratified manner. In this review, we discuss the rationale and status of active surveillance — which constitutes a standard of care in most evidence-based guidelines — and comment on whether and when focal therapy should complement it in those men wishing to continue a tissue-preserving strategy.

### Association between the dihydrotestosterone level in the prostate and prostate cancer aggressiveness using the Gleason score [^1125UfPf]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The association between dihydrotestosterone in the prostate and prostate cancer aggressiveness has not yet been elucidated. We analyzed dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate and Gleason score in patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 81 patients with suspected prostate cancer underwent prostate biopsy. Serum samples were collected before biopsy. Dihydrotestosterone levels in prostatic tissue and serum were analyzed using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry after polar derivatization.

- **Results**: A total of 47 patients were diagnosed with stages T1 to T3N0M0 prostate cancer, and 34 were diagnosed with no malignancy. Of the 47 patients, 32 had a Gleason score of 6 or less, and 15 had a score of 7 to 10. Dihydrotestosterone in prostatic tissue in patients with Gleason score 7 to 10 disease was significantly lower than in those with Gleason score 6 or less disease (p = 0.025). Gleason score correlated with the testosterone-to-serum dihydrotestosterone ratio (rs = 0.329, p = 0.038).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with Gleason score 7 to 10 prostate cancer have low dihydrotestosterone in the prostate, although there were no significant differences between patients with Gleason score 7 to 10 vs. 6 or less prostate cancer with respect to serum androgens. Low dihydrotestosterone in cases of aggressive prostate cancer is probably sufficient to activate androgen receptor expression and propagate tumor growth.

### Changes in prostate cancer grading: Including a new patient-centric grading system [^114AbaQd]. The Prostate (2016). Low credibility.

The first structured approach to grade prostate cancer based on the underlying histological architecture was developed by Donald Gleason, who in 1966 proposed a morphologic classification of prostate cancer and in 1974 demonstrated its clinical significance based on prostate cancer-specific death. Contemporarily referred to as the Gleason grading system, it has gained worldwide recognition, allowing a more individualized approach for patients with prostate cancer.

In 2005, the International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) made the first revisions to the grading system. Subsequently, based on new discoveries in the pathologic and clinical aspects of prostate cancer, as well as its changing nature due in part to robust screening, there was a need for experts to revisit the approach to grading prostate cancer. In November 2014, ISUP experts and clinical leaders in prostate cancer from 17 countries conducted a consensus conference in Chicago, IL, USA. The consensus conference defined various grade patterns and proposed the adoption of a new grading system for prostate cancer. Herein, we describe the background and rationale for the changes and provide guidelines for their clinical implementation.

### Automated deep-learning system for Gleason grading of prostate cancer using biopsies: A diagnostic study [^116LGZ7g]. The Lancet Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The Gleason score is the strongest predictor of recurrence for prostate cancer, but substantial inter-observer variability limits its usefulness for individual patients. Specialized urological pathologists have greater concordance; however, such expertise is not widely available. Prostate cancer diagnostics could benefit from robust, reproducible Gleason grading. This study aimed to investigate the potential of deep learning to perform automated Gleason grading of prostate biopsies.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, a deep-learning system was developed to grade prostate biopsies following the Gleason grading standard. The system used randomly selected biopsies, sampled by the biopsy Gleason score, from patients at the Radboud University Medical Center (pathology reports dated between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2017). A semi-automatic labeling technique circumvented the need for manual annotations by using pathologists' reports as the reference standard during training. The system was designed to delineate individual glands, assign Gleason growth patterns, and determine the biopsy-level grade.

For validation, a consensus reference standard was established by three expert urological pathologists on an independent test set of 550 biopsies. Of these 550, 100 were used in an observer experiment comparing the system, 13 pathologists, and two pathologists in training to the reference standard. The system was also compared to an external test dataset of 886 cores.
