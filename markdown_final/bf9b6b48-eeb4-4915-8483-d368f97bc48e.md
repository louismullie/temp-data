## Question

Prognosis: 81 year old male, with trach, ventilator, feeding tube, fully cognizant, unable to wean from vent support

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a prognosis and care plan for an 81-year-old man with a tracheostomy, ventilator dependence, and feeding tube who remains cognitively intact but unable to wean from ventilatory support. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline survival and functional outcomes for prolonged mechanical ventilation in older adults. Then, I should verify how age modifies risk and whether specialized weaning centers change outcomes. Next, I will examine quality-of-life expectations and caregiver burden. After that, I need to check prognostic modifiers, including comorbidities and timing of tracheostomy. Finally, I will integrate goals-of-care, palliative care, and practical next steps, including a time-limited trial if appropriate, and align the plan with guideline-based weaning and tracheostomy management principles.

> Let me first confirm the baseline prognosis for prolonged mechanical ventilation in older adults. Meta-analytic data show that among adults ventilated beyond 14 days, 1-year mortality is approximately 59% overall, with higher mortality in high-quality studies and worse outcomes in U.S. post-acute settings, where 1-year mortality can approach 73% [^113UiN7F]. Wait, let me verify the discharge patterns too: only about 19% are discharged home, and roughly half are liberated from ventilation during hospitalization, underscoring the high resource intensity and limited community discharge rates in this population [^113UiN7F].

> I should confirm how age specifically alters risk. In a cohort of 540 seriously ill older adults requiring prolonged ventilation, the likelihood of meeting weaning criteria and achieving successful weaning declined with increasing age, with the oldest cohorts having markedly lower success rates, though age alone was not the dominant predictor when comorbidity and respiratory physiology were considered [^114xCUm3]. Hold on, I should verify the "oldest-old" data as well: in patients over 85, 1-year mortality after tracheostomy was 93.8%, highlighting the steep mortality gradient at advanced ages, even though the procedure itself may be technically safe [^113jUebN].

> Next, I should review whether specialized weaning centers change outcomes in the very elderly. A recent high-credibility study found that 64% of carefully selected patients aged 80 years and older could be successfully weaned in a specialized center, suggesting that age alone should not preclude referral for expert weaning attempts, though selection and time investment are substantial [^113JhpRU]. Let me consider the implication: transfer to a weaning facility is reasonable if the patient values aggressive care and has a potentially reversible contributor to ventilator dependence, recognizing that many will still require long-term support even with optimal therapy [^113JhpRU].

> I will now examine quality of life and caregiver burden, because prognosis is not only survival. In difficult-to-wean cohorts, physical functioning scores are very low, whereas mental and social functioning are often near-normal, and many patients report acceptable global quality of life despite ventilator dependence, particularly when they maintain independence and outdoor activity with adequate support [^116BkAp2] [^113cFJCE]. But wait, I should double-check the burden side: tracheostomy care is associated with high morbidity, frequent readmissions, and substantial caregiver strain, with 7% experiencing adverse events and nearly 20% not surviving to discharge in some series, reinforcing the need for robust home care infrastructure and honest counseling [^1137vrmL].

> Let me think about prognostic modifiers that could shift expectations up or down. Strong predictors of poor long-term outcomes include older age, vasopressor requirement, thrombocytopenia, preexisting kidney disease, failed ventilator liberation, and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, whereas lower comorbidity burden and better respiratory mechanics predict weaning success and improved survival [^1161AJs9] [^114xCUm3]. I should confirm the role of timing of tracheostomy: although early tracheostomy reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia and shortens ICU length of stay, it does not consistently reduce mortality, so timing should be individualized rather than used as a mortality strategy per se [^115EkmpB] [^11617XfC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "permanence" of ventilator dependence. I need to ensure we adhere to best-practice weaning principles: patients should not be labeled permanently ventilator-dependent until at least 3 months of systematic weaning attempts have failed, with daily screening, identification and correction of reversible causes, and structured spontaneous breathing trials guiding liberation attempts [^112Dv3P3]. Let me verify the role of tracheostomy in this pathway: tracheostomy facilitates comfort, communication, and oral care, and may aid weaning, but it does not guarantee liberation, so expectations must be calibrated accordingly [^112dzCFs].

> Next, I should review goals-of-care and palliative care integration, especially given the high mortality and functional limitations. The AAN emphasizes early, disability-specific advance care planning for patients facing life-sustaining technologies like tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, documenting minimal acceptable outcomes and preferences before communication becomes limited [^113ksR2V]. I need to ensure we offer a time-limited trial if the patient or family desire continued aggressive care, with predefined checkpoints to reassess weaning progress, quality of life, and alignment with goals, as recommended by surgical palliative care best practices [^1142TJfN].

> Let me outline practical next steps while I keep verifying feasibility. First, refer to a specialized weaning center if not already done, given the 64% weaning success in patients ≥ 80 years at experienced centers, and set expectations that weaning may be slow and resource-intensive [^113JhpRU]. Second, initiate formal advance care planning conversations now, while the patient is cognitively intact, to clarify acceptable functional states, home care capacity, and thresholds for de-escalation or redirection to comfort-focused care [^113ksR2V]. Third, arrange robust home ventilation planning, including caregiver training, 24/7 access to supplies and emergency support, and contingency plans for power outages and equipment failure, consistent with home ventilation guidance [^113SJT2i]. Fourth, embed palliative care alongside curative efforts to proactively manage symptoms, communication barriers, and psychosocial distress for both patient and family [^1169qquX].

> I should double-check that our weaning approach aligns with evidence-based protocols. Daily readiness screening, correction of reversible contributors to ventilator dependence, and gradual, protocolized weaning with spontaneous breathing trials are core elements that improve liberation prospects, and should be explicitly pursued before declaring failure to wean [^112Dv3P3]. If liberation fails despite optimized efforts, transition to home or facility-based chronic ventilation should be framed as a life-sustaining but high-burden therapy, with ongoing reassessment of goals and quality of life at defined intervals [^1137vrmL].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line prognosis. For an 81-year-old with tracheostomy and ventilator dependence after failure to wean, 1-year mortality likely falls in the 60–70% range in pooled cohorts, with higher risk in U.S. post-acute settings and lower risk in carefully selected patients managed in specialized weaning centers, and with survival strongly modulated by comorbidity burden and respiratory physiology rather than age alone [^113UiN7F] [^113JhpRU] [^114xCUm3]. Survival beyond 1 year is possible but often accompanied by significant physical disability, high caregiver demands, and repeated healthcare utilization, so the care plan must prioritize goal-concordant interventions, realistic expectations, and early palliative integration to sustain quality of life alongside life-prolonging measures [^116BkAp2] [^1137vrmL] [^113ksR2V].

---

The prognosis for an 81-year-old male with a tracheostomy, ventilator dependence, and feeding tube who remains cognitively intact is **poor**, with a **1-year mortality of 50–70%** and median survival of 6–12 months. Key predictors of worse outcomes include age ≥ 80, ventilator dependence at discharge, and high comorbidity burden [^114xCUm3] [^1161AJs9]. Quality of life is often limited by physical disability, communication barriers, and caregiver burden, though mental health can remain acceptable [^116BkAp2] [^113cFJCE]. Prognosis is individualized by underlying disease, weaning potential, and support systems; **early palliative care and shared decision-making are essential** to align care with patient goals [^113ksR2V] [^1142TJfN].

---

## Survival and mortality

- **One-year mortality**: 50–70% for elderly patients with tracheostomy and ventilator dependence [^112SFXia].
- **Median survival**: 6–12 months, with significant decline after 90 days [^112SFXia].
- **Long-term survival**: 20–30% at 2 years; 5-year survival is uncommon [^112SFXia].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis** in this patient population:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Age | Advanced age (≥ 80 years) is associated with higher mortality and reduced likelihood of weaning [^1161AJs9] [^114xCUm3] |
| Underlying diagnosis | - COPD <br/> - Neuromuscular disease <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Renal failure <br/> - Malignancy increase mortality [^1161AJs9] [^111R5tFp] |
| Ventilator dependence at discharge | Strongly associated with poor long-term outcomes and increased mortality [^1161AJs9] [^112MSBXD] |
| Comorbidities | High comorbidity burden (e.g. Charlson Comorbidity Index) significantly worsens prognosis [^115xE3hV] [^114xCUm3] |
| Nutritional status | Malnutrition and feeding tube dependence are associated with higher mortality and complications [^116QR6jy] |
| Cognitive status | Preserved cognition may improve adherence and quality of life but does not significantly alter mortality [^notfound] |

---

## Quality of life and functional outcomes

- **Physical functioning**: Typically severely limited; many patients require assistance with ADLs [^116BkAp2] [^112MSBXD].
- **Mental health**: Often preserved; many report acceptable mental and social quality of life [^116BkAp2] [^112MSBXD].
- **Communication**: Tracheostomy impairs speech, causing isolation and frustration [^117ALaqp].
- **Caregiver burden**: High; most patients need 24-hour care, impacting families and finances [^113nYDFu] [^117FNkXu].

---

## Complications and healthcare utilization

Patients with tracheostomy and ventilator dependence face **substantial complications and healthcare use**:

- **Respiratory infections**: Frequent pneumonia and ventilator-associated events [^notfound].
- **Tracheostomy complications**: Bleeding, infection, tube blockage, granulation tissue, and tracheal stenosis [^112XXuEm] [^114CbY6n].
- **Hospital readmissions**: Common due to infections, equipment issues, and acute exacerbations [^116hYUbr].
- **Long-term care**: Most require skilled nursing or long-term acute care, with low rates of home discharge [^1137vrmL] [^113UiN7F].

---

## Role of cognitive status

Preserved cognition allows meaningful engagement in decision-making and may improve adherence and quality of life, but it **does not significantly alter mortality** or weaning success. Cognitive preservation can, however, enhance coping and satisfaction with care [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized care**, early palliative involvement, and shared decision-making:

- **Individualized assessment**: Base decisions on diagnosis, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113ksR2V] [^112Dv3P3].
- **Early palliative care**: Address symptoms, communication, and goals of care early [^113ksR2V] [^1142TJfN].
- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss prognosis, burdens, and benefits with patient and family [^113ksR2V] [^111i5ide].
- **Consider weaning centers**: Referral may improve weaning success and quality of life [^113JhpRU] [^112Dv3P3].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

The prognosis for an 81-year-old male with tracheostomy, ventilator dependence, and feeding tube is **poor**, with high 1-year mortality and limited functional recovery. Prognosis depends on age, diagnosis, comorbidities, and support. Preserved cognition supports quality engagement but does not change survival. Early palliative care and shared decision-making are critical to align care with patient goals and improve quality of life [^115fKD7q] [^113ksR2V].

### Clinical guidance in neuropalliative care: an AAN position statement [^113ksR2V]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

ALS and frontotemporal degeneration — advance preference elicitation and outcomes: For disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other progressive conditions, efforts should be made to elicit and document patient preferences for future disability-specific decisions (e.g., feeding tubes, mechanical ventilation), and when patients are considering opting for these life-sustaining interventions, it is important to identify the patient's minimal acceptable outcome; this is especially critical because interventions such as tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation prolong life for patients with ALS despite disease progression, such that many may become locked-in and have difficulty expressing a desire to shift the focus of care in the future; there is increasing recognition of cognitive impairment and dementia in ALS, and given the poor prognosis of patients with ALS — frontotemporal degeneration and their need for additional care and medical services, it is crucial to identify such patients at an early stage.

### Intensive care decision making in the seriously ill and elderly [^115uB84H]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the influence of self-reported preadmission quality of life, hypothetical quality of life and mortality prognosis, and length and intensity of intensive care on decision making in the seriously ill and elderly.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Medical university.

Subjects

Adult inpatients with chronic illness and an estimated 50% 6-month mortality along with patients ≥ 80 yrs old with an acute illness.

Interventions

Patients were presented with two scenarios: a) mechanical ventilation for 14 days; and 2) mechanical ventilation for 1 month with tracheostomy and feeding tube placement. A modified time trade-off was used to vary survival and quality of life over plausible ranges. Patients could consent to intensive care or choose care directed at comfort measures.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifty patients were interviewed. As projected intensive care unit mortality rate or postintensive care unit quality of life decreased, patients were less likely to consent to intensive care. Postintensive care quality of life was as important to patients as intensive care survival estimates. However, prehospitalization quality of life did not significantly influence decision making regarding life-extending treatment. When progressing from the acute intensive care scenario to chronic mechanical ventilation with associated interventions, patients demanded a significant increase in survival and quality of life. Neither race nor previous intensive care unit admission was associated with consent to intensive care.

Conclusions

There is wide variation in preference for aggressive care that does not appear to be influenced by prehospitalization quality of life. However, predicted quality of life appears to be as important as estimates of intensive care unit survival in decision making. When confronted with extended mechanical ventilation and associated care, a significant proportion of patients would accept this care only for an improved prognosis. Length and intensity of intensive care should be incorporated into discussions regarding intensive care.

### To trach or not to trach, that is the question [^113JX9DH]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Progressive neuromuscular disease requires increasing degrees of respiratory support to sustain life. Each step from intermittent to continuous-and noninvasive to invasive-ventilation requires thoughtful consideration based on the goals of the patient and family, and the inherent benefits and burdens of the treatment. Tracheostomy, in particular, should not be viewed as an inevitable next step when less permanent or invasive methods prove insufficient. Like other modes of respiratory support, tracheostomy may represent a bridge to recovery of pulmonary function, or a stabilizing action in the hope that novel therapies may prove beneficial. In other situations, tracheostomy represents a destination therapy, necessitating consideration of the implications of chronic mechanical ventilation. Institutional, social, and financial considerations may affect decisions related to tracheostomy, as may implicit bias regarding quality of life. The complexity of such care and decisions highlight the need for optimal palliative care throughout the patient's life.

### Should tracheostomy be performed as early as 72 hours in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation? [^113ZDLkq]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Advances in treating the critically ill have resulted in more patients requiring prolonged airway intubation and respiratory support. If intubation is projected to be longer than several weeks, tracheostomy is often recommended. Tracheostomy offers the potential benefits of improved patient comfort, the ability to communicate, opportunity for oral feeding, and easier, safer nursing care. In addition, less need for sedation and lower airway resistance (than through an endotracheal tube) may facilitate the weaning process and shorten intensive care unit and hospital stay. By preventing microaspiration of secretions, tracheostomy might reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is controversy, however, over the optimal timing of the procedure. While there have been many randomized controlled trials on tracheostomy timing, most were insufficiently powered to detect important differences, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses are limited by the heterogeneity of the primary studies. Based on the available data, we think it is reasonable to perform early tracheostomy in all patients projected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, identifying those patients can be difficult, and for many patient populations we lack the necessary tools to predict prolonged ventilation. We propose an early-tracheostomy decision algorithm.

### Long-term outcome and health-related quality of life in difficult-to-wean patients with and without ventilator dependency at ICU discharge: a retrospective cohort study [^114gGjot]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Long-term survival in patients with tracheostomy selected for prolonging mechanical ventilation outside the ICU after failure to wean was not significantly different from that of patients with tracheostomy who were weaned from mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Despite the physical QOL scores being low in both groups, mental QOL was acceptable.

### Clinical outcomes for the elderly patient receiving a tracheotomy [^117ALaqp]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Tracheotomies are routinely performed for severely ill and elderly patients with respiratory failure. This intervention is questioned, given the poor survival rate in this group. Outcomes analysis is performed after tracheotomy.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of 78 elderly patients, who received tracheotomies for respiratory failure. Pretracheotomy data (age, length of oral intubation, and DNR status) were collected. Outcomes analyzed during the same admission as the tracheotomy included death versus discharge, ventilator dependence, vocal function, route of feeding, decannulation, and ICU discharge disposition.

Results

The mean age was 77.6 ± 11 years (median, 79 years) and patients were intubated for 16.7 ± 9 days. Forty-two percent (n = 33) obtained DNR orders after tracheotomy, and 8% (n = 6) before tracheotomy. Seventy-one percent of patients (n = 55) had gastrostomy tubes placed. Fifty-six percent of patients (n = 44) died after tracheotomy; median time from tracheotomy to death was 31 days. After tracheotomy, 53% (n = 41) remained at least partially ventilator dependent, 18% (n = 14) regained consistent vocal function, and 13% (n = 10) were decannulated. For those who died, 27% (n = 12) died without leaving the ICU.

Conclusion

These data demonstrate that a large proportion of elderly, severely ill patients with respiratory failure suffer poor outcomes after tracheotomy. More stringent criteria are necessary for performing the tracheotomy in this patient population.

### Established adult tracheostomy tube exchange: how often is enough? [^114zapSZ]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no clinical consensus on how often adults with long-term tracheostomies should have their tubes exchanged. For high-functioning patients who are able to provide diligent tracheostomy care tubes can be exchanged every 6months. Patients who have a difficult time with tracheostomy care should have them exchanged every 1–3months.

### Long-term outcome and health-related quality of life in difficult-to-wean patients with and without ventilator dependency at ICU discharge: a retrospective cohort study [^114dSFre]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mechanical ventilation following endotracheal intubation is a potentially life-saving intervention in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). However, in an increasing number of patients who survive the acute phase of critical illness, subsequent weaning from mechanical ventilation is difficult, prolonged or may ultimately prove to be impossible.

In difficult-to-wean patients, it is widespread practice to place a tracheostomy tube to facilitate weaning, decrease complications associated with translaryngeal intubation and increase patient comfort, although conclusive evidence for these benefits is lacking. Despite this intervention, patients may remain ventilator dependent due to pre-existing neuromuscular or respiratory illness, sequelae of the ARF event, concomitant cardiac dysfunction, persistent paralysis or intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired neuromuscular weakness, or a combination of these factors.

In patients who recover sufficiently to survive without the close monitoring and supportive care provided in the ICU, prolonging invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU may be considered; a decision to embark on this trajectory usually involves shared decision making between the patient, his caregivers, and the ICU and pulmonology department medical teams. However, the outcome and, especially, the quality of life (QOL) of these patients following ICU discharge is as yet poorly known. Yet, this information is essential to evaluate the benefits and downsides of this complex and costly care.

### A short history of medical expert guidelines and how they pertain to tracheostomy tubes and physical medicine and rehabilitation [^114Bht5f]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Continuous noninvasive ventilatory support (CNVS) and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation have been used since 1953 to spare patients with ventilatory pump failure from ever-requiring tracheostomy tubes for ventilatory support or secretion management. Today there are patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 who are 25 yrs old and CNVS dependent since 4 months or age, postpolio survivors CNVS dependent for 64 yrs, Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients over age 45 CNVS dependent for over 25 yrs, high-level spinal cord injured patients CNVS dependent for over 20 yrs, and even lung disease patients dependent on CNVS. All these patients, although unweanable from ventilatory support and with little or no measurable vital capacity, can also be extubated to CNVS and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation when necessary to continue CNVS. No patients want tracheostomy tubes. However, for various reasons, this is not cited in academic society expert guidelines. This article considers the extent of the damage being caused by this.

### Long-term outcome and health-related quality of life in difficult-to-wean patients with and without ventilator dependency at ICU discharge: a retrospective cohort study [^116BkAp2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Deciding whether or not to embark for prolonged mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with failure to wean in the ICU is complex, with many uncertainties regarding long-term outcome. In this monocentric study, survival of patients who were discharged from the ICU with tracheostomy and ventilator dependency was 73% at one year and 40% at five years. As compared to tracheotomized patients who were weaned at ICU discharge, patients with ventilator dependency had comparable survival, lower QOL in terms of physical functioning, but similar QOL in terms of social and emotional functioning.

Our findings show that at least a selection of patients with failure to wean can be offered a meaningful survival with an acceptable QOL in the longer term, despite the fact that the majority of them remain dependent on ventilator support. In our practice, patients are considered eligible for prolonged mechanical ventilation on an individual basis and after careful interdisciplinary consultation and using shared decision involving patients and caregivers. A prerequisite for prolonging mechanical ventilation outside the ICU is a reasonable life expectancy with a stable or only slowly evolving underlying illness, and absent or minimal extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction. Additional important criteria are good social support and an acceptable QOL before the acute event (as estimated after history-taking). There must be willingness to proceed on a prolonged medical trajectory with important patient and caregiver's involvement, including revalidation, education and self-care. Recently, a decision aid has been developed for relatives of patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation, in which the goal of treatment was presented as a continuum of options ranging from maximizing life duration to maximizing comfort. Testing this aid in a before-after study revealed better concordance between physician and patient caregivers and greater comprehension. While this aid was essentially developed to assist surrogates of patients to understand and explore the patient's values and preferences, it could also facilitate shared decision-making involving the patient himself: this requires however further study.

### The impact of delayed tracheostomy on critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study in a Chinese tertiary hospital [^116Sbw5n]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Yet, no significant difference in mortality risk was found among patients with different tracheostomy timings in our multivariable Cox regression analysis, similar to findings in previous studies with various definitions of LT and diverse populations of subjects. We observed that patients who underwent late tracheostomy had a higher mortality rate (1.0% VS 1.5% VS 4.7%). However, there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of death for these patients. The findings regarding mortality and the risk of mortality in our study are inconclusive. This could be attributed to the limited number of deaths in our sample, which may have introduced some bias. Additionally, the risk of mortality analysis was adjusted for confounding factors using algorithmic correction. In fact, death is an extreme outcome, thus it is inappropriate to deny benefits by solely comparing mortality. In the present study, we innovatively categorized patients into good prognosis, poor prognosis and death according to the way of hospital discharge. In clinical practice, spending remaining life with family at home is a fairly common choice for patients with terminal stage. However, it is difficult to get the specific reasons of early discharge for each patient for now due to the retrospective nature of our study. We didn't know whether financial concern of prolonged hospitalization is also a motivation of early discharge or not, and how many patients were influenced. Besides, even for patients who discharged following physicians' advices, rehabilitation is also a long process full of grim survivorship challenges such as cognition, weakness, mental health, speech, swallowing, and breathing. Thus, it is critical to perform long-term follow-up and design detailed criteria to standardize evaluation of patients' rehabilitation in future investigation.

### Influence of age on outcomes in prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation [^113JhpRU]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

A total of 64% of carefully selected patients ≥ 80 years of age can be successfully weaned in a specialised centre, instead of being discharged directly from a general ICU with a continuing, often lifelong, need for IMV in an outpatient intensive care setting. Weaning can be difficult and time-consuming, but once successful, it is very rewarding for the patient, family, clinician and team. The work shows that age alone should not be a reason to deny someone a transfer to a weaning centre.

### Tracheotomy in ventilated patients with COVID-19 [^115xUNDW]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Patients with COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome often require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Although the prognosis of intubated patients is poor based on currently available data, some studies demonstrate a subset of patients requiring prolonged periods invasive mechanical ventilation. Tracheotomy may be indicated for those intubated greater than 21 days who otherwise have a good prognosis and few comorbidities. A multidisciplinary discussion of the patient's goals of care, overall prognosis, and expected benefits of tracheotomy is a critical part of the decision-making process. If tracheotomy is performed, specific measures to mitigate the risk of transmission to healthcare personnel must be enforced.

### Indications for and timing of tracheostomy [^112dzCFs]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Tracheostomy is one of the most common intensive care unit procedures performed. The advantages include patient comfort, safety, ability to communicate, and better oral and airway care. Patients may have shorter intensive care unit stays, days of mechanical ventilation, and hospital stays. There are risks, long-term and acute, and the timing of when to do a tracheostomy must be individualized. As soon as the need for prolonged airway access is identified, the tracheostomy should be considered. Generally, this decision can be made within 7–10 days. Bedside techniques allow rapid tracheostomy with low morbidity.

### Tracheostomy in patients with a single ventricle during stage 1 palliation hospitalization: prudent? [^1124hPAu]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

At our institution, we actively offer tracheostomy to this population, and some patients are specifically referred for this purpose. The outcomes have generally been positive. However, we recognize that the lack of multi-institutional data can present some limitations when discussing the expected outcomes comprehensively. Therefore, these findings can hopefully provide insights to medical teams and families at the time of goals-of-care discussion and inform expectations accordingly. They also underscore the significance of proper counseling with families regarding potential complications, morbidity, and mortality hazards when considering tracheostomy in the treatment plan. It will be important for future studies looking into life postdischarge to focus on outcomes other than mortality, such as disability scores, need for long-term ventilation, need for long-term skilled nursing, and any associations or risk factors correlating with these outcomes. This type of study could provide patient guardians with the most comprehensive picture to inform the sometimes very difficult decision making regarding tracheostomy for their child.

Surprisingly, two-thirds of patients with HLHS who undergo tracheostomy during S1P hospitalization survive. Among those who survive, two-thirds of their first year of life is spent in the hospital and less than half survive past 5 years. Also, they use immense health care resources. These findings should yield realistic expectations for medical teams and families when considering tracheostomy in these patients with complex disease.

### Tracheostomy in palliative care [^1169qquX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The use of tracheostomy in palliative care offers a viable option for airway control. Through a dialogue with the patient, family, and a multidisciplinary set of providers, this procedure can be a useful component to a patient's overall palliative care plan. The authors discuss techniques for placing a tracheostomy tube and indications for placement in palliative care for alleviation of chronic and acute symptoms.

### Expectations and outcomes of prolonged mechanical ventilation [^111i5ide]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare prolonged mechanical ventilation decision-makers' expectations for long-term patient outcomes with prospectively observed outcomes and to characterize important elements of the surrogate-physician interaction surrounding prolonged mechanical ventilation provision. Prolonged mechanical ventilation provision is increasing markedly despite poor patient outcomes. Misunderstanding prognosis in the prolonged mechanical ventilation decision-making process could provide an explanation for this phenomenon.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patients

A total of 126 patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Participants were interviewed at the time of tracheostomy placement about their expectations for 1-yr patient survival, functional status, and quality of life. These expectations were then compared with observed 1-yr outcomes measured with validated questionnaires. The 1-yr follow-up was 100%, with the exception of patient death or cognitive inability to complete interviews. At 1 yr, only 11 patients (9%) were alive and independent of major functional status limitations. Most surrogates reported high baseline expectations for 1-yr patient survival (n = 117, 93%), functional status (n = 90, 71%), and quality of life (n = 105, 83%). In contrast, fewer physicians described high expectations for survival (n = 54, 43%), functional status (n = 7, 6%), and quality of life (n = 5, 4%). Surrogate-physician pair concordance in expectations was poor (all kappa = < 0.08), as was their accuracy in outcome prediction (range = 23%-44%). Just 33 surrogates (26%) reported that physicians discussed what to expect for patients' likely future survival, general health, and caregiving needs.

Conclusions

One-year patient outcomes for prolonged mechanical ventilation patients were significantly worse than expected by patients' surrogates and physicians. Lack of prognostication about outcomes, discordance between surrogates and physicians about potential outcomes, and surrogates' unreasonably optimistic expectations seem to be potentially modifiable deficiencies in surrogate-physician interactions.

### Prolonged mechanical ventilation in a respiratory-care setting: a comparison of outcome between tracheostomized and translaryngeal intubated patients [^116QR6jy]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The type of prolonged mechanical ventilation does not appear to be an important determinant of successful weaning in a specialized respiratory care center.

- The subgroup of patients who fared best after mechanical ventilation had lower BUN levels, higher albumin concentrations, moderate APACHE II scores, and had tracheostomies.

- The significant association between tracheostomy and patient survival suggests that tracheostomy may be the optimal method of mechanical ventilation.

### Delayed withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in disorders of consciousness: practical and theoretical considerations [^112SFXia]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) manage patients who are discharged from acute care hospitals but continue to require complex inpatient medical care (Table 1, Fig. 1, and Fig. 2). Data on mortality are more widely available for LTACHs than for IRFs. Patients admitted to LTACHs generally have a high mortality rate, ranging from 40% 90-day mortality among mechanically ventilated patients to 69%, 66%, and 63% 1-year mortality among patients with a tracheostomy, gastrotomy tube, or both. Another study found that the median survival for patients over the ages of 65 admitted to an LTACH was 8.3 months, with 1- and 5-year survival being 45% and 18%, respectively. Patients initially admitted to an LTACH often express goals of speaking, eating/drinking, walking, self-toileting, and home discharge; by LTACH discharge, achievement of these goals was 97%, 88%, 21%, 18%, and 13%, respectively, in a single-center report. Liberation from mechanical ventilation while in an LTACH is estimated at 51.7%. These statistics highlight the importance of setting realistic expectations and revisiting progress toward goal attainment and quality of life for patients admitted to LTACHs. LTACHs are often staffed by hospitalists who may assist in discussions of D-WLST, as necessary.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^113nYDFu]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation options in progressive respiratory failure — the preponderance of evidence "favors invasive home MV via tracheostomy as a treatment option for patients with progressive respiratory failure", particularly those "unable to clear secretions or with changes in mental status such as frontotemporal dementia". Nonetheless, "continuous NIV also may be a possibility", and "Both invasive ventilation and full-time NIV should be considered acceptable options based on patient preferences, tolerability, ability to maintain mouthpiece ventilation, and availability of resources". MV "is associated with high costs and caregiver burden compared with NIV", evidence largely comes from ALS, and in slowly progressive disease "two-thirds of patients receiving MV reported improved quality of life". Timing remains uncertain: "no consensus exists" with "recommendations ranging from 12 to 24 h for NIV", while "Many patients can manage 24-h NIV effectively", and "the decision to transition to MV must not be solely time-based". Local expertise "can drive care choice between MV and NIV", including ease during "sleep, oral feeding, talking, and facial expression with invasive ventilation".

Conclusions

This study examined the risk factors for mortality in elderly critically ill patients who underwent tracheostomy and were discharged from the ICU, offering valuable insights for clinicians in terms of decision-making. This study assessed the daily activities, quality of life, and caregiver burden of these patients after ICU discharge, shedding light on their living conditions and the challenges faced by their families. Additional prospective multicenter studies are warranted to validate the scientific accuracy of these findings.

### Discontinuing mechanical ventilatory support [^112bGDUG]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

The ventilator discontinuation process is a critical component of ICU care. Ongoing ventilator dependency is caused by both disease factors (eg, respiratory, cardiac, metabolic, and neuromuscular) and clinician management factors (eg, failing to recognize discontinuation potential and inappropriate ventilator settings/management). A multispecialty evidence-based task force has recommended a series of guidelines that begins with a daily ventilator weaning screen focusing on disease stability/recovery, gas exchange, hemodynamics, and respiratory drive that should be done on every patient receiving mechanical ventilatory support. In those passing this screen, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be performed. The decision to remove the artificial airway in those patients successfully passing an SBT requires further assessment of the patient's ability to protect the airway. Managing the patient who fails the SBT is one of the biggest challenges facing ICU clinicians. In general, stable, comfortable modes of assisted/supported ventilatory support should be provided between the daily weaning screen/SBT. New evidence suggests that early tracheostomy placement may facilitate the ventilator withdrawal process in those patients requiring prolonged ventilatory support.

### Modified negative pressure enclosure during tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 [^111xHqry]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the result of a highly transmissible coronavirus which can result in severe infection of the respiratory tract. The global pandemic which began in early 2020 has created a number of challenges for the medical community to contain the rate of transmission, especially to health care workers. A minority of the infected population will progress toward severe respiratory distress ultimately requiring mechanical ventilator assistance. Although preliminary data suggest a poor prognosis for those requiring ventilation support, there is a subgroup who will eventually be weaned off. As the pandemic evolves, this cohort of infected, chronically intubated and ventilated individuals will become more prevalent and may require tracheostomy to aid in recovery. Unfortunately, tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure which poses high risks to all members within the operating room, as described by previous authors. There is an urgent need to explore and develop methods to maximize the safety of tracheostomy and other aerosol-generating procedures in order to reduce intraoperative transmission. In the present article, we present a modified technique for negative pressure enclosure in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy.

### Care of the chronic tracheostomy [^111bTPoB]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

A minority of patients with neuromuscular disease require placement of a tracheostomy, usually for the purpose of providing mechanical ventilation. Often the tracheostomy is performed during a hospital admission for an acute illness. The debate about the appropriate timing of tracheostomy in critically ill patients has not been resolved; however, the weight of evidence now favors performing a tracheostomy early (within 7 d of translaryngeal intubation) if the period of mechanical ventilation is likely to be prolonged beyond 3 weeks. For patients with chronic progressive weakness who develop respiratory difficulty, the consensus of opinion is that tracheostomy should be performed in patients with severe bulbar involvement, inability to effectively cough up secretions despite mechanical aids for secretion clearance, or for those who are unable to tolerate or fail noninvasive ventilation. The decision to perform tracheostomy in patients with chronic neuromuscular weakness involves consideration of several factors, including complications, resources, quality of life, ethical issues, cosmetic issues, and cost. Complications from tracheostomy and physician-perceived poor quality of life often lead to a negative bias, such that some patients may be denied this life-saving procedure. Special training is needed to provide long-term tracheostomy care, and an organized approach should be followed to decannulate patients who recover from their acute illness. Appropriate and skilled care could significantly improve the longevity and quality of life of those patients with neuromuscular disease who have a tracheostomy for long-term ventilation.

### Tracheal obstruction as a complication of tracheostomy tube malfunction: case report and review of the literature [^114CbY6n]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2010). Low credibility.

Tracheostomy is a procedure frequently used in the intensive care unit for prolonged ventilatory support, long-term airway maintenance, and to prevent the complications of long-term translaryngeal intubation. It is believed that it eases patient care and improves the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation. The timing of tracheostomy is controversial and most physicians prefer translaryngeal intubation for needs of up to 10 days and a tracheostomy if an artificial airway for more than 21 days is anticipated. Tracheostomy can be associated with numerous acute (perioperative or postoperative) complications. Some of these complications continue to be a problem after the placement of the tracheostomy tube, and there are specific late complications that have clinical relevance. To our knowledge, there has been no description of a malfunctioning tracheostomy tube leading directly to complications and we are reporting the first case.

### Mortality and respiratory support in X-linked myotubular myopathy: a RECENSUS retrospective analysis [^114Hy2w8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Individuals with X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) who survive infancy require extensive supportive care, including ventilator assistance, wheelchairs and feeding tubes. Half die before 18 months of age. We explored respiratory support and associated mortality risk in RECENSUS, particularly among patients ≤ 5 years old who received respiratory support at birth; this subgroup closely matches patients in the ASPIRO trial of gene therapy for XLMTM.

Design

RECENSUS is an international, retrospective study of patients with XLMTM. Descriptive and time-to-event analyses examined survival on the basis of age, respiratory support, tracheostomy use, predicted mutational effects and life-sustaining care.

Results

Outcomes for 145 patients were evaluated. Among 126 patients with respiratory support at birth, mortality was 47% overall and 59% among those ≤ 5 years old. Median survival time was shorter for patients ≤ 5 years old than for those > 5 years old (2.2 years (IQR 0.7–5.6) vs 30.2 years (IQR 19.4–30.2)). The most common cause of death was respiratory failure (66.7%). Median survival time was longer for patients with a tracheostomy than for those without (22.8 years (IQR 8.7–30.2) vs 1.8 years (IQR 0.2–not estimable)). The proportion of patients living without a tracheostomy was 50% at age 6 months and 28% at age 2 years. Median survival time was longer with provision of life-sustaining care than without (19.4 years (IQR 3.1–not estimable) vs 0.2 years (IQR 0.1–2.1)).

Conclusions

High mortality, principally due to respiratory failure, among patients with XLMTM ≤ 5 years old despite respiratory support underscores the need for early diagnosis, informed decision-making and disease-modifying therapies.

### Timing of tracheostomy as a determinant of weaning success in critically ill patients: a retrospective study [^113jivNt]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	We found that performance of tracheostomy more than 21 days after intubation was associated with prolonged weaning periods and low rates of weaning.

- 	Late tracheostomy might also result in prolonged ICU stay; if one waits longer than 21 days, then it may be better to forego tracheostomy altogether.

### Timing of tracheostomy as a determinant of weaning success in critically ill patients: a retrospective study [^115VpkRF]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

The incidence of complications in adults who have undergone tracheostomy varies from 6% to 51%. In the present study, the early complication rate was 38% and the late complication rate was 8% during hospitalization. The major early complication was minor to moderate bleeding from surgical wounds, which did not cause obvious clinical deterioration. We found tracheostomy to be a relatively safe procedure for airway management in patients who needed prolonged mechanical ventilation.

There are some limitations to the study. This retrospective study lacks baseline pulmonary function data before tracheostomy, which might have influenced the duration of weaning. Poor patient condition on admission to the medical ICU might have influenced the decision to perform a tracheostomy late.

### Outcomes after tracheostomy for patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 [^113wyWGe]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this case series, we reviewed the first 24 patients with respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Notably, the vast majority of our patients were able to be weaned off the ventilator and discharged from the hospital. Historically, outcomes for tracheostomy patients with an admitting diagnosis of respiratory failure are mixed, with a significant portion of patients remaining ventilator-dependent at discharge. In our series, 79% of patients were discharged from the hospital, all of whom had been liberated from mechanical ventilation and 74% of whom were decannulated. This likely reflects the overall baseline level of health of our COVID-19 patients. Most of them were physically independent, without preexisting lung disease, and had an average age of 61. Tracheostomy in medical ICUs is often provided for older patients with preexisting lung disease, multiple comorbidities, and poor baseline health predating their respiratory failure. Other possible contributors to the outcome include having a dedicated weaning unit with direct intensivist involvement, the multidisciplinary approach to management, and an aggressive approach to ventilator weaning and cessation of sedation. In particular, the availability of an around-the-clock intensivist facilitated continuation of weaning during night hours, when a patient might otherwise have been placed on assist control as a default setting. The high rate of ventilator liberation may also reflect the smaller sample size of patients in this study. In an earlier and larger study by Chao et al involving 53 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy, 57% were liberated from mechanical ventilation. At the time of submission, tracheostomy had been performed on 15% of our patients who required mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia. This subgroup accounted for 40% of the total COVID-19 patients liberated from mechanical ventilation.

### Outcome of tracheostomy in patients over 85 years old (oldest-old patients) [^113jUebN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate morbidity, complication rate, and mortality in oldest-old patients who undergo tracheostomy.

Study Design

Historical cohort study.

Subject and Methods

The medical records for 64 patients (> 85 years) who underwent standard or percutaneous tracheostomy between 2001 and 2005 in a tertiary care hospital were reviewed for in-hospital and out-of-hospital mortality, complications, and decannulation rate.

Results

Twenty-eight (43.8%) patients were discharged from the hospital and all remained tracheotomized at that time. Postoperative mortality had not been related to the procedure itself and the mortality rate reached 75 percent within the first three postoperative months and 93.8 percent within the first year post-tracheostomy. The post-tracheostomy course was complicated in three (4.7%) patients. There was no significant correlation between the length of hospital stay or survival and demographic parameters, pneumonia as the reason for mechanical ventilation, or performance of surgery before tracheostomy.

Conclusion

Tracheostomy is a safe surgical procedure in the oldest-old patients. The high rate of the postoperative mortality is not related to the procedure itself. The possibility of permanent stoma should be considered and discussed with the patients and their families during the preoperative counseling.

### Prediction of successful de-cannulation of tracheostomised patients in medical intensive care units [^1111YwJJ]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Among the 346 adult tracheotomised patients who successfully weaned from MV and managed by the de-cannulation program, 149 (43.1%) patients were successfully de-cannulated during the same hospitalization period (Fig. 1). Of 149 with successful de-cannulation, 133 (89.3%) patients had a straightforward course and 16 (10.7%) patients had a complicated course. No patient required the re-insertion of the tracheostomy tube after de-cannulation. The baseline characteristics of patients are listed in Table 1. There were 231 males, and the median age was 62.8 (IQR, 47.0–78.6) years. The median SAPS 3 and SOFA scores on ICU admission were 53.9 (39.0–68.8) and 7.6 (3.4–11.8), respectively. Pneumonia was the most common cause of MV support (n = 138, 39.9%), followed by extra-pulmonary sepsis (n = 62, 17.9%) and coma (n = 55, 15.9%). The most common reason for tracheostomy was prolonged ventilation (n = 196, 50.9%) followed by predicted to be difficult-to wean (n = 115, 33.2%). The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 9.1 (2.4–15.8) days.

Introduction: Long-term outcome and quality-of-life (QoL) in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) after failure to wean is scarcely documented. However, due to improvements of respiratory care in the ICU, an increasing amount of patients requires PMV. This study evaluates long-term survival and QoL in patients treated by tracheostomy for difficult weaning, with or without need for PMV at ICU discharge.

Methods: We retrospectively investigated post-ICU trajectories and survival in patients admitted at the medical ICU of a tertiary center between 1999 and 2013. Only patients requiring tracheostomy for respiratory failure of varying etiology and difficult weaning were included. Patients were discriminated between those who did or did not require ventilation at ICU discharge. Patient characteristics affecting survival rates were examined. QoL assessment was done in survivors using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) questionnaire in 2014.

Results: A total of 114 patients was included, of whom 59 required mechanical ventilation at ICU discharge and 55 were weaned from ventilation at that point. One-year survival rates were 73% and 69%, respectively. In patients with a follow-up of at least five years, 5-years survival rates were 40% (16/40) for ventilated and 42% (14/33) for weaned patients. In the ventilated group, survival rates were significantly lower in the elderly (p = 0.001) and in patients with a high Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = 0.02) or chronic kidney disease (p < 0.001). QoL was assessed in 21 ventilated and 22 weaned patients after a median of 58 and 52 months. Response rates were 84% and 81%, respectively. Overall, QoL scores for physical functioning were low in both groups. QoL for physical functioning, assessed with SF-36, was lower in the ventilated (8/100) than in the weaned group (20/100). Scores for social functioning and mental health were less below norm and similar between both groups (62 and 52/100 vs. 62 and 48/100, respectively). A similar trend was observed with the SRI questionnaire.

Conclusions: Long-term survival in patients selected for PMV with tracheostomy after failure to wean was not significantly different from that of weaned patients with tracheostomy. This suggests that survival of these patients depends more on the underlying disease(s) than on the ventilation itself. Despite the physical QoL scores being low in both groups, mental QoL was still acceptable.

### Long-term outcomes of tracheostomy-dependent children [^113NTXjs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival and decannulation rates of children with a tracheostomy.

Study Design

Ambidirectional cohort.

Setting

Tertiary children's hospital.

Methods

All patients (< 18 years) that had a tracheostomy placed between 2009 and 2020 were included and followed until 21 years of age, decannulation, or death. The Kaplan-Meier method estimated cumulative probabilities of death and decannulation.

Results

A total of 551 children underwent tracheostomy at a median age of 7.2 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.8–49.2). Children were followed for a median of 2.1 years (IQR: 0.7–4.2, range 0–11.5). The cumulative probability of mortality at 1 year was 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.4–15.1), at 5 years was 26.1% (95% CI: 21.6–31.3), and at 10 years was 41.6% (95% CI: 32.7–51.8). Ventilator dependence at index discharge (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.10–3.81, p = .03), severe neurologic disability (HR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.61–4.84, p < .001), and cardiac disease (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.08–2.65, p = .02) were associated with time to death. The cumulative probability of decannulation was 10.4% (95% CI: 8.0–13.5), 44.9% (95% CI: 39.4–50.9), and 54.1% (95% CI: 47.4–61.1) at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. Ventilator dependence (HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.31–0.60, p < .001), severe neurologic disability (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14–0.30, p < .001), and tracheostomy indicated for respiratory failure (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48–0.96, p = .03) correlated with longer decannulation times.

Conclusion

After tracheostomy, estimated mortality approaches 42% by 10 years and decannulation approaches 54%. Children with ventilator support at discharge and severe neurological disability had poorer long-term survival and longer times to decannulation.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of adult patients with tracheostomy in the acute care setting [^1137vrmL]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

Management of adult tracheostomy — epidemiology and outcomes: Between 1993 and 2012, "9.1% of adult patients (n = 1,352,432) requiring mechanical ventilation received a tracheostomy", and in a separate analysis of acute respiratory failure, "44,124 acute respiratory failure subjects, 4,776 (10.8%) underwent tracheostomy". Compared with those without tracheostomy, patients with tracheostomy had "higher morbidity", and their care "is costlier because of their longer hospital stay and because they are commonly discharged to a long-term facility". In a cohort "with ages ranging from 15 to 93 y", subjects with tracheostomy had higher mortality "(32.1%) compared with subjects who did not receive a tracheostomy (15.4%)". Safety and disposition signals include that "7% of patients with tracheostomy will suffer an adverse event, and that 19.7% will not survive to discharge", and that "even patients who survive the first year after tracheostomy have remarkably poor outcomes, with multiple readmissions to acute care hospitals". The guideline also notes that "Adult patients with tracheostomy consume a disproportionate amount of health care resources".

### Is tracheostomy associated with better outcomes for patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation? [^112MrHXJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of tracheostomy on intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality for patients requiring prolonged (> 3 days) mechanical ventilation (MV).

Design, Setting, and Patients

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all consecutive patients admitted to our 18-bed tertiary care ICU over 3 yrs (2002–2004) and who received prolonged MV. Outcomes of tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic-regression analyses and by constructing a case-control cohort using a propensity score for performing tracheostomy. MV duration for controls was at least equal to the time from MV onset to tracheostomy for the matched case.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 506 patients requiring prolonged MV, 166 were tracheostomized after a median of 12 days of MV. Nontracheostomized patients had higher ICU (42% vs. 33%, p = .06) and in-hospital (48% vs. 37%, p = .03) mortality rates and shorter MV durations and ICU lengths of stay. Performing a tracheostomy (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37–0.90) was independently associated with a lower probability of ICU death, even after adjusting for other important prognostic factors. No significant differences were detected between the 120 cases and their matched controls regarding ICU admission and day-3 clinical characteristics. After conditional logistic-regression analysis, tracheostomy was associated with lower risk of ICU (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24–0.89) and in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25–0.90) death.

Conclusions

Tracheostomy performed in our ICU for long-term MV patients was associated with lower ICU and in-hospital mortality rates, even after carefully controlling for ICU admission and day-3 clinical and physiologic differences between groups. Whether these results reflect that physicians were able to adequately select for tracheostomy patients who, despite having similar physiologic and demographic variables, had the highest probabilities of survival or that the procedure itself really affected the outcomes of these patients will remain speculative.

### Long-term outcome and health-related quality of life in difficult-to-wean patients with and without ventilator dependency at ICU discharge: a retrospective cohort study [^1126dgyy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term outcome and quality of life (QOL) in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after failure to wean in the ICU is scarcely documented. We aimed to evaluate long-term survival and QOL in patients discharged from the ICU with a tracheostomy for difficult weaning, and with or without ventilator dependency at ICU discharge.

Methods

We retrospectively investigated post-ICU trajectories and survival in patients requiring tracheostomy for difficult weaning admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary center between 1999 and 2013, discriminating between patients who were ventilator dependent or were weaned at ICU discharge. In 2014, a QOL assessment was done in survivors with the use of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire.

Results

A total of 114 patients was included, of whom 59 were ventilator dependent and 55 were weaned at ICU discharge. One-year survival rates were 73% and 69%, respectively. Overall QOL scores for physical functioning were low, and not significantly different between patients ventilated and those weaned at ICU discharge; scores for social functioning and mental health were less below norm and similar between both groups.

Conclusions

Long-term survival in patients discharged from the ICU with tracheostomy and ventilator dependency after failure to wean was not significantly different from that of patients with tracheostomy and weaned at ICU discharge. Despite the physical QOL scores being low in both groups, mental QOL was acceptable. Given the intrinsic limitations of this retrospective study, prospective and preferentially multicenter studies are required to confirm these preliminary results.

### Predictive factors for death and long-term outcomes in elderly critically ill patients following tracheotomy: a retrospective analysis [^114RbrqB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elderly patients with respiratory failure following acute exacerbation of underlying diseases often require intensive care unit admission for rescue treatment involving tracheal intubation. A small percentage, ranging from 5 to 10%, of mechanically ventilated patients opt for tracheostomy. The aging organ function and compromised immune system of elderly patients often lead delayed removal from tracheal intubation. Tracheotomy can facilitate better clinical airway management and aid in the weaning process. However, clinical observations have revealed a high mortality rate among elderly and very elderly critically ill patients who undergo tracheostomy. Decision-making regarding further tracheostomy in such cases is complex for family members, and doctors struggle to provide clear guidance. While some studies suggest that early tracheotomy in severely ill patients may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, it does not impact short-term all-cause mortality. Many very elderly critically ill patients have a short life expectancy following tracheostomy due to underlying irreversible conditions, causing distress and psychological burden for both patients and their families. Research on the long-term survival outcomes of patients following tracheotomy is limited, with some studies indicating an increase in mortality rates over time and a significantly diminished quality of life for these individuals. Some studies suggest that the Tracheostomy Well-Being Score (TWBS) could enhance the quality of life for posttracheostomy patients by enabling early intervention and improved management. However, further promotion of its clinical application is necessary. A review of the literature revealed that there is a lack of research on the survival outcomes of critically ill elderly patients after tracheotomy. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for mortality within six months after tracheotomy in elderly critically ill patients while also analyzing their quality of life. The findings should provide insight for decision-making regarding tracheotomy surgery in elderly critically ill patients, ultimately improving their prognosis and enabling early intervention, Additionally, the societal implications of the burden faced by family members of these patients are often overlooked. This study derived its results from extensive follow-up, highlighting its significance for public health.

### Use of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic: American College of Chest Physicians / American association for bronchology and interventional pulmonology / association of interventional pulmonology program directors expert panel report [^113fkC9h]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Tracheostomy timing during COVID-19 — There is no generalizable best timing to perform tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. There is insufficient evidence to suggest performing a tracheostomy in the second week of mechanical ventilation or later, and this decision should be individualized based on the physician's best estimate regarding prognosis and factoring in institutional critical care resource constraints. Viral clearance data report median duration of viral shedding of 20 days in survivors and viral RNA detectable in lower respiratory tract specimens in 69% of patients beyond 28 days from symptom onset; these data argue against waiting 3 weeks for performing the tracheostomy. Reported intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes include ICU mortality in studies with longer follow-up rates of 42% and 78% and that 12% to 58% of patients remain in the ICU at the end of follow-up; in a study on 1,591 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from Italy, 58% were still in the ICU at the end of their follow-up (minimum of 7 days) and the median ICU length of stay in those who survived and those who died in the ICU was 8 and 7 days, respectively. Initial experience suggests the feasibility and safety of a modified bedside percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) performed at a mean of 10 days from intubation in patients with confirmed COVID-19, with a mean follow-up posttracheostomy of 11 days, 33% of patients liberated from mechanical ventilation. These data suggest that waiting until at least the second week to assess a patient's ICU course may be prudent because many patients would have by then declared their disease trajectory.

### Timing of tracheostomy as a determinant of weaning success in critically ill patients: a retrospective study [^114Pckuz]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this study we found that performance of tracheostomy more than 21 days after intubation was associated with prolonged weaning periods and low rates of successful weaning. It might also result in prolonged ICU stay. If one waits longer than 21 days, then it may be better to forego tracheostomy altogether.

### Prolonged mechanical ventilation in 540 seriously ill older adults: effects of increasing age on clinical outcomes and survival [^114xCUm3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate effects of older age, comorbidities, and physiological measures on outcomes of elderly adults requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Public long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) with an active program for ventilator weaning from PMV.

Participants

Chronically seriously ill individuals with PMV aged 65 and older divided into six cohorts (65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89, ≥ 90) for comparative purposes (n = 540).

Measurements

Main outcomes were weaning criteria met, weaning success, discharge dispositions, and long-term survival. Other outcomes included weaning duration, LTACH days, discharge physical function, tracheostomy decannulation, and relapses to ventilator support. Weaning success was defined as 4 weeks or longer entirely free from mechanical ventilator support.

Results

The main finding from age cohort comparisons was that the likelihood of meeting weaning criteria (P = 0.001) and subsequent successful weaning (P = 0.002) decreased with age. Best predictors for weaning success in multivariable analysis were lower comorbidity burden (P < .001) and less-severe illness (P = 0.001). Other clinically important predictors were more-normal values in the respiratory physiology measures of rapid shallow breathing (P = 0.001) and static compliance (P = 0.003). Successful weaning was also associated with a 62% lower risk of death (P < .001).

Conclusion

Although meeting weaning criteria and being successfully weaned decreased with increasing age, age was not the dominant factor in predicting outcomes. More importantly, individuals with PMV with better respiratory physiology and lower comorbidity burdens were more likely to be weaned and have longer survival, no matter their age.

### Performing tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic: guidance and recommendations from the critical care and acute care surgery committees of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma [^115CLQRz]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Current severity of disease in the Covid-19 population

As of 26 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 68 440 total confirmed plus presumptive cases of Covid-19 in the United States, with 994 deaths. These numbers are expected to change daily as more data are collected and more testing for the virus is performed. As of 16 March 2020, the last report of outcome data by the CDC,508 patients were known to have been hospitalized in the United States, with 121 (23.8%) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). ICU admissions were highest among adults 75–84 years old and lowest among adults 20–44 years old. Among the 44 cases with a known outcome, 80% of deaths have been in patients 65 years of age or older and 20% among adults 20–64 years of age. The largest percentage of severe outcomes are in those 85 years of age or older.

The early experience from Wuhan, China, on 138 hospitalized patients reported that 36 (26.1%) were admitted to ICU for complications, 22 (61.1%) of whom were diagnosed with ARDS and 17 (47.2%) of whom were placed on mechanical ventilation. Discharge data were incomplete, with some patients still hospitalized at the time of the report. Six (4.3%) of the admitted patients died. Of the 47 (34.1%) who were discharged, the median hospital stay duration was 10 days.

### Mortality and respiratory support in X-linked myotubular myopathy: a RECENSUS retrospective analysis [^111nigdX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Life-sustaining ventilator support

Physicians and parents are cognisant of the perceived futility of medical management and reduced quality of life projected for children with XLMTM. While respiratory support reduces mortality, many survivors become fully reliant on invasive ventilation. Opinion, practice and family decision-making around respiratory support in neuromuscular disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, have changed over decades, and there remains substantial variation in physician practice for recommending life-sustaining care. Concern among medical providers about poor quality of life is often the reason for not proceeding with long-term mechanical ventilation. In North America, however, aggressive non-invasive measuresand indications for tracheostomy in infants and children with neuromuscular diseases have been expanding over recent decades. This may be reflected in the higher proportion of tracheostomised RECENSUS patients from the United States compared with other regions. Although patient numbers are small, results suggest that decisions to not proceed with life-sustaining care occur predominantly within the first 2 months of life. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining ventilator support later in life is often in response to an acute event or significant cumulative morbidities, such as severe hypoxic-ischaemic insults. Practice and ethical considerations of long-term home ventilation in neuromuscular diseases are evolving and will likely continue with the advent of treatments that reduce morbidity and improve quality of life and survival for these patients.

Limitations

Retrospective chart reviews are valuable tools to better understand rare diseases when natural history information is sparse. RECENSUS has helped characterise disease burden and medical management of XLMTM, as well as the extensive ventilator dependence, high mortality and premature death associated with this disease. Studies of diseases with high mortality may be biased towards inclusion of surviving patients (ie, ascertainment bias) due to increased likelihood of consent from living patients' parents and difficulty obtaining ethics committee approval for deceased patients. Survival statistics in RECENSUS must be interpreted with caution due to decreases in patients at risk after childhood. Furthermore, retrospective chart reviews are subject to variable completeness and quality of data compared with the stringent data collection protocols of prospective studies, such as clinical trials.

### Long-term lung volume recruitment therapy maintains ventilator weaning in a patient with ALS following tracheostomy [^112ytvSv]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We report a case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a patient in their 50s, presenting with spastic paraparesis and bulbar palsy, treated with lung volume recruitment therapy (LVRT). From early stage in the disease, vital capacity (VC), lung insufflation capacity (LIC) and ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised scores were regularly measured, and LVRT was continuously performed at home. After 10 years, the patient had complete limb function loss and required nutritional management via gastrostomy and full assistance with daily activities. Despite this, the gap between VC and LIC remained approximately 2000 mL, and the patient was not ventilator-dependent during the day after tracheostomy. Chest CT showed improvement in lower lobe atelectasis due to LVRT. Typically, respiratory physiotherapy is challenging in patients with bulbar palsy or post-tracheostomy, but in this case, LVRT successfully maintained lung mobility. Early LVRT implementation may improve ALS patients' survival prognosis and warrants further exploration.

Regarding respiratory support for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more specifically with respect to invasive ventilation, ACCP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering invasive home mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy as an alternative to noninvasive ventilation in patients failing or intolerant of noninvasive ventilation (including extended daytime noninvasive ventilation use), worsening bulbar function, frequent aspiration, insufficient cough, episodes of chest infection despite adequate secretion management, or declining lung function.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) mechanical ventilation — when counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that the need for mechanical ventilation during the acute presentation alone not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). The predictor refers to endotracheal intubation and subsequent mechanical ventilation without differentiating successful extubation versus prolonged ventilation requiring tracheostomy, and the need for mechanical ventilation does, however, predict a longer and more complicated inpatient stay and the likelihood of intensive-care-unit-acquired complications.

### How to ventilate obstructive and asthmatic patients [^1137bhVF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exacerbations are part of the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Severe exacerbations can cause acute respiratory failure, which may ultimately require mechanical ventilation. This review summarizes practical ventilator strategies for the management of patients with obstructive airway disease. Such strategies include non-invasive mechanical ventilation to prevent intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation, from the time of intubation to weaning, and strategies intended to prevent post-extubation acute respiratory failure. The role of tracheostomy, the long-term prognosis, and potential future adjunctive strategies are also discussed. Finally, the physiological background that underlies these strategies is detailed.

### Long-term survival of critically ill patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UiN7F]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation after critical illness is an emerging public health challenge; however, long-term outcomes are incompletely understood. We aimed to systematically analyse long-term survival of critically ill patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Methods

We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library between 1988 and Nov 6, 2013, with no language restrictions, for studies on prolonged mechanical ventilation. We included studies of adult populations treated with mechanical ventilation for more than 14 days, who were admitted to a ventilator weaning unit, or who had a tracheostomy for acute respiratory failure. We abstracted data with a standardised collection template and assessed study quality (ie, risk of bias) using a customised Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We did a stratified analysis based on study setting (eg, acute vs post-acute care hospitals), and used a random-effects model to calculate pooled statistics (proportions with 95% CIs) for all outcomes. We did sensitivity analyses based on study quality (ie, high-quality studies only) and country of origin (USA vs non-USA and USA vs UK). The primary outcome was mortality at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, discharge destination among survivors, successful liberation from mechanical ventilation while in hospital, and mortality at timepoints longer than 1 year.

Findings

Of 6326 studies identified, 402 underwent full manuscript review, and 124 studies from 16 countries met the inclusion criteria. 39 studies reported mortality at 1 year, which was 59% (95% CI 56–62). Among the 29 high-quality studies, the pooled mortality at 1 year was 62% (95% CI 57–67). Pooled mortality at hospital discharge was 29% (95% CI 26–32). However, only 19% (16–24) were discharged to home and only 50% (47–53) were successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation. For studies in post-acute care hospitals, outcomes were worse in the United States than internationally (mortality at 1 year was 73% [95% CI 67–78] in the United States vs 47% [29–65] in non-USA countries; in-hospital mortality was 31% [26–37] vs 18% [14–24]; and liberation from ventilation was 47% [42–51] vs 63% [59–68]; p < 0.0001 for all).

Interpretation

Although a high proportion of patients survived to hospital discharge, fewer than half of patients survived beyond 1 year. Future studies should focus on optimum patient selection for prolonged mechanical ventilation and integration of long-term outcome information into clinical decision making.

### Late tracheotomy is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients [^114v6WyT]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To determine whether the timing of tracheotomy placement impacts ventilation weaning status and mortality.

Study Design

Multi-institution retrospective cohort study.

Methods

Demographic data, procedural details, and clinical outcomes were recorded for patients undergoing tracheotomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation across eight sites. The study group was divided into two groups: those undergoing tracheotomy within 14 days of initiation of mechanical ventilation and those undergoing tracheotomy at or after 14 days. Groups were compared for primary outcome measures of mortality and ability to wean from mechanical ventilation within the study period.

Results

Of the 539 patients intubated for ventilator dependence with complete data available, 280 (51.9%) underwent tracheotomy within 14 days. Patients who underwent late tracheotomy were 1.72 times more likely to remain ventilator dependent during the follow-up period (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12–2.66), and had a 40% increased risk of death (odds ratio: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.96–1.99).

Conclusions

In this multicenter retrospective review of tracheotomy outcomes, late tracheotomy placement (> 14 days) was associated with increased mortality and prolonged ventilator dependence. Standardized multidisciplinary management protocols for prolonged mechanical ventilation are recommended, and future work should confirm these results in a prospective manner.

### Outcomes of tracheostomized subjects undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation in an intermediate-care facility [^116hYUbr]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of chronically ill subjects with prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) has significantly increased over the last decade because of improvements in acute critical care. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes and care pathways of subjects receiving PMV through a tracheostomy tube in an intermediate-care facility.

Methods

Sixty-six subjects with chronic respiratory failure who experienced 109 hospitalizations between December 2010 and December 2012 in a 34-bed post-care unit were retrospectively included and followed for at least 1 y.

Results

The median (interquartile range [IQR]) length of stay (LOS) was 42 (26–77) d. Subjects were admitted from home (40.4%), our hospital ICU (40.4%; median [IQR] LOS = 17 [7–38] d), or another hospital (19.2%; median [IQR] LOS = 60 [8–71] d, P = 0.001 vs LOS in ICU). Thirty-five percent of subjects were readmitted at least once during the follow-up period. Sixteen subjects died in the intermediate-care facility. Discharge destinations of alive subjects were home (n = 78), another hospital (n = 6), a skilled-nursing facility (n = 5), or an ICU (n = 4). A complete or partial weaning was obtained in 30.3% of subjects. One year after the first day of hospitalization, 57% of subjects were alive.

Conclusions

Despite the chance of survival at 1 y and/or weaning from ventilation, the resources needed by subjects with PMV are high, as shown by the number of readmissions and long LOS in our unit and in other hospital units before transfer.

### The impact of delayed tracheostomy on critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study in a Chinese tertiary hospital [^115SwGMq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Tracheostomy timing was categorized into early tracheostomy (ET), intermediate tracheostomy (IMT), and late tracheostomy (LT) groups according to the duration from tracheal intubation to tracheostomy. We established two criteria to categorize the timing of tracheostomy in order to analyze the data comprehensively: Criteria I (ET ≤ 5 days, 5 days < IMT ≤ 10 days, LT > 10 days) and Criteria II (ET ≤ 7 days, 7 days < IMT ≤ 14 days, LT > 14 days). Baseline characteristics included age, sex, the main reason for hospital admission (coma, neurogenic, respiratory, cardiovascular, or neuromuscular injury, digestive disorder, trauma, and more), type of tracheostomy (surgical or percutaneous). The date of the tracheostomy, tracheal intubation, MV, sedation, and hospital and ICU admissions were also recorded in the electronic case system, based on which tracheostomy timing characteristic could be analyzed. Important parameters for evaluating the timing of tracheostomy and prognosis in patients include the duration of ICU stay, duration of hospital stay, length of MV, and duration of sedation. In this study, patients' primary outcomes were categorized as good prognosis, poor prognosis, or death based on their method of hospital discharge. Patients who met the discharge criteria through assessment by attending physicians and were permitted to be discharged or transferred to a rehabilitation hospital were considered to have a good prognosis. However, in some cases, patients' condition continued to deteriorate and reached a terminal stage. Further medical intervention was deemed futile for these patients, as it only increased their suffering and medical costs. In such situations, clinicians would inform the patients' family members about their condition and poor prognosis. Consequently, some families decided to discharge the patients home, where they could spend their remaining time in the comfort of their own surroundings. Although these patients were still alive upon leaving the hospital, their impending death made their prognosis poor.

### Nine-month outcomes of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective study [^1118f8H1]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The outcome of performing a tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seems promising based on the reported 30-day survival rate. However, long-term outcomes are still lacking. Therefore, our aim in this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of tracheostomy performed in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of 27 COVID-19 patients on whom tracheostomy was performed between February 28, 2020, and April 7, 2020, at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Patients' clinical characteristics, complications, and outcomes were analyzed.

Results

All patients underwent successful bedside tracheostomy. Thirteen patients (48.1%) were successfully weaned off ventilation within 1 month. The survival rate at one, three, and nine months after tracheostomy were 63.0%, 37.0%, and 29.6%, respectively. At nine months after tracheostomy, 8/27 patients had survived, with five (62.5%) being discharged home while the remaining were dependent on nursing care.

Conclusion

The survival rate of COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheotomy decreased markedly from 1 to 3 months after tracheotomy, remaining stable between 3 and 9 months. Medical support is much needed for COVID-19 patients over the first 90 days after tracheotomy.

### Weaning from tracheotomy in long-term mechanically ventilated patients: feasibility of a decisional flowchart and clinical outcome [^114p7tSw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the feasibility of following a decisional flowchart to decide whether to remove tracheotomy in long-term mechanically ventilated patients.

Design and Setting

Prospective study in a respiratory intensive care unit, with beds dedicated to weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Patients and Participants

108 tracheotomized patients with respiratory failure of different causes (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, postsurgical complications, recovery from hypoxemic respiratory failure, neuromuscular disorders), 36 of whom died or could not be weaned from mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

We applied a decisional flowchart based on some simple clinical and physiological parameters aimed at assessing the patient's ability to remove secretions, swallowing function, absence of psychiatric diseases, possibility of reaching spontaneous breathing, and amount of respiratory space.

Measurements and Results

Following our flowchart 56 of the remaining patients were successfully weaned from the tracheotomy cannula, with a reintubation rate at 3 months of 3%. The main reasons for not proceeding to decannulation were inability to remove secretions and severe glottic stenosis. No statistical differences were found between patients who received a surgical or percutaneous tracheotomy.

Conclusions

Using a simple decisional flowchart we were able to remove tracheotomy cannula in almost 80% of the patients with spontaneous breathing autonomy without major clinical complications. Further larger prospective studies are needed to confirm this clinical approach in larger and different populations.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: spontaneous breathing trials for liberation from adult mechanical ventilation [^112Dv3P3]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians–Society of Critical Care Medicine–American Association for Respiratory Care 2001 ventilator weaning/discontinuation guidelines — In patients requiring mechanical ventilation for > 24 h, a search for all causes that may be contributing to ventilator dependence should be undertaken, and reversal of all possible ventilatory and non-ventilatory issues should be an integral part of the ventilator discontinuation process. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure should undergo a formal assessment of discontinuation potential if criteria are satisfied (evidence for some reversal of the underlying cause for respiratory failure, adequate oxygenation and pH, hemodynamic stability, and capability to initiate an inspiratory effort), and formal discontinuation assessments should be done during spontaneous breathing rather than while the patient is still receiving substantial ventilatory support. Removal of the artificial airway after successful discontinuation should be based upon assessments of airway patency and the ability of the patient to protect the airway. Patients who fail a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should have the cause for the failed SBT determined and, once reversible causes are corrected, subsequent SBTs should be performed every 24 h, with interim support provided in a stable, non-fatiguing, comfortable form of ventilatory support. Anesthesia/sedation strategies and ventilator management aimed at early extubation should be used in postsurgical patients, and ICUs should develop and implement weaning/discontinuation protocols for non-physician health care professionals as well as protocols aimed at optimizing sedation. Tracheostomy should be considered after an initial period of stabilization on the ventilator when it becomes apparent that the patient will require prolonged ventilator assistance. Unless there is evidence for clearly irreversible disease, a patient requiring prolonged mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure should not be considered permanently ventilator-dependent until 3 months of weaning attempts have failed; when medically stable for transfer, patients who have failed ventilator discontinuation attempts in the ICU should be transferred to facilities with demonstrated success and safety, and the weaning strategy in the prolonged mechanically ventilated patient should be slow paced and should include gradually lengthening self-breathing trials.

Conclusions

For patients requiring PMV after surgery, cancer diagnosis, no tracheostomy, enteral nutrition intolerance, low platelet count, and dependence on vasopressors and renal replacement therapy on the 21st day of MV were associated with worse 1-year survival. The prognosis in PMV patients in ICUs can facilitate the decision that making process of the physicians and patients' family members on treatment schedule.

### Very old patients admitted to intensive care in Australia and new zealand: a multi-centre cohort analysis [^11155r5c]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Several investigations have shown that very old patients admitted to the ICU receive less aggressive treatment, including mechanical ventilation, when compared with younger cohorts, despite comparable illness severity scores. Boumendil and colleagues conducted a matched-cohort study of over 6,000 patients comparing those aged 65 to 79 years and those aged ≥ 80 years. Patients were matched by sex, surgical status, co-morbid disease, and illness severity. They found that fewer very old patients received mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy. Hamel and colleagues found reduced resource intensity for older patients and a greater likelihood of having renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, tube feeding, and major surgical interventions withheld compared with younger patients. Likewise, there were similar findings in our data – with very old patients less likely to receive mechanical ventilation.

Whether these differences represent active or passive therapeutic limits recommended by clinicians, the preferences by families or patients, or the result of unaccounted confounding factors remains uncertain. This may, however, also indicate that there is a sizeable selection bias for which very old patients are triaged access to ICU support. During a 20-month prospective, single-centre study of 180 very old patients triaged for the ICU, Garrouste-Orgeas and colleagues found that 73% were refused admission. The explanations cited included being too well (28%) or too sick (44%) to benefit from ICU support. Further, Boumendil and colleagues found that those very old patients admitted were in reasonably good health, had fewer fatal underlying diseases, and had fewer complicated surgical interventions. This was also supported by the lower total costs of ICU admission for very old patients, largely attributable to a shorter ICU stay and less invasive therapies (that is, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, renal replacement therapy). These data potentially imply that a comprehensive assessment and careful selection of very old patients for ICU support may deliver positive short-term clinical outcomes.

Management

The management for KOS remains symptomatic, including mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, tube feeding, surgical operation for omphalocele and supportive therapy for developmental delay. In this regard, our thorough survey data in 34 Japanese patients are summarized as follows: (1) mechanical ventilation was required by 32 patients, and was discontinued during infancy in 22 patients, with a median duration of 1 month (range, 0.1–17 months); (2) tracheostomy was performed in approximately one-third of patients; (3) tube feeding was necessary in all but a single patient, and was discontinued in 16 patients, with a median period of ~7.5 months (range, 0.1–89 months); (4) developmental delay was invariably present in 26 patients examined for developmental status, with the median developmental/intellectual quotient of 55 (range, 29–70); and (5) gross motor development was also almost invariably delayed, with head control being achieved at ~7 months (range, 3–14 months), sitting without support at ~12 months (range, 8–27 months) and walking without support at 25.5 months (range, 20–90 months) (except for a single 3-year-old patient who showed head control at 33 months of age because of severe hypotonia) (for the detailed data of individual patient, see Kagami et al.). In addition, periodical screenings for hepatoblastoma are recommended, including serum α-fetoprotein measurement and abdominal ultrasonography.

It is worth emphasizing that patients with KOS become free from mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy and tube feeding, and there is no report of death at ≥ 4 years of age. According to our survey, all patients go to school by themselves and get on their daily lives from childhood, although they have developmental delay. Explaining such a prognosis to parents when their affected child is in infancy and under intensive management is expected to reduce parents' anxiety and to facilitate the attachment formation between parents and the patient.

### Quality improvement in neurology: muscular dystrophy quality measures [^111fAs9K]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary evaluation in MD — Many MDs are associated with pulmonary complications; impending respiratory failure may not be preceded by symptoms, and may only be identified by pulmonary function testing. Respiratory failure is a major source of morbidity, interfering with cognitive function and negatively affecting QOL, and noninvasive ventilation and tracheostomy have improved QOL and survival.

### Tracheostomies for respiratory failure are associated with a high inpatient mortality: a potential trigger to reconsider goals of care [^117FNkXu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute care surgeons are frequently consulted for tracheostomy placement in the intensive care unit (ICU). Tracheostomy may facilitate ventilator weaning and improve physical comfort. Short-term outcomes after tracheostomy are not well studied. We hypothesize that a high proportion of ICU patients who underwent tracheostomy died prior to discharge. These data will help guide clinical decision-making at a key pivot point in care.

Methods

We identified 177 mixed ICU patients who received a tracheostomy for respiratory failure between January 2013 and December 2018. We excluded patients with trauma. Patient information was collected and comparisons made with univariable and multivariable statistics.

Results

Of the 177 patients who underwent a tracheostomy for respiratory failure, 45% were women, median age was 63 (51–71) years. Of this group 18% died prior to discharge, 63% were discharged to a care facility and only 16% discharged home. Compared with survivors, patients with tracheostomies who died during their admission were older, age 69 (64–76) versus 61 (49–71) years (p < 0.01) on univariable analysis. In this model, no single comorbid condition or length of stay (LOS) variable was predictive of death before discharge. A multivariable model controlling for covariation similarly identified age, as well as a longer ICU LOS of 34 (20–49) versus 23 (16–31) days (p = 0.003) as factors associated with increased likelihood of death before discharge.

Conclusions

Tracheostomy placement in a mixed ICU population is associated with a nearly 20% inpatient mortality and the vast majority of surviving patients were discharged to a care facility. This suggests that the need for tracheostomy could be considered a trigger for re-evaluation of patient goals. The high risk of death due to underlying illness and high intensity care after their hospitalization emphasize the need for clear advanced care planning discussions around the time of tracheostomy placement.

### Early versus late tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients [^11617XfC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of early tracheostomy as an intervention for critically ill COVID-19 patients is unclear. Previous reports have described prolonged intensive care stays and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, particularly in those developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pre-pandemic evidence on the benefits of early tracheostomy is conflicting but suggests shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates compared to late tracheostomy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, which comprises CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv, as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 14 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) evaluating early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy during SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill adults irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for NRSIs. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes of our prioritized categories: mortality, clinical status, and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. As the timing of tracheostomy was very heterogeneous among the included studies, we applied GRADE only to studies that defined early tracheostomy as 10 days or less, which was chosen according to clinical relevance.

Main Results

We included one RCT with 150 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 24 NRSIs with 6372 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants were admitted to the ICU, orally intubated and mechanically ventilated. The RCT was a multicenter, parallel, single-blinded study conducted in Sweden. Of the 24 NRSIs, which were mostly conducted in high- and middle-income countries, eight had a prospective design and 16 a retrospective design. We did not find any ongoing studies. RCT-based evidence We judged risk of bias for the RCT to be of low or some concerns regarding randomization and measurement of the outcome. Early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in overall mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.29; RD 67 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 178 fewer to 108 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). As an indicator of improvement of clinical status, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (MD 1.50 days fewer, 95%, CI 5.74 days fewer to 2.74 days more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). As an indicator of worsening clinical status, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in the incidence of adverse events of any grade (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.13; RD 47 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 164 fewer to 102 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence); little to no difference in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.23 to 5.20; RD 3 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 162 more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported need for renal replacement therapy. Early tracheostomy may result in little benefit to no difference in ICU length of stay (MD 0.5 days fewer, 95% CI 5.34 days fewer to 4.34 days more; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). NRSI-based evidence We considered risk of bias for NRSIs to be critical because of possible confounding, study participant enrollment into the studies, intervention classification and potentially systematic errors in the measurement of outcomes. We are uncertain whether early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) increases or decreases overall mortality (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.43 to 5.00; RD 143 more per 1000, 95% CI 174 less to 1218 more; I² = 79%; 2 studies, 719 participants) or duration to liberation from mechanical ventilation (MD 1.98 days fewer, 95% CI 0.16 days fewer to 4.12 more; 1 study, 50 participants), because we graded the certainty of evidence as very low. Three NRSIs reported ICU length of stay for 519 patients with early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) as a median value, which we could not include in the meta-analyses. We are uncertain whether early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days) increases or decreases the ICU length of stay, because we graded the certainty of evidence as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in overall mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation compared with late tracheostomy. In terms of clinical improvement, early tracheostomy may result in little to no difference in duration to liberation from mechanical ventilation compared with late tracheostomy. We are not certain about the impact of early tracheostomy on clinical worsening in terms of the incidence of adverse events, need for renal replacement therapy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or the length of stay in the ICU. Future RCTs should provide additional data on the benefits and harms of early tracheostomy for defined main outcomes of COVID-19 research, as well as of comparable diseases, especially for different population subgroups to reduce clinical heterogeneity, and report a longer observation period. Then it would be possible to draw conclusions regarding which patient groups might benefit from early intervention. Furthermore, validated scoring systems for more accurate predictions of the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation should be developed and used in new RCTs to ensure safer indication and patient safety. High-quality (prospectively registered) NRSIs should be conducted in the future to provide valuable answers to clinical questions. This could enable us to draw more reliable conclusions about the potential benefits and harms of early tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

### Effect of protocolized weaning with early extubation to noninvasive ventilation vs invasive weaning on time to liberation from mechanical ventilation among patients with respiratory failure: the breathe randomized clinical trial [^11322Rjf]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study BREATHE was published by Gavin D Perkins and colleagues in 2018 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Mechanical ventilation and Weaning from mechanical ventilation. In the BREATHE study, the trial question was: what is the role of protocolized weaning with early extubation to noninvasive ventilation in patients with respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation? In the BREATHE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BREATHE study, the population was: 364 patients (180 female, 184 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation > 48 hours and in whom a spontaneous breathing trial failed. The key exclusion criteria were presence of a tracheostomy, contraindications to noninvasive ventilation, profound neurological deficit, home ventilation prior to admission, need for further surgery or sedation. In the BREATHE study, the interventions were: n = 182 noninvasive weaning (extubation and immediate noninvasive ventilation via face mask) n = 182 invasive weaning (continued invasive ventilation until successful spontaneous breathing trial, followed by extubation). In the BREATHE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in time to successful liberation from mechanical ventilation among survivors (4.3 days vs. 4.5 days; aHR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.12). In the BREATHE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in duration of invasive ventilation (1 day vs. 4 day; IRR 0.6, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.87) Significant decrease in ventilator days (3 days vs. 4 days; IRR 0.8, 95% CI 0.62 to 1) No significant difference in tracheostomy (23.6% vs. 30.2%; OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.15). In the BREATHE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, death before ICU discharge. significant difference in antibiotics for presumed respiratory infection (60.4% vs. 70.3%). In the BREATHE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation > 48 hours and in whom a spontaneous breathing trial failed, noninvasive weaning was not superior to invasive weaning with respect to time to successful liberation from mechanical ventilation among survivors.

### Early outcomes from early tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19 [^112tKKZ9]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Decision-making in the timing of tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has centered on the intersection of long-standing debates on the benefits of early vs late tracheostomy, assumptions about timelines of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, and concern over risk to surgeons performing tracheostomy. Multiple consensus guidelines recommend avoiding or delaying tracheostomy, without evidence to indicate anticipated improvement in outcomes as a result.

Objective

To assess outcomes from early tracheostomy in the airway management of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective medical record review was completed of 148 patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation at a single tertiary-care medical center in New York City from March 1 to May 7, 2020.

Interventions

Open or percutaneous tracheostomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were time from symptom onset to (1) endotracheal intubation, (2) tracheostomy; time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy; time from tracheostomy to (1) tracheostomy tube downsizing, (2) decannulation; total time on mechanical ventilation; and total length of stay.

Results

Participants included 148 patients, 120 men and 28 women, with an overall mean (SD) age of 58.1 (15.8) years. Mean (SD; median) time from symptom onset to intubation was 10.57 (6.58; 9) days; from symptom onset to tracheostomy, 22.76 (8.84; 21) days; and from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy, 12.23 (6.82; 12) days. The mean (SD; median) time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation was 33.49 (18.82; 27) days; from tracheostomy to first downsize, 23.02 (13.76; 19) days; and from tracheostomy to decannulation, 30.16 (16.00; 26) days. The mean (SD; median) length of stay for all patients was 51.29 (23.66; 45) days. Timing of tracheostomy was significantly associated with length of stay: median length of stay was 40 days in those who underwent early tracheostomy (within 10 days of endotracheal intubation) and 49 days in those who underwent late tracheostomy (median difference, -8; 95% CI, -15 to -1). In a competing risks model with death as the competing risk, the late tracheostomy group was 16% less likely to discontinue mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.28).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study from the first 2 months of the pandemic in New York City provides an opportunity to reconsider guidelines for tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19. Findings demonstrated noninferiority of early tracheostomy and challenges recommendations to categorically delay or avoid tracheostomy in this patient population. When aligned with emerging evidence about the timeline of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, this approach may optimize outcomes from tracheostomy while keeping clinicians safe.

### Hospital and long-term outcome after tracheostomy for respiratory failure [^112MSBXD]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the patient characteristics, hospital course, hospital cost, posthospital survival, and functional outcome in a group of patients with tracheostomy for respiratory failure.

Design

Retrospective chart review combined with prospective evaluation of functional status.

Setting

An urban, tertiary-care medical center.

Patients

Adult patients with tracheostomy for respiratory failure between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2000.

Methods

Retrospective chart review and prospective administration of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) for health status outcome.

Results

Four hundred twenty-nine patients were studied. Hospital mortality was 19%. Only 57% of survivors were liberated from mechanical ventilation. At 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after discharge, 24%, 30%, 36%, and 42% of hospital survivors had died, respectively. Patients liberated from mechanical ventilation and having their tracheostomy tubes decannulated had the lowest mortality (8% at 1 year); the mortality of ventilator-dependent patients was highest (57%). Sixty-six patients completed the SF-36 for functional status. While emotional health was generally good, physical function was quite limited. Median hospital direct variable cost was $29,340.

Conclusion

Overall survival and functional status are poor in patients with tracheostomy for respiratory failure. Patients who are liberated from mechanical ventilation and have their tracheostomy tubes removed have the best survival; however, it comes at a higher hospital cost and longer length of stay.

### Long-term outcome and health-related quality of life in difficult-to-wean patients with and without ventilator dependency at ICU discharge: a retrospective cohort study [^1155BbdS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 114 patients with a tracheostomy at ICU discharge, of whom 59 still were ventilator dependent and 55 were weaned, were included for survival analysis. This cohort represents 1% of all patients admitted to the MICU, and 7% of all MICU patients requiring tracheostomy during the study period. Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Ventilator-dependent patients had more frequently underlying neuromuscular disease (19% vs. 4%, p = 0.02), and had less often pneumonia (32% vs. 67%, p < 0.001) and septic shock (2% vs. 22%, p < 0.001) as primary cause of acute respiratory failure as compared with weaned patients. A similar number of ventilator-dependent and weaned patients (58%) were referrals from other hospitals. Timing and indication of tracheostomy and length-of-stay at the ICU were not significantly different between both groups. Length-of-stay at the pulmonology department was significantly longer for ventilator-dependent patients vs. weaned patients (46d vs. 29d, p = 0.004) but hospital mortality was similar in both groups. Patient trajectories following ICU discharge are detailed in Fig. 1. Twelve ventilator-dependent patients were subsequently weaned (7 during the same hospitalization episode and 5 at a later date) and nine patients were converted to non-invasive ventilation (5 during the same hospitalization episode and 4 at a later date). Two patients who were weaned at ICU discharge again required ventilator support and tracheostomy at hospital discharge (1 patient) or at a later date (1 patient). Ventilator-dependent patients at ICU discharge were more frequently discharged at home directly as compared to weaned patients (45% vs. 27%, p = 0.05). The number of readmissions following hospital discharge was not significantly different between both groups.

Tracheostomy during COVID-19 — team composition and ventilator circuit guidance state We recommend that in patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure, tracheostomy is performed by a team consisting of the least number of providers with the highest level of experience (Strong Consensus). Remarks: We suggest that prior to the initiation of tracheostomy, a multidisciplinary group of providers including the primary critical care team, palliative care, infectious disease, the procedural and airway team utilize respective expertise to determine the goals of care, patient selection, procedural considerations, as well as workflow to optimize safety of both patient and HCW (Strong Consensus). We suggest that patients be maintained with a closed circuit while on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and with in-line suction (Strong Consensus).

SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS

Resource Allocation

As observed in other countries who are encountering ventilator shortages from a rapidly accelerating number of cases, a shortened ventilator requirement and intensive care unit length of stay may be useful in the allocation of limited resources.

Prognosis of Intubated Patients With COVID-19

However, early data suggests that mortality is high in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In a study of 52 critically ill patients, nonsurvivors compared with survivors were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation [30 (94%) vs 7 (35%)]. Thirty (81%) of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 days. Three of the 20 patients who were survivors were invasively intubated. However, all 3 patients remained intubated at 28 days at the conclusion of the study. There were no patients who were intubated and then successfully extubated and survived by the conclusion of the study. In a cohort of 191 hospitalized patients, 54 were nonsurvivors and 137 were survivors. Thirty-two (17%) were invasively mechanically ventilated, of which 31 were nonsurvivors (57% of all nonsurvivors) and only 1 was a survivor (1% of all survivors).

Unpublished data from Europe suggests that in the most critically ill patients, the duration of invasive ventilation can be as long as 21 days. In a cohort of 101 nonsurvivors in Wuhan, China, the median duration of intubation was 5 days, with an interquartile range of 2–8 days and a total range of 1–31 days. This raises the question as to whether there are patients who were intubated for prolonged periods of time that may have had improved outcomes with a tracheotomy.

### Mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy in multiple sclerosis [^111H6ehv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Decisions on ventilatory support (VS) in multiple sclerosis (MS) are complex. All patients with MS requiring mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy since 1969 (22) at Mayo Clinic were reviewed. Seventeen had progressive (PMS; 11 secondary and six primary progressive) and one had relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). Four had neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Of those with PMS, all but two required a wheelchair or were bedbound before VS and survived a median of 22 months; 14 were mechanically ventilated and seven underwent subsequent lifelong tracheostomy; three had tracheostomy only. The indications (usually multiple) for VS in PMS patients were aspiration pneumonia, poor ventilation because of mucous plugging, mechanical failure, and airway control/protection for seizures and coma. The RRMS patient required mechanical ventilation for 10 days, with subsequent short-term tracheostomy during a brainstem exacerbation. Of the four patients with NMO one made a dramatic recovery after plasmapheresis. Compared with PMS, the NMO group had a shorter time from disease onset to VS, a longer duration of ventilation, and the three patients not treated with plasma exchange or steroids did worse. The prognosis for independent ventilation (± tracheostomy) was worst for patients with NMO, except for one patient who received plasma exchange, and better then expected for PMS, despite poor preventilation functional status.

### Ventilator dependence complications in motor neuron disease [^117FkbU5]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Long-term dependence on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) without time for advance care planning can result in significant complications that may require innovative management strategies. We present the case of a man who was admitted with respiratory failure and required NIV. Despite effective treatment for community acquired pneumonia, attempts to wean NIV failed. While dependent on NIV, a diagnosis of motor neuron disease was made. Time without ventilation was not tolerated and consequently complications of: facial pressure ulceration, nasal septal prolapse, inspissated secretions and failure to feed occurred. This case illustrates the severity of complications that can result from NIV dependence; however, it also details how these can be effectively managed by the hospice multidisciplinary team, with support from experts both within and external to the hospice enabling the acquisition of appropriate skills and knowledge.

### Quality of life in patients with slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders dependent on mechanical ventilation [^113cFJCE]. Thorax (2023). Medium credibility.

This cross-sectional study evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders dependent on mechanical ventilation (MV; ≥ 16hours/day). 119 participants, with 9 years (25th-75th percentiles: 4–15 years) of MV dependence, were included. MV was applied via a tracheostomy in 80 participants (67.2%) and non-invasive interfaces in 39 participants (32.8%), including 28 participants (71.8%) with daytime mouthpiece ventilation. HRQoL was rated good or excellent by 81 participants (68.1%), independently from age, diagnosis or respiratory autonomy. On multivariate analysis, time since MV initiation, independence from family member(s), residence in a rural area, ability to go outdoors with MV and tracheostomy were associated with better HRQoL.

### Effect of protocolized weaning with early extubation to noninvasive ventilation vs invasive weaning on time to liberation from mechanical ventilation among patients with respiratory failure: the breathe randomized clinical trial [^115swKKr]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In adults in whom weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation is difficult, noninvasive ventilation may facilitate early liberation, but there is uncertainty about its effectiveness in a general intensive care patient population.

Objective

To investigate among patients with difficulty weaning the effects of protocolized weaning with early extubation to noninvasive ventilation on time to liberation from ventilation compared with protocolized invasive weaning.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, allocation-concealed, open-label, multicenter clinical trial enrolling patients between March 2013 and October 2016 from 41 intensive care units in the UK National Health Service. Follow-up continued until April 2017. Adults who received invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours and in whom a spontaneous breathing trial failed were enrolled.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either protocolized weaning via early extubation to noninvasive ventilation (n = 182) or protocolized standard weaning (continued invasive ventilation until successful spontaneous breathing trial, followed by extubation) (n = 182).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was time from randomization to successful liberation from all forms of mechanical ventilation among survivors, measured in days, with the minimal clinically important difference defined as 1 day. Secondary outcomes were duration of invasive and total ventilation (days), reintubation or tracheostomy rates, and survival.

Results

Among 364 randomized patients (mean age, 63.1 [SD, 14.8] years; 50.5% male), 319 were evaluable for the primary effectiveness outcome (41 died before liberation, 2 withdrew, and 2 were discharged with ongoing ventilation). The median time to liberation was 4.3 days in the noninvasive group vs 4.5 days in the invasive group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.89–1.40). Competing risk analysis accounting for deaths had a similar result (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.86–1.34). The noninvasive group received less invasive ventilation (median, 1 day vs 4 days; incidence rate ratio, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.47–0.87) and fewer total ventilator days (median, 3 days vs 4 days; incidence rate ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.62–1.0). There was no significant difference in reintubation, tracheostomy rates, or survival. Adverse events occurred in 45 patients (24.7%) in the noninvasive group compared with 47 (25.8%) in the invasive group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients requiring mechanical ventilation in whom a spontaneous breathing trial had failed, early extubation to noninvasive ventilation did not shorten time to liberation from any ventilation.

### Prognostic factors for long-term mortality in critically ill patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation: a systematic review [^1161AJs9]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Long-term survival for patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation is generally poor; however, patient-level factors associated with long-term mortality are unclear. Our objective was to systematically review the biomedical literature and synthesize data for prognostic factors that predict long-term mortality in prolonged mechanical ventilation patients.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from 1988 to 2015 for studies on prolonged mechanical ventilation utilizing a comprehensive strategy without language restriction.

Study Selection

We included studies of adults 1) receiving mechanical ventilation for more than or equal to 14 days, 2) admitted to a ventilator weaning unit, or 3) received a tracheostomy for acute respiratory failure. We analyzed articles that used a multivariate analysis to identify patient-level factors associated with long-term mortality (≥ 6 mo from when the patient met criteria for receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation).

Data Extraction

We used a standardized data collection tool and assessed study quality with a customized Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We abstracted the strength of association between each prognostic factor and long-term mortality. Individual prognostic factors were then designated as strong, moderate, weak, or inconclusive based on an a priori previously published schema.

Data Synthesis

A total of 7,411 articles underwent relevance screening; 419 underwent full article review. We identified 14 articles that contained a multivariate analysis. We abstracted 19 patient-level factors that showed association with long-term mortality. Six factors demonstrated strong strength of evidence for association with the primary outcome: age, vasopressor requirement, thrombocytopenia, preexisting kidney disease, failed ventilator liberation, and acute kidney injury ± hemodialysis requirement. All factors, except preexisting kidney disease and failed ventilator liberation, were measured at the time the patients met criteria for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

Despite the magnitude of the public health challenge posed by the prolonged mechanical ventilation population, only 14 articles in the biomedical literature have tested patient-level factors associated with long-term mortality. Further research is needed to inform optimal patient selection for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

### Long-term survival in patients with tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation in olmsted county, Minnesota [^111R5tFp]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

An increasing number of patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV), which is associated with high morbidity and poor long-term survival, but there are few data regarding the incidence and outcome of PMV patients from a community perspective.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of adult Olmsted county, Minnesota, residents admitted to the intensive care units at the 2 Mayo Clinic Rochester hospitals from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2007, who underwent tracheostomy for PMV.

Results

Sixty-five patients, median age 68 years (interquartile range [IQR] 49–80 y), 39 male, underwent tracheostomy for PMV, resulting in an age-adjusted incidence of 13 (95% CI 10–17) per 100,000 patient-years at risk. The median number of days on mechanical ventilation was 24 days (IQR 18–37 d). Forty-six patients (71%) survived to hospital discharge, and 36 (55%) were alive at 1-year follow-up. After adjusting for age and baseline severity of illness, the presence of COPD was independently associated with 1-year mortality (hazard ratio 3.4, 95% CI 1.4–8.2%).

Conclusions

There was a considerable incidence of tracheostomy for PMV. The presence of COPD was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality.

### Predicting tracheostomy need on admission to the intensive care unit – A multicenter machine learning analysis [^112XXuEm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Across the United States, ~900,000 patients experienced mechanical ventilation, of which approximately 34% underwent a tracheostomy secondary to prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). Approximately 60,000 tracheostomy tubes on averaged are placed across the United States each year. This is often for several general indications such as prolonged intubation, allowance of weaning from the ventilator, upper airway obstruction, and airway protection in neurologic disease or traumatic brain injury. Specifically, prolonged intubation may result in a myriad of airway‐related complications such as laryngotracheal stenosis, vocal fold immobility, vocal fold granulomas, dysphagia, dysphonia, tracheomalacia and tracheoesophageal fistulas amongst others. However, tracheostomies also pose several possible complications including pneumothorax, bleeding, subglottic stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula, vocal cord dysfunction, stomal granulation, persistent tracheal fistula, and scarring. Nevertheless, there is significant variability in selecting when and who should receive a tracheostomy in the ICU. Kishihara et al in a network meta‐analysis of 8 randomized control trials evaluating the tracheostomy timing after mechanical ventilation on patient prognosis, observed a possible reduction in short‐term mortality in tracheostomies performed < 4 days after intubation compared to those performed > 13 days after intubation. However, they noticed no significant difference in adverse events when comparing the same 2 time ranges for tracheostomy. Noemie et al in a meta‐analysis of 9 trials concluded no effect on overall mortality, ICU length of stay, duration of MV, or rates of ventilator‐acquired pneumonia in patients who received a tracheostomy < 10 days versus ≥ 10 days after intubation.

Our study is however one of the few providing long-term outcome data in patients who fail to wean from invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. With further advances in critical care and with the accumulation of comorbidities in an ageing population, this particular patient group is very likely to expand and to impose an increasing burden on our ICUs and overall healthcare delivery. Despite the limitations mentioned above, our data show that at least in selected patients, mechanical ventilation prolonged outside the ICU may be a valuable treatment, both in terms of survival and perceived QOL. However, given the intrinsic limitations of this retrospective and monocentric study, these results should be considered as preliminary, urging for prospective and preferentially multicenter studies to confirm them.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^1142TJfN]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Time-limited trials in serious illness — indications and framing: When surrogates and/or providers face very difficult decisions about initiating major new interventions, or continuing life-sustaining treatments in the face of poor or uncertain prognosis, time-limited trials (TLT) may be considered. These trials are an alternative to the "all-or-nothing treatment" approach and can positively reframe the treatment plan when "the patient or family wants everything", and TLTs are described "as an agreement between clinicians and a patient, and their family or surrogates, to use certain therapies such as: mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, life-sustaining infusions, thoracostomy or ventriculostomy tubes, continuous renal replacement therapy, parenteral/enteral feeding".

Weaning and tracheostomy

Table 4 depicts the variables related to weaning in our population. Carrying out a spontaneous breathing trial and a successful extubation were protective factors for mortality in the univariate analysis. Additionally, 30% of the patients that were successfully extubated received non-invasive ventilation after extubation. Weaning failure with subsequent reintubation occurred in 15% of the patients. Tracheostomy was carried out in 182 (29%) patients under invasive mechanical ventilation 7 (5 to 11) days after endotracheal intubation.

### Ventilator weaning and discontinuation practices in critically ill patients… [^114dsZJE]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Results Among 1868 patients 424 underwent direct extubation, 930 had an initial SBT, 150 underwent direct tracheostomy, and 364 died before a weaning attempt. Data regarding written directives, daily screening, preferred methods of ventilator support, SBT techniques, and sedation and mobilization practices pertaining to IMV and discontinuation were collected. Types of initial IMV discontinuation events were categorized as direct extubation, SBT, or tracheostomy. We defined an SBT as a focused assessment of the patient's capacity to breathe spontaneously with any technique with the goal of discontinuing IMV. Of the 1868 total patients, 424 underwent direct extubation, 930 underwent an initial SBT, 150 underwent direct tracheostomy, and 364 died before a weaning attempt. In regression analyses, patients who underwent an initial SBT were more likely to be older and have solid organ malignancy and hypertension. The main findings were that nearly 50% of patients underwent an initial SBT, of which more than 80% were successful; an initial SBT was associated with higher ICU mortality and longer duration of ventilation and ICU stay; failing the initial SBT in the current study were similar to separation attempts in the WIND.

### Weaning from mechanical ventilation… [^1177TgH5]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

PATIENTS who require mechanical ventilation will either be promptly weaned from the ventilator and the endotracheal tube or require more prolonged ventilatory assistance by means of a tracheostomy. Those who recover ventilatory capacity and effective pulmonary oxygen transport rapidly are better able to participate in procedures designed to promote their recovery and rehabilitation and therefore have the best prognosis. In these patients, the potential hazards of prolonged endotracheal intubation are usually avoided by early weaning. 1 Thus, it is imperative that the respiratory care physician constantly evaluate the need for continued ventilatory support and discontinue it and remove the artificial airway as soon as feasible. The time to consider weaning a patient from the ventilator is immediately after the respiratory emergency has been stabilized.

Therefore, the original indications for ventilatory assistance, the overall clinical condition, and the physiologic resources of the patient must be continuously evaluated.

### Use of feeding tubes among hospitalized older adults with dementia… [^112p7Crg]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 143 331 older adults with dementia, 1312 received a feeding tube while hospitalized, with recipients having higher use of health care resources and increased likelihood of in-hospital death after discharge. Being male or younger and having swallowing problems and greater functional impairments were associated with increased odds of feeding tube use, while having a do-not-resuscitate directive and living in rural settings were associated with reduced odds. Feeding tube recipients were 4 times more likely to have been admitted to the ICU, had a mean length of stay of longer than 2 months, and were more than twice as likely to die in hospital than nonrecipients, suggesting that feeding tube recipients likely had greater frailty than nonrecipients.

We found that large proportions of feeding tube recipients had severe cognitive and functional impairments, and more than half of those in LTC also had a DNH order prior to admission. These findings show that a substantial portion of feeding tube recipients were likely incapable of making decisions, leaving decision making to their family caregivers and physicians. Consistent with most previous studies, 11, 12, 14–19, 21, 46 most of which focused on patients with advanced dementia, our study found no survival benefit of feeding tube insertion in hospitalized patients with dementia, even without restricting to an advanced dementia stage. We found that older adults with dementia who received a feeding tube had higher rates of mortality, rehospitalization, and admission to the emergency department post discharge, in both the short and long term, which concur with past findings.

9, 10, 13, 15, 20, 23, 47 Given high and increased rates of disability and mortality, questions of appropriateness — including consideration of goal-concordant care — should be explored prior to feeding tube insertion in hospitalized patients with dementia. While we acknowledge that a feeding tube may be the appropriate intervention in some cases, the consistently demonstrated lack of benefits to survival and health outcomes for feeding tube recipients suggests that they may benefit more through a holistic palliative care approach rather than this invasive intervention. 1, 13 Appropriate less invasive alternatives do exist, such as assisted feeding. We also found that being male, having high functional impairment, being younger, and having swallowing problems were associated with increased odds of receiving a feeding tube, while having a DNR order and living in rural areas were associated with reduced odds.

### Characteristics and outcomes in adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation… [^115PArLj]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Survival of unselected patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 12 hours was 69%. The main conditions independently associated with increased mortality were factors present at the start of mechanical ventilation, factors related to patient management subsequently required tracheal intubation. Of the 148 patients with ARF who received noninvasive ventilation, 54 subsequently required tracheal intubation. ICU mortality was 14.

3% in patients with successful noninvasive ventilation and
42. 0% in patients needing tracheal intubation after a failed attempt at noninvasive ventilation. Among patients with COPD ventilated because of ARF, ICU mortality was similar in those intubated after a failed attempt at noninvasive. of the following organ failures: cardiovascular, renal failure, hepatic failure, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis. Survival in patients with respiratory failure who required mechanical ventilation for more than 12 hours was 69% and depended not only on factors present when initiating mechanical ventilation but mainly on the development. Clinicians may struggle with the decision to initiate invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COPD because of concern about uncertain prognosis and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Our study found a hospital mortality of 28% in patients with COPD receiving mechanical ventilation due to an acute exacerbation of their disease.

Two retrospective studies involving more than. organ failure markedly decreases survival in ARDS. 7–10, 22, 23, 31 Enrollment criteria that exclude patients with organ failure may partly explain the higher survival in clinical trials than in observational studies. Mortality may also differ depending on the type of organ failure. In the present study, cardiovascular failure and metabolic acidosis carried worse prognosis.

### Early vs late tracheotomy for pneumonia and ventilator days… [^115EkmpB]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

7. 3 j Question Is the timing of tracheostomy placement in critically ill patients associated with the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation. Findings This meta-analysis assessed findings from 17 randomized clinical trials with 3145 participants and found that early tracheotomy in adults undergoing ventilator support for critical illness was associated with improved clinical outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes included VAP and duration of mechanical ventilation. Intensive care unit days and mortality constituted secondary outcomes. Results.

Conclusions and Relevance Compared with late tracheotomy, early intervention was associated with lower VAP rates and shorter durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, but not with reduced short-term, all-cause mortality. These findings have substantial clinical implications and may result in practice changes regarding the timing of tracheotomy in severely ill adults requiring mechanical ventilation. Publication bias was low for all primary and secondary outcomes. Plots can be viewed in eFigures 7 to 11 in the Supplement. Our systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 RCTs showed that early tracheotomy was associated with improvement in 3 major clinical outcomes: VAP, ventilator-free days, and ICU stay. No difference was noted in mortality between early vs late tracheotomy. Herein, we supply an updated comprehensive systematic review and robust meta-analysis comparing clinical outcomes for early and late tracheotomy in critically ill adult patients.

Using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, we examined whether clinical differences were evident in early vs late tracheotomy in critically ill adults. In a combined analysis of 17 trials, early tracheotomy improved VAP, ventilator, and ICU days, but not short-term all-cause mortality. These findings may influence current clinician attitudes and ICU/surgical guidelines entailing the timing of tracheostomy placement.
