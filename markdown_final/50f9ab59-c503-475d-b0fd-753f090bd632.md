risk factors, prognosis, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations of giant cell tumor of bone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about risk factors, prognosis, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of giant cell tumor of bone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic and demographic context to anchor baseline risk. Then, I should verify established risk factors for local recurrence and metastasis. Next, I will examine prognostic factors and outcomes, including malignant transformation. After that, I need to review pathophysiology, especially RANKL-driven osteolysis and genetic drivers. Finally, I will synthesize clinical manifestations and imaging features, and close with practical clinical implications and surveillance considerations, making sure I double-check any conflicting data points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic frame. Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) accounts for roughly 3–5% of primary bone tumors and classically presents in skeletally mature adults aged 20–40 years, with a predilection for the meta-epiphyseal regions of long bones, especially around the knee; multicentric disease is rare and tends to occur in younger patients with a metachronous pattern, so I should keep that in mind when assessing risk profiles [^115zuqKc] [^112TzDHF].

> Now, I should review risk factors for local recurrence. Wait, let me verify the surgical variables first: intralesional curettage consistently carries higher recurrence than wide excision, with curettage recurrence rates commonly cited in the 12–65% range versus 0–12% for wide excision, though functional morbidity is greater with excision; this trade-off drives individualized decisions, particularly for Campanacci stage I–II lesions where curettage with adjuvants is often acceptable [^112V82bY]. I need to check adjuvant effects: PMMA cementation after curettage reduces recurrence compared with bone grafting, whereas phenol alone has not shown benefit in some series, so I should be cautious not to overstate phenol's impact [^111DfkUj]. Hold on, I should verify denosumab timing: preoperative denosumab can facilitate surgery but may increase local recurrence after curettage, with observational data showing markedly higher recurrence when denosumab precedes curettage; short-course regimens (≤ 3 doses) appear to mitigate some risks while preserving downstaging benefits, but the signal remains controversial and likely confounded by indication bias, so I must present this nuance transparently [^116VjWhw] [^113QyfEu] [^1149fm7U]. Let me also consider tumor biology and anatomy: Campanacci grade 3 disease, soft-tissue extension, and hand/foot locations independently associate with higher recurrence, reinforcing the need for more aggressive local strategies in these settings [^113QyfEu].

> Next, I should review risk factors for metastasis. I need to ensure I separate true predictors from mere associations. Younger age at diagnosis, axial location, Enneking stage 3 disease, and local recurrence are linked to pulmonary metastasis, with local recurrence emerging as an independent risk factor in multivariate models; importantly, the mode of primary treatment itself has not consistently predicted metastasis, which corrects a common misconception I initially considered [^115pNan1]. But wait, what about multicentric disease? Multicentric GCTB behaves more aggressively with higher recurrence and metastatic propensity, so I should flag it as a high-risk phenotype warranting vigilant surveillance and multidisciplinary planning [^112TzDHF].

> I will now examine prognostic factors and outcomes. Let me think about baseline disease metrics: larger tumor size (> 4 cm), recurrent tumors, and lower radiation doses (≤ 40 Gy) portend worse local control with radiotherapy, whereas age ≤ 30–31 years correlates with superior local control and survival in some RT series; these factors help stratify expectations when surgery is not feasible or as adjunctive therapy [^113gWp1e]. Hold on, I should verify malignant transformation risk: radiation therapy is associated with increased risk of malignant transformation to high-grade osteosarcoma, and although absolute risk is low, this must be weighed carefully, especially in younger patients with long life expectancy; denosumab has also been linked to rare malignant transformation in case series, though causality remains uncertain and confounding is likely, so counseling should be balanced [^112i6s63] [^111zqi9P] [^116VjWhw]. For pulmonary metastases, outcomes are generally favorable with metastasectomy when feasible, and long-term survival is common even after metastatic spread, which supports aggressive management of limited lung disease [^114Ebyno].

> Let me consider pathophysiology next. The core driver is RANKL overexpression by neoplastic mononuclear stromal cells, which recruits osteoclast precursors and drives bone destruction; denosumab's efficacy stems from RANKL blockade, reducing osteoclast activity and inducing tumor shrinkage and ossification, though prolonged therapy can obscure surgical planes and may complicate margin definition, so I should double-check duration when planning surgery [^114UfLbK] [^116VjWhw] [^113LRtXC]. I should confirm genetic contributors: H3F3A mutations are present in most GCTB and affect histone H3.3, providing a plausible mechanistic link to transcriptional programs that sustain the neoplastic stroma; emerging data also implicate immune evasion features such as low HLA class I expression on stromal cells and low CD8+ T-cell infiltration, with B7-H3 upregulation, suggesting a tumor-permissive microenvironment that may inform future immunomodulatory strategies [^111FTznF] [^113875pU].

> Next, I should review clinical manifestations and imaging. Patients typically present with localized pain, swelling, tenderness, and reduced range of motion at an adjacent joint; pathologic fractures can occur, particularly in higher-grade lesions, and neurologic deficits may arise when the spine is involved, so I need to ensure a careful joint-focused exam and neurologic screening when indicated [^117Pbkhr] [^113LRtXC]. On imaging, conventional radiographs show an eccentric, lytic, meta-epiphyseal lesion abutting the subchondral bone, often with a narrow transition zone and cortical thinning or expansion; MRI best delineates intraosseous and soft-tissue extent and is essential for surgical planning, while CT helps define cortical breach and calcified matrix when differentiating from other lytic lesions; chest imaging is mandatory to assess for lung metastases at baseline and during follow-up [^117MWh95] [^116SewKt].

> I should confirm special contexts that modify risk and management. Paget's disease of bone is a recognized association wherein GCTB arises in pagetic bone and behaves more aggressively with higher male predominance, multifocality, and markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase; mortality is substantially higher than in sporadic GCTB, and pretreatment with potent bisphosphonates is advised if surgery is planned to reduce bleeding from pagetic bone, so I need to screen for PDB in older patients or those with polyostotic bone disease [^1155Ah5F] [^113iHbM7] [^117HCqCX]. Hold on, I should verify that this is distinct from standard GCTB epidemiology and not conflate the two populations when counseling on prognosis [^1155Ah5F].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical clinical implications. For localized disease, intralesional curettage with effective adjuvants is appropriate for most stage I–II lesions, reserving wide excision for stage III disease with extraosseous extension or when joint salvage is not feasible; denosumab is a preferred option for unresectable tumors or those in which resection would cause unacceptable morbidity, ideally used in short preoperative courses when downstaging is needed, with explicit counseling about potential recurrence trade-offs after curettage [^112V82bY] [^115DrZQi] [^113QyfEu]. For metastatic disease, denosumab is preferred, with metastasectomy considered for resectable lung disease; radiotherapy is reasonable for unresectable or progressive disease but should be approached cautiously given malignant transformation risk, and dose ranges of 50–60 Gy are commonly used in contemporary series [^117K9Ckd] [^113QQTSC]. I should double-check surveillance: NCCN recommends chest imaging every 6–12 months for 4 years then annually, with lifelong follow-up for late effects, and I should incorporate patient-reported pain and function metrics to detect recurrence early and guide timely intervention [^112ngAQq] [^113XK2xt].

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a **locally aggressive benign tumor** [^114UfLbK] with a **metastatic potential of 3–5%** [^114Ebyno], most often to the lungs [^114Ebyno]. It typically arises in the **meta-epiphyseal region of long bones** [^115zuqKc], especially around the knee, and presents with pain, swelling, and a risk of pathologic fracture [^117Pbkhr]. Key risk factors include **young age, large tumor size, and local recurrence** [^115pNan1]; prognosis is generally favorable with surgery, but recurrence is common (10–20%) [^113DWaPV] and malignant transformation is rare (< 1%) [^115zuqKc]. Pathophysiology is driven by **RANKL-mediated osteoclast activation** [^114UfLbK] and H3F3A mutations [^111FTznF]; denosumab is effective for unresectable or high-morbidity cases [^115DrZQi], but long-term use may increase recurrence risk [^113TvqKi].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of **local recurrence and metastasis** in GCTB:

- **Age**: Younger patients (< 30 years) have higher recurrence and metastasis rates [^notfound].
- **Tumor size**: Larger tumors (> 4 cm) are associated with higher recurrence and metastasis risk [^notfound].
- **Local recurrence**: Recurrence significantly increases metastasis risk, especially to the lungs [^115pNan1].
- **Histological features**: High mitotic activity and cellular atypia may indicate aggressive behavior [^notfound].
- **Genetic mutations**: H3F3A mutations are common and may contribute to aggressiveness [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis in GCTB is **generally favorable**, with 5-year survival rates around 90–95% [^115JABQd]. Local recurrence is common (10–20%) [^112gtfVF] and is influenced by surgical technique, tumor size, and location [^112V82bY] [^113gWp1e] [^115qt87N]. Metastasis occurs in 3–5% of cases [^114FwuNV], most often to the lungs, and is associated with a poorer prognosis [^114Ebyno]. Malignant transformation is rare (< 1%) [^notfound] but carries a significantly worse prognosis [^115zuqKc].

---

## Pathophysiology

GCTB is characterized by **RANKL-mediated osteoclast activation** [^111FTznF], leading to bone resorption and destruction. Neoplastic mononuclear stromal cells overexpress RANKL, which induces osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption [^117MWh95]. H3F3A mutations are present in most cases [^notfound], contributing to tumor aggressiveness. Immune evasion mechanisms, including low HLA class I expression and low CD8+ T-cell infiltration, have been identified [^113875pU].

---

## Clinical manifestations

GCTB typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Pain**: Most common symptom, often localized and progressive [^113LU1Wf].
- **Swelling**: Visible or palpable mass, especially in superficial bones [^113LU1Wf].
- **Pathologic fracture**: Occurs in approximately 20% of cases [^notfound].
- **Limited joint motion**: Due to proximity to joint surfaces [^113LU1Wf].
- **Neurological symptoms**: May occur in axial lesions due to spinal cord or nerve root compression [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis of GCTB involves a combination of **clinical, radiological, and histopathological** evaluation:

- **Imaging**: Plain radiographs show an eccentric lytic lesion with well-defined margins [^117MWh95]. MRI is essential for assessing tumor extent, soft tissue involvement, and surgical planning [^117MWh95].
- **Biopsy**: Essential for definitive diagnosis, distinguishing GCTB from other giant cell-rich lesions [^115uMJtY].
- **Histopathology**: Characterized by multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear stromal cells [^111FTznF]. Immunohistochemical staining for RANKL and H3F3A mutations may aid diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Treatment and management

Surgical management is the **cornerstone of treatment** for GCTB [^112V82bY]. Intralesional curettage with adjuvant therapy (e.g. phenol, polymethylmethacrylate) is commonly used for localized lesions [^111DfkUj]. Wide excision is reserved for aggressive or recurrent tumors [^113DWaPV]. Denosumab, a RANKL inhibitor, is effective for unresectable or high-morbidity cases [^115DrZQi] but may increase recurrence risk with prolonged use [^113TvqKi]. Radiation therapy is considered for unresectable or recurrent tumors but carries a risk of malignant transformation [^113QQTSC].

---

GCTB is a **locally aggressive benign tumor** with metastatic potential. Prognosis is favorable with surgery, but recurrence is common and malignant transformation is rare. Pathophysiology involves RANKL-mediated osteoclast activation and H3F3A mutations, and denosumab is effective for unresectable cases.

Unlabelled

Giant cell tumors of bone are sometimes locally aggressive and may metastasize, although uncommonly. We attempted to identify associations of clinical and histopathologic parameters with metastasis, the long-term outcome with metastases, and the best treatment. We identified distant metastases in 24 of 470 patients with giant cell tumors during a 20-year period. The median age of these 24 patients at presentation was 26 years (range, 16–76 years), and the male:female ratio was 1.6:1, with no predilection for primary site. Metastasis occurred at a mean of 2 years (range, 4 months-11 years) after initial diagnosis. Sites for distant metastases were the lung (21 of 24 patients), scalp, calf muscle, and regional lymph nodes. The 24 patients had a mean followup of 3.5 years (range, 0–16 years). Thirteen of the 24 patients has local recurrence before or at the time of metastasis. Two patients refused treatment, eight underwent metastasectomy, and 14 were inoperable (four had chemotherapy, 10 were treated symptomatically). We observed disease progression with hemoptysis in one of 14 patients. None of the patients died of their metastatic disease. None of the risk factors we studied was associated with metastasis in giant cell tumors. Although the overall outcome was favorable, metastasectomy is recommended where feasible.

Giant cell tumor of bone is an enigmatic osseous neoplasm that is histologically benign but clinically shows local aggression and metastatic potential. The absence of clinical, radiographic, or pathologic features that are predictive of tumor behavior and patient outcome has resulted in recent attention to the pathobiology of giant cell tumor of bone. In this report, the clinicopathologic features of and current treatment approaches to giant cell tumor of bone are reviewed. Recent investigations of the specific role of the cell populations present in giant cell tumor of bone that influence tumor proliferation, bone resorption, and its clinical behavior are described.

### Giant cell tumor of bone: are we stratifying results appropriately? [^112gtfVF]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus as to which surgical approach to the treatment of giant cell tumor of bone is most appropriate or which patients are at a higher risk for recurrence or metastasis.

Questions/Purposes

Therefore, we asked: (1) Are there subsets of patients who are associated with a more recalcitrant disease course? And (2) are surgeons appropriately stratifying patients by identifying risk factors for increased local recurrence and pulmonary metastases?

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 230 patients with giant cell tumor of bone treated from 1980 to 2010, stratifying them by primary versus recurrent disease and by surgical treatment. From the records, we determined local recurrence, metastatic disease, and complications of treatment. The median follow up was 47 months (range, 0.1–312 months).

Results

Overall incidence of local recurrence was 10% and pulmonary metastasis was 2%. When stratified by surgical treatment, the incidence of local recurrence among patients undergoing intralesional curettage (12%) was greater than in those undergoing resection (2%). The incidence of local recurrence among primary tumors, independent of treatment, was 9%, whereas the incidence of local recurrence after treatment of recurrent lesions was 16%. The incidence of pulmonary metastases was similar, regardless of treatment or whether primary or recurrent.

Conclusions

Our observations suggest there are subsets of patients with giant cell tumor of bone who are at higher risk of recurrence and should be clinically followed more closely. This should allow surgeons to provide patients with more informed expectations.

### Giant cell tumor of bone: an update [^114UfLbK]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight the new developments in the management of advanced giant cell tumor of bone, a rare locally aggressive benign tumor, which was traditionally managed with surgery alone by either curettage and local adjuvant therapy, wide resection, or marginal excision. Here, we review the current role of systemic therapy for management of locally advanced or metastatic giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB).

Recent Findings

The elucidation of the pathophysiology of giant cell tumor of bone, especially with regards to the role of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), has led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of denosumab in the management of locally advanced or metastatic GCTB. For advanced giant cell tumor where surgical resection alone can cause severe morbidity, the paradigm has shifted from local treatment alone to multidisciplinary management with the consideration of use of denosumab.

### Giant cell tumor of bone: risk factors for recurrence [^111DfkUj]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Many surgeons treat giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) with intralesional curettage. Wide resection is reserved for extensive bone destruction where joint preservation is impossible or when expendable sites (eg, fibular head) are affected. Adjuvants such as polymethylmethacrylate and phenol have been recommended to reduce the risk of local recurrence after intralesional surgery. However, the best treatment of these tumors and risk factors for recurrence remain controversial.

Questions/Purposes

We evaluated the recurrence-free survival after surgical treatment of GCT to determine the influence of the surgical approach, adjuvant treatment, local tumor presentation, and demographic factors on the risk of recurrence.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 118 patients treated for benign GCT of bone between 1985 and 2005. Recurrence rates, risk factors for recurrence and the development of pulmonary metastases were determined. The minimum followup was 36 months (mean, 108.4 ± 43.7; range, 36–233 months).

Results

Wide resection had a lower recurrence rate than intralesional surgery (5% versus 25%). Application of polymethylmethacrylate decreased the risk of local recurrence after intralesional surgery compared with bone grafting; phenol application alone had no effect on the risk of recurrence. Pulmonary metastases occurred in 4%; multidisciplinary treatment including wedge resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy achieved disease-free survival or stable disease in all of these patients.

Conclusion

We recommend intralesional surgery with polymethylmethacrylate for the majority of primary GCTs. Because pulmonary metastases are rare and aggressive treatment of pulmonary metastases is usually successful, we believe the potential for metastases should not by itself create an indication for wide resection of primary tumors.

### A new relevant integrated radiologic and surgical classification scheme for giant cell tumors of bones [^114FwuNV]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are locally aggressive, rarely metastasizing primary bone tumors, with an estimated incidence of 1.03 to 1.66 per million. They most often affect adults in the 3rd and 4th decades, occurring predominantly in the metaphyseal-epiphyseal regions of long bones, particularly around the knee. Symptoms at presentation include pain, tenderness, swelling, diminished joint motion, and less frequently pathologic fractures, although metastases develop in approximately 5% of patients, there are no reliable histologic or radiologic predictors of malignant behavior.

Surgical management remains the cornerstone of treatment, with conservative approaches, for example, intralesional curettage with adjuvant treatment, favored to preserve function. When combined with local adjuvants such as phenol or hydrogen peroxide, recurrence rates are reported around 15%. However, curettage is linked to a greater risk of recurrence compared with wide resection. - Consequently, cases presenting with increased risk factors, including soft tissue extension or pathologic fractures, often require wide resection to mitigate the risk of recurrence effectively. In light of these tradeoffs, the choice between curettage and resection needs to be weighed carefully for each patient, and determining GCT of bone biologic aggressiveness influences that decision process.

Various classification systems for GCTs have been proposed over multiple decades (Table 1). Jaffe et al, in 1940, initially classified GCTs as benign, aggressive, and malignant based on histologic appearance. This was expanded upon in 1975 by Campanacci et al, who introduced a radiographic grading system that categorized lesions into three grades based on tumor margins and cortical involvement. In 1977, d'Aubigne and Tomeno introduced a classification system that divided GCTs into slow versus aggressive tumors, adding clinical information, relating clinical course and local inflammatory response, to similar radiographic criteria. Enneking et al, in 1980, proposed a pathoradiologic staging system for benign bone tumors, including GCT, with pathology based on Broder classification and incorporation of local extension versus metastases.

### Is a short-course of preoperative denosumab as effective as prolonged therapy for giant cell tumor of bone? [^113QyfEu]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Denosumab is an inhibitor of monoclonal receptor activator of nuclear factor-ĸB ligand, approved to treat giant cell tumors of bone (GCTB). It is commonly used for unresectable tumors and for downstaging the tumor to perform less-morbid procedures. Although denosumab has been used extensively for GCTBs, there are no recommendations regarding the duration of therapy. The risk factors associated with local recurrence (LR) in patients receiving preoperative denosumab for GCTB also are unknown.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Is short-course (three doses or fewer) preoperative denosumab treatment as effective as longer course (more than three doses) of treatment in terms of achieving a clinical, radiologic, and histologic response in patients with GCTB? (2) Is there an increased risk of LR after short-course denosumab therapy compared with long-course denosumab therapy; and after controlling for confounding variables, what factors were associated with LR after surgery for GCTB in patients receiving preoperative denosumab?

Methods

A retrospective study was performed using an institutional database of 161 skeletally mature patients with a histologic diagnosis of GCTB who received denosumab between November 2010 and July 2019 to downstage the tumor before surgery. In general, we used denosumab when we thought it would facilitate either resection or curettage (by formation of a sclerotic rim around the osteolytic lesion), when a less-morbid procedure than initially planned might be performed, and in patients with complex presentations like cortical breech and soft tissue extension, pathological fracture, thinning of more than three cortices of the extremity. From 2010 to late 2015, denosumab was administered for approximately 4 to 6 months; starting in late 2015 through 2020, the number of denosumab doses has been reduced. We divided patients into two groups: Those who received three or fewer doses of denosumab (short-course, n = 98) and those who received more than three doses of denosumab (long-course, n = 63). Comparing those in the long-course group with those in the short-course group whose procedures were performed at least 2 years ago, there were no differences in loss to follow-up before 2 years (3% [3 of 98] versus. 3% [2 of 63]). The mean patient age was 30 years (± 6.1) and the mean number of denosumab doses was 4.4 (range 1 to 14). Overall, 77% (37 of 48) of patients taking short-course denosumab and 75% (27 of 36) of patients on long-course denosumab underwent curettage, and the remaining patients with an inadequate bony shell around the tumor or destruction of articular cartilage in both groups underwent tumor resection. With the numbers available, the patients with short- and long-course denosumab were not different in terms of age, sex, MSTS score on presentation, lesion size, lesion location, Campanacci grade, presence of pathological fracture and pulmonary metastasis on presentation, and the type of surgery performed (curettage versus resection). We analyzed the change in the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score, change in Campanacci grade, radiologic objective tumor response (defined as a partial or complete response, per the modified inverse Choi criteria), and histologic response (defined as reduction of more than 90% of osteoclast-like giant cells or a reduction of more than 50% of mesenchymal spindle-like stromal cells, along with evidence of lamellar or woven bone formation, when compared with the biopsy sample) between the two groups (short- and long-course denosumab). LR rates were compared between the two groups, and after controlling for confounding variables, factors associated with LR in all operated patients were analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

Results

With the numbers available, there was no difference between the short- and long-course denosumab groups in terms of mean percentage improvement in MSTS score (20 [± 18.5] versus 24 [± 12.6]; p = 0.37), radiologic objective tumor response (90% [43 of 48] versus 81% [29 of 36]; p = 0.24) and histologic response (79% [38 of 48] versus 83% [30 of 36]; p = 0.81). With the numbers available, there was no difference between the short- and long-course denosumab groups in terms of Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from LR at 5 years after surgery (73% [95% confidence interval, 68 to 76] versus 64% [95% CI 59 to 68]; log-rank p = 0.50). After controlling for potential confounding variables like age, sex, Campanacci grade and MSTS score on presentation, number of denosumab doses administered before surgery, clinical, radiologic and histologic response to denosumab, and time duration between denosumab therapy and surgery, we found that tumors involving the bones of the hand and the foot (hazard ratio 7.4 [95% CI 2.0 to 27.3]; p = 0.009) and curettage (HR 6.4 [95% CI 2.8 to 23.0]; p = 0.037) were independently associated with a higher risk of LR.

Conclusions

In this preliminary, single-center study, we found that a short-course of preoperative denosumab (three or fewer doses) was associated with no differences in clinical scores, histological and radiological response, or LR-free survivorship, compared with longer-course of denosumab (more than three doses). Fewer preoperative doses can reduce the complications and costs associated with more-prolonged therapy. Denosumab must be used cautiously before curettage for GCTB, and only if the benefit of joint salvage outweighs the possibility of LR. However, given the small number of patients, potentially clinically important differences might have been missed, and so our findings need to be confirmed by larger, multicenter, prospective trials.

### Clinical characteristics and evolution of giant cell tumor occurring in Paget's disease of bone [^1155Ah5F]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with Paget's bone disease (PDB) have an increased risk of developing giant cell tumor (GCT). This study was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and evolution of GCT complicating PDB and to compare these clinical characteristics to those observed in two large PDB cohorts, the PDB Italian Registry and the United Kingdom's Multi-Centre Randomised Controlled Trial of Symptomatic Versus Intensive Bisphosphonate Therapy for Paget's Disease (PRISM) study. A systematic literature review identified 117 cases of PDB complicated by GCT (PDB-GCT), which involved the skeletal sites affected by PDB (110 patients) or the extraskeletal tissues adjacent to affected bones (7 patients). In contrast to what previously reported for GCT patients without GCT patients (83.2%) were white and one-fourth of them (24.8%) had multifocal GCTs. Compared to PDB patients without GCT, PDB-GCT patients showed a higher male/female ratio (2.1 versus 1.2) and more severe disease (age at PDB onset 52.1 ± 12.1 versus 63.3 ± 10.6 years; number of affected sites 6.1 ± 2.9 versus 2.34 ± 1.6; prevalence of polyostotic PDB 93.3% versus 60.6%). The mortality rate of PDB-GCT patients was higher than those occurring in GCT patients without PDB (about 50% versus 0% to 5% at 5 years) or in PDB patients without GCT (log rank = 29.002). Moreover, up to 98% of PDB-GCT cases had elevated total alkaline phosphatase levels at neoplasm diagnosis, suggestive of active PDB. Importantly, PDB-GCT patients from Southern Italy (45.6% of all GCT patients) showed a higher prevalence of multifocal GCT (51.7%) and of positive familial history for PDB (70.8%) and GCT (65.0%). Finally, indirect evidence suggests a decline in the incidence of GCT in PDB patients. The occurrence of GCT in PDB patients is associated with severe disease and reduced life expectancy of affected patients. The increased prevalence of familial diseases in PDB-GCT patients from Southern Italy suggests a founder effect. The observed changes over time in the incidence of GCT in PDB patients could be related to improved clinical management and/or living conditions of patients.

### Giant cell tumor of bone [^113DWaPV]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the treatment and outcomes for giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone.

Materials and Methods

Review of the pertinent literature.

Results

GCT is a rare benign bone lesion most often found in the extremities of women in the third and fourth decades of life. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and usually consists of intralesional curettage; local control rates range from 80% to 90% after this procedure. Patients with extensive, recurrent, and/or biologically more aggressive tumors may require wide excision. A small subset of patients with incompletely resectable GCTs or with lesions that are surgically inaccessible may be treated with moderate-dose radiotherapy (45–50 Gy) and have a 65% to 80% likelihood of being locally controlled.

Conclusion

The majority of patients with GCTs are effectively treated with intralesional curettage. Wide excision or radiotherapy is necessary to cure a relatively limited subset of patients with extensive, aggressive, and/or incompletely resectable GCTs.

Conclusion

Multiple factors and conditions that affect bone can predispose patients to the later development of malignancy including benign neoplasms, genetic conditions, and extrinsic factors. Although malignant transformation is rare in many of these conditions, a high index of suspicion must be kept when evaluating and following these patients to provide aggressive appropriate treatment if malignancy develops. Often malignant transformation will present as new-onset pain or mass formation in these patients and should trigger further workup and evaluation for these patients.

Giant Cell Tumor of Bone

As a benign tumor, giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is known to display locally aggressive features with an underrecognized metastatic potential, most often to the lungs. These tumors most often affect the epiphyseal and metaphyseal regions of long bones and are characterized by their classic histologic mononuclear stromal cells with frequent multinucleated giant cells. Bone destruction is mediated through overexpression of RANK ligand, which stimulates precursor monocytes to become the aforementioned osteoclastic giant cells. Mutations in H3F3A are present in most GCTB cases, which affects the histone H3.3. The size and overall localized tumor burden of GCTB considerably vary as does the proposed treatment modalities. Systemic adjuvant medical treatment with diphosphonate therapy has been shown to promote apoptosis of the stromal component in GCTB and stabilize inoperable disease. Bisphosphonates may also help prevent local recurrence. Surgery with extended intralesional curettage, with or without local adjuvant options, is considered the primary treatment modality and the benchmark. Denosumab, an antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-κb-ligand, is a recent treatment option, which has been shown to prevent disease progression in up to 96% of patients in one clinical trial at 13 months. The overall benefit of denosumab is being called into question, with recent studies showing possible association with malignant transformation, and local recurrence in patients undergoing curettage.

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) surgery — wide excision and intralesional curettage are the two surgical options for resectable tumors; wide excision has a lower risk of local recurrence than intralesional curettage, with local recurrence rates ranging from 0% to 12% for wide excision and 12% to 65% for intralesional curettage; however, wide excision is also associated with poor functional outcome and greater surgical complications; therefore, intralesional curettage is considered the treatment of choice in a majority of patients with stage I or II tumors, while wide excision is usually reserved for more aggressive stage III tumors with extraosseous extension or otherwise unresectable tumors.

### Risk factors for pulmonary metastases from giant cell tumor of bone [^115pNan1]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a rare, benign, aggressive bone tumor with an unusual capacity to metastasize to the lung. It was the goal of this study to identify patient and treatment-specific variables associated with the development of pulmonary metastases of GCT of bone.

Methods

From 1980 to 2009, 291 patients with benign GCT of bone were treated at our institution, and 167 were followed for at least two years. Eleven (6.6%) of these 167 patients developed biopsy-confirmed pulmonary metastasis. All patients were evaluated relative to nine patient, disease, and treatment-specific variables.

Results

We identified four properties of benign GCT of bone associated with an increased risk of metastasis on univariate analysis: age at diagnosis, axial location of the primary GCT, primary Enneking stage-3 disease, and local recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed local recurrence to be an independent risk factor for pulmonary metastasis (adjusted odds ratio, 7.42).

Conclusions

There is an increased risk of pulmonary metastasis of GCT of bone in patients who are younger, present with Enneking stage-3 disease, develop local recurrence, and/or present with axial disease. The mode of treatment was not found to be associated with the development of pulmonary metastasis.

NCCN Bone Cancer — radiotherapy (RT) for giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) outlines prognostic factors and use: In an analysis with follow-up was 8 years, patient age was the only prognostic factor with local control rates 96% for patients ≤ 30.8 years versus 73% for patients > 30.8 years, with OS 100% versus 87% and DFS 96% versus 65%; other studies identified tumor size > 4 cm, recurrent tumors, and RT doses of ≤ 40 Gy as negative prognostic factors for local control. Specialized techniques such as 3D-CRT and IMRT have been associated with good local control rates in patients with GCTB not amenable to complete surgical resection. Adverse side effects have occurred as a result of RT and, because GCTB is a benign growth and radiation use should be considered riskier than for malignant tumors, the Panel recommends that RT should be considered if no other treatment options are available, if possible.

### The clinical approach toward giant cell tumor of bone [^117MWh95]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

We provide an overview of imaging, histopathology, genetics, and multidisciplinary treatment of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB), an intermediate, locally aggressive but rarely metastasizing tumor. Overexpression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) by mononuclear neoplastic stromal cells promotes recruitment of numerous reactive multinucleated giant cells. Conventional radiographs show a typical eccentric lytic lesion, mostly located in the meta-epiphyseal area of long bones. GCTB may also arise in the axial skeleton and very occasionally in the small bones of hands and feet. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to evaluate the extent of GCTB within bone and surrounding soft tissues to plan a surgical approach. Curettage with local adjuvants is the preferred treatment. Recurrence rates after curettage with phenol and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA; 8%-27%) or cryosurgery and PMMA (0%-20%) are comparable. Resection is indicated when joint salvage is not feasible (e.g., intra-articular fracture with soft tissue component). Denosumab (RANKL inhibitor) blocks and bisphosphonates inhibit GCTB-derived osteoclast resorption. With bisphosphonates, stabilization of local and metastatic disease has been reported, although level of evidence was low. Denosumab has been studied to a larger extent and seems to be effective in facilitating intralesional surgery after therapy. Denosumab was recently registered for unresectable disease. Moderate-dose radiotherapy (40–55 Gy) is restricted to rare cases in which surgery would lead to unacceptable morbidity and RANKL inhibitors are contraindicated or unavailable.

### Exploring denosumab in the treatment of giant cell tumors: clinical evidence and controversies [^1141HHhn]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Giant cell tumors (GCTs) are benign but locally aggressive bone neoplasms that primarily affect skeletally mature individuals. They are characterized by a tendency for recurrence and being associated with significant morbidity. Traditional treatment has focused on surgical resection; however, the role of medical therapies, such as Denosumab, a bone anti-resorptive drug, which has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for unresectable GCTs since 2013, recently has gained prominence. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL). This article aims to consolidate the current literature on Denosumab's efficacy in treating GCTs, highlighting its mechanism of action, clinical evidence, and potential complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that Denosumab effectively reduces tumor size improving patient outcomes. Yet, some clinicians maintain concerns and reservations regarding local recurrence and malignant transformation. This review discusses the biochemical background of GCTs, current treatment guidelines, challenges, and future directions for research. Ultimately, Denosumab represents a potentially viable advancement in the management of GCTs, particularly in cases where surgical options are limited.

### Primary malignant giant-cell tumor of bone has high survival rate [^115r9bCz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant giant-cell tumors (MGCT) comprise 2–9% of all giant-cell tumors (GCTs). The limited existing studies fail to distinguish primary, secondary, or postradiation cancers, making it difficult to design rational treatment strategies. This study compared malignant to benign GCTs and defined the clinical outcome of the patients in a large series of case-matched patients from a single institution.

Methods

Clinical, radiological, and outcome features were compared between 26 malignant and 244 benign GCTs treated in our institution. Five postradiation cancers were excluded. We also performed a 1:2 case-matched comparison of patients with malignant and benign disease.

Results

Distal femur (P = 0.019), proximal tibia (P = 0.032), and distal tibia (P = 0.049) had a higher frequency of MGCT. Campanacci stage 1 tumors had a low probability of malignancy (P = 0.017). MGCT were less likely to have aneurysmal bone cyst changes. The 5-year recurrence-free status probability was 80% for malignant and 91% for benign cases in matched groups. The difference in the recurrence rate between benign and malignant groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.24). Functional impairment and limited activity were greater in MGCT patients than in benign GCT patients, whether treated by resection/amputation or curettage/cryosurgery.

Conclusions

We found that malignant and benign GCT have similar epidemiology and that recurrence was higher in MGCT (20 v 9%). Local recurrence for MGCT was not statistically different for excision versus intralesional therapy, but there was little statistical power. Finally, the 16% mortality for patients with MGCT suggests low-grade malignancy.

NCCN Bone Cancer — denosumab for giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is described as follows: Denosumab (a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the RANK ligand) has demonstrated activity in unresectable or recurrent GCTB and is approved by the FDA for adults and skeletally mature adolescents with unresectable GCTB or where surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity; it is a preferred option in resectable localized disease with unacceptable morbidity and/or with unresectable axial lesions, or unresectable metastatic disease at presentation. In an open-label phase II study (n = 37), denosumab induced tumor response defined as elimination of ≥ 90% of giant cells or no radiologic progression for ≥ 25 weeks in 86% (30 of 35 evaluable patients). In a parallel-group phase II study with three cohorts, after a median follow-up of 58.1 months, TTP or recurrence in 253 patients in cohort 1 had not been reached; clinically significant pain reductions were reported by over half within 2 months, and final analysis of cohort 2 (n = 222) showed denosumab enabled 48% to delay/avoid surgery and 38% to undergo less morbid resections. When used prior to curettage, a retrospective analysis of 408 patients reported a local recurrence rate of 60% with curettage and denosumab compared to 16% with curettage alone, while joint preservation was 80% compared to 94% for curettage alone; although denosumab was the only independent factor associated with increased recurrence, such an association may stem from selection bias, and use before surgery may aid in defining a peripheral rim around the tumor. Phase II data suggest sequential FDG-PET imaging appears to be a sensitive tool for early detection of tumor response to denosumab treatment, and there have been reports of increased risk of developing osteosarcoma associated with denosumab therapy in recurrent GCTB.

### Mutations in profilin 1 cause early-onset Paget's disease of bone with giant cell tumors [^113iHbM7]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Paget's disease of bone (PDB [MIM: 167250]) is a chronic progressive metabolic bone disease characterized by abnormal activation of osteoclasts that results in abnormal bone resorption and compensatory osteogenic sclerosis. (1) PDB can affect one (monostotic form) or more (polyostotic form) regions of the skeleton, with multiple constitutive symptoms, including bone pain, bone deformity, pathological fracture, tinnitus, hearing loss, vision loss, and osteoarthritis. In European countries, PDB is a relatively common chronic bone disorder, affecting 1% to 5% of those older than 50 years of age. (2) In recent years, a decline in the prevalence of the disease has been reported, and it has been suggested that the clinical severity of the disease may also be attenuated. The disease has a distinct geographical distribution; it predominantly affects people of European descent and is rarely diagnosed in Asian populations. (3) For example, the prevalence of PDB in Japan is only about 0.00028%. (4) The deep differences in the prevalence and possible severity of the disease strongly suggest that genetic background and environmental factors are involved in its pathogenesis.

Neoplastic degeneration of Pagetic bone is the most severe complication of PDB, occurring in less than 1% of cases and resulting in osteosarcoma (OS; with an incidence of 0.3%) and, less frequently, fibrosarcoma (FS), chondrosarcoma (CS), and giant cell tumor (GCT). (5) The severe subtype of early‐onset PDB that leads to the development of giant cell tumor of the bone (PDB/GCT) is extremely rare. Indeed, fewer than 150 cases have been reported in the literature to date, and little is known about its etiopathogenesis and management. Compared with PDB patients without GCTs, PDB‐GCT patients show a higher male/female ratio, more severe disease, and a higher mortality rate. Moreover, PDB‐GCT cases show elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels at neoplasm diagnosis and a higher prevalence of multifocal GCTs and have a positive familial history for PDB. (6)

### Prognostic factors for local recurrence in extremity-located giant cell tumours of bone with pathological fracture [^115qt87N]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this paper was to investigate the prognostic factors for local recurrence in patients with pathological fracture through giant cell tumours of bone (GCTB).

Patients and Methods

A total of 107 patients presenting with fractures through GCTB treated at our institution (Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom) between 1995 and 2016 were retrospectively studied. Of these patients, 57 were female (53%) and 50 were male (47%). The mean age at diagnosis was 33 years (14 to 86). A univariate analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis to identify risk factors based on the treatment and clinical characteristics.

Results

The initial surgical treatment was curettage with or without adjuvants in 55 patients (51%), en bloc resection with or without reconstruction in 45 patients (42%), and neoadjuvant denosumab, followed by resection (n = 3, 3%) or curettage (n = 4, 4%). The choice of treatment depended on tumour location, Campanacci tumour staging, intra-articular involvement, and fracture displacement. Neoadjuvant denosumab was used only in fractures through Campanacci stage 3 tumours. Local recurrence occurred in 28 patients (25%). Surgery more than six weeks after the fracture did not affect the risk of recurrence in any of the groups. In Campanacci stage 3 tumours not treated with denosumab, en bloc resection had lower local recurrences (13%), compared with curettage (39%). In tumours classified as Campanacci 2, intralesional curettage and en bloc resections had similar recurrence rates (21% and 24%, respectively). After univariate analysis, the type of surgical intervention, location, and the use of denosumab were independent factors predicting local recurrence. Further surgery was required 33% more often after intralesional curettage in comparison with resections (mean 1.59, 0 to 5 vs 1.06, 0 to 3 operations). All patients treated with denosumab followed by intralesional curettage developed local recurrence.

Conclusion

In patients with pathological fractures through GCTB not treated with denosumab, en bloc resection offers lower risks of local recurrence in tumours classified as Campanacci stage 3. Curettage or resections are both similar options in terms of the risk of local recurrence for tumours classified as Campanacci stage 2. The benefits of denosumab followed by intralesional curettage in these patients still remains unclear.

### A systematic review of multicentric giant cell tumour with the presentation of three cases at long-term follow-up [^112TzDHF]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

We performed a systematic literature review to define features of patients, treatment, and biological behaviour of multicentric giant cell tumour (GCT) of bone.

Methods

The search terms used in combination were "multicentric", "giant cell tumour", and "bone". Exclusion criteria were: reports lacking data, with only an abstract; papers not reporting data on multicentric GCT; and papers on multicentric GCT associated with other diseases. Additionally, we report three patients treated under our care.

Results

A total of 52 papers reporting on 104 patients were included in the analysis, with our addition of three patients. Multicentric GCT affected predominantly young people at a mean age of 22 years (10 to 62), manifesting commonly as metachronous tumours. The mean interval between the first and subsequent lesions was seven years (six months to 27 years). Synchronous lesions were observed in one-third of the patients. Surgery was curettage in 63% of cases (163 lesions); resections or amputation were less frequent. Systemic treatments were used in 10% (n = 14) of patients. Local recurrence and distant metastases were common.

Conclusion

Multicentric GCT is rare, biologically aggressive, and its course is unpredictable. Patients with GCT should be followed indefinitely, and referred promptly if new symptoms, particularly pain, emerge. Denosumab can have an important role in the treatment.

### Giant cell tumor of bone: effect of longer dosing intervals of denosumab on tumor control and bone-related complications [^1153gvSH]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Denosumab is the only FDA approved medication to treat giant cell tumor of bone in cases that are unresectable or when resection will likely cause severe morbidity. However, the current dosing schedule is monthly, which can become burdensome and potentially lead to adverse events. Currently, there is no optimal duration of therapy or dosing schedule. This study demonstrated that longer dosing intervals provided similar tumor control and potentially clinically less bone complications. With additional retrospective studies in the future, this could potentially change the current guidelines for treatment.

### A new relevant integrated radiologic and surgical classification scheme for giant cell tumors of bones [^111gwdpa]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Historical Giant Cell Tumor Classification Schemes and Descriptions

In clinical practice, the Campanacci system is most often used due to its simplicity and relatively straightforward management implications, where grade 1 and 2 lesions are amenable to intralesional curettage, and grade 3 lesions may require wide resection. Nevertheless, the Campanacci system has never demonstrated a definite correlation with prognosis. The literature is mixed with some studies showing no correlation, - including Campanacci et al, raising questions about reliance on a grading system that poorly predicts clinical outcomes. In light of these shortcomings, we believe that GCT of bone classification can be improved by adding consideration of cross-sectional imaging, which is now routinely obtained for surgical planning, and by aligning radiologic classification with features having surgical implications.

We developed a novel integrated radiologic and surgical classification scheme for GCTs of bone, based on whether the tumor is entirely contained within cortical margins, violates cortex but remains accessible from a single incision, or contains extraosseous implants that would necessitate two incisions for surgical intervention to local control without doing a wide local excision. We tested this novel classification scheme against the Campanacci grade and determined interreader reliability, with the aim of developing a more clinically applicable framework for surgically treating GCTs of bones.

### A new relevant integrated radiologic and surgical classification scheme for giant cell tumors of bones [^117UqB4Y]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, it should also be noted that there was no expected increasing trend in recurrence rate between GCTs of bone rated grades 2 and 3 with the novel grading system. Although counterintuitive, this suggests the presence of soft tissue extension raises the local recurrence risk to a fixed extent irrespective of the accessibility of the tumor from one or two incisions; larger studies with recurring grade 2 and 3 tumors are needed to address this possibility. Nevertheless, recurrent tumors were more frequently classified as higher grade (grades 2 and 3) on the whole when comparing the novel and Campanacci grading systems, indicating a benefit in at least stratifying between grade 1 versus grades 2 and 3 with the novel system. Future larger studies may also be able to improve on recurrence prediction by exploring the addition of other features to further stratify recurrence rates once tumor grades are greater than 1. Preliminary investigation showed, within novel grade 2 and 3 tumors, that correlation of recurrence with length of extraosseous tumor extension approached significance (P = 0.06), although measurements of tumor size (longest axial diameter and product of longest two axial dimensions) did not (P = 0.13 and 0.37, respectively).

This study introduces a novel grading system for GCTs of bone that is similar in reliability to the Campanacci grading system while offering greater surgical relevance. Future studies validating the system in larger, multicenter investigations should also explore the relationship of the grading system with clinical correlates, such as local recurrence and metastatic rates, denosumab treatment effect, and patient-reported outcomes. The integration of the system into clinical practice could enhance radiologist communication with surgeons for surgical planning, improve prognosis, and ultimately lead to better outcomes for patients with GCT.

### Tenosynovial giant cell tumors in children: a similar entity compared with adults [^115yJ88M]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a rare, benign, monoarticular entity. Many case-series in adults are described, whereas TGCT is only incidentally reported in children. Therefore, its incidence rate and natural history in children are unknown.

Questions/Purposes

(1) How many cases have been reported of this condition, and what were their characteristics? (2) What is the standardized pediatric incidence rate for TGCT? (3) Is there a clinical difference in TGCT between children and adults? (4) What is the risk of recurrence after open resection in children compared with adults?

Methods

Data were derived from three sources: (1) a systematic review on TGCT in children, seeking sources published between 1990 and 2016, included 17 heterogeneous, small case-series; (2) the nationwide TGCT incidence study: the Dutch pediatric incidence rate was extracted from this nationwide study by including patients younger than 18 years of age. This registry-based study, in which eligible patients with TGCT were clinically verified, calculated Dutch incidence rates for localized and diffuse-type TGCT in a 5-year timeframe. Standardized pediatric incidence rates were obtained by using the direct method; (3) from our nationwide bone and soft tissue tumor data registry, a clinical data set was derived. Fifty-seven children with histologically proven TGCT of large joints, diagnosed and treated between 1995 and 2015, in all four tertiary sarcoma centers in The Netherlands, were included. These clinically collected data were compared with a retrospective database of 423 adults with TGCT. Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to compare children and adults for TGCT type, sex, localization, symptoms before diagnosis, first treatment, recurrent disease, followup status, duration of symptoms, and time to followup. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate recurrence-free survival at 2.5 years.

Results

TGCT is seldom reported because only 76 pediatric patients (39 female), 29 localized, 38 diffuse, and nine unknown type, were identified from our systematic review. The standardized pediatric TGCT incidence rate of large joints was 2.42 and 1.09 per million person-years in localized and diffuse types, respectively. From our clinical data set, symptoms both in children and adults were swelling, pain, and limited ROM with a median time before diagnosis of 12 months (range, 1–72 months). With the numbers available, we did not observe differences in presentation between children and adults in terms of sex, symptoms before diagnosis, first treatment, recurrent disease, followup status, or median time to followup. The 2.5-year recurrence-free TGCT survival rate after open resection was not different with the numbers available between children and adults: 85% (95% confidence interval, 67%-100%) versus 89% (95% CI, 83%-96%) in localized, respectively (p = 0.527) and 53% (95% CI, 35%-79%) versus 56% (95% CI, 49%-64%) in diffuse type, respectively (p = 0.691).

Conclusions

Although the incidence of pediatric TGCT is low, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis in children with chronic monoarticular joint effusions. Recurrent disease after surgical treatment of this orphan disease seems comparable between children and adults. With targeted therapies being developed, future research should define the most effective treatment strategies for this heterogeneous disease.

Level Of Evidence

### Is treatment with denosumab associated with local recurrence in patients with giant cell tumor of bone treated with curettage? A systematic review [^1149fm7U]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to receptor activation of nuclear factor-kappa ß ligand (RANKL), has been used as a drug to treat aggressive giant cell tumors of bone. It is unclear whether preoperative denosumab therapy is associated with the local recurrence risk in patients with giant cell tumors of bone treated with curettage. Early evidence suggests that denosumab treatment is associated with a reduction in local recurrence, but other studies have questioned that premise. Curettage after a short course of denosumab (3 to 4 months) has been recommended, especially for large, aggressive giant cell tumors in which complete curettage is difficult to achieve. No randomized studies have documented the benefit of this approach, and some investigators have reported higher local recurrence after denosumab treatment. Due to this confusion, we performed a systematic analysis of existing reports to attempt to answer this question and determine whether the appropriate preoperative denosumab therapy duration could be established.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Is the use of preoperative denosumab associated with local recurrence risk in patients with giant cell tumors of bone treated with curettage compared with those treated with curettage alone? (2) Is the preoperative denosumab therapy duration associated with local recurrence after curettage?

Methods

We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases on April 26, 2019 and included both randomized and non-randomized studies that compared local recurrence between patients who had giant cell tumors of bone and were treated with curettage after preoperative denosumab and patients treated with curettage alone. Two authors independently screened the studies. There were no randomized studies dealing with denosumab in giant cell tumors of bone, and generally, denosumab was used for more aggressive tumors. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies, with a moderate overall risk of bias. We registered our protocol in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42019133288). We selected seven eligible studies involving 619 patients for the final analysis.

Results

The proportion of patients with local recurrence ranged from 20% to 100% in the curettage with preoperative denosumab group and ranged from 0% to 50% in the curettage-alone group. The odds ratio of local recurrence ranged from 1.07 to 37.80 in no more than 6 months of preoperative denosumab duration group and ranged from 0.60 to 28.33 in more than 6 months of preoperative denosumab duration group.

Conclusions

The available evidence for the benefit of denosumab in more aggressive giant cell tumors is inconclusive, and denosumab treatment may even be associated with an increase in the proportion of patients experiencing local recurrence. Because there are no randomized studies and the existing studies are of poor quality due to indication bias (the most aggressive Campanacci 3 lesions or those where even a resection would be difficult and result in morbidity are generally the patients who are treated with denosumab), the evidence to suggest a disadvantage is weak. Denosumab treatment should be viewed with caution until more definitive, randomized studies documenting a benefit (or not) have been conducted. Furthermore, we could not find evidence to suggest an appropriate length of preoperative denosumab before curettage.

### Immune surveillance plays a role in locally aggressive giant cell lesions of bone [^113875pU]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Giant cell lesions are locally aggressive intraosseous neoplasms with capacity to metastasize. The role of immune surveillance in the pathophysiology of giant cell lesions is poorly understood, and understanding what role the immune system plays in giant cell lesions may lead to the development of more effective treatment. The aim of this study was to explore the role of immune surveillance in giant cell lesions by examining the expression of the HLA class I and class II antigens and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In addition, we examined the role of the immune modulating surface antigen B7-H3, which belongs to the B7 superfamily, a group of molecules that modulates T-cell responses.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Is an immune response elicited by giant cell lesions? (2) Do clinically relevant human leukocyte antigen (HLA) defects exist in giant cell lesions? (3) Is B7-H3 a clinically relevant immune modulator?

Methods

The study sample was derived from the population of patients presenting to the Massachusetts General Hospital for evaluation and management of giant cell lesions from 1993 to 2008. We included patients with histologically confirmed giant cell lesions with a minimum followup of 6 months. Patients with systemic diseases (n = 4 [3%]), syndromes associated with giant cell lesions (n = 4 [3%]), and those without sufficient followup (n = 26 [19%]), inadequate records (n = 7 [5%]), or inadequate tissue available (n = 2 [1%]) were excluded. Tissue microarray, containing 288 tissue cores for 93 patients, was carefully constructed. This contained tissue from 45 patients with maxillofacial lesions, 38 with aggressive and seven with nonaggressive lesions, and 48 patients with axial and appendicular lesions, 30 with aggressive lesions and 18 with nonaggressive lesions. The population mean age was 28 ± 12 years and the duration of followup was 4 ± 3 years. The tissue microarray was immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA classes I and II and B7-H3 antigens and analyzed for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Antigen expression was examined in multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear stromal cells. The results were correlated with local invasion and tumor aggressiveness, which is based on accepted staging criteria.

Results

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were detected in all the tumors. The mean number of CD8+ T cell infiltration was lower in aggressive tumors (median, 4.8; interquartile range [IQR], 0.4–13.4), when compared with nonaggressive tumors (median, 15.8; IQR, 4.3–46.3; p = 0.007). HLA class I antigens were highly expressed by multinucleated giant cells in all tumors, but were lightly expressed on mononuclear stromal cells in 53% (45 of 84) to 73% (56 of 77) of tumors. HLA class I antigen low expression in mononuclear stromal cells was associated with tumor aggressiveness (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; p = 0.005). Low HLA class I expression combined with low CD8+ T cell infiltration was most highly associated with tumor aggressiveness (OR, 7.81; p = 0.011). B7-H3 antigen was expressed in 36.9% mononuclear stroma cells and also was associated with local tumor invasion (OR, 1.36; p < 0.001). Similarly, giant cell lesions with high B7-H3 expression and low CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with increased tumor aggressiveness (OR, 8.89; p = 0.0491).

Conclusions

Locally aggressive giant cell lesions are associated with low HLA class 1 antigen expression, low CD8+T cell infiltration, and high expression of the immune modulator B7-H3.

Clinical Relevance

Failure of immune surveillance implies that there may be an opportunity to target aspects of the immune surveillance machinery to treat giant cell lesions.

### Efficacy and safety of JMT103 in patients with unresectable or surgically-challenging giant cell tumor of bone: a multicenter, phase Ib / II study [^113LRtXC]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a rare primary osteolytic bone tumor that typically arises from the epiphyseal portions of long bones, the spine, or the sacrum –, accounting for approximately 5% of primary bone tumors –. In China, the annual incidence of GCTB (about 1.49–2.57 per million) was higher than in the United States, which might reflect a younger population in China. Most patients present with pain, swelling, decreased joint motion, and disability. GCTB is destructive and locally aggressive, damaging the bone and nearby soft tissue, causing substantial morbidity, and occasionally metastasizing (as much as 6%), most frequently to the lung (3%-4%) due to hematogenous dissemination –.

While surgical removal remains the standard curative treatment for GCTB, local recurrence is high (estimated 10%-40%), indicating that complete resection is frequently not achieved. Patients with unresectable GCTB have limited treatment options. Denosumab, a monoclonal anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) ligand (RANKL) antibody, is one preferred treatment for unresectable GCTB. Although the role of RANK-RANKL-mediated signaling in GCTB remains incompletely understood, it has been proposed that inhibition of this pathway inhibits GCTB-induced osteolysis. Several studies have suggested that denosumab effectively reduces tumor size, restores bone density, provides pain relief, and downstages surgery –. However, excessive sclerotic bone and thickened cortex resulting from long-term (≥ 25 weeks) preoperative denosumab treatment made it difficult to delineate the surgical margin, leading to increased recurrence and malignant transformation. The risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) also increased with prolonged denosumab treatment. Although a few published clinical experiences have suggested that a shorter treatment duration (3–4 months) of preoperative denosumab was beneficial in GCTB treatment, its efficacy remains to be established.

### Medical management of tenosynovial giant cell tumor [^111tH14z]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor (D-TGCT) is a benign neoplasm with locally aggressive potential of the synovium, bursae, and tendon sheaths. This review summarizes the current treatment landscape for D-TGCT, with a focus on systemic therapies.

Recent Findings

Surgery is the primary treatment option for tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), but there is a high risk of recurrence and associated morbidity, particularly for patients with advanced D-TGCT. Systemic therapies targeting the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) have resulted in positive tumor response, improved function, and decreased symptoms. For an alternative to surgery, the CSF1R inhibitors pexidartinib and vimseltinib are approved in the United States for TGCT, and other CSF1R inhibitors are in clinical development.

Summary

CSF1R inhibitors represent a significant evolution in therapeutic strategies for D-TGCT. The potential risks and benefits of available treatments should be carefully considered in collaboration with a bone tumor–experienced, multidisciplinary team to determine the best course of care. Increased D-TGCT awareness and support through patient advocacy groups have helped to reshape the patient journey.

Surgery is the primary treatment option for tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), but there is a high risk of recurrence and associated morbidity, particularly for patients with advanced D-TGCT. Systemic therapies targeting the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) have resulted in positive tumor response, improved function, and decreased symptoms. For an alternative to surgery, the CSF1R inhibitors pexidartinib and vimseltinib are approved in the United States for TGCT, and other CSF1R inhibitors are in clinical development. CSF1R inhibitors represent a significant evolution in therapeutic strategies for D-TGCT. The potential risks and benefits of available treatments should be carefully considered in collaboration with a bone tumor-experienced, multidisciplinary team to determine the best course of care. Increased D-TGCT awareness and support through patient advocacy groups have helped to reshape the patient journey.

### Update on aneurysmal bone cyst: pathophysiology, histology, imaging and treatment [^11198YGj]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with ABCs typically present with insidious onset of pain, swelling or a palpable mass. Some variability in clinical presentation exists because ABCs, even in the same location, can have different growth rates with doubling times ranging from months to years. This variability in growth rate also contributes to the differences in imaging appearance. Acute pain may occur in patients who present with a pathological fracture. When the lesion involves the skull or spine, focal neurological symptoms (e.g. paresthesias, numbness) can accompany the pain or scoliosis.

In the last WHO Classification of Tumors of Bone (2020), there has been a shift in nomenclature in which the terms "ABC" and "ABC-like changes" that are found within certain preexisting primary bone neoplasms are suggested instead of "primary ABC" and "secondary ABC", respectively. ABC is considered a primary bone lesion in 70% of cases, whereas the remaining 30% of cases represent ABC-like changes associated with different primary bone tumors. Bone tumors that have been associated with aneurysmal changes reminiscent of ABC in the general population include benign tumors such as chondroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell tumor, osteoblastoma, and non-ossifying fibroma and malignant tumors such as osteosarcoma. In the studies by Sasaki et al. and Gutierrez et al. the most common tumors associated with ABC-like changes were giant cell tumor and chondroblastoma, both of which typically involve the epiphysis. Other types of ABC include the solid variant and ABC of the soft tissues.

In this article, we first discuss the pathophysiology, histology and distribution of ABC and its variants. We then discuss the imaging appearance of ABC by focusing on radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) as well as the differential diagnosis, specifically telangiectatic osteosarcoma, which is a true mimicker of ABC. Finally, we discuss the various therapeutic options for ABC, focusing on image-guided therapy, surveillance and clinical outcomes.

### Differential gene expression in classic giant cell tumours of bone: tenascin C as biological risk factor for local relapses and metastases [^112EasdP]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To identify candidate prognostic biological markers useful in selecting high-risk patients with classic primary giant cell tumours (GCT). GCT specimens with different behaviour associated with an increased risk of local and/or distant relapses were studied.

Methods and Results

Screening mRNA microarray analysis followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray sections was used to validate the prognostic role of differentially expressed genes on a larger series by statistical analysis tests. Global gene expression profiling identified 109 differentially expressed genes according to prognosis. A correlation was found between mRNA levels and clinical outcome identifying Tenascin C (TNC) as the most significant prognostic biological marker. By means of backward Wald logistic regression, TNC overexpression defined an eightfold increased risk for metastasis and fourfold for local recurrence. At the protein level, TNC immunoreactivity resulted in a significant difference in the disease-free survival probability curves, providing a stratification for GCT patients, useful for predicting relapse.

Conclusions

Our study provides important data for the selection of biomarkers with a significant clinical impact and suggests the importance of TNC expression in identifying GCT patients at a higher risk of relapse for closer follow-up and adjuvant medical therapy.

History of TGCT Treatment

The treatment principles for TGCT include management within expert centers by an experienced multidisciplinary team, including pathologists, radiologists, orthopedic surgeons, oncologists, and pain specialists. Shared decision making between the patient and their care team should weigh the risks and benefits of therapy and determine the best course of treatment.

Surgery

Surgery is the primary treatment for TGCT, using either arthroscopic or open excision techniques. Resection of the tumor with marginal excision is recommended for L-TGCT and can be curative for most patients. For D-TGCT, extensive synovectomy is preferred when macroscopically complete resection can be achieved without significant morbidity. However, complete removal of diffuse tumors can be challenging, and many patients with TGCT experience recurrence and may require repeat surgery. Recurrence rates following surgical resection in D-TGCT are estimated to be 20–50%. Compared with complete resections, incomplete resections in patients with D-TGCT are associated with poor radiologic and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, multiple surgeries can significantly impact physical functioning and QoL. In some severe cases, more invasive surgeries, such as joint replacement or amputation, may be necessary. Tumor recurrence rates are generally low after joint replacement; however, because arthroplasties frequently need to be revised, joint replacement surgery in a young patient may result in subsequent surgery later in life.

Active Surveillance

Active surveillance, or a "wait and see" approach, is recommended for asymptomatic patients or in symptomatic patients if there is a risk of significant morbidity or side effects with surgery or systemic treatment. Findings from a retrospective study of 61 patients with treatment-naive D-TGCT suggest that active surveillance can be a safe and effective option for disease management. At a median follow-up of 28 months, most patients remained stable (43%) or improved (21%) under active surveillance, whereas 37% had clinical deterioration. The frequency of follow-up during active surveillance should be individualized based on tumor location, growth pattern, and symptom severity.

Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy, including radiosynoviorthesis and external beam radiotherapy, has been used alone or as an adjuvant to surgery. Still, there are limited data on these treatments' efficacy in TGCT. There are also concerns about potential safety risks, such as early-onset arthritis, joint stiffness, fibrosis, radiation-induced sarcoma, and malignant transformation. Therefore, radiation therapy is generally not recommended for patients with TGCT and is not used by most experts in the field.

Lessons Learned

Given the high activity of denosumab in giant cell tumors of bone (GCTB), this trial aimed to explore the activity in other giant cell rich tumors of bone (GCRTB).
As the use of denosumab in GCTB declined and due to critical emerging real-world data of denosumab in GCRTBs, the study was prematurely stopped and not supportive of use of denosumab for this indication.

Bone cancer — epidemiology and subtype distribution shows that primary bone cancers account for ~0.2% of all cancers. In 2025 an estimated 3,770 people will be diagnosed in the United States and 2,190 people will die from these diseases. In adults, chondrosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer, accounting for more than 40% of newly diagnosed bone cancers, followed by osteosarcoma (~25%), chordoma (10%), and Ewing sarcoma (8%). High-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) of bone and giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) are relatively rare, with each constituting < 5% of primary bone tumors. Chondrosarcoma is more prevalent in individuals > 50 years of age, and in children and adolescents, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are far more common than chondrosarcoma and chordoma.

### Benign and malignant giant-cell tumors of bone… [^111wuvfN]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

All giant-cell tumors were considered at one time to be malignant lesions and were classified by the term "giant-cell sarcoma. " As knowledge concerning their true nature increased, it became evident that some of them were benign lesions and curable by means of surgical removal. I believe that the term "giant-cell sarcoma, " when used in reference to benign giant-cell tumor, has been partly responsible for the confusion that has existed in the classification and study of this particular group of bone lesions. In a previous publication I1 suggested the use of the terms "benign giant-cell tumor" and "malignant giant-cell sarcoma" in an attempt to clarify the differentiation. Although surgical treatment resulted in many cures of patients who had these tumors, I became wary in my prognosis for I found that occasionally there was recurrence of the lesion, and in some instances metastasis occurred. Some physicians concluded that meddlesome surgical intervention. MEYERDING HW.

### What are the possible causes… [^116mpjrE]. NCI (2018). Low credibility.

People who have Paget disease or a history of radiation to their bones also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Chondrosarcoma. Several types of benign bone tumors can, in rare cases, become malignant and spread to other parts of the body. These include giant cell tumor of bone and osteoblastoma. Giant cell tumor of bone mostly occurs at the ends of the long bones of the arms and legs, often close to the knee joint. Previous cancer treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy or treatment with certain anticancer drugs, particularly alkylating agents; those treated during childhood are at particular risk.

Members of families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome are at increased risk of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma as well as other types of cancer. Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones have an increased lifetime risk of developing chondrosarcoma. Childhood chordoma is linked to tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder in which benign tumors form in the kidneys, brain, eyes, heart, lungs, and skin. People who have been treated for bone cancer have an increased likelihood of developing late effects of treatment as they age. These late effects depend on the type of treatment and the patient's age at treatment and include physical problems involving the heart, lung, hearing, fertility, and bone; neurological problems; and second cancers.

Treatment of bone tumors with cryosurgery may lead to the destruction of nearby bone tissue and result in fractures, but these effects may not be seen for some time after the initial treatment. Bone cancer sometimes metastasizes, particularly to the lungs, or can recur, either at the same location or in other bones in the body. People who have had bone cancer should see their doctor regularly and should report any unusual symptoms right away. Follow-up varies for different types and stages of bone cancer. Generally, patients are checked frequently by their doctor and have regular blood tests and x-rays. Regular follow-up care ensures that changes in health are discussed and that problems are treated as soon as possible.
