## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which transcription factor is required for B cells to differentiate into plasma cells in a patient with acute hepatitis A, and to choose among BCL6, MITF, MTA3, and BLIMP1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether it changes the immunologic question. Then, I should verify the core transcriptional circuitry that governs plasma cell differentiation. Next, I will examine each option against that circuitry and check for any exceptions or nuances. Finally, I will confirm the canonical answer and briefly note why the distractors are incorrect, anchoring the reasoning in the literature.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context so I don't conflate virology with immunology. The vignette describes acute hepatitis A with anti-HAV IgM positivity, which is a classic acute viral hepatitis presentation. However, the question is purely about the transcriptional control of B-cell terminal differentiation into plasma cells, and that pathway is antigen-agnostic, so the virologic diagnosis does not alter the correct transcription factor answer [^notfound].

> Now, I need to think about the core transcriptional network that drives plasma cell differentiation. Hold on, let me verify the canonical regulators: the mutually antagonistic programs include B-cell identity factors such as PAX5 and BCL6, and the plasma cell program driven by IRF4, BLIMP1, and XBP1, with BLIMP1 generally considered the master regulator that extinguishes B-cell genes and activates the antibody-secreting cell program [^112iBUjy].

> I will now examine BLIMP1 as the leading candidate. BLIMP1, encoded by PRDM1, is repeatedly described as the master regulator of plasma cell differentiation; it represses B-cell genes and is required for full plasma cell differentiation, even though there may be an earlier BLIMP1-independent initiation phase in some contexts, which still makes BLIMP1 the essential factor for terminal differentiation and high-level immunoglobulin production [^115ddokP] [^114a9KxN].

> Wait, let me verify the relationship between BLIMP1 and the other key factors so I don't overstate independence. IRF4 is required upstream and induces BLIMP1, and BLIMP1 in turn induces XBP1, which is essential for the unfolded protein response and immunoglobulin secretion; this hierarchical relationship reinforces BLIMP1's central role in executing the plasma cell fate [^114g4WcS] [^117Wb4fG].

> Next, I should review the distractors. BCL6 maintains germinal center and B-cell identity and actually represses plasma cell differentiation; thus, it is antagonistic to the plasma cell program rather than required for it, which rules out option A [^1155nb2M]. MITF is a melanocyte-lineage transcription factor and is not established as a regulator of B-cell to plasma cell differentiation, so option B is not relevant here [^notfound]. MTA3 is part of a chromatin remodeling complex implicated in epithelial biology and is not a canonical regulator of plasma cell differentiation, making option C unlikely [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any of the other canonical plasma cell factors could be the intended answer. IRF4 and XBP1 are indeed required, but they are not among the listed options, and BLIMP1 remains the most accurate choice among the provided alternatives given its master regulatory status and its placement in the transcriptional hierarchy that executes plasma cell differentiation [^112iBUjy].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final selection. The transcription factor required for B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, among the choices provided, is BLIMP1, with the caveat that IRF4 and XBP1 are also essential components of the network but are not offered as options here [^115ddokP] [^117Wb4fG] [^1133JBNy].

---

The correct answer is **D. BLIMP1**. BLIMP1 (PRDM1) is the **master transcription factor** required for terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, inducing the plasma cell program and suppressing B-cell identity genes [^116ZYx42] [^112iBUjy]. BCL6 maintains B-cell identity and **opposes plasma cell differentiation**, while MITF and MTA3 are not central regulators of this process [^1155nb2M] [^116ZYx42].

---

## Transcriptional regulation of plasma cell differentiation

Plasma cell differentiation is a **highly regulated process** involving multiple transcription factors that coordinate the transition from activated B cells to antibody-secreting plasma cells [^116ZYx42]. Key transcription factors include:

- **BCL6**: Maintains germinal center B-cell identity and proliferation, and represses plasma cell differentiation [^112iBUjy].
- **IRF4**: Induces BLIMP1 expression and is essential for plasma cell differentiation [^114g4WcS].
- **XBP1**: Required for plasma cell differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion, integrating the unfolded protein response [^1133JBNy] [^1148po3Q].
- **BLIMP1**: Master regulator of plasma cell differentiation, suppressing B-cell genes and activating plasma cell-specific genes [^115ddokP].

---

## Role of BLIMP1 in plasma cell differentiation

BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1, encoded by PRDM1) is the **master transcription factor** required for terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells [^114a9KxN]. It orchestrates the plasma cell program by:

- **Suppressing B-cell identity genes**: Represses genes such as BCL6, PAX5, and CIITA, which maintain B-cell identity [^notfound].
- **Activating plasma cell-specific genes**: Induces genes involved in antibody secretion, including XBP1, IRF4, and immunoglobulin genes [^117Wb4fG].
- **Integrating signaling pathways**: Responds to cytokine signals (e.g. IL-21) and integrates the unfolded protein response via XBP1 activation [^117Wb4fG].

Loss of BLIMP1 **impairs plasma cell differentiation**, leading to reduced immunoglobulin production and impaired humoral immunity [^114a9KxN].

---

## Role of other transcription factors in plasma cell differentiation

While BLIMP1 is the master regulator, other transcription factors contribute to plasma cell differentiation:

- **IRF4**: Essential for plasma cell differentiation, inducing BLIMP1 expression and coordinating isotype switching [^117Wb4fG] [^114g4WcS].
- **XBP1**: Required for plasma cell differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion, integrating the unfolded protein response [^1133JBNy] [^1148po3Q].
- **BCL6**: Maintains germinal center B-cell identity and opposes plasma cell differentiation [^115Btg1w].

---

## Clinical relevance of plasma cell differentiation in hepatitis A

In hepatitis A, **robust humoral immunity** is essential for viral clearance. Plasma cells produce virus-specific antibodies that neutralize HAV and facilitate immune complex clearance. BLIMP1-driven plasma cell differentiation is therefore critical for effective humoral immunity against HAV [^notfound].

## Summary of transcription factors involved in plasma cell differentiation

| **Transcription factor** | **Role in plasma cell differentiation** |
|-|-|
| BLIMP1 | Master regulator; essential for terminal differentiation |
| IRF4 | Induces BLIMP1; essential for plasma cell differentiation |
| XBP1 | Required for immunoglobulin secretion and plasma cell function |
| BCL6 | Maintains B-cell identity; opposes plasma cell differentiation |

### STAT5B restrains human B-cell differentiation to maintain humoral immune homeostasis [^1155nb2M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lymphocyte differentiation is regulated by coordinated actions of cytokines and signaling pathways. IL-21 activates STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 and is fundamental for the differentiation of human B cells into memory cells and antibody-secreting cells. While STAT1 is largely nonessential and STAT3 is critical for this process, the role of STAT5 is unknown.

Objectives

This study sought to delineate unique roles of STAT5 in activation and differentiation of human naive and memory B cells.

Methods

STAT activation was assessed by phospho-flow cytometry cell sorting. Differential gene expression was determined by RNA-sequencing and quantitative PCR. The requirement for STAT5B in B-cell and CD4 + T-cell differentiation was assessed using CRISPR-mediated STAT5B deletion from B-cell lines and investigating primary lymphocytes from individuals with germline STAT5B mutations.

Results

IL-21 activated STAT5 and strongly induced SOCS3 in human naive, but not memory, B cells. Deletion of STAT5B in B-cell lines diminished IL-21-mediated SOCS3 induction. PBMCs from STAT5B-null individuals contained expanded populations of immunoglobulin class-switched B cells, CD21 lo Tbet + B cells, and follicular T helper cells. IL-21 induced greater differentiation of STAT5B-deficient B cells into plasmablasts in vitro than B cells from healthy donors, correlating with higher expression levels of transcription factors promoting plasma cell formation.

Conclusions

These findings reveal novel roles for STAT5B in regulating IL-21-induced human B-cell differentiation. This is achieved by inducing SOCS3 to attenuate IL-21 signaling, and BCL6 to repress class switching and plasma cell generation. Thus, STAT5B is critical for restraining IL-21-mediated B-cell differentiation. These findings provide insights into mechanisms underpinning B-cell responses during primary and subsequent antigen encounter and explain autoimmunity and dysfunctional humoral immunity in STAT5B deficiency.

### Thioredoxin is a metabolic rheostat controlling regulatory B cells [^112iT3cN]. Nature Immunology (2024). High credibility.

While our focus has been on the antioxidant properties of Trx in maintaining B reg cell metabolism, Trx plays a pleiotropic role in the immune system, including promoting cell growth, modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulating apoptosis. In addition, it is well established that Trx controls protein structure and function, promoting the binding of transcription factors to target DNA by reducing cysteine residues present on these proteins. In this context, cysteine residues targeted by Trx are present in Cyp1a1 (a proxy for Ahr), NF-κB, AP-1 and HIF-1α — transcription factors previously shown to regulate IL-10 expression. Several of these factors, including HIF-1α, have been identified in the mitochondria. Taken together, it is possible that, in addition to regulating the amounts of both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS, Trx controls protein functions in the mitochondria, which consequently exert their effects in the nucleus.

B cell differentiation into plasmablasts requires mitochondrial membrane polarization to maximize the outputs of OXPHOS. Our results also show that the same pathway is required for the differentiation of IL-10 + B reg cells. To add a degree of complexity we have now shown that although inhibition of Trx in B cells impairs ETC function, the IL-10 − plasmablast frequencies were unaffected by these metabolic changes. We propose that the decrease in mitochondrial membrane polarization observed in B cells following Trx inhibition triggers supplementary metabolic pathways in IL-10 − plasmablasts. One potential pathway is glutamine metabolism, which we have shown to be essential for both B reg cell and plasmablast differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 3a, e, f). Glutamine metabolism drives mTORC1 activity, thereby promoting plasma cell differentiation and antibody secretion.

Alternatively, it has been previously shown that mice deficient in the antioxidant Tumor Protein 53-Induced Nuclear Protein 1 (TP53INP1) in the presence of chronic oxidative stress display elevated plasma cell frequencies with enhanced antibody secretion, suggesting that increased oxidative stress may expedite plasma cell differentiation. Future investigations will aim to address this hypothesis.

### Temporal and context-dependent requirements for the transcription factor foxp3 expression in regulatory T cells [^114vNeCP]. Nature Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Main

Regulatory T (T reg) cells are requisite watchmen of the immune system, whose identity is distinguished by the expression of their X-chromosome-encoded lineage-specifying transcription factor Foxp3 (refs. –). Foxp3 plays a critical role in T reg cell differentiation, conferring both suppressor function and fitness, largely by exploiting the pre-established epigenetic landscape in precursor cells before Foxp3 expression –. In mice on a non-autoimmune prone genetic background showed that Foxp3 expression is stable in differentiated T reg cells, whereas recently generated T reg cells can lose Foxp3 expression –. In inflammatory settings, T reg cells upregulate Foxp3 expression and increase their suppressor function, yet both can become compromised in severe infections or autoimmunity, in particular in conjunction with genetic predispositions or interleukin (IL)-2 deprivation.

The indispensable role of Foxp3 in establishing T reg cell functionality during their differentiation has been demonstrated by comparisons of mice expressing a Foxp3 GFPKO reporter-null versus a functional Foxp3 GFP allele. The currently prevailing notion of a requirement for continuous Foxp3 expression was suggested by Cre recombinase-induced ablation of a Foxp3 conditional allele in vitro in rapidly dividing T reg cells followed by their adoptive transfers into lymphopenic hosts; however, the confounders of these early studies left unresolved the question of whether the Foxp3-dependent T reg functional program is intrinsically resilient or vulnerable. This uncertainty is particularly intriguing in light of the recent studies suggesting a model where Foxp3 is acting largely indirectly by inducing relatively modest changes in the expression of a few, yet to be defined, direct target genes, which in turn can act to establish the genome-wide transcriptional and functional program of T reg cells. Thus, the role for Foxp3 in the maintenance of transcriptional and functional features of differentiated T reg cells remains unknown despite major previous efforts.

### B cell activation and plasma cell differentiation are inhibited by de novo DNA methylation [^1179nMoH]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Appropriate regulation of B cell function is essential for humoral immunity and helps prevent antibody-dependent autoimmune diseases and B cell malignancies. Humoral immunity is maintained by mutually antagonistic transcription factor programs that either maintain B cell identity or promote plasma cell differentiation. Upon stimulation, naive B cells rapidly proliferate while simultaneously amplifying and modulating their gene expression program, resulting in distinct cell fates and functions –. How gene expression programs are both remodeled and propagated across the many rounds of cellular division during B cell differentiation is not well understood. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, have the potential to control gene expression and cell identity through mitosis. Such is the case in B cells, where DNA hypomethylation is coupled to activation, proliferation, differentiation, and gene regulation. Data thus far suggest that B cells undergo extensive and targeted DNA hypomethylation upon activation, but it is not known if de novo DNA methylation is also important for B cell fate and function.

DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, which in mammals occur primarily on the 5′-position of cytosine in the context of CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation represses transcription in promoters and mutagenic repetitive elements. Transcriptional enhancers are demarcated with intermediate amounts of DNA methylation, where demethylation is enforced by transcription factor occupancy. Highly expressed genes harbor high levels of gene-body DNA methylation, which helps prevent spurious transcription. DNA methylation is maintained through mitosis by the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1, which reciprocally methylates hemi-methylated CpGs formed during DNA replication. This process is essential for mammalian development, hematopoiesis, lymphocyte maturation, and differentiation. Deposition of de novo DNA methylation by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is also required for mammalian developmentand when deleted in hematopoietic stem cells restricts B cell development, but how it contributes to the molecular programming, differentiation, and function of mature B cells is not well understood.

To test the hypothesis that de novo DNA methylation is important for mature B cell function, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were conditionally deleted from B cells (Dnmt3-deficient) in mice. Dnmt3-deficient mice have phenotypically normal B cell development and maturation in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes, and mature follicular B cells show few molecular defects. Upon antigenic stimulation, Dnmt3-deficient mice have enlarged germinal center and plasma cell responses by a cell autonomous mechanism coupled to gene dysregulation, a failure to gain de novo DNA methylation, and repress the chromatin state in bone marrow plasma cells. Thus, Dnmt3-dependent DNA methylation restricts B cell activation and plasma cell differentiation.

### Skewed B cells in chronic hepatitis C virus infection maintain their ability to respond to virus-induced activation [^115VMtAH]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by persistent B-cell activation, with enhanced differentiation and reduced proliferative ability. To assess the possible role of HCV in altering B-cell subset distribution, we examined ex vivo frequencies and B-cell inhibitory receptor expression in 37 chronic HCV-infected patients and 25 healthy donors (HD). In addition, we determined whether short-term exposure to culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) resulted in B-cell subset skewing and/or activation. There was a statistically significant increase in the frequencies of immature transitional, activated memory and tissue-like memory (TLM) B cells in HCV-infected patients compared with HD. We also found that the frequency of memory B cells correlated with serum HCV RNA levels. The proportion of B cells expressing the marker of exhaustion Fc receptor-like 4 (FcRL4) was generally low even though significantly higher in the patients' memory B-cell compartment compared with HD, and a positive correlation was found between the frequencies of the patients' TLM FcRL4+ B cells and serum alanine aminotransferase and histological activity index at liver biopsy. Exposure to cell-free HCVcc in vitro did not result in B-cell skewing but induced significant activation of naïve, TLM and resting memory B cells in HCV-infected patients but not in HD, in whom cell-associated virus was an absolute requirement for activation of memory B cells. These findings provide corroborative evidence in favour of significant B-cell subset skewing in chronic HCV infection and in addition show that expression of exhaustion markers in selected B-cell subsets does not impair virus-induced B-cell activation.

### Gene expression profiling reveals a highly specialized genetic program of plasma cells [^1167b6Gb]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

The formation of terminally differentiated plasma cells represents the critical final step in B-cell differentiation. In this study, utilizing oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we describe the highly specialized genetic profile exhibited by terminally differentiated plasma cells. A total of 1476 known genes were differentially expressed by plasma cells compared with B cells. Plasma cells displayed an up-regulation, induction, or a selective retention of a unique constellation of transcription factors, including members of the AP-1, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and octamer binding factor families. Interestingly, plasma cells also displayed a down-regulation of several RNA polymerase I- related factors, consistent with terminal differentiation, and exhibited a down-regulation of the TATA box binding protein. Furthermore, plasma cells displayed alterations in multiple components of the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways and showed a unique pattern of apoptosis and proliferation-associated genes. Unexpectedly, plasma cells displayed an up-regulation of 2 factors normally associated with microenvironmental positioning of neuronal cells, reelin and neuropilin-1. These results supply insight into the developmental genetics of plasma cell differentiation and provide a foundation for further analysis of plasma cell biology.

### Environmental sensing by mature B cells is controlled by the transcription factors PU.1 and spiB [^111qc1kt]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Humoral immunity is underpinned by the ability of B cells to sense and integrate signals from their environment and respond with the appropriate intrinsic differentiation program. These environmental cues include the cognate antigen, T cell help and survival factors such as BAFF. In this study, we show that the Ets family transcription factors, PU.1 and SpiB, well-known regulators of early lymphopoiesis, are redundantly required for the normal expression and function of virtually all pathways by which B cells sense and respond to the surrounding milieu. In contrast plasma cell development was either unaffected or accelerated by the loss of both factors. Thus PU.1 and SpiB act redundantly to balance the proliferative and differentiation response of B cells that is essential for protective humoral immunity.

Within the Ets family, PU.1 and SpiB are the genes most highly related to each other. They bind to the same consensus DNA recognition site, either on their own or in complex with IRF4 or IRF8. Both factors are constitutively expressed throughout B cell development, with SpiB expression being rapidly extinguished upon plasma cell differentiation, while PU.1 remains expressed at a low concentration and can, at least in culture, still occupy many thousands of binding sites in the genome. The similarity of this pair of transcription factors has long complicated the interpretation of their function in B cells. PU.1 null embryos die in late gestation and lack all lymphocytes, while removal of PU.1 in adult hematopoietic stem cells ablates B-cell development. Surprisingly, conditional inactivation of PU.1 in committed B cells using Cd19 -Cre, which is first active during B cell development in the bone marrow, results in no pronounced defects in B cell production or function beyond a role in B1 cell formation. Loss of SpiB is also compatible with normal B cell development, however SpiB KO mice have defects in the GC reaction at later times points after immunization. In this study, we observed normal numbers of peripheral B cell subsets in mice lacking PU.1 or SpiB, as well as functional GC, at the peak time post immunization (day 14). In contrast to our previous studies using Cd19 -Cre, we observed a partial impairment in GC responses in vivo and enhanced plasma cell differentiation in vitro in the absence of PU.1. The major difference between the studies is that here we have utilized Cd23 -Cre that is active from the transitional stage in the spleen, sparing the bone marrow development process entirely. This, as discussed below may impact on the ability of SpiB to compensate for the loss of PU.1.

### Plasma cell differentiation is regulated by the expression of histone variant H3.3 [^116pyYoG]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our findings shed light on the role of the H3.3 histone variant in the process of PC differentiation. However, they do not rule out other potential models of PC differentiation, like those involving transcription factor networks and epigenetic regulation. Our study emphasizes the significance of additional layers of epigenetic remodeling, such as H3.3 distribution and chromatin accessibility, in understanding the PC differentiation process.

### The transcription factor XBP1 is selectively required for eosinophil differentiation [^116XRF63]. Nature Immunology (2015). Medium credibility.

The transcription factor XBP1 has been linked to the development of highly secretory tissues such as plasma cells and Paneth cells, yet its function in granulocyte maturation has remained unknown. Here we discovered an unexpectedly selective and absolute requirement for XBP1 in eosinophil differentiation without an effect on the survival of basophils or neutrophils. Progenitors of myeloid cells and eosinophils selectively activated the endoribonuclease IRE1α and spliced Xbp1 mRNA without inducing parallel endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling pathways. Without XBP1, nascent eosinophils exhibited massive defects in the post-translational maturation of key granule proteins required for survival, and these unresolvable structural defects fed back to suppress critical aspects of the transcriptional developmental program. Hence, we present evidence that granulocyte subsets can be distinguished by their differential reliance on secretory-pathway homeostasis.

### B cell activation and plasma cell differentiation are inhibited by de novo DNA methylation [^117EGi4y]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

B cells provide humoral immunity by differentiating into antibody-secreting plasma cells, a process that requires cellular division and is linked to DNA hypomethylation. Conversely, little is known about how de novo deposition of DNA methylation affects B cell fate and function. Here we show that genetic deletion of the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (Dnmt3-deficient) in mouse B cells results in normal B cell development and maturation, but increased cell activation and expansion of the germinal center B cell and plasma cell populations upon immunization. Gene expression is mostly unaltered in naive and germinal center B cells, but dysregulated in Dnmt3-deficient plasma cells. Differences in gene expression are proximal to Dnmt3-dependent DNA methylation and chromatin changes, both of which coincide with E2A and PU.1-IRF composite-binding motifs. Thus, de novo DNA methylation limits B cell activation, represses the plasma cell chromatin state, and regulates plasma cell differentiation.

### Initiation of plasma-cell differentiation is independent of the transcription factor blimp-1 [^114a9KxN]. Immunity (2007). Low credibility.

Blimp-1 is considered an essential regulator of the terminal differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. We show here that Rag1-/- mice reconstituted with fetal liver cells homozygous for a DNA-binding-deficient mutant of Prdm1 (the gene encoding Blimp-1) lack a defined plasma-cell compartment, yet show detectable amounts of all immunoglobulin isotypes. In vitro analysis revealed that Blimp-1 is not required for the initiation of antibody secretion but is essential for subsequent high immunoglobulin production. Blimp-1-independent differentiation was blocked at a preplasmablast stage characterized by decreased Pax5 expression and the activation of plasma-cell genes. Analysis of Blimp-1-sufficient differentiation revealed a phase prior to Blimp-1 expression in which several genes normally repressed by Pax5 are re-expressed, suggesting that plasma-cell differentiation is initiated by the inhibition of Pax5 function. Our results indicate that full plasma-cell differentiation but not commitment to the plasma-cell fate requires the expression of functional Blimp-1.

### The differentiation and stress response factor XBP-1 drives multiple myeloma pathogenesis [^116aMe5J]. Cancer Cell (2007). Low credibility.

Based upon the above efforts to construct MM mouse models, we hypothesized that enforced B cell lineage-directed transgene expression of factors driving plasma-cell differentiation, alone or together with classical myeloma genes, would enhance the development of a MM-like disease. XBP-1 is a basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor of the CREB-ATF family and a major regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and plasma-cell differentiation. XBP-1-deficient embryos die in utero from severe liver hypoplasia and resultant fatal anemia. Viable chimeras derived from XBP-1 null ES cells injected into Rag2 blastocysts reveal that XBP-1-deficient B cells proliferate and form germinal centers, yet there is a profound impairment in Ig secretion and absence of plasma cells. XBP-1 is subject to alternative RNA processing, generating two mRNA transcripts encoding the same N-terminal DNA binding domain, but different C-terminal transactivation domains. The shorter spliced transcript, designated XBP-1s, possesses enhanced transactivation potential and stability relative to the product of the unspliced transcript, designated XBP-1u. Thus, XBP-1u has no appreciable transactivation potential and may function as a dominant negative of XBP-1s.

### Elevated interferon-stimulated gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurs in patients infected with genotype 1 but not genotype 3 hepatitis C virus [^111teqeN]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2015). Low credibility.

The ISGs identified in our study with elevated transcriptional in PBMCs from patients with gt1 infection include a number of genes that have previously been identified in transcriptomic studies of HCV-infected liver biopsies. These studies compared liver transcriptomes between patients who achieved SVR with patients who failed to respond to IFN-based therapies and demonstrated that higher expression of ISGs is associated with poor response to therapy. Indeed, pre-existing induction of ISGs predicts treatment response with greater accuracy than the widely used IL28B genotype. While these studies failed to specifically address genotype-specific transcriptional changes within the liver, when treatment response was excluded, viral genotype had the next biggest influence on differential gene transcription.

In the liver, the elevated transcription of ISGs includes a number of negative regulators of IFN α signalling pathways, such as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18), which inhibits further IFN signalling and is thought to contribute to the lack of IFN α -induced gene induction in treatment nonresponders. Strong IFN responses have also been hypothesized to limit the development of robust T-cell immune responses during the establishment of chronic HCV infection. Our results suggest that a general elevation of PBMC ISG transcription occurs in gt1-infected patients. This is in agreement with the conclusion by Sarasin-Filipowicz and colleagues that patients infected with HCV gt1 more frequently have increased expression of ISGs in the liver, which provides a plausible explanation for the relatively poor response to IFN-based therapies in these patients. It is perhaps noteworthy that gt1 infection is associated with spontaneous viral clearance during acute infection. The strong pro-inflammatory responses induced by HCV gt1 may aid clearance during early acute infection but hinder IFN signalling once chronic infection is established.

Despite observing a significant level of hypocholesterolemia in gt3-infected patients, we did not observe changes in genes involved in lipid metabolism. While in vitro studies have identified alterations in metabolic gene expression induced by HCV gt3 proteins, our results demonstrate that such transcriptional changes are not apparent in PBMCs. It is possible that changes in lipid metabolism may only occur within liver hepatocytes despite systemic reduction in total cholesterol levels. Alternatively, genotype-specific differences in lipid metabolism may only be evident at a post-transcriptional level. Clark and colleagues have previously identified a gt3-specific decrease in the serum levels of metabolites involved in the late stages of cholesterol synthesis, which resolve upon successful response to therapy, indicating that HCV gt3 is able to directly perturb cholesterol biosynthesis at a post-transcriptional level.

### Regulatory T-cell suppressor program co-opts transcription factor IRF4 to control T (H) 2 responses [^111VKqqv]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

In the course of infection or autoimmunity, particular transcription factors orchestrate the differentiation of T(H)1, T(H)2 or T(H)17 effector cells, the responses of which are limited by a distinct lineage of suppressive regulatory T cells (T(reg)). T(reg) cell differentiation and function are guided by the transcription factor Foxp3, and their deficiency due to mutations in Foxp3 results in aggressive fatal autoimmune disease associated with sharply augmented T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokine production. Recent studies suggested that Foxp3 regulates the bulk of the Foxp3-dependent transcriptional program indirectly through a set of transcriptional regulators serving as direct Foxp3 targets. Here we show that in mouse T(reg) cells, high amounts of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), a transcription factor essential for T(H)2 effector cell differentiation, is dependent on Foxp3 expression. We proposed that IRF4 expression endows T(reg) cells with the ability to suppress T(H)2 responses. Indeed, ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele in T(reg) cells resulted in selective dysregulation of T(H)2 responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin isotype production, and tissue lesions with pronounced plasma cell infiltration, in contrast to the mononuclear-cell-dominated pathology typical of mice lacking T(reg) cells. Our results indicate that T(reg) cells use components of the transcriptional machinery, promoting a particular type of effector CD4(+) T cell differentiation, to efficiently restrain the corresponding type of the immune response.

### Elevated interferon-stimulated gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurs in patients infected with genotype 1 but not genotype 3 hepatitis C virus [^116piQue]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be classified into seven distinct genotypes that are associated with differing pathologies and respond differently to antiviral therapy. In the UK, genotype 1 and 3 are present in approximately equal proportions. Chronic infection with HCV genotype 3 is associated with increased liver steatosis and reduced peripheral total cholesterol levels, which potentially influences peripheral immune responses. To understand these differences, we investigated host gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by microarray and quantitative PCR in patients with genotype 1 (n = 22) or genotype 3 infection (n = 22) and matched healthy controls (n = 15). Enrichment of genes involved in immune response and inflammatory pathways were present in patients infected with HCV genotype 1; however, no differences in genes involved in lipid or cholesterol metabolism were detected. This genotype-specific induction of genes is unrelated to IL28B genotype or previous treatment failure. Our data support the hypothesis that genotype 1 infection drives a skewed Type I interferon response and provides a foundation for future investigations into the host-pathogen interactions that underlie the genotype-specific clinical outcomes of chronic HCV infection.

### Plasma cell differentiation is controlled by multiple cell division-coupled epigenetic programs [^1123nT2T]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The genomic loci associated with B cell differentiation that are subject to transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in vivo are not well defined, leaving a gap in our understanding of the development of humoral immune responses. Here, using an in vivo T cell independent B cell differentiation model, we define a cellular division-dependent cis-regulatory element road map using ATAC-seq. Chromatin accessibility changes correlate with gene expression and reveal the reprogramming of transcriptional networks and the genes they regulate at specific cell divisions. A subset of genes in naive B cells display accessible promoters in the absence of transcription and are marked by H3K27me3, an EZH2 catalyzed repressive modification. Such genes encode regulators of cell division and metabolism and include the essential plasma cell transcription factor Blimp-1. Chemical inhibition of EZH2 results in enhanced plasma cell formation, increased expression of the above gene set, and premature expression of Blimp-1 ex vivo. These data provide insights into cell-division coupled epigenetic and transcriptional processes that program plasma cells.

### Gene expression profiling of plasma cells and plasmablasts: toward a better understanding of the late stages of B-cell differentiation [^112WvfEp]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Plasma cells (PCs), the end point of B-cell differentiation, are a heterogeneous cell compartment comprising several cell subsets from short-lived highly proliferative plasmablasts to long-lived nondividing fully mature PCs. Whereas the major transcription factors driving the differentiation of B cells to PCs were recently identified, the subtle genetic changes that underlie the transition from plasmablasts to mature PCs are poorly understood. We recently described an in vitro model making it possible to obtain a large number of cells with the morphologic, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of normal polyclonal plasmablastic cells (PPCs). Using Affymetrix microarrays we compared the gene expression profiles of these PPCs with those of mature PCs isolated from tonsils (TPCs) and bone marrow (BMPCs), and with those of B cells purified from peripheral blood (PBB cells) and tonsils (TBCs). Unsupervised principal component analysis clearly distinguished the 5 cell populations on the basis of their differentiation and proliferation status. Detailed statistical analysis allowed the identification of 85 PC genes and 40 B-cell genes, overexpressed, respectively, in the 3 PC subsets or in the 2 B-cell subsets. In addition, several signaling molecules and antiapoptotic proteins were found to be induced in BMPCs compared with PPCs and could be involved in the accumulation and prolonged survival of BMPCs in close contact with specialized stromal microenvironment. These data should help to better understand the molecular events that regulate commitment to a PC fate, mediate PC maintenance in survival niches, and could facilitate PC immortalization in plasma cell dyscrasias.

### Elevated serum BAFF levels in patients with autoimmune hepatitis [^111zGnRq]. Human Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Serum cytokines are thought to be involved in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) pathogenesis via immune dysregulation. B-cell activating factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and is known for its role in the survival and maturation of B cells. The aim of the study was to evaluate the serum levels of BAFF in patients with AIH and determine its relation to the clinical features of AIH. We examined serum BAFF levels in 55 patients with AIH, 14 patients with acute hepatitis (AH), 33 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 33 healthy subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver function tests, quantitative immunoglobulin, and antinuclear antibody levels were also assayed in AIH patients. Serum BAFF levels were elevated in AIH patients compared with healthy subjects (AIH: 2.07 ± 1.21 pg/ml, control: 0.77 ± 0.22 pg/ml). Similarly, serum BAFF levels were significantly higher in AIH patients compared with AH or chronic hepatitis C patients. There was a positive correlation between BAFF and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.513, p < 0.0001), alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.435, p < 0.0001), total bilirubin (r = 0.419, p < 0.01), and soluble CD30 (r = 0.579, p < 0.0001) in AIH patients. However, there was no correlation between BAFF and levels of gammaglobulins or titer of antinuclear antibodies. Corticosteroid treatment resulted in marked reduction in serum BAFF levels in AIH patients. These results suggest that BAFF contributes to liver injury and disease development in AIH patients.

### Critical role for stat3 in T-dependent terminal differentiation of IgG B cells [^112tFoSf]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Stat proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are crucial in many aspects of mammalian development. In the immune system, Stat3 has distinct roles in T-cell, neutrophil, and macrophage function, but a role for Stat3 in B-cell development, particularly in the terminal differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells, has never been directly tested. In this study, we used the Cre/lox system to generate a mouse strain in which Stat3 was conditionally deleted in the B-cell lineage (Stat3(fl/fl)CD19(Cre/+)). B-cell development, establishment of the peripheral B-cell compartment, and baseline serum antibody levels were unperturbed in Stat3(fl/fl)CD19(Cre/+) mice. Strikingly, Stat3(fl/fl)CD19(Cre/+) mice displayed profound defects in T-dependent (TD) IgG responses, but normal TD IgM, IgE, and IgA responses and T-independent (TI) IgM and IgG3 responses. In addition, germinal center (GC) formation, isotype switching, and generation of memory B cells, including IgG+ memory cells, were all intact in Stat3(fl/fl)CD19(Cre/+) mice, indicating that the requirement for Stat3 was limited to plasma cell differentiation. These results demonstrate a profound yet highly selective role for Stat3 in TD IgG plasma cell differentiation, and therefore represent a unique example of a transcription factor regulating isotype-specific terminal B-cell differentiation.

### Advances in the management of hepatitis B [^111hVLeQ]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection remains a pervasive global health challenge, affecting an estimated 254 million people worldwide. This review summarizes the current landscape of hepatitis B, including its epidemiology and the clinical spectrum of acute and chronic infection. It discusses the interplay between host and virus that underlies the progression from acute hepatitis to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The review further examines current screening practices, diagnostic methods, and staging tools, as well as providing an in-depth evaluation of antiviral treatment strategies guided by randomized clinical trials and international consensus. Particular emphasis is placed on emerging therapeutic approaches. Drawing on high quality evidence from large scale epidemiological studies, rigorous clinical trials, and evolving global guidelines, this review not only encapsulates the state of the art in the management of hepatitis B but also highlights critical gaps and future directions. This synthesis is intended to inform clinicians and researchers alike, offering insights that may enhance patient care and guide future research toward the ultimate goal of elimination of hepatitis B.

### Metabolic control of plasma cell differentiation-what we know and what we don't know [^116bk5VX]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Antibody secretion is executed by plasma cells that are generated in the periphery and migrate to the bone marrow to establish a long lived pool. The terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells is executed by a network of transcription factors that cross-regulate each other in order to irreversibly promote this transition. While major progress has been made in the understanding the transcriptional activity of the underlying master regulators, much less is known on the metabolic regulation of plasma cell differentiation that is required to support antibody synthesis, folding and secretion at high levels and allow their long-lasting survival. In this review we will address the known cross talks between the transcription and metabolic control of plasma cells and elaborate on the gaps of knowledge in the field.

### Expression pattern of XBP1 (S) in human B-cell lymphomas [^116g5TYq]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

The transcription factor XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1) is essential for plasma cell (PC) differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion. XBP1 is widely expressed, but its activity is precisely controlled by mRNA splicing in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It is the active form of XBP1, XBP1(S), which is required for PC differentiation. The relationship between XBP1(S) expression and PC differentiation in human tissue and its expression in hematologic malignancies has eluded assessment. With a novel antibody, we now define XBP1(S) expression in a large series of normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues. We establish that XBP1(S) provides a specific marker of advanced plasma differentiation and in lymphoid malignancies is restricted to PC-derived neoplasms and plasmablastic diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. XBP1(S) expression delineates heterogeneity amongst plasmablastic diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, identifying a distinct tumor sub-group. Furthermore, our results establish a direct and practical means of assessing ER stress in human tumors.

### A pre-neoplastic epigenetic field defect in HCV-infected liver at transcription factor binding sites and polycomb targets [^112GP3f3]. Oncogene (2017). Low credibility.

Our parallel study of B lymphocytes indicates that the transcriptional dysregulatory events are not constitutive throughout the body and reflective of a generally inflammatory state, but instead occur specifically in the cell type infected by HCV. B lymphocytes should have represented a cell type with a higher likelihood of being informative for HCV-associated cellular perturbations, given the unusually high frequency of a spectrum of B cell lymphoproliferative events associated with HCV infection. The easy accessibility of these cells from peripheral blood also raised the possibility that they could serve a role as biomarkers of events occurring in the liver. Instead, we see no significant DNA methylation or transcriptional changes characterizing the B lymphocytes from HCV-infected individuals, indicating that the transcriptional regulatory effects observed in liver are more likely to be due to the HCV infection in their host cells and not to the chronic inflammatory process.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116bgNYr]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) clinical manifestations and progression in people with HIV indicate that both acute and chronic HCV infections are usually minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, and elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels may be the only laboratory finding during acute and chronic infection; recognition of acute HCV with new-onset liver enzyme elevations is clinically important because early initiation of HCV treatment can lower the likelihood of poorer outcomes and prevent transmission to others; cirrhosis develops in 20 to 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection within 20 years after infection, and HIV coinfection adversely affects the course of HCV with significantly accelerated progression, particularly in those with advanced immunodeficiency (CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] count < 200 cells/mm³).

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111dqnj9]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) pathogenesis — immune tolerance failure and effector mechanisms are described as follows: Autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells break self-tolerance to hepatic autoantigens as the result of environmental triggers and inability of autoantigen-specific natural T regulatory cells (nTregs) and inducible T regulatory cells (iTregs) to prevent autoreactivity. Concurrently, in the absence of effective B regulatory cell (Breg) inhibition, autoreactive B cells produce autoantibodies. Peptide autoantigens are presented by class II and class I HLA alleles to autoreactive T-cell receptors on CD4 T helper (Th) cells and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), respectively. Binding of different autoantigens to B-cell receptors initiates secretion of specific autoantibodies. The composition of the local cytokine milieu dictates CD4 Th cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th22, and Th17 cells.

### Repression of the transcription factor bach2 contributes to predisposition of IgG1 memory B cells toward plasma cell differentiation [^113B9Lff]. Immunity (2013). Low credibility.

Memory B cells are essential for generating rapid and robust secondary antibody responses. It has been thought that the unique cytoplasmic domain of IgG causes the prompt activation of antigen-experienced IgG memory B cells. To assess this model, we have generated a mouse containing IgG1 B cells that have never encountered antigen. We found that, upon challenge, antigen-experienced IgG1 memory B cells rapidly differentiated into plasma cells, whereas nonexperienced IgG1 B cells did not, suggesting the importance of the stimulation history. In addition, our results suggest that repression of the Bach2 transcription factor, which results from antigen experience, contributes to predisposition of IgG1 memory B cells to differentiate into plasma cells.

### Environmental sensing by mature B cells is controlled by the transcription factors PU.1 and spiB [^1112NHpb]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Humoral immunity requires B cells to respond to multiple stimuli, including antigen, membrane and soluble ligands, and microbial products. Ets family transcription factors regulate many aspects of haematopoiesis, although their functions in humoral immunity are difficult to decipher as a result of redundancy between the family members. Here we show that mice lacking both PU.1 and SpiB in mature B cells do not generate germinal centers and high-affinity antibody after protein immunization. PU.1 and SpiB double-deficient B cells have a survival defect after engagement of CD40 or Toll-like receptors (TLR), despite paradoxically enhanced plasma cell differentiation. PU.1 and SpiB regulate the expression of many components of the B cell receptor signaling pathway and the receptors for CD40L, BAFF and TLR ligands. Thus, PU.1 and SpiB enable B cells to appropriately respond to environmental cues.

### Plasma cell differentiation and the unfolded protein response intersect at the transcription factor XBP-1 [^1148po3Q]. Nature Immunology (2003). Medium credibility.

The transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) is essential for the differentiation of plasma cells and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we show that UPR-induced splicing of XBP-1 by the transmembrane endonuclease IRE1 is required to restore production of immunoglobulin in XBP-1-/- mouse B cells, providing an integral link between XBP-1, the UPR and plasma cell differentiation. Signals involved in plasma cell differentiation, specifically interleukin-4, control the transcription of XBP-1, whereas its post-transcriptional processing is dependent on synthesis of immunoglobulins during B cell differentiation. We also show that XBP-1 is involved in controlling the production of interleukin-6, a cytokine that is essential for plasma cell survival. Thus, signals upstream and downstream of XBP-1 integrate plasma cell differentiation with the UPR.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^111QCSP3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

### The inflammatory cytokine profile associated with liver damage is broader and stronger in patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to patients with acute hepatitis B [^116kEvVz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Liver damage in hepatitis B is immune driven and correlates with inflammatory markers in patient serum. There is no comparison of these markers to determine if inflammatory profiles are distinct to different types of liver damage across patients at different stages of disease. We measured 25 inflammatory markers in patients with acute hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis B with hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion and chronic patients stopping nucleoside analogue therapy. Myeloid markers dominated the inflammatory profile in all stages of hepatitis B. More inflammatory markers were detectable in chronic patients, including elevated concentrations of cytotoxic effectors Fas ligand, TRAIL, and TNF-α.

### Generation of polyclonal plasmablasts from peripheral blood B cells: a normal counterpart of malignant plasmablasts [^116qP6WB]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

A new way to identify tumor-specific genes is to compare gene expression profiles between malignant cells and their autologous normal counterparts. In patients with multiple myeloma, a major plasma cell disorder, normal plasma cells are not easily attainable in vivo. We report here that in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood B lymphocytes, purified from healthy donors and from patients with multiple myeloma, makes it possible to obtain a homogeneous population of normal plasmablastic cells. These cells were identified by their morphology, phenotype, production of polyclonal immunoglobulins, and expression of major transcription factors involved in B-cell differentiation. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis shows that these polyclonal plasmablastic cells have a gene expression pattern close to that of normal bone marrow-derived plasma cells. Detailed analysis of genes statistically differentially expressed between normal and tumor plasma cells allows the identification of myeloma-specific genes, including oncogenes and genes coding for tumor antigens. These data should help to disclose the molecular mechanisms of myeloma pathogenesis and to define new therapeutic targets in this still fatal malignancy. In addition, the comparison of gene expression between plasmablastic cells and B cells provides a new and powerful tool to identify genes specifically involved in normal plasma cell differentiation.

### Regulation of plasma-cell development [^116ZYx42]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2005). Medium credibility.

Plasma cells are the terminally differentiated, non-dividing effector cells of the B-cell lineage. They are cellular factories devoted to the task of synthesizing and secreting thousands of molecules of clonospecific antibody each second. To respond to microbial pathogens with the necessary specificity and rapidity, B cells are exquisitely regulated with respect to both development in the bone marrow and activation in the periphery. This review focuses on the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, including the different subsets of B cells that become plasma cells, the mechanism of regulation of this transition, the transcription factors that control each developmental stage and the characteristics of long-lived plasma cells.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113qm2ZT]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10⁴ IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log₁₀ IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

### Antagonistic expression of hepatitis C virus and alpha interferon in lymphoid cells during persistent occult infection [^114i99Di]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Detection of residual HCV in individuals with SVR after treatment of CHC can be significantly heightened by analyzing ex vivo mitogen-activated T and B lymphocytes and applying sensitive nucleic acid amplification assays. However, it remained unknown if synergistic activation of lymphocytes and monocytes would further augment HCV detection, if viral replication becomes universally upregulated in treated cells, and if examining sequential sera and lymphoid cells would improve detection of occult infection. Using paired sera and lymphoid cells collected 1 year apart from 17 individuals with normal liver enzymes for up to 72 months after SVR, it was found that simultaneous activation of lymphocytes and monocytes enhanced identification of silent HCV infection and revealed that in some cases monocytes were the principal immune cell type where HCV persisted. Testing of serial samples further increased detection of occult infection. Ultimately, by combining the above two approaches, all individuals with SVR were found to be silent carriers of HCV. Clonal sequencing revealed HCV variations in sera and lymphoid cells and evolution of viral genomes confirming ongoing virus replication. Surprisingly, similar to those with CHC, naive lymphoid cells from some individuals carried approximately 10³ HCV copies/µg total RNA. HCV loads in naive lymphoid cells predetermined the outcome of ex vivo stimulation with respect to upregulation or inhibition of HCV replication. HCV RNA levels in occult infection were inversely proportional to the expression of IFNalpha and IFN-inducible MxA, but not to IFNgamma or tumour necrosis factor alpha in naive and mitogen-treated lymphoid cells.

### Cutting edge issues in autoimmune hepatitis [^111Trsik]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory liver disease affecting mainly females and characterised histologically by interface hepatitis, biochemically by elevated transaminase levels and serologically by circulating autoantibodies and increased levels of immunoglobulin G. Autoimmune hepatitis responds to immunosuppressive treatment, which should be instituted as soon as diagnosis is made. Seropositivity for smooth muscle and/or antinuclear antibody defines type 1 autoimmune hepatitis, while positivity for liver kidney microsomal type 1 antibody defines type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. The aetiology of autoimmune hepatitis is unknown, though both genetic and environmental factors are involved in its expression. The major mechanism of liver damage involves immune reactions against host liver antigens that are not adequately controlled by defective regulatory T cells. Current research aiming at potentiating regulatory T cell function in vitro to reconstitute tolerance in vivo has given promising results.

### Analysis of gene transcription in sera during chronic hepatitis C infection [^114TFgfM]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Alternative, non-invasive techniques are necessary to monitor the progression of liver disease during chronic hepatitis C. Firstly, because serum is the most accessible material for studies using qPCR in microplates, gene transcription was compared in 219 selected genes involved in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection between sera, PBMCs and liver samples collected simultaneously from five patients infected chronically. Secondly, using sera, gene profiles were compared between HCV-infected patients (n = 10) and healthy controls (n = 10). In addition, the influence of alcohol intake was examined in patients infected with HCV genotype-1. Firstly, amplifiable mRNAs were obtained in all samples. After amplification, significant correlations were observed between: liver versus serum; liver versus PBMCs; and serum versus PBMCs (r² = 0.37, r² = 0.54, r² = 0.49, respectively). A comparison of gene transcription by gene involved in T- and B-cell markers, adhesion molecules, apoptosis, liver matrix turnover and inflammation, revealed comparable, significant correlations between serum and liver, (r² = 0.30, r² = 0.60, r² = 0.51, r² = 0.51, r² = 0.26, and r² = 0.61 respectively). Secondly, a quantitative analysis of gene expression in sera between genotype-1b-infected patients and healthy controls revealed that 41 genes involved closely in T-cell activation and apoptosis were over-expressed significantly in patients infected with HCV. In these patients, alcohol consumption was associated with an increased expression of six genes involved in the inflammatory response, together with a decrease of genes associated with dendritic cell function. It is concluded that in patients infected with HCV, serum can be used to evaluate expression of liver genes. Further prospective studies are clearly needed to validate the initial results and to define the relevant genes.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^111eugRz]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver of unknown cause that may progress to liver cirrhosis and end stage liver failure if diagnosis is overlooked and treatment delayed. The clinical presentation is often that of acute hepatitis, sometimes very severe; less frequently, it can be insidious or completely asymptomatic. The disease can affect people of any age and is more common in women; its incidence and prevalence seem to be on the rise worldwide. An abnormal immune response targeting liver autoantigens and inducing persistent and self-perpetuating liver inflammation is the pathogenic mechanism of the disease. A specific set of autoantibodies, increased IgG concentrations, and histological demonstration of interface hepatitis and periportal necrosis are the diagnostic hallmarks of autoimmune hepatitis. Prompt response to treatment with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory drugs is almost universal and supports the diagnosis. The aims of treatment are to induce and maintain long term remission of liver inflammation. Treatment can often even reverse liver fibrosis, thus preventing progression to advanced cirrhosis and its complications. Most patients need lifelong maintenance therapy, and repeated follow-up in experienced hands improves the quality of care and quality of life for affected patients.

### Gene repression by pax5 in B cells is essential for blood cell homeostasis and is reversed in plasma cells [^112Ts6VB]. Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

The transcription factor Pax5 represses lineage-inappropriate genes and activates B cell-specific genes in B lymphocytes. By identifying 110 Pax5-repressed genes, we now demonstrate that Pax5 downregulates diverse biological activities including receptor signaling, cell adhesion, migration, transcriptional control, and cellular metabolism at B cell commitment. The T lymphoid or myeloid expression of these genes demonstrates that Pax5(-/-) pro-B cells and common lymphoid progenitors display lymphoid and myeloid promiscuity of gene expression. These lineage-inappropriate genes require continuous Pax5 activity for their repression, as they are reactivated in committed pro-B cells and mature B cells following conditional Pax5 deletion. Pax5-repressed genes are also reexpressed in plasma cells, which depend for normal function on Cd28 and Ccr2 reactivation. The loss of Pax5 during terminal differentiation thus contributes to the plasma cell transcription program. Finally, ectopic expression of the Pax5-repressed chemokine gene Ccl3 in B cells results in increased osteoclast formation and bone loss, demonstrating that Pax5-mediated gene repression is essential for normal homeostasis of hematopoietic development.

DAR encode lineage-specific transcription factor footprints

Transcription factor DNA-binding motifs enriched in DAR were identified to determine the putative transcription factors/families affected by chromatin accessibility changes at each division. The ETS or the composite ETS:IRF family motifs were prevalent across all divisions in DAR that lost accessibility (Supplementary Fig. 1a), suggesting that at a chromatin level, accessibility at these sites is lost to extinguish the B cell program. In ATAC-seq datasets, a discrete footprint reflecting variations in accessibility across a transcription factor motif and the surrounding chromatin can be computed. Base-pair resolution footprints of the ETS family factor SPIB and composite ETS:IRF motif bound by PU.1:IRF8, which negatively regulate plasma cell formation, were analyzed at each division. Both motifs progressively lost accessibility through each division, suggesting that their respective factors no longer functioned at these loci (Fig. 3a). In agreement with the rearrangement of the chromatin architecture upon B cell differentiation, CTCF motifs were enriched at loci that both lost and gained accessibility (Supplementary Fig. 1). Sites that increased accessibility were enriched for factors that control plasma cell differentiation and function including IRF, AP-1, OCT2 motifs, and composite elements including the AICE (IRF:AP-1) and ISRE (IRF:IRF) motifs (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 1b). Thus, DAR were enriched for transcription factor motifs that function in the differentiation of B cells to plasma cells.

### The 11q terminal deletion disorder jacobsen syndrome is a syndromic primary immunodeficiency [^114T73SV]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Therefore, close attention should be paid to immune cell function in these patients and when they present with recurrent infections immunological evaluation is warranted. It might be that more patients with JS require immunoglobulin replacement therapy than currently acknowledged. One of the important remaining questions is which genetic defect is responsible for the combined immunodeficiency state in JS. In previous studies an important role for ETS-1, a member of the ETS family of transcription factor, was proposed in cardiac abnormalities in Jacobsen patients. In mice deletion of ETS-1 leads to membranous ventricular septal defects, bifid cardiac apex and a non-apex-forming left ventricle. Moreover, it was previously found that ETS-1, which is highly expressed in NK cells, B and T lymphocytes in physiological conditions, is involved in NK cell development, B cell differentiation and T lymphocyte development. Several aberrations in B lymphocyte differentiation have been described in ETS-1 knockout mice, like enhanced differentiation into IgM- and IgG-secreting cells plasma cells and decreased titres of IgG2a. In mice expressing only one of the 2 known isoforms of ETS-1 diminished spleen cellularity including fewer memory cells was found. ETS-1 knockout mice also have a variety of defects in T cell lineage, including aberrant thymic differentiation, reduced peripheral T cell numbers, reduced IL-2 production and impairments in Th1 and Th2 cytokine production. Finally, in ETS-1 deficient mice lower numbers of NK cells and lower NK progenitors in the bone marrow are found. Interestingly, in our study, besides low numbers of memory B cells, low numbers of total NK cells and T lymphocytes were detected in a number of patients. This could be explained by a deletion of ETS-1. On the other hand, Friend Leukemia virus Integration-1 (FLI-1), which belongs to the ETS transcription factor family, is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 as well and is mainly expressed in haematopoietic cells. Loss of normal FLI-1 activation in mice resulted in significantly fewer splenic follicular B cells, an increased number of transitional and marginal zone B cells when compared to control mice. There are no studies that have evaluated the role of FLI-1 on immune cell functions in human. In myeloid malignancies deletion of 11q was described. Itwas demonstrated that this deletion existed both as a sole abnormality and in association with other changes, including t(8;21). It could therefore be hypothesized that deletions in the long arm of chromosome 11 in JS coincides with defects on other chromosomes that are responsible for the immune cell defects described. In ongoing research we will further characterize which genes in the deletion are responsible for the immune defects in patients with JS. A larger (international) cohort of JS patients with known genetic defects will be analysed for immunodeficiencies. We will define the smallest common deletion in JS patients with proven immunodeficiency, to narrow the potential genes involved in the development of immune cell defects in JS. ETS-1 may be a candidate gene, but also FLI-1 could play a role and novel genes with currently unknown function might be identified as being potentially involved in immune cell function. The role of FLI-1 on immune cell development and function will be studied in more detail. Finally, the potential involvement of genetic defects affecting other chromosomes should be studied in more detail in JS.

### Pathogenic memory plasma cells in autoimmunity [^11518kfG]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rational approaches to target (pathogenic) plasma cells should be based on a molecular understanding of their lifestyle, spotting their 'Achilles' heel', at best an exclusive one. However, selective targeting of autoreactive plasma cells remains a challenge as no unique or druggable markers have been identified so far. What do we know about the generation and persistence of plasma cells? In vitro, plasmablasts can develop from any type of activated B cell including naive, marginal zone, follicular, germinal center and memory B cells. In the process of becoming a plasma cell, the activated B cell undergoes considerable differentiation, transcriptionally and morphologically, in order to enable the massive production and secretion of antibodies. While for a long time plasma cells had been regarded as short-lived end products of B cell differentiation, arguing that the B cell would be the decisive target in antibody-mediated diseases, we now distinguish between short-lived plasmablasts/plasma cells with a lifetime of only a few days and long-lived memory plasma cells which can persist for many years. The molecular competence of a plasmablast to become a memory plasma cell is still not well defined. T cell signaling via CD40L seems to be pivotal, since genetic ablation of the CD40/CD40L axis leads to severe impairment of humoral memory, and (T cell-derived) cytokines like IL-10 and IL-21 promote plasma cell development. However, it has also been demonstrated that memory B cells can develop into memory plasma cells independently of T cell help, but in this case the generation of memory B cells is T cell-dependent.

### New insights into the regulation of human B-cell differentiation [^116sVmEa]. Trends in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

B lymphocytes provide the cellular basis of the humoral immune response. All stages of this process, from B-cell activation to formation of germinal centers and differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells, are influenced by extrinsic signals and controlled by transcriptional regulation. Compared to naïve B cells, memory B cells display a distinct expression profile, which allows for their rapid secondary responses. Indisputably, many B-cell malignancies result from aberrations in the circuitry controlling B-cell function, particularly during the germinal centre (GC) reaction. Here, we review new insights into memory B-cell subtypes, recent literature on transcription factors regulating human B-cell differentiation and further evidence for B-cell lymphomagenesis emanating from errors during GC cell reactions.

### Monozygotic twins discordant for common variable immunodeficiency reveal impaired DNA demethylation during naïve-to-memory B-cell transition [^117KtykS]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

B-cell differentiation and activation require high rates of protein synthesis and proliferation. In normal conditions both may provide an apoptotic stimulus, requiring the action of anti-apoptotic molecules such as BCL2-XL (Fig. 5), encoded by the BCL2L1 gene, and which are also hypermethylated in CVID B cells. This protein maintains the mitochondrial potential membrane and blocks the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.

Finally, at the end of BCR signalling there are the transcription factors, which can transform the signals received at the cell surface into gene expression changes that enable the cell to adapt and respond. To ensure that the proper gene expression pattern is achieved for the different stimuli, it is important not only for several transcription factors to be activated but also for those that are not required to be blocked. E2A (encoded by another hypermethylated gene in CVID memory B cells, namely TCF3; Fig. 5) and NF-κB are two examples of transcription factors activated during BCR signalling, while FOXO transcription factors are blocked after BCR activation.

Our findings regarding the impaired ability to demethylate genes during the transition from naive or memory cells reinforces the notion emerging from various studies that CVID individuals are deficient in differentiating towards memory B cells. For instance, we have known for over 40 years that CD73 activity is reduced in B lymphocytes of patients suffering from immunodeficiency syndromesand we now know that CD73-dependent adenosine generation favours class-switch recombination, endowing the B cell with an intrinsic control of differentiation towards immunoglobulin class-switched plasma cells. As mentioned above, CVID patients have severely deficient levels of switched memory B cells. These altered proportions of B-cell subsets are also reflected in the cell counts in the cohort of CVID individuals analysed in this study. Interestingly, at the DNA methylation level, genes such as PIK3CD, RPS6KB2, KCNN4, KCNC4, CORO1B and BCL2L1 are hypermethylated in memory B cells of CVID individuals relative to healthy individuals, or, in other words, they do not undergo the demethylation in the transition from naive to memory cells observed in healthy individuals. This could also be interpreted as meaning that if the DNA methylation patterns for these genes in memory cells from CVID individuals were reminiscent of those from naive cells, their ability to respond/maintain appropriate responses could therefore be diminished.

### Defective bcl-2 expression in memory B cells from common variable immunodeficiency patients [^117AiVr8]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and different degrees of B cell compartment alteration. Memory B cell differentiation requires the orchestrated activation of several intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the activation of a number of factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) which, in turn, promote transcriptional programs required for long-term survival. The aim of this study was to determine if disrupted B cell differentiation, survival and activation in B cells in CVID patients could be related to defects in intracellular signaling pathways. For this purpose, we selected intracellular readouts that reflected the strength of homeostatic signaling pathways in resting cells, as the protein expression levels of the Bcl-2 family which transcription is promoted by NF-κB. We found reduced Bcl-2 protein levels in memory B cells from CVID patients. We further explored the possible alteration of this crucial prosurvival signaling pathway in CVID patients by analysing the expression levels of mRNAs from anti-apoptotic proteins in naive B cells, mimicking T cell-dependent activation in vitro with CD40L and interleukin (IL)-21. BCL-XL mRNA levels were decreased, together with reduced levels of AICDA, after naive B-cell activation in CVID patients. The data suggested a molecular mechanism for this tendency towards apoptosis in B cells from CVID patients. Lower Bcl-2 protein levels in memory B cells could compromise their long-term survival, and a possible less activity of NF-κB in naive B cells, may condition an inabilityto increase BCL-XL mRNA levels, thus not promoting survival in the germinal centers.

### Plasma cell differentiation and survival [^113KaYZn]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Humoral immunity depends on the regulated production and maintenance of antibody secreting cells during the course of an immune response. Recent insights into the transcriptional regulation of the initiation of plasma cell differentiation have clarified aspects of this process, particularly with respect to the choice between the memory B cell and plasma cell differentiation pathways. It is now possible to specify the conditions favouring these outcomes and to predict where they might occur within the germinal center. Once formed, plasma cell survival is critically dependent on accessing niches that are formed by stomal elements in both normal and inflamed tissues. The apparent homeostasis of plasma cell numbers means that new specificities can persist only at the expense of existing ones, raising questions on how immunological memory is maintained in the face of new immune responses. The answer appears to be through the reduction of the process to a single cell level, thereby introducing an element of stochasticity.

### Hepatitis B [^115o6V1S]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

HBV clinical term definitions — per Table 4 — include the following: Chronic hepatitis B is defined as chronic necroinflammatory disease of the liver caused by persistent infection with hepatitis B virus and can be subdivided into HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B. Inactive HBsAg carrier state is persistent HBsAg without evidence of significant, ongoing necroinflammatory disease. Acute exacerbation or flare of hepatitis B is intermittent elevations of aminotransferase activity to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal and more than twice the baseline value. Reactivation of hepatitis B is reappearance of active necroinflammatory disease of the liver in a person known to have the inactive HBsAg carrier state or resolved hepatitis B. HBeAg clearance is loss of HBeAg in a person who was previously HBeAg positive. HBeAg seroconversion is loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe in a person who was previously HBeAg positive and anti-HBe negative. HBsAg reversion is reappearance of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative, anti-HBs positive.

Table 4
Definition of the consensus recommendation for histological criteria of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) from the International AIH Group Pathology pathology section

However no single histological abnormality is specific for AIH, and other conditions need to be excluded before establishing the diagnosis (box 1). Some histological features do argue against a diagnosis of AIH. Multiple well-formed granulomas, widespread bile duct injury, copper-associated protein deposition without advanced fibrosis, or steatosis/steatohepatitis, support an alternative or co-existing diagnosis. However given the high population prevalence of steatotic liver disease, it is debatable whether finding features of this condition as 'another liver disease' should diminish the likelihood of AIH.

Additional findings in AIH include lymphocytic apoptotic bodies and intracytoplasmic hyaline droplets in Kupffer cells. Their diagnostic significance and specificity await formal evaluation (online supplemental table 3).

Isolated centrilobular zonal necrosis and syncytial giant cell hepatitis are unusual findings, but do not invalidate the diagnosis, particularly in acute presentations.

Centrilobular zonal necrosis without portal hepatitis or fibrosisshould be recognised as part of the AIH spectrum, as these patients respond well to immunosuppressionand might be underscored as AIH using the diagnostic scoring systems (Section E). A plasma cell rich component, or clusters of plasma cells would further favour a diagnosis of AIH, even without of the more typical portal-based damage.

AIH presenting as AS hepatitis (with or without ALF) (Section C) poses particular diagnostic challenges. Liver histology was considered essential for diagnosis in 42% of patients with AS-AIH in a large multicentre cohort. Histological features include central perivenulitis (about 70%), severe hepatic necrosis (about 50%); lymphoid aggregates and plasma cell enrichment.

### Spi-B inhibits human plasma cell differentiation by repressing BLIMP1 and XBP-1 expression [^115Btg1w]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The terminal differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells is tightly regulated by a complex network of transcription factors. Here we evaluated the role of the Ets factor Spi-B during terminal differentiation of human B cells. All mature tonsil and peripheral blood B-cell subsets expressed Spi-B, with the exception of plasma cells. Overexpression of Spi-B in CD19(+) B cells inhibited, similar to the known inhibitor BCL-6, the expression of plasma cell-associated surface markers and transcription factors as well as immunoglobulin production, ie, in vitro plasma cell differentiation. The arrest in B-cell differentiation enforced by Spi-B was independent of the transactivation domain, but dependent on the Ets-domain. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and assays using an inducible Spi-B construct BLIMP1 and XBP-1 were identified as direct target genes of Spi-B mediated repression. We propose a novel role for Spi-B in maintenance of germinal center and memory B cells by direct repression of major plasma cell factors and thereby plasma cell differentiation.

### The forkhead transcription factor FOXP1 represses human plasma cell differentiation [^112MWiY7]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Expression of the forkhead transcription factor FOXP1 is essential for early B-cell development, whereas downregulation of FOXP1 at the germinal center (GC) stage is required for GC B-cell function. Aberrantly high FOXP1 expression is frequently observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, being associated with poor prognosis. Here, by gene expression analysis upon ectopic overexpression of FOXP1 in primary human memory B cells (MBCs) and B-cell lines, combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we established that FOXP1 directly represses expression of PRDM1, IRF4, and XBP1, transcriptional master regulators of plasma cell (PC) differentiation. In accordance, FOXP1 is prominently expressed in primary human naive and MBCs, but expression strongly decreases during PC differentiation. Moreover, as compared with immunoglobulin (Ig) M(+) MBCs, IgG(+) MBCs combine lower expression of FOXP1 with an enhanced intrinsic PC differentiation propensity, and constitutive (over)expression of FOXP1 in B-cell lines and primary human MBCs represses their ability to differentiate into PCs. Taken together, our data indicate that proper control of FOXP1 expression plays a critical role in PC differentiation, whereas aberrant expression of FOXP1 might contribute to lymphomagenesis by blocking this terminal B-cell differentiation.

### Plasma cell differentiation is controlled by multiple cell division-coupled epigenetic programs [^111A62Vb]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The kinetic analysis of gene expression and accessibility described herein revealed a subset of primed genes that contained accessible promoters but were not transcribed in undivided B cells. In memory CD8 T cells, genes with primed promoters encoded important effector functions that would be required during reactivation. In naive B cells, primed promoters occurred at genes with cell cycle and metabolic functions but also the essential plasma cell transcription factor Prdm1. Therefore, similar to CD8 T cells, B cell genes that function in the next developmental phase (i.e. activation and differentiation) displayed a pre-existing chromatin accessibility programming that may reduce the number of molecular steps necessary for or allow for a more rapid induction. A subset of primed promoters was marked by the repressive post-translational histone modification H3K27me3 and inhibition of the enzyme responsible for deposition, EZH2, resulted in enhanced expression of primed genes. H3K27me3 has been shown to mark essential developmental gene promoters and has been suggested to allow precise temporal and synchronized control of transcription. EZH2 is highly upregulated in proliferating GC B cells – and in response to LPS in vivoand ex vivo. These data suggest that in proliferating B cells, as in the GC, EZH2 functions to repress differentiation. Moreover, inhibition of EZH2 catalytic activity resulted in early induction of Prdm1 expression ex vivo. Reducing the molecular steps necessary for induction of genes such as Prdm1 is likely an important mechanism to allow rapid differentiation and formation of plasma cells. As methods improve to analyze the histone code on small numbers of primary cells, it will be revealing to track changes in post-translational histone modifications by cell division, including H3K27me3, to precisely determine when these marks change during differentiation.

Together, these chromatin accessibility data provide a readout of the trans -acting factors and epigenetic mechanisms and define the chromatin centric reprogramming steps required for B cells to differentiation into plasma cells. The initiation of the plasma cell gene expression program involves an elaborate interaction of transcription factors and the opening of thousands of enhancers. Histone modifications add an important layer of complexity and provide potential temporal control mechanisms for gene expression kinetics. Defining the epigenetic landscape in a cell-division linked manner for other stimuli will provide insights into the common and unique programming of B cell fates and the control of humoral immunity.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

Guidance statements — autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) drug withdrawal and monitoring: Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long-term treatment-free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and IgG levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for at least 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long-term maintenance regimen.

### Not interferon, but interleukin-6 controls early gene expression in hepatitis B virus infection [^117Y4vHA]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

With about 350 million virus carriers, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem. HBV is a noncytopathic virus causing persistent infection, but it is still unknown whether host recognition of HBV may activate an innate immune response. We describe that upon infection of primary human liver cells, HBV is recognized by nonparenchymal cells of the liver, mainly by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), although they are not infected. Within 3 hours, this recognition leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and subsequently to the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), but does not induce an interferon response. The activation of proinflammatory cytokines, however, is transient, and even inhibits responsiveness toward a subsequent challenge. IL-6 released by Kupffer cells after activation of NF-kappaB controls HBV gene expression and replication in hepatocytes at the level of transcription shortly after infection. Upon binding to its receptor complex, IL-6 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases exogenous signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-jun N-terminal kinase, which inhibit expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha and HNF 4alpha, two transcription factors essential for HBV gene expression and replication.

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate recognition of HBV patterns by nonparenchymal liver cells, which results in IL-6-mediated control of HBV infection at the transcriptional level. Thus, IL-6 ensures early control of the virus, limiting activation of the adaptive immune response and preventing death of the HBV-infected hepatocyte. This pattern recognition may be essential for a virus, which infects a new host with only a few virions. Our data also indicate that therapeutic neutralization of IL-6 for treatment of certain diseases may represent a risk if the patient is HBV-infected.

### Plasma cell differentiation is controlled by multiple cell division-coupled epigenetic programs [^115NjFuw]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Because, epigenetic mechanisms can function to restrict or promote the accessibility of DNA to sequence-specific binding proteins, identifying differentially accessible regions between two cell types can reveal regulatory elements that function to regulate gene expression and thus cell fate decisions. The assay for transposase accessible chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a sensitive tool that can detect accessible regions in the genome, including promoters and distal regulatory elements. The analysis of transcription factor DNA sequence motifs in regions that display altered accessibility provides an indication of which transcription factor families and pathways may be involved in the regulation of gene expression and differentiation. Here, ATAC-seq was applied to an in vivo model of B cell differentiationto define the cis -regulatory changes that occur at distinct differentiation stages defined by cellular divisions. We identify a unique set of promoters that exhibit increased accessibility in the absence of gene expression in undivided B cells. A subset of these primed promoters are enriched for H3K27me3 and chemical inhibition of EZH2 enhances expression of primed genes and increases plasma cell formation ex vivo. Together, these data provide a role for EZH2 dependent control of B cell fate that is orchestrated and regulated in a division-dependent manner.

### CTCF orchestrates the germinal centre transcriptional program and prevents premature plasma cell differentiation [^115T42Uc]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In germinal centres (GC) mature B cells undergo intense proliferation and immunoglobulin gene modification before they differentiate into memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells (PC). GC B-cell-to-PC transition involves a major transcriptional switch that promotes a halt in cell proliferation and the production of secreted immunoglobulins. Here we show that the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is required for the GC reaction in vivo, whereas in vitro the requirement for CTCF is not universal and instead depends on the pathways used for B-cell activation. CTCF maintains the GC transcriptional programme, allows a high proliferation rate, and represses the expression of Blimp-1, the master regulator of PC differentiation. Restoration of Blimp-1 levels partially rescues the proliferation defect of CTCF-deficient B cells. Thus, our data reveal an essential function of CTCF in maintaining the GC transcriptional programme and preventing premature PC differentiation.

### CTCF orchestrates the germinal centre transcriptional program and prevents premature plasma cell differentiation [^113quazC]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a ubiquitous architectural protein with eleven zinc-finger domains. Although initially described as a transcriptional regulator of the c-myc proto-oncogenethat establishes physical barriers on the DNA acting as a transcriptional insulator, studies have shown that CTCF is also associated with regions of active transcription. CTCF mediates long-range chromatin loops to facilitate or prevent promoter–enhancer interactions, suggesting that CTCF may have a general function in the control of gene transcription (reviewed in ref.). A number of studies have addressed the function of CTCF during B-cell development. Removal of CTCF-binding sites at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus has revealed an important function of CTCF in the regulation of V(D)J recombination during bone marrow differentiation. In addition, elimination of CTCF in early B-cell precursors, although compatible with immunoglobulin heavy chain recombination, resulted in a block in B-cell differentiation in the bone marrow. However, the function of CTCF in mature B cells, and particularly during the GC reaction, is unclear.

Here we use a conditional mouse model to deplete CTCF specifically in GC B cells. We find that CTCF is required for the GC reaction in vivo. By contrast, the sensitivity to CTCF deficiency in vitro is selectively dependent on the pathways mediating B-cell activation. Extensive transcriptome and functional analyses reveal that CTCF is required to maintain the GC transcriptional programme and to prevent premature PC differentiation by facilitating cell proliferation and by blocking Blimp-1 expression. Thus our data unveil CTCF as an important regulatory factor for late B-cell differentiation.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1136NeVQ]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis immunopathogenesis is described as a multistep working model in which a break in self-tolerance to hepatic autoantigens initiates immunological responses causing progressive hepatic necroinflammation and fibrogenesis. First, thymic autoantigen-specific iTregs are incapable of preventing autoimmune responses to hepatic autoantigens during hepatic or systemic immune responses to environmental triggers such as viral infections or xenobiotics. Second, professional antigen-presenting cells present autoantigenic peptides to autoreactive T cell receptors on naïve CD4+ TH cells, and CD8+ T cells and APCs activate MAIT cells by presenting bacterially processed vitamin B metabolites to MAIT cell TCRs. Costimulation is a crucial third step that induces expression of T-cell genes required for proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of autoantigen-specific CD4+ TH subsets (Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, iTregs, Tfh) and both CD8+ CTLs and CD8+ Tregs. Fourth, secretion of specific cytokines by CD4+ TH subsets leads to B-cell autoantibody production, macrophage activation, and CD4+ TH1‑mediated hepatocyte cytotoxicity. The fifth step is the cumulative failure of CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs and Bregs to control autoantigen-specific effector mechanisms causing hepatic injury, and exposure of CD4+ iTregs to specific cytokines can transform them into pathogenic CD4+ TH17 cells. The sixth step is the generation of complex portal inflammatory infiltrates that cause cytotoxicity of periportal and lobular hepatocytes, and necroinflammatory destruction activates periportal stellate cells, amplifies local immune responses, causes progressive portal fibrosis, and culminates in cirrhosis in the absence of effective immunosuppressive therapy. Functionally, CD4 Th1 cells secrete cytokines that promote proliferation of autoantigen-specific CD8 CTLs and activation of macrophages; CD4 Th2 cytokines augment immunoglobulin production by B cells and Tfh cytokines induce their conversion to immunoglobulin G (IgG)–secreting plasma cells; CD4 Th17 cells intensify inflammation and tissue injury, while autoantigen-specific iTregs can down‑regulate the proliferation and functions of all CD4 Th subsets and inadequate numbers and/or dysfunction of CD4 iTregs may play a key role in AIH.

### Graded expression of interferon regulatory factor-4 coordinates isotype switching with plasma cell differentiation [^114g4WcS]. Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the coordination of isotype switching with plasma cell differentiation are poorly understood. We show that interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) regulates both processes by controlling the expression of the Aicda and Prdm1 genes, which encode AID and Blimp-1, respectively. Genome-wide analysis demonstrated that Irf4(-/-) B cells failed to induce the entire Blimp-1-dependent plasma cell program. Restoration of AID or Blimp-1 expression in Irf4(-/-) B cells promoted isotype switching or secretion, respectively. IRF-4 was expressed in a graded manner in differentiating B cells and targeted Prdm1. Higher concentration of IRF-4 induced Prdm1 and consequently the transition from a germinal center gene expression program to that of a plasma cell. We propose a gene-regulatory network in which graded expression of IRF-4 developmentally coordinates isotype switching with plasma cell differentiation.

### Transcription factor IRF4 controls plasma cell differentiation and class-switch recombination [^117Wb4fG]. Nature Immunology (2006). Medium credibility.

B cells producing high-affinity antibodies are destined to differentiate into memory B cells and plasma cells, but the mechanisms leading to those differentiation pathways are mostly unknown. Here we report that the transcription factor IRF4 is required for the generation of plasma cells. Transgenic mice with conditional deletion of Irf4 in germinal center B cells lacked post-germinal center plasma cells and were unable to differentiate memory B cells into plasma cells. Plasma cell differentiation required IRF4 as well as the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1, which both acted 'upstream' of the transcription factor XBP-1. In addition, IRF4-deficient B cells had impaired expression of activation-induced deaminase and lacked class-switch recombination, suggesting an independent function for IRF4 in this process. These results identify IRF4 as a crucial transcriptional 'switch' in the generation of functionally competent plasma cells.

### Role of miR-223 in the pathophysiology of liver diseases [^112Ho3xB]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis

The most common causes of viral hepatitis comprise five unrelated hepatotropic viruses, namely, hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, HCV, HDV, and HEV. Viral infections are initially recognized by host innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including TLRs, NLRs, RIG-I-like receptors, and C-type lectins. The early PRR-mediated innate immune response is also required for orchestrating the development and activation of adaptive immune responses, which ultimately resolve viral infections and provide long-term protection against subsequent infection. Various innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, are involved in the control of viral infection and immunopathogenesis of viral hepatitis.

As miR-223 regulates the differentiation of several key factors (e.g. neutrophils, monocytes, and granulocytes) of innate immune response, it may affect the early stage of viral infection. Studies have shown that miR-223 expression is affected by HCV infection and treatment-based viral cures. The plasma level of miR-223 is significantly increased by at least sevenfold in patients, achieving sustained virologic response (SVR), after treatment compared with the baseline level but not in patients who have relapsed. The increased miR-223 level indicates the potential antiviral functions of the miRNA in SVRs and/or a physiological response to viral clearance. However, it remains unclear how high levels in the plasma relate to the expression levels of this miRNA in liver tissues. In another study, analysis of a miRNA panel in fresh liver biopsies showed that hepatic expression of miR-223 as well as other immunological and inflammatory pathway-associated miRNAs is downregulated by chronic HCV infection. Dysregulated miRNAs may be linked to chronic liver inflammation and subsequent complications by regulating the NF-κB pathway by targeting its key signaling molecules. In hepatitis B patients, the results have shown that miR-223 is elevated in serum from patients with chronic hepatitis B to a similar extent as in patients with HCC, suggesting the strong potential of miR-223 to serve as a novel biomarker for liver injury but not specifically for HCC. An additional study has shown that HBsAg particles circulating in HBV carriers can carry Ago2-associated protein and cellular miRNAs, especially liver-specific miRNAs and immune regulatory miRNAs (such as miR-223). These HBsAg-associated miRNAs may affect viral persistence and aid in explaining the clinical evidence that most efficient immune controls of HBV infection are associated with the loss of serum HBsAg. This finding also opens a new avenue for research to perceive the interactions between miR-223 and HBV infection. Another study has shown that miR-223 levels are downregulated in the serum of HBV-positive HCC patients compared with healthy controls, and that miR-223 is downregulated in HBV X (HBx)- or HBV-transfected HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, further suggesting that viral protein can regulate miR-223 expression and subsequently regulate host function by its target genes.

### Aberrant expansion and function of follicular helper T cell subsets in IgG4-related disease [^115rWxFQ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

One possible explanation for this is that Bcl‐6 expression by Tfh cells is unstable. It has previously been shown that Bcl‐6 expression is only necessary for Tfh cell generation at the early stage of Tfh cell maturation in GCs, but no longer required for Tfh cell function once CD4+ T cells have committed to the Tfh cell pathway, and Bcl‐6 expression may be down‐regulated when Tfh cells are in a state of silence 9, 18. Consistent with this possibility, in a Bcl‐6 reporter mouse strain, Tfh cells gradually down‐modulated Bcl‐6 protein expression over a few weeks after development. The Bcl‐6 low Tfh cells rapidly terminated proliferation and up‐regulated IL‐7 receptor expression. In addition, it was reported that there was no difference between the function of BCl‐6+ Tfh cells and the function of Bcl‐6− Tfh cells 21. However, BLIMP‐1 was barely expressed in the affected tissue (data not shown), but was up‐regulated in the peripheral blood of patients with IgG4‐RD. The up‐regulation of BLIMP‐1 (PRDM1) in circulating CD4+ T cells of patients with IgG4‐RD was not quite clear. We assumed that BLIMP‐1 (PRDM1) might function as a compensatory mechanism and be increased once GC Tfh cells developed and transformed into memory cTfh cells. Alternatively, BLIMP‐1 (PRDM1) might be up‐regulated in blood cTfh cells as a means to prevent their full differentiation into functional cTfh cells, a condition that is restricted to the tissue 22. Therefore, the mechanisms through which cTfh cells are controlled by multiple transcriptional regulators in IgG4‐RD needs to be further investigated.

As mentioned above, IL‐21 is essential for Tfh cell development and plays a pivotal role in the capacity of Tfh cells to drive B cell differentiation into plasmablasts/plasma cells. Our study also revealed that the levels of IL‐21 mRNA were up‐regulated in peripheral CD4+ T cells of patients with IgG4‐RD compared to healthy controls, and significantly decreased after treatment. In addition, we demonstrated that the IL‐21 mRNA level was positively correlated with the serum levels of IgG, serum levels of IgG4, and IgG4:IgG ratio. These results suggest that IL‐21 might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of IgG4‐RD. In the affected tissue of patients with IgG4‐RD, IL‐21 protein was highly expressed around the glandular tissue, as well as diffusely expressed throughout the tissue.

### Plasma cell differentiation requires the transcription factor XBP-1 [^1133JBNy]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Considerable progress has been made in identifying the transcription factors involved in the early specification of the B-lymphocyte lineage. However, little is known about factors that control the transition of mature activated B cells to antibody-secreting plasma cells. Here we report that the transcription factor XBP-1 is required for the generation of plasma cells. XBP-1 transcripts were rapidly upregulated in vitro by stimuli that induce plasma-cell differentiation, and were found at high levels in plasma cells from rheumatoid synovium. When introduced into B-lineage cells, XBP-1 initiated plasma-cell differentiation. Mouse lymphoid chimaeras deficient in XBP-1 possessed normal numbers of activated B lymphocytes that proliferated, secreted cytokines and formed normal germinal centres. However, they secreted very little immunoglobulin of any isotype and failed to control infection with the B-cell-dependent polyoma virus, because plasma cells were markedly absent. XBP-1 is the only transcription factor known to be selectively and specifically required for the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes to plasma cells.

### Elevated interferon-stimulated gene transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurs in patients infected with genotype 1 but not genotype 3 hepatitis C virus [^112mRzKF]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2015). Low credibility.

While the elevation of ISG transcription is evident in PBMC samples from gt1-infected patients, the mechanisms underlying this induction are not understood. A key question raised from our study is why gt1 and gt3 mediate different transcriptional responses? Although it is likely that reduced peripheral cholesterol levels act to reduce pro-inflammatory responses of peripheral immune cells, as described previously, this fails to explain potential genotype-specific differences observed in transcriptomic studies of the liver. No differences in the transcription of Type I, II, or III IFNs were observed between any of the study groups, suggesting that alternative immune signalling pathways drive the induction of ISGs. Future studies should address whether gt1- or gt3-specific genetic sequences are responsible for driving elevated ISG transcription.

In summary, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that gt1 infection drives a skewed Type I IFN response. These transcriptional differences may shed light on possible mechanisms underlying the distinctive clinical manifestations of these two HCV genotypes. Our study lays the foundation for further analysis of dysregulation of host cell factors by the distinct HCV genotypes.

Introduction

Representing the end stage of B-cell differentiation, plasma cells (PCs) play an important role in humoral immunity by synthesizing and secreting antibodies, thus protecting the host against infections. We previously developed a multistep culture system with various combinations of cytokines and activation molecules that reproduce the sequential PC differentiation (PCD) occurring in the different organs/tissues in vivo. PCD is initiated by activation of B cells, leading to their differentiation into transitional preplasmablasts (prePBs), a highly proliferating cell population. These prePBs further differentiate into plasmablasts (PBs), which can develop into quiescent long-lived PCs after migrating to survival niches which are traditionally in the bone marrow. Specific pro-survival niches could also comprise mucosa and sites of inflammation. B cells and PCs are key players of humoral immunity. Understanding the biological processes that control the production and the survival of normal PCs is critical both to prevent tumorigenesis and identify targets for pathogenic PCs and ensure efficient immune response without autoimmunity or immune deficiency.

On the transcriptional level, the differentiation of B cells into PCs is associated with substantial and coordinated changes in gene expression profiles. These changes are tightly guided by two sets of stage-specific transcription factors (TFs) that repress each other including: (1) B-cell TFs (PAX5, BCL6, and BACH2) maintaining the B-cell fate and (2) PC TFs (IRF4, BLIMP1 and XBP1) that are required to extinguish B-cell genes and activate the antibody-secreting cell (ASC) program.

Over the past decades, much progress has been made in understanding the physiological and transcriptional processes occurring during PCD. Knowledge of global gene expression patterns during PCD has been largely based on data obtained in mouse systems. Recent studies using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provide a more comprehensive view of transcriptional changes during murine PCD.

### Noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^116MsfcA]. Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A subset of T cells, the follicular helper T cell (Tfh), is responsible for providing help during B‐cell maturation and germinal center generation. There is a relative paucity of data about the role of B cells in the pathophysiology of AIH, although hypergammaglobulinemia (namely, elevated IgG) as well as defining antibodies are integral to the diagnosis of AIH. However, recent data has emerged regarding the role of TNF family B‐cell activating factor (BAFF), a cytokine essential for the development and maturation of B cells, which is further discussed below as a candidate biomarker.
