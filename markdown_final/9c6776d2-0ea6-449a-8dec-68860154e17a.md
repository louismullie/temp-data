Migraine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute migraine management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding secondary causes. Then, I should classify migraine type and severity to guide treatment selection. Next, I will select first-line acute therapy based on attack severity and patient factors, followed by escalation strategies and special populations. After that, I need to address timing of treatment, monitoring response, and prevention of medication overuse. Finally, I will consider preventive therapy thresholds and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and rule out secondary causes, because misclassification leads to suboptimal therapy and unnecessary testing; I should apply ICHD-3 criteria and screen for red flags such as new focal deficits, thunderclap onset, age > 50 with new headache, or progressive pattern, and if present, pursue neuroimaging and targeted evaluation before committing to migraine-specific treatment [^115SG2oJ] [^114KzJdX].

> Next, I should classify the migraine phenotype and severity to align therapy with attack characteristics; I need to distinguish migraine without aura from migraine with aura, assess attack frequency to separate episodic from chronic migraine, and grade severity as mild, moderate, or severe, while also noting associated symptoms like nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia that influence route and choice of therapy [^116vNnhh] [^1165RaQb] [^116Uedce].

> For mild-to-moderate attacks, I should start with simple analgesics, and I need to ensure I prioritize NSAIDs first-line because they have stronger evidence than acetaminophen; ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac potassium, and effervescent aspirin are all reasonable choices, with acetaminophen reserved for those who cannot take NSAIDs, and I should counsel on early dosing to improve outcomes [^1178PHGs] [^116Loc6i] [^114NWJ8R].

> For moderate-to-severe attacks or when NSAIDs are inadequate, I should offer a triptan, but wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness; high-quality evidence shows triptans outperform NSAIDs and acetaminophen for 2-hour pain freedom and sustained responses, and combinations of triptan plus NSAID outperform monotherapy, though adverse events are more frequent with triptans, so I must balance benefit and risk and screen for cardiovascular contraindications before prescribing [^112JzNsE] [^113hrC4H] [^114RcvPG].

> If triptans are contraindicated or not tolerated, I should consider gepants or ditans; I need to check the evidence base here, and yes, ubrogepant demonstrates superiority to placebo for 2-hour pain freedom and most-bothersome symptom freedom in phase 3 trials, and guidelines support offering gepants or ditans in patients who fail or cannot take triptans, with attention to hepatic metabolism considerations for some agents [^112DFGzd] [^115ePbFX] [^1145YhJg].

> I should double-check the timing principle because it materially affects outcomes; treating early when pain is mild increases the likelihood of 2-hour pain freedom and sustained responses across multiple classes, including triptans and gepants, and I should reinforce this at every visit to counteract the common tendency to delay until pain escalates [^117YUryu] [^1149JMGs].

> For patients with prominent nausea or vomiting, I need to ensure the route matches physiology; nonoral options such as subcutaneous sumatriptan, intranasal triptans, or intramuscular ketorolac can be used, and I should consider antiemetics like metoclopramide or prochlorperazine as adjuncts when nausea is severe, while avoiding agents with high abuse potential such as opioids or butalbital except in exceptional refractory cases [^116Loc6i] [^1137CPkd].

> Let me consider special populations carefully; in pregnancy, I should avoid triptans and prioritize acetaminophen as first-line, reserving NSAIDs for the second trimester if needed, and in pediatrics, ibuprofen or acetaminophen are first-line with triptans reasonable in adolescents, emphasizing early treatment and nonoral routes when vomiting is present, and if one triptan fails, I should try an alternative before switching classes [^116Loc6i] [^112Xk7c4].

> I will now examine escalation and rescue strategies; if the first agent fails, I should reassess diagnosis, timing, and adherence, then consider switching within class, for example trying a different triptan, or escalating to combination therapy such as sumatriptan plus naproxen, which improves pain freedom and sustained relief compared with monotherapy, and I should plan for relapse management with a second dose if symptoms recur within 24–48 hours while counseling on medication-overuse risk [^115qdxf5] [^116Loc6i].

> Next, I should review how to monitor response and define success; clinically meaningful endpoints include 2-hour pain freedom, sustained pain freedom to 24–48 hours, and functional restoration, and I should track consistency across multiple attacks because patients value reliable responses; I also need to watch for medication-overuse headache if acute treatments are used on more than about 10–15 days per month and intervene early with detoxification and prevention strategies [^111KrwZh] [^112yaSt1].

> Hold on, I should verify when to initiate preventive therapy; a practical threshold is when migraine adversely affects at least two days per month despite optimized acute therapy, or when acute medication overuse is present, and before starting prevention I should optimize acute treatment, address triggers and lifestyle factors, and select agents based on comorbidities and patient preferences, recognizing that evidence quality varies and shared decision-making is essential [^116Loc6i] [^116aAz36].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without skipping steps; confirm diagnosis and exclude secondary causes, classify phenotype and severity, treat mild attacks early with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, escalate to a triptan for moderate-to-severe attacks or NSAID-refractory cases, consider triptan–NSAID combination for enhanced efficacy, use gepants or ditans when triptans are contraindicated or fail, tailor route to nausea and speed of escalation, reinforce early treatment at mild pain, monitor for medication overuse, and initiate prevention when disability persists or overuse emerges, documenting outcomes with diaries to guide iterative adjustments [^115SG2oJ] [^112JzNsE] [^1178PHGs] [^115ePbFX].

> But wait, what if the patient is already using frequent acute medications; I should proactively screen for medication-overuse headache at each visit, educate on limits, and if present, implement withdrawal with bridging therapy and initiate prevention, because MOH perpetuates chronification and undermines acute efficacy, and this step is as critical as choosing the right acute drug [^116Loc6i].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and actionable; treat early when pain is mild, prioritize NSAIDs for mild-to-moderate attacks, use triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks or NSAID failures, consider triptan–NSAID combinations for superior outcomes, reserve gepants or ditans for triptan-intolerant patients, avoid opioids and butalbital, and escalate to prevention when disability persists, all while verifying diagnosis periodically and aligning choices with patient values and comorbidities [^112JzNsE] [^113hrC4H] [^1137CPkd] [^116Loc6i].

Migraine is a **recurrent primary headache disorder** with episodic attacks of moderate-to-severe throbbing pain, typically accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, and lasting 4–72 hours if untreated. Diagnosis is clinical, guided by ICHD-3 criteria, and management is **stratified**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen for mild attacks, triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks, and gepants or ditans when triptans are contraindicated or ineffective [^116Loc6i] [^112JzNsE]. Preventive therapy is indicated for **frequent or disabling attacks**, with options including beta-blockers, antiepileptics, CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine [^116aAz36] [^114KzJdX]. Early treatment improves outcomes, and **patient education on triggers and medication overuse is essential** [^1165nRCC] [^116Loc6i].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Migraine presents with **recurrent attacks** of moderate-to-severe throbbing pain, often unilateral, worsened by physical activity, and accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia; attacks typically last 4–72 hours if untreated [^112JzNsE]. Aura occurs in about 25% and includes transient visual, sensory, speech, or motor disturbances [^notfound]. Diagnosis is clinical, based on **ICHD-3 criteria**, requiring at least five attacks with specific features and exclusion of secondary causes [^1165RaQb] [^115SG2oJ].

---

## Pathophysiology

Migraine involves **trigeminovascular activation**, neuropeptide release (notably CGRP), and cortical spreading depression during aura; genetic and environmental factors contribute to susceptibility [^1136rLZy]. CGRP plays a central role, and its pathway is targeted by newer therapies [^112DFGzd].

---

## Acute treatment

Acute therapy aims for **rapid pain relief and functional restoration**; treat early for best outcomes [^1165nRCC].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | Ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac | Mild-to-moderate attacks | First-line; avoid in GI/renal risk [^1178PHGs] |
| Acetaminophen | Acetaminophen | Mild attacks | Alternative when NSAIDs contraindicated [^116Loc6i] |
| Triptans | Sumatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan | Moderate-to-severe attacks | First-line; contraindicated in CAD, stroke, uncontrolled HTN [^112JzNsE] |
| Gepants | Ubrogepant, rimegepant | Triptan contraindicated or ineffective | No vasoconstriction; hepatic interactions [^115ePbFX] |
| Ditans | Lasmiditan | Triptan contraindicated or ineffective | No vasoconstriction; sedation risk [^1145YhJg] |

---

Combination therapy (triptan plus NSAID) improves efficacy and reduces recurrence [^113hrC4H]. Avoid opioids and butalbital except in **refractory cases** due to dependence and medication-overuse headache risk [^1137CPkd].

---

## Preventive treatment

Preventive therapy is indicated for **frequent (≥ 4/month), prolonged, or disabling attacks**, or when acute treatments are ineffective or contraindicated [^notfound].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Propranolol, metoprolol | Unknown | Effective; avoid in asthma, bradycardia |
| Antiepileptics | Topiramate, valproate | Unknown | Effective; teratogenicity with valproate |
| CGRP mAbs | Erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab | CGRP pathway | Highly effective; monthly injections |
| OnabotulinumtoxinA | Botox | Unknown | For chronic migraine (≥ 15 days/month) |

---

Non-pharmacologic options include **cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, acupuncture, and lifestyle measures** (regular sleep, hydration, diet, exercise) [^116aAz36].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Acetaminophen first-line; avoid triptans, NSAIDs (especially third trimester), and valproate [^notfound].
- **Pediatrics**: Ibuprofen or acetaminophen first-line; triptans (especially nasal) effective in adolescents [^111tqQ8K].
- **Elderly**: Use caution with triptans; consider NSAIDs or acetaminophen first-line [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Gepants and ditans expand options for patients who cannot use triptans [^112JzNsE]. Neuromodulation devices (e.g. non-invasive vagus nerve stimulators, transcranial magnetic stimulation) are under study and may offer non-pharmacologic acute care [^116SMwLE]. Personalized medicine approaches targeting genetic and phenotypic markers are being explored [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Education on **trigger identification and avoidance** (stress, sleep disruption, hormonal changes, certain foods) is essential [^116Uedce]. Medication-overuse headache prevention requires limiting acute medications to ≤ 2–3 days/week [^notfound]. Early treatment at the first sign of attack improves outcomes [^117YUryu].

---

Migraine is a **chronic neurologic disease** with episodic attacks; **individualized, stratified acute care** and appropriate preventive therapy, plus education, achieve the best outcomes [^111VS4zm].

### Migraine treatment: current acute medications and their potential mechanisms of action [^116Z6Vja]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common and disabling primary headache disorder with a significant socioeconomic burden. The management of migraine is multifaceted and is generally dichotomized into acute and preventive strategies, with several treatment modalities. The aims of acute pharmacological treatment are to rapidly restore function with minimal recurrence, with the avoidance of side effects. The choice of pharmacological treatment is individualized, and is based on the consideration of the characteristics of the migraine attack, the patient's concomitant medical problems, and treatment preferences. Notwithstanding, a good understanding of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the various drug options is essential to guide therapy. The current approach and concepts relevant to the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine will be explored in this review.

Background

In an effort to improve migraine management around the world, the International Headache Society (IHS) has here developed a list of practical recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine. The recommendations are categorized into optimal and essential, in order to provide treatment options for all possible settings, including those with limited access to migraine medications.

Methods

An IHS steering committee developed a list of clinical questions based on practical issues in the management of migraine. A selected group of international senior and junior headache experts developed the recommendations, following expert consensus and the review of available national and international headache guidelines and guidance documents. Following the initial search, a bibliography of twenty-one national and international guidelines was created and reviewed by the working group.

Results

A total of seventeen questions addressing different aspects of acute migraine treatment have been outlined. For each of them we provide an optimal recommendation, to be used whenever possible, and an essential recommendation to be used when the optimal level cannot be attained.

Conclusion

Adoption of these international recommendations will improve the quality of acute migraine treatment around the world, even where pharmacological options remain limited.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^111PePsy]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

The quality of clinical trials is an essential part of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Scientific and clinical developments in headache medicine led to second and third editions in 2000 and 2012, respectively. The current, fourth edition of the Guidelines retains the structure and much content from previous editions. However, it also incorporates evidence from clinical trials published after the third edition as well as feedback from meetings with regulators, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and patient associations. Its final form reflects the collective expertise and judgement of the Committee. These updated recommendations and commentary are intended to meet the Society's continuing objective of providing a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the conduct and reporting of randomised controlled trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

### What do patients want from acute migraine treatment? [^1165nRCC]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical observations have shown that migraine is a progressive disorder, both within an acute attack, and within the disease itself. Rates of diagnosis for migraine have increased in the last decade, but more than half of migraineurs remain undiagnosed. Patient expectations of migraine therapies have also increased (patients require rapid and sustained pain relief with a treatment that has good tolerability), and can differ greatly from those of physicians. Management decisions should be made with these expectations in mind, to enhance patient outcomes and compliance with treatment. Improved understanding of acute migraine attack pathophysiology has led to the strategy of early treatment to modify both the progression of the current attack and, potentially, the progression of the disease itself in the individual. The triptans are effective acute migraine therapies. Each agent has its own distinct profile of efficacy and tolerability, enabling individualization of treatment.

### Millions of migraine attacks, many answers, more questions [^111dm3bZ]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the landscape of migraine treatment, many unanswered questions remain-particularly, which medications are most effective as acute agents and for which patients? Given the heterogeneity of patients, clinicians' practice, and the integration of new agents into migraine care, this is an ambitious question to address. 1 At the same time, this question is crucial both because proper acute treatment is an important metric of quality of care and such treatments are woefully underused in the general population. 2,3.

1. Clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks

1.1. Subject selection

1.1.1. Migraine definition

Recommendation:

Eligible subjects should fulfil the diagnostic criteria for migraine according to the most current version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) of the IHS.

Comments:

Clinical trials of acute treatments for migraine can include subjects who have migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and both migraine types, but the ICHD diagnostic criteria should be fulfilled to avoid population heterogeneity. In trials focusing on the acute treatment of migraine with aura, subjects with both migraine types can be included, as aura symptoms are recognizable, the attack types are distinguishable, and most people who have migraine with aura also have attacks of migraine without aura. (Refer to Section 2.1 for more information about migraine with aura.) In trials enrolling participants with a history of both types of attacks, the type of the treated attack should be classified according to ICHD criteria based on the clinical features captured in a diary. Note that this requirement may be impractical when subjects are instructed to treat early, because early treatment of migraine can modify the clinical features of an attack and thereby prevent analysis by type (refer to Section 2.2 for more information about early intervention trials). In some instances, after efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in subjects with confirmed diagnoses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura, trials targeting subjects with probable migraine – migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine – may be appropriate.

1.2.9. Timing of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.9.1. The timing of acute treatment should be defined in the trial protocol.

1.2.9.2. Usually, participants are instructed to treat when migraine headache pain is of at least moderate intensity, but alternatives include treating as soon as possible after headache onset, treating when pain intensity is mild, and treating when pain intensity is severe.

1.2.9.3. The timing of acute treatment must be consistent with the objectives of the trial.

1.2.9.4. Subjects should record the time and pain intensity at the time of treatment in the trial diary.

Comments:

The head pain of migraine frequently begins with mild intensity, progressively increases with variable speed to a peak, and is followed by resolution; headache pain can also fluctuate spontaneously during a migraine attack. These characteristics can pose challenges regarding the timing of treatment (e.g. early or when the attack is fully developed) and the evaluation of trial results. For example, healthcare providers typically recommend treating early in the course of a migraine attack, while pain intensity is mild, because it can enhance efficacy. At the beginning of an attack, however, migraine without aura can be difficult to distinguish from non-migraine headaches. Thus, subjects in migraine clinical trials who are instructed to treat as soon as possible (i.e. at the first sign of migraine) may mistakenly treat other headache types. The potential for confusion is mitigated when attacks are allowed to fully develop. Having subjects wait until pain intensity is moderate or severe before treating increases the specificity of migraine diagnoses. Yet because this strategy conflicts with common clinical advice about early treatment, it is essential that participants in clinical trials receive clear instruction about when to use acute treatment. In later stages of development, depending on the specific objectives of the program, trials evaluating early intervention and treatment when headache pain intensity is severe (e.g. for early morning migraine) are encouraged when investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of new treatments.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^117YUryu]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Additional challenges hindering clinical trials for the acute treatment of aura include the low incidence and relatively short duration of aura, together with the high inter-individual variability of aura characteristics. The adoption of alternative trial designs may help to overcome these challenges and the consequent lack of specific treatments for migraine-associated aura. As a first step, the trial protocol should clearly state if the objective is to abort or reduce the length of the aura or to reduce or eliminate the headache, as these are distinct outcomes that most likely have different neurobiologies. It should also specify that participants have a history of at least one aura or attack of migraine with aura per month. In trials where the expected effect of treatment is to prevent the headache phase, the primary efficacy endpoint should be the number of headaches following the aura, with pain freedom after 2 hours a secondary efficacy measure. When the focus is on headache prevention in migraine with aura, a feasible compromise can be aura followed by headache in at least 80% of the attacks. In trials where aura is the event of interest, the primary efficacy measure should be the duration of the aura.

2.2. Early intervention

To facilitate migraine diagnosis and assess whether acute treatment will be effective when headache intensity is moderate or severe, subjects in clinical trials are often required to wait until headache pain is of at least moderate intensity before they treat an attack. This is not how migraine attacks are treated in clinical practice, where early intervention may be the most effective acute treatment strategy. With many oral triptans, for example, early intervention has been shown to lead to a higher percentage of pain-free responses at 2 hours after treatment than traditional administration (i.e. when headache intensity is moderate or severe): 57% versus 43% for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, 68% versus 47% for eletriptan, 53% versus 38% for almotriptan 12.5 mg, 58% versus 32% for sumatriptan 100 mg, and 66% versus 44% for rizatriptan 10 mg). Early treatment while pain is mild has been associated with higher pain free rates for non-triptan acute treatments as well.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116SMwLE]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1991, the Clinical Trials Standing Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS) published the first edition of the Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Its goal was to improve the quality of controlled clinical trials in migraine by encouraging the use of scientifically robust methods in clinical research. To keep pace with developments in the scientific and clinical understanding of acute treatment, the Committee published a second edition of the Guidelines in 2000 and a third edition in 2012. The commitment to continuous improvement has been recognized; the Guidelines were considered in the 2018 Guidance for industry prepared by the Division of Neurology Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they were adopted by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in a 2016 concept paper that represented an important milestone in its formal revision of the 2007 Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of migraine.

Since the 2012 update, multiple new acute treatments have been developed, including small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, serotonin (5-HT 1F) receptor agonists, triptan reformulations, and neuromodulation approaches. Accordingly, the Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition incorporates data from clinical trials conducted since the third edition of the Guidelines was published, as well as feedback from meetings with representatives of the FDA and EMA, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and patient associations. Although the Committee considered the comments of pharmaceutical and device manufacturers and members of the IHS on the first draft, the published version is an independent and unbiased reflection of the expertise and consensus judgement of its members.

The present publication retains the structure of the third edition, with sub-sections for the selection of subjects, trial design, evaluation of results, statistics, and special issues, as well as a Toolbox, which provides readers with an index to content and summary statements for each section. Several challenges in trial design that were raised in a preliminary statement in the third edition – specifically, the timing of acute treatment, consistency of response, and participants who have migraine with aura – have been addressed in Sections 1.2.9, 1.2.12, and 2.1, respectively. It is therefore hoped that this edition of the Guidelines continues the tradition of its predecessors by providing investigators with a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the conduct and reporting of clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

1.2.2. Placebo control

Recommendations:

1.2.2.1. Interventions under evaluation for the acute treatment of migraine should be compared with placebo.

1.2.2.2. When two presumably active treatments are compared, a placebo control should be included for assay sensitivity.

Comments:

The placebo effect is a genuine psychobiological phenomenon that affects the results of clinical trials across different disease states. In trials for the acute treatment of migraine placebo response varies widely, from 6% to 56% for headache relief and from 6% to 25% for pain freedom. This variability makes it difficult to interpret the results of active comparator trials that do not include placebo. Trials using historical controls or active comparators lack assay sensitivity and require large sample sizes to provide the narrow confidence intervals (CIs) needed to ensure that new drugs are not inferior to controls.

In the past, modified designs (e.g. exclusion of placebo responders or sequential parallel designs) to reduce placebo response have proved poorly effective. Nonetheless, particular care should be dedicated to identify and mitigate placebo response risks as much as possible.

### Comparative effects of drug interventions for the acute management of migraine episodes in adults: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112JzNsE]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a neurological disorder characterised by disabling, recurrent episodes of moderate to severe headache and accompanying symptoms lasting up to 72 hours. Migraine affects more than one billion people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability in girls and women aged 15 to 49 years. The burden of migraine extends to personal welfare, reduced productivity, and poor socioeconomic outcomes.

The acute management of migraine episodes consists of drug interventions aimed at providing rapid and sustained pain relief, and, ideally, freedom from pain. Several drugs with different mechanisms of action are available. International clinical guidelines generally endorse non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as initial treatment, whereas triptans are recommended for moderate to severe episodes or when the response to NSAIDs is insufficient. In recent years, lasmiditan and gepants have been introduced as further treatment options, especially for patients with contraindications to triptans owing to potential vasoconstrictive effects and higher risk of ischaemic events. However, no clear consensus exists as to which specific agents from these drug classes should be selected initially.

Given the wide range of drugs for acute treatment of migraine, clinicians and patients need robust evidence to make the best, individualised choice in routine practice. Network meta-analyses allow for estimation of comparative efficacy, providing a comprehensive summary of the evidence base and understanding of the relative merits of the multiple interventions. Previous network meta-analyses, however, only compared a subset of available drugs. As part of the AMADEUS (acute migraine attacks: different effects of individual drugs) "project", we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare licensed oral drugs for the acute treatment of migraine episodes in adults.

### What efficacy measures are clinically relevant and should be used in cochrane reviews of acute migraine trials? An alternative viewpoint [^113y9WQS]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

I briefly review the purposes of efficacy measures, which go far beyond supporting new drug development. I use vignettes to illustrate the importance of functional recovery during the migraine attack, and argue that headache relief provides this. Sustained headache relief (SHR) is therefore a very worthwhile outcome when the alternative is a day of debilitating pain. As a measure, SHR may not be ideal for new drug development but it is informative to individuals, health care providers and politicians, and serves cost-effectiveness analysis better than any other. Cochrane are absolutely right to use it in systematic reviews along with the IHS-recommended measures.

### Treatment recommendations for migraine [^116Uedce]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be acute or preventive. Acute treatment attempts to stop the progression of an attack or relieve pain and functional impairment once an attack has begun, whereas preventive therapy is given to reduce attack frequency and severity. Additional benefits of preventive therapy include improving responsiveness to acute attack treatment, and reducing disability. Treatment protocols should also include education and reassurance, avoidance of triggers, nonpharmacological treatments, and physical and/or complementary medicine when appropriate. The treatment plan should be reassessed at regular intervals. Acute attack medication can be specific or nonspecific, and needs to be tailored to the individual patient. Backup and rescue medication should be available in case the initial treatment fails. The route of drug administration depends on attack severity, how rapidly the attack escalates, the patient's preference, the presence or absence of severe nausea or vomiting, and the need for rapid relief. Preventive migraine treatments include beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs. Preventive treatments are selected on the basis of the drugs' side-effect profiles and the patient's coexistent and comorbid conditions.

### Time lost due to an attack-a novel patient-reported outcome measure for acute migraine treatments [^111551vE]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We propose a new outcome measure to assess the efficacy of migraine treatments translating the approach of the Global Burden of Disease studies from a societal to an individual level: Instead of calculating "years lived with disability", we suggest estimating "time lost due to an attack".

Methods

Time lost due to an attack is calculated by multiplying the duration and the degree of impaired functioning during an attack.

Results

Time lost due to an attack, different from other outcome measures, does not just focus on the short-term analgesic effects of treatments, but rather on the improvement of all migraine symptoms and restoration of functioning, also considering therapy-related impairment. Importantly, time lost due to an attack measures the entire time patients are not functioning normally, from onset to complete resolution.

Conclusions

Time lost due to an attack represents a new paradigm to assess migraine burden in single patients for a patient-centered evaluation of both acute and prophylactic treatments.

1.1.4. Frequency of attacks

Recommendations:

1.1.4.1. Attacks of migraine should occur two to eight times per month.

1.1.4.2. The frequency of other headaches (including non-target) must be no greater than 1 day per month.

1.1.4.3. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headache between attacks of migraine under study.

1.1.4.4. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

Comments:

A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that those with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of freedom from headache between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse, and it avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. The evaluation of three to five consecutive attacks provides information on consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack (refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response).

1.1.5. Duration of migraine

Recommendation:

Migraine should be present for at least 1 year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

Because there are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, and the 1-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria, a minimum course of 1 year is advised to exclude people with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician evaluation of medical records. At least five prior attacks of migraine without aura or two prior attacks of migraine with aura are required for diagnoses using ICHD criteria.

1.1.6. Age at onset

Recommendation:

The age at onset of migraine should be less than 50 years.

Comments:

Few adults will be excluded by this criterion, as migraine beginning after the age of 50 years is rare, and the prevalence of secondary headaches or organic diseases mimicking migraine increases after age 50. The inclusion of subjects with onset of migraine after 50 years of age can be considered in phase IV trials, as long as the migraine diagnosis is well established by ICHD criteria, and secondary headaches have been ruled out.

1.1.2. Other primary headaches

Recommendations:

1.1.2.1. Individuals satisfying criteria for chronic migraine or with a history of chronic migraine in the last 12 months should be excluded from pivotal efficacy trials for the acute treatment of migraine. In subsequent trials, exploration of the benefits of new acute treatments in subjects with chronic migraine is needed.

1.1.2.2. Subjects with other concomitant primary headache types (e.g. tension-type headache) are allowed if attacks are infrequent (i.e. present on an average of < 1 day/month and < 12 days/year) and can be differentiated from migraine based on the quality of pain and associated symptoms.

Comments:

Individuals with chronic migraine are excluded from the initial clinical trials of acute treatment because they may complicate analyses of efficacy in undifferentiated populations (refer to for guidance about trials evaluating preventive treatments in adults with chronic migraine). Subjects with migraine may have other primary headache types, including tension-type headache. Those experiencing primary headaches that cannot be distinguished from ICHD-defined migraine without aura should be excluded.

1.1.3. Secondary headaches

Recommendation:

Individuals with secondary headaches, including medication-overuse headache, should be excluded.

Comments:

Excessive use of acute medications for migraine does not necessarily lead to medication-overuse headache, and some individuals may fulfil IHS criteria for overuse of acute medications without suffering from a chronic pattern of headache. The secondary headache exclusion also applies to these subjects.

2.2.2. Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint in early intervention trials should be pain-free at 2 hours after treatment. However, as the aim of early intervention trials is also to evaluate efficacy on pain progression, sustained pain-free to 24 or 48 hours (refer to Section 1.3.4.2) should be used as a co-primary endpoint. The number of protocol violators (subjects assigned to treat mild headache who treat moderate-severe and vice versa) in early intervention trials can be substantial. As protocol violators, these subjects can be excluded from the ITT analysis, but there is a risk that analysis of the smaller sample will not be sufficiently powered to detect treatment effects. An acceptable alternative is to reassign these subjects to their actual treatment groups, as long as the re-allocation is done before the blind is broken.

1.2.12. Consistency of response

Recommendations:

1.2.12.1. Intra-individual consistency of response may be evaluated over multiple attacks in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

1.2.12.2. Response to at least four attacks should be assessed, and at least one of the four attacks should be treated with placebo in a randomized fashion.

Comments:

Population-level consistency of response refers to the proportion of treated subjects who achieve a trial endpoint for the first, second, third, or n th treated attack. This is best assessed in randomized controlled trials evaluating multiple attacks (≥ 4) using any of the following three designs. In the first design, all subjects use active treatment for at least three attacks, with placebo in one additional attack, in a randomized order. The second design administers the active treatment for all attacks in most subjects, while a subset uses both active treatment and placebo in a randomized manner for at least four attacks. The third design uses a combined approach, with an initial 1-month double-blind phase (subjects use active treatment or placebo for the first attack) followed by a 1- or 2-month open-label phase, during which subjects treat at least three attacks with the active intervention.

Testing the effect of an acute treatment on several migraine attacks may increase the discriminative power for efficacy when outcome measures are averaged across multiple attacks for each subject, provided that all analysed subjects treat the same number of attacks. Using a generalized estimating equation or random-effects modelling, all treated attacks can be used as a basis for comparison. Generalized estimating equations control for intra-individual correlation, whereas random-effects models treat each individual as a random effect. However, the increase in analytic power can be counterbalanced by a decrease in the number of subjects completing the trial. Relative to single-attack trials, multiple attack trials have higher dropout rates and may introduce an unmanageable bias if dropouts are related to tolerability issues or lack of efficacy. Furthermore, repeated intake of placebo when a standard treatment is available raises ethical issues.

Assessing intra-individual and population-level consistency of response has been difficult in long-term safety trials because they rarely include a placebo control and often introduce selection bias when responders from an efficacy trial are carried over. Long-term trials should be used to evaluate the development of tolerance (tachyphylaxis).

1.3. Evaluation of results

---

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116cNEue]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.4.5. Headache relief

Recommendations:

1.3.4.5.1. Headache relief, defined as the decrease in headache pain from moderate or severe at baseline to mild or none at 2 hours after treatment and before taking any rescue medication (refer to Section 1.2.11), should be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

1.3.4.5.2. A time point before 2 hours after treatment can be used when testing parenteral treatments.

Comments:

Headache relief should be used as an outcome measure, but only as a secondary endpoint and mainly to facilitate comparison of the results of new clinical trials with those of previous programmes Since headache relief is associated with relief of disability, it can be used in clinical trials as a proxy for pain improvement and restoration of function. Headache relief is also useful for comprehensive cost of treatment analyses.

In older acute migraine clinical trials, headache relief at 2 hours after treatment was used extensively as a primary efficacy outcome based on the suggestion that patients may consider an acute treatment effective while residual headache pain persists. The validity of this argument has been challenged by evidence showing that patients do not believe a reduction in headache pain from moderate to mild constitutes success and expect acute treatment to provide freedom from pain. In addition, the headache relief endpoint assumes that the magnitude of change from severe pain to no pain is clinically equivalent to the change from moderate pain to mild pain, which is not the case. Finally, the verbal rating of pain intensity as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe assumes it is an interval variable in the absence of clinical validation.

1.3.4.6. Time to meaningful relief

Recommendation:

Time to meaningful relief can be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

Comments:

Time to meaningful relief is most often assessed by subjects using electronic diaries with time-stamp capabilities, which have largely replaced the use of stopwatches. The time-stamped information improves the precision of time estimates relative to the fixed-interval assessments once commonly used in migraine trials by providing data about treatment response over a clinically relevant period of time instead of at pre-specified time points (e.g. 1, 2, or 4 hours after treatment). Time stamping also allows diary entries for time to meaningful relief to be analysed by powerful statistical methods, such as survival analysis, that are superior to analyses based on fixed intervals.

1.2.5. Stratification

Recommendations:

1.2.5.1. There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials.

1.2.5.2. Stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or an important factor may influence the results of a trial.

Comments:

Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials, and stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Stratification variables that have been used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (i.e. with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

1.2.6. Intention to treat

Recommendations:

1.2.6.1. Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT), which implies that analyses should include all randomised subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received.

1.2.6.2. The full analysis set may be modified to exclude subjects from the analysis if no treatment was taken or if no data points after treatment were recorded. A plan should be provided prospectively as to how participants missing the 2-hour endpoint or who treat but do not record data will be handled. Those who treat but do not record data should probably be counted as failures, and those who use rescue medication before the 2-hour time assessment should be counted as failures.

Comments:

The ITT principle encourages, where reasonable, the inclusion of subjects who withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or did not fully adhere to trial protocol. The ITT principle should be adhered to when the primary outcome is a variable that measures a change from baseline to any post-dose time point or to the end of the trial. When the primary outcome is defined as a rate of change, and the analysis will therefore imply a slope or rate of calculation, only subjects who have received at least one dose and recorded at least one data point should be included.

### Non-pharmacological approaches for migraine [^117MvcJp]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is one of the most common and debilitating neurological disorders. However, the efficacy of pharmacological therapies may have unsatisfactory efficacy and can be poorly tolerated. There is a strong need in clinical practice for alternative approaches for both acute and preventive treatment. Occasionally, this need might arise in the context of low-frequency migraneurs who are not keen to use medication or fear the potential side effects. At the opposite end of the spectrum, clinicians might be faced with patients who have proven refractory to numerous medications. These patients may benefit from invasive treatment strategies. In recent years, promising strategies for migraine therapy have emerged alongside a progressively better understanding of the complex pathophysiology underlying this disease. This review discusses the most recent and evidence-based advances in non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches for migraine, offering alternatives to drug treatment for both the commonly encountered episodic cases as well as the more complex migraine phenotypes, which are capable of challenging even the headache specialist.

Clinical trials are a key component of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for Controlled Trials of Drugs in Migraine. Advances in drugs, devices, and biologicals, as well as novel trial designs, have prompted several updates over the nearly 30 years since, including most recently the Guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment of chronic migraine (2018), the Guidelines for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults (2019), and Guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment of migraine in children and adolescents (2019). The present update incorporates findings from new research and is intended to optimize the design of controlled trials of preventive pharmacological treatment of episodic migraine in adults. A guideline for clinical trials with devices will be published separately.

### Migraine [^115SG2oJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Migraine affects about 1 billion people worldwide, and up to 15% of adults in the United States have migraine attacks in any given year. Migraine is associated with substantial adverse socioeconomic and personal effects. It is the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide for all ages and the leading cause in women aged 15 to 49 years. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the likelihood of unnecessary investigations and suboptimal management. This article advises clinicians about diagnosing migraine, ruling out secondary headache disorders, developing acute and preventive treatment plans, and deciding when to refer the patient to a specialist.

1.3.4.18. Treatment of relapse

Recommendation:

The efficacy of treatment for headache relapse should be measured by the percentage of subjects with pain freedom 2 hours after the administration of treatment for headache relapse.

Comments:

Relapse of headache pain of any intensity can be treated with active treatment or placebo in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial. Participants should be re-randomized to active treatment or placebo for the second dose. Measured by the pain relief endpoint, the efficacy of certain acute medications (e.g. oral triptans) is similar whether the primary or the relapsing headache is treated.

1.2.10. Number of attacks treated

Recommendations:

1.2.10.1. Determining the effect of an acute treatment on the first migraine attack should be the primary objective. The attack to be considered should be clearly specified in the protocol.

1.2.10.2. If multiple attacks are treated, the first treated attack or the attack that will be considered for assessing the primary objective can be randomly selected.

Comments:

In most clinical trials of acute treatment, the first treated attack will be used in the evaluation of efficacy. Refer to Section 1.2.12 for information about multiple-attack trials addressing consistency of response as a primary objective.

1.2.11. Rescue medication

Recommendations:

1.2.11.1. The use of rescue medication should be allowed at any time after the first primary efficacy time point, typically 2 hours after the initial administration of treatment.

1.2.11.2. Use of rescue medication before the 2-hour endpoint should be considered a treatment failure unless an earlier time point for rescue was pre-specified in the trial protocol.

Comments:

The time interval to using rescue medication can be reduced when the primary efficacy time point is before 2 hours, which is often the case in assessments of parenteral drugs or trials involving paediatric subjects. Little can be learned from delaying rescue medications beyond the primary efficacy time point. Furthermore, delays may unduly discomfort subjects and prolong the attack and associated disability, which are ethically unacceptable. Rescue medication can be taken before the time of the primary endpoint if subjects require it, but such use should be recorded as a treatment failure.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: a position statement of the international headache society [^111KrwZh]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute treatment

Pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at 2 h: Pain is one of the most disabling symptoms of migraine attacks, but some patients report being even more bothered by nausea/vomiting or photophobia. For HTAs involving acute treatments, the primary endpoint should be pain freedom at 2 h after treatment or freedom or relief from the MBS at 2 h after treatment. These straightforward efficacy measures can be captured prospectively and over a long period via the use of headache diaries. Emerging observations suggest that for some patients the most bothersome symptom may include pain exacerbation with movement or cognitive effects of migraine.

Sustained pain freedom (at 24 or 48 h): Ideally, acute migraine treatment should abort migraine attacks. Because migraine attacks can last up to 72 h, and many acute treatments have a shorter half-life, it is important to record relapses of headache pain that occur after an initial (2-h) response to treatment.

Consistency of response: For patients with migraine, a reliable response across migraine attacks is an important benefit of treatment. Since many studies of acute treatments employ single-attack designs, it is important to consider the results of multiple randomized controlled trials in HTAs. Consistency can be measured at the population level or the within-person level. Population consistency is assessed by measuring the proportion of patients achieving an endpoint (2-h pain freedom, for example) for the first attack, the second attack, the third attack. Within person or intra-individual consistency is assessed by measuring the proportion of patients achieving an endpoint in a pre-specified proportion of attacks; examples include two of three, three of three, three of four or four of four attacks. Alternatively, within-individual consistency can be assessed using estimates of variability.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112opxsU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline key questions — acute episodic migraine pharmacologic treatment focuses on six key questions: comparative benefits and harms of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients with acute attacks of episodic migraine; comparative benefits and harms of second-step pharmacologic treatments for patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine attack; patients' values and preferences regarding initial pharmacologic treatments; patients' values and preferences regarding second-step pharmacologic treatments; cost-effectiveness of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients; and cost-effectiveness of second-step pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial attempt. Across these, variation by demographic characteristics (age, sex, gender, race/ethnicity) and by the presence of menstrual or menstrual (cyclical) migraine is explicitly queried for benefits/harms and for outcomes.

### Pharmacologic treatment of acute attacks of episodic migraine: a systematic review and network meta-analysis for the American College of Physicians [^114RcvPG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Migraine is common, affecting 15% of Americans.

Purpose

To compare benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments for acute attacks of episodic migraine in adults and assess cost-effectiveness.

Data Sources

Three electronic databases searched to October 2024, gray literature, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently selected English-language randomized trials.

Data Extraction

Single reviewer data extraction with second review. Dual independent risk of bias and certainty of evidence (COE) assessment.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-one head-to-head and 165 placebo-controlled trials were included in meta-analyses and network meta-analyses. Triptans were more effective than acetaminophen (low COE) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (high COE) for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours. Triptan and acetaminophen combinations were more effective than acetaminophen alone (moderate COE) for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours but not more than triptans alone (low COE). Triptan and NSAID combinations were more effective for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours compared with acetaminophen (low COE), gepants (low COE), NSAIDs (high COE), and triptan monotherapy (moderate COE). Triptan regimens, however, often had a higher risk for adverse events. One study found triptans more cost-effective than ditans and gepants.

Limitations

Harms assessment was limited to randomized trials. Many comparisons lacked sufficient evidence to draw conclusions.

Conclusion

Triptans and combinations of triptans were more effective than NSAID and acetaminophen alone.

### Sumatriptan plus naproxen for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults [^115qdxf5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in October 2013 on 'Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults'. Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. It affects two to three times more women than men, and is most common in the age range 30 to 50 years. Effective abortive treatments include the triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory classes of drugs. These drugs have different mechanisms of action and combining them may provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan plus naproxen, administered together as separate tablets or taken as a fixed-dose combination tablet, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via The Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) to 28 October 2015, MEDLINE (via Ovid) from 1946 to 28 October 2015, and EMBASE (via Ovid) from 1974 to 28 October 2015, and two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using sumatriptan plus naproxen to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

For this update we identified one new study (43 participants), but it did not contribute any data for analysis. The review included 13 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity. Twelve studies contributed data for analyses: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. We judged only one small study to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated; it did not contribute to any analyses. Overall, the combination was better than placebo for the primary outcomes of pain-free and headache relief at two hours. The NNT for pain-free at two hours was 3.1 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 3.5) when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 (4.3 to 5.7) when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (high quality evidence). Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result. Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal; they were more common with the combination than with placebo (moderate quality evidence). Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than with sumatriptan (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this review were not changed. Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone were not large. More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

### Acute migraine therapy: recent evidence from randomized comparative trials [^115HtMu1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

(1) A wide array of data regarding acute migraine treatment are available, but few trials strictly adhere to International Headache Society guidelines for patient inclusion criteria.(2) Triptans appear to have similar efficacy profiles, but among newer triptans, almotriptan offers improved tolerability over sumatriptan.(3) Combination indomethacin/caffeine/prochlorperazine most likely has similar therapeutic efficacy to triptan therapy, with further research needed to complete understanding of any potential differences between these treatments.(4) Multi-targeted combination therapy with a triptan plus a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as sumatriptan/naproxen sodium, is more effective in acute migraine treatment than monotherapy with either agent alone.(5) It is unclear whether triptans offer clinically relevant benefits over aspirin or NSAIDs in migraine patients. Thus NSAIDs, particularly effervescent aspirin, should be considered the first-line treatment of migraine attacks.

Main Results

We included 12 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. No studies were considered to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated. Overall, the combination was better than placebo for pain-free and headache relief responses. At two hours, the NNT for pain-free response was 3.1 when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (RR 3.65 (95% CI 3.0 to 4.5); high quality evidence). Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result.

Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone are not large. More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

2.2.1. Design

Early intervention trials were once characterized by wide variations in methodology and design and important differences in the definition of an early intervention. As the time of treatment (how soon after onset treatment is taken) and headache intensity (treatment is taken when pain is mild) are not necessarily interchangeable, early intervention should be defined as the administration of treatment when pain intensity is mild and within 1 hour of headache onset. By this definition, individuals with headaches predominantly occurring at night or on waking in the morning, as well as those who experience more than one headache type and who are not able to differentiate migraine from other headaches, should be excluded from early intervention trials.

The specifics of an early intervention design depend on the purpose of the trial. If its objective is to show that a drug is more effective than placebo when treating early in the mild phase, then a traditional parallel-group comparison or crossover design can be used (refer to Section 1.2.3 for more information about design types). However, if its objective is to show that early treatment (when pain is mild) is more effective than late treatment (when pain is moderate/severe), the theoretically ideal design would be a multiple crossover trial in which the same subject treats four attacks (early intervention with placebo, early intervention with active, late intervention with placebo, and late intervention with active) in randomized order. Because a trial using this design would be complex, an acceptable option would be a design used by Goadsby et al. in which subjects in four parallel arms (early intervention with placebo, early intervention with active, late intervention with placebo, and late intervention with active) treat a single attack. Another suitable alternative would utilize a two-arm parallel design, with treatment arms allocated to early intervention and late intervention, and subjects treating two attacks (one with placebo and one with active) in a randomized order.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^111kk3cK]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

To properly calculate a sample size, investigators need to take the following four steps, at a minimum: estimate placebo response rates for the primary outcome measure, based on well-founded assumptions and meta-analyses; define a clinically relevant difference between active and placebo response rates for the primary outcome measure; establish the a priori statistical errors (α- and ß); and determine an acceptable trial power (1-ß). In addition, the appropriateness of an adjustment for multiple comparisons must be considered in trials with more than one primary endpoint. Investigators do not have to limit these adjustments to Bonferroni corrections, as there are various other alternatives available, notably the hierarchical or gatekeeper approach. Adjustment for multiple comparisons may not be necessary for secondary and tertiary endpoints. The required sample size may be much larger if the goal of the trial is to establish non-inferiority or equivalence. Investigators need to pre-specify acceptable limits for such considerations.

Standard statistical methods can also be used for analysis of assessment measures in crossover and parallel-group trials. In addition to formal hypothesis testing and reporting of p -values, CIs for differences between an active treatment and placebo and between two active treatments are strongly recommended to inform readers more fully of the meaning of the results of the trial. A statement that two drugs are equally effective without giving CIs is unacceptable. Time to event (pain-free) analyses or time to meaningful relief analyses can be performed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves or Cox proportional hazard regression methods to compare the onset of action of two active treatments. Trials that collect data from multiple attacks within a subject or collect data at multiple time points may need to use a repeated measures or generalized estimating equations approach.

The statistical analysis plan needs to specify handling of missing data, with proper justification behind the choice of approach(es) for imputation. Investigators should refer to the guidelines of the agency or agencies funding the trial for information on how to handle missing data.

Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric migraine — treatment sequencing and route selection: Clinicians should counsel patients and families that a series of medications may need to be used to find treatments that most benefit the patient (Level B), should instruct patients and families to use the medication that best treats the characteristics of each migraine to provide the best balance of efficacy, side effects, and patient preference (Level B), and should offer an alternate triptan, if 1 triptan fails to provide pain relief, to find the most effective agent to reduce migraine symptoms (Level B). Clinicians may prescribe a nonoral route when headache peaks in severity quickly, is accompanied by nausea or vomiting, or oral formulations fail to provide pain relief (Level C), and clinicians should counsel patients and families that if their headache is successfully treated by their acute migraine medication but headache recurs within 24 hours of their initial treatment, taking a second dose of acute migraine medication can treat the recurrent headache (Level B).

### Management of the acute migraine headache [^116CWeRJ]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

As many as 30 million Americans have migraine headaches. The impact on patients and their families can be tremendous, and treatment of migraines can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for family physicians. Abortive treatment options include nonspecific and migraine-specific therapy. Nonspecific therapies include analgesics (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiates), adjunctive therapies (antiemetics and sedatives), and other nonspecific medications (intranasal lidocaine or steroids). Migraine-specific abortive therapies include ergotamine and its derivatives, and triptans. Complementary and alternative therapies can also be used to abort the headache or enhance the efficacy of another therapeutic modality. Treatment choices for acute migraine should be based on headache severity, migraine frequency, associated symptoms, and comorbidities.

### Have the IHSbeen followed? Laying the ground for the 4th edition [^116FmMFe]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Headache Society (IHS) has published four editions of Guidelines for acute clinical trials in migraine in the past 28 years. This continuous update process has been driven by the increasing amount of scientific data in the field of migraine and by the need to continuously improve the quality of trials.

Objectives

To illustrate: i) the results of the analysis on the adherence of published trials to the 3rd edition published in 2012, in order to identify the critical areas that needed to be addressed in the 4th edition and ii) the changes introduced in this latter edition for improving adherence and methodology robustness.

Methods

We searched and reviewed all controlled trials on acute treatment of migraine published in the period 2012–2018 and we assessed their adherence to the 3rd edition of the IHS Guidelines using a score system based on the most important recommendations. Afterwards, we compared the two editions of the Guidelines and assessed the changes between them.

Results

We included data from 24 controlled clinical trials. Most trials had a randomized double-blind controlled (RDB) design, while a minority (16.7%) were non-randomized double-blind trials. Less than half (44.6%) of the RDB trials used the recommended "pain-free at 2 hours" endpoint as the primary efficacy measure. Trial design and evaluation of results were the areas that diverged the most from the recommendations.

Conclusion

Adherence to IHS guidelines for clinical trials has been suboptimal so far. The new edition has been adapted and optimized to facilitate uptake and strengthen the quality of evidence.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114KzJdX]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of current literature, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology. In this Consensus Statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

1.3.4.11. Global impact (functional disability and quality of life)

Functional disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are important secondary global measures that account for the impact of headache and associated symptoms, as well as any adverse effects of treatment.

Recommendation:

1.3.4.11.1. Subjects should assess functional disability just before and up to 2 hours after the administration of acute treatment, before the use of rescue medication, using a simple verbal, numerical scale. The following question is recommended: "How well can you function right now?" Response options should be: 0 = no disability (i.e. able to function normally); 1 = mild disability (i.e. able to perform all activities of daily living but with some difficulty); 2 = moderate disability (i.e. unable to perform certain activities of daily living); 3 = severe disability (i.e. unable to perform most to all activities of daily living or requiring bed rest).

Comments:

Disability can be defined as a decrement in any of a range of domains (cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, or participation) or as the sum of difficulties, impairment, and decreased productivity in daily activities; HRQoL refers to the overall effect of illness and its therapy on the perception of the ability to live a useful and fulfilling life, including physical and mental components, general health perception, and level of performance/participation in different roles. Restoring the ability to function and improving quality of life are among the main objectives of acute migraine treatment, and the global impact of migraine can be measured by considering functional disability and quality of life. However, it is important that the instruments employed are appropriate for assessing the global effect of treatment on subjects' quality of performance in different roles and daily activities and sense of wellbeing.

Based on previous recommendations in IHS Guidelines, an NINDS-CDE recommendation as supplemental evaluation instrument, and continuing use in trials of acute treatment of migraine, the Functional Impairment Scale (FIS) and the Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) are recommended instruments for assessing functional disability. A simple numerical scale may be used to evaluate HRQoL, and of the global impact assessment tools used in clinical trials of acute treatment, only the 24-hour MSQoL and Minor Symptoms Evaluation Profile (a self-administered, 24-item instrument that uses a VAS to record perceived symptoms of migraine) are well suited for assessing the impact of acute treatment.

1.2.3. Design types

Recommendations:

1.2.3.1. Although both parallel-group and crossover designs may be used, parallel-group designs are preferred.

1.2.3.2. Limited to phase II trials, group-sequential, adaptive treatment, and dose-defining designs may be appropriate.

Comments:

The parallel-group design has the advantage of simplicity. Parallel-group trials have successfully demonstrated both superiority and similarity among treatments. Multiple-attack, parallel-group designs can be used to assess intra-individual consistency of response, although carry-over effects and intra-individual correlation must be taken into account (refer to Section 1.2.12 for information about consistency of response). With crossover trial designs, period and carry-over effects may occur, and complexities may be introduced if the tested treatment has notable side effects. Crossover designs can also be used in multiple-attack trials to estimate intra-individual consistency of response with placebo-control groups. In addition, crossover designs allow for the assessment of acute treatment preferences. Subjects who have taken more than one treatment can be asked which treatment they would prefer to take again. Reponses to this question reflect subjects' net assessment of benefits and tolerability. Given the popularity of social media, participants in crossover trials should be instructed to refrain from posting about the trial.

Non-traditional clinical trial designs include step-wise, adaptive, enriched designs and futility trials. Adaptive designs allow for the modification of aspects of a trial (e.g. dosing) while in progress without undermining its scientific validity or integrity. For phase II evaluations of optimal dosing, randomised group-sequential, adaptive treatment, dose-defining, proof-of-concept and two-stage, adaptive, dose-ranging designs are appropriate. The major advantage of these non-traditional designs is that they allow evaluation of the lowest effective dose and highest tolerated dose over a wide dose range in relatively few subjects. The chosen dose(s) can then be confirmed as optimal in phase III clinical trials.

1.2.4. Randomization

Recommendation:

Subjects enrolled in parallel-group and crossover trials should be randomized at entry to the trial, except when considering adaptive randomization.

Comments:

True randomization is crucial to avoid bias and, in large trials, to contribute to group matching. Block randomization using varying block sizes (e.g. blocks sizes of two, four, six, etc.) may be helpful in preventing participants from guessing treatment assignments.

1.3.1. Attack report form (diary)

Recommendation:

An easy-to-use electronic diary that captures predefined endpoints should be used. Investigator-initiated trials may use paper diaries.

Comments:

Headache characteristics and response to treatment are best recorded by means of electronic diaries with time-stamp capabilities. Data for the index attack and the 2-hour time point should be entered in real time. Adverse events may be collected in the diary or during follow-up visits. Serious AEs need to be reported within 24 hours. In settings where electronic diaries are not available (e.g. investigator-initiated trials), paper diaries may be used.

With diaries, the quantity and quality of collected data tend to be inversely proportional. Complicated report forms with detailed description of symptoms may be difficult for subjects to fill out during attacks. Some trials have been successful using algorithms to ensure that the treated attack is a migraine.

Familiarization with data capture on the trial diary is important. Subjects can complete the diary report for an attack whilst treating with their usual medication prior to entering the trial, and the data are reviewed at the trial site. Subjects can also be asked to complete the diary at the randomization visit by recalling events of their most recent attack. The latter procedure is preferable because it minimizes delays in trial participation.

1.3.2. Primary endpoint: Pain freedom at 2 hours

Recommendation:

1.3.2.1. The percentage of subjects who become pain free at 2 hours after treatment, before the use of any rescue medication, should be the primary measure of efficacy.

Comments:

Freedom from pain before the use of rescue medication is simple, clinically relevant, reflects patients' expectations, and is independent of the confounding effects of other therapies (e.g. rescue medication). With respect to the 2-hour time point, it may be argued that because some acute treatments have a slow time to maximum or time to effective plasma concentration, an expectation of pain freedom within 2 hours of treatment is unrealistic. This position runs counter to the principles of Good Clinical Practice, which give the highest consideration to subject wellbeing; participants in clinical trials should not be subjected to undue harm, and the use of effective rescue therapies should not be delayed beyond 2 hours. Pain freedom at times before 2 hours should be considered as an endpoint in trials of non-oral treatments (e.g. intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal).

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1129RN4g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians acute episodic migraine guideline — Recommendation 1 states that ACP recommends that clinicians add a triptan to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

### Current options for the prevention and treatment of migraine [^116oF4sE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common condition affecting approximately 18% of women and 6% of men in the United States. The goals of managing migraine are 2-fold: to prevent attacks from occurring and to effectively and rapidly end them when they do occur.

Objective

This article reviews the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine.

Methods

Information for inclusion in this review was identified through a search of MEDLINE from 1995 to the present. Search terms included migraine, acute treatment, prophylactic treatment, preventive treatment, and individual drug names.

Results

Preventive measures for migraine include lifestyle changes (eg, avoiding migraine triggers and maintaining regular sleep, eating, and work habits) and drug therapy. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants are among the more common drug classes used for migraine prophylaxis, but preventive therapy must be individualized, taking into account efficacy, potential adverse effects, co-existing medical conditions, and drug costs. Many medications are available for the acute treatment of migraine, including over-the-counter analgesics and prescription drugs. Of the latter, the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D)-receptor agonists, or triptans, are the most recently introduced class. Each of the 4 available triptans (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, and rizatriptan) is effective in ending a migraine attack, but comparative trials have shown differences between individual drugs in the time to pain relief and the percentage of patients who obtain pain relief.

Conclusions

Medications to prevent or reduce the frequency of migraine tend to be less specific and effective than medications for the acute treatment of migraine. As a class, triptans are generally well tolerated and may be considered drugs of choice for the acute treatment of moderate to severe migraine.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116qbMj1]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

2. Special issues

2.1. Migraine with aura

Many people who have migraine without aura also have attacks of migraine with aura. Both attack types have, in most cases, similar headache features and associated symptoms, and they may share the same basic pain mechanisms. So far, no treatment has been shown to be effective when administered in the aura phase, either for reducing the duration of the aura or preventing the subsequent headache; in separate assessments of acute treatment given during the aura phase, sumatriptan 6 mg SC and eletriptan 40 mg oral tablets had no effect on the aura or the headache.

The main challenge in clinical trials focused on subjects who have migraine with aura is diagnostic accuracy. The current ICHD classification recognizes the main type, migraine with typical aura (group 1.2.1), as well as variants for typical aura followed by migraine headache, typical aura followed by non-migraine headache, and aura not followed by headache. Since most acute treatment trials are carried out in mixed populations – subjects who have migraine with aura, subjects who have migraine without aura, and subjects who have attacks of both migraine types – investigators cannot determine whether both types of attacks occurring in the same subject have similar or different responses to treatment unless each attack is separately classified as migraine with aura or migraine without aura. Therefore, a detailed recording of each aura symptom and the total duration of the aura is mandatory, and these should be based on uniform requirements. To improve accuracy and ensure that response to migraine-associated aura is being evaluated, diagnostic and treatment diaries capable of recording specific aura symptoms and duration of aura should be used. With these specialized instruments, an observation of blurred vision or visual snow, which might be mistaken for aura with a standard diary, would not be enough to classify an attack as migraine with aura. Note that in trials designed to assess treatment of the aura phase, detailed instruction about the proper use of diaries is mandatory.

### Zolmitriptan for acute migraine attacks in adults [^113zEdnp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. Zolmitriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. These medicines work in a different way to analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of zolmitriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, together with three online databases (www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com, www.clinicaltrials.gov, and apps.who.int/trialsearch) for studies to 12 March 2014. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using zolmitriptan to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratios and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNT) or harmful effect (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Twenty-five studies (20,162 participants) compared zolmitriptan with placebo or an active comparator. The evidence from placebo-controlled studies was of high quality for all outcomes except 24 hour outcomes and serious adverse events where only limited data were available. The majority of included studies were at a low risk of performance, detection and attrition biases, but did not adequately describe methods of randomisation and concealment. Most of the data were for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses compared with placebo, for treatment of moderate to severe pain. For all efficacy outcomes, zolmitriptan surpassed placebo. For oral zolmitriptan 2.5 mg versus placebo, the NNTs were 5.0, 3.2, 7.7, and 4.1 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at two hours, sustained pain-free during the 24 hours postdose, and sustained headache relief during the 24 hours postdose, respectively. Results for the oral 5 mg dose were similar to the 2.5 mg dose, while zolmitriptan 10 mg was significantly more effective than 5 mg for pain-free and headache relief at two hours. For headache relief at one and two hours and sustained headache relief during the 24 hours postdose, but not pain-free at two hours, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray was significantly more effective than the 5 mg oral tablet. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with zolmitriptan than placebo, with a clear dose response relationship (1 mg to 10 mg). High quality evidence from two studies showed that oral zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 5 mg provided headache relief at two hours to the same proportion of people as oral sumatriptan 50 mg (66%, 67%, and 68% respectively), although not necessarily the same individuals. There was no significant difference in numbers experiencing adverse events. Single studies reported on other active treatment comparisons but are not described further because of the small amount of data.

Authors' Conclusions

Zolmitriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for migraine attacks for some people, but is associated with increased adverse events compared to placebo. Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 5 mg benefited the same proportion of people as sumatriptan 50 mg, although not necessarily the same individuals, for headache relief at two hours.

### Acute migraine headache: treatment strategies [^11345J3V]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent attacks. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, antiemetics, ergot alkaloids, and combination analgesics have evidence supporting their effectiveness in the treatment of migraine. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatments for mild to moderate migraines, whereas triptans are first-line treatments for moderate to severe migraines. Although triptans are effective, they may be expensive. Other medications such as dihydroergotamine and antiemetics are recommended for use as second- or third-line therapy for select patients or for those with refractory migraine. The pharmacologic properties, potential adverse effects, cost, and routes of administration vary widely, allowing therapy to be individualized based on the pattern and severity of attacks. Several treatment principles, including taking medication early in an attack and using a stratified treatment approach, can help ensure that migraine treatment is cost-effective.

### Comparison of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with migraine with potentially adequate and insufficient triptan response [^114pynKP]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Effective acute treatment can reduce pain, symptoms, and disability associated with migraine attacks. In contrast, suboptimal acute treatment can lead to increased migraine-related disability, use of inappropriate treatments, risk of medication overuse, and risk of disease progression. Suboptimal acute treatment is common, with nearly 40% reporting dissatisfaction with acute treatment. More than half (56%) report inadequate response to acute treatment, as measured by pain freedom at two hours. Significant predictors of insufficient response to acute treatment include male sex, higher body mass index, and increasing migraine frequency and severity.

Triptans are recommended as the first-line treatment option for the acute treatment of migraine by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the American Headache Society (AHS). Although they are the most commonly used first-line prescription treatment for a migraine attack, observational studies have consistently demonstrated low adherence and persistence to triptans in the real world. Among those who discontinue triptans, the most commonly cited reasons are lack of efficacy and adverse events. The latest AHS Consensus Statement recommends trial of at least two oral triptans prior to switching to another medication class for acute treatment of migraine attacks. However, more than half of new triptan users do not refill their first triptan prescription; most switch to non-triptan migraine medications instead of refilling their triptan; and approximately one in four discontinue acute treatment entirely. Among new triptan users that switch medications, the overwhelming majority do not switch to another triptan, instead receiving barbiturates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids. These findings suggest that some new triptan users are receiving suboptimal treatment benefits with triptans for the acute treatment of migraine.

### Migraine prevention [^113SyCZq]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Preventive medications reduce migraine frequency and severity, and improve migraine-specific quality of life. Recent evidence also suggests that these same medications enhance the patient's response to acute migraine therapies, and may also reduce the likelihood of developing chronic daily headache. However, many patients who should receive or be offered preventive treatment are not. Most patients can be successfully managed when patient and physician expectations are realistic and aligned, the selection of preventive medications is individualised, and the initiation and titration strategy is appropriate and carefully followed. Rational combinations of preventive medications may also be useful. This review provides an evidence and experience-based approach to the preventive treatment of migraine.

### Effect of ubrogepant vs placebo on pain and the most bothersome associated symptom in the acute treatment of migraine: the ACHIEVE II randomized clinical trial [^112DFGzd]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Ubrogepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist under investigation for acute treatment of migraine.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ubrogepant compared with placebo for acute treatment of a single migraine attack.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-attack, clinical trial (ACHIEVE II) conducted in the United States (99 primary care and research clinics; August 26, 2016-February 26, 2018). Participants were adults with migraine with or without aura experiencing 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month.

Interventions

Ubrogepant 50 mg (n = 562), ubrogepant 25 mg (n = 561), or placebo (n = 563) for a migraine attack of moderate or severe pain intensity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Co-primary efficacy outcomes were pain freedom and absence of the participant-designated most bothersome migraine-associated symptom (among photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea) at 2 hours after taking the medication.

Results

Among 1686 randomized participants, 1465 received study treatment (safety population; mean age, 41.5 years; 90% female); 1355 of 1465 (92.5%) were evaluable for efficacy. Pain freedom at 2 hours was reported by 101 of 464 participants (21.8%) in the ubrogepant 50-mg group, 90 of 435 (20.7%) in the ubrogepant 25-mg group, and 65 of 456 (14.3%) in the placebo group (absolute difference for 50 mg vs placebo, 7.5%; 95% CI, 2.6%-12.5%; p = 0.01; 25 mg vs placebo, 6.4%; 95% CI, 1.5%-11.5%; p = 0.03). Absence of the most bothersome associated symptom at 2 hours was reported by 180 of 463 participants (38.9%) in the ubrogepant 50-mg group, 148 of 434 (34.1%) in the ubrogepant 25-mg group, and 125 of 456 (27.4%) in the placebo group (absolute difference for 50 mg vs placebo, 11.5%; 95% CI, 5.4%-17.5%; p = 0.01; 25 mg vs placebo, 6.7%; 95% CI, 0.6%-12.7%; p = 0.07). The most common adverse events within 48 hours of any dose were nausea (50 mg, 10 of 488 [2.0%]; 25 mg, 12 of 478 [2.5%]; and placebo, 10 of 499 [2.0%]) and dizziness (50 mg, 7 of 488 [1.4%]; 25 mg, 10 of 478 [2.1%]; placebo, 8 of 499 [1.6%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with migraine, acute treatment with ubrogepant compared with placebo led to significantly greater rates of pain freedom at 2 hours with 50-mg and 25-mg doses, and absence of the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at 2 hours only with the 50-mg dose. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of ubrogepant against other acute treatments for migraine and to evaluate the long-term safety of ubrogepant among unselected patient populations.

2.3. Menstrual migraine

In menstruating females, the peak incidence of migraine occurs in the interval beginning 2 days before and extending through the first few days of menstruation. The Appendix of ICHD-3 provides criteria for pure menstrual migraine and menstrually-related migraine. For both disorders, attacks occur on days −2 to + 3 of menstruation in at least two out of three menstrual cycles. For pure menstrual migraine, attacks occur at no other time of the month, while in menstrually-related migraine attacks may occur at other times. Pure menstrual migraine is less common than menstrually-related migraine; in one study, only 7% of females had pure menstrual migraine while 34.5% had menstrually-related migraine.

Migraine attacks occurring in association with menstruation are generally noted to be severe, of long duration, and associated with higher relapse rates. Acute treatment trials might therefore investigate the efficacy of a new therapy by comparing its rate of relapse with those of standard treatments in subjects with menstrually-related migraine, pure menstrual migraine, or both conditions. If the effect of an acute treatment on pure menstrual migraine is to be investigated, accurate diagnosis is essential; it is recommended that subjects record migraine attacks and menstrual periods prospectively in a headache dairy for two to three cycles before entering the trial and that investigators apply the strict definition provided above to distinguish them from subjects with menstrually-related migraine. Three months of prospective diary information may be needed to be certain of the diagnosis. If the aim is to assess the effect of a treatment on menstrually-related migraine attacks, it is recommended (but not mandatory) that randomized subjects report menstruation in the headache diary, treating at least one menstrually-related attack with the test treatment. In either population, subjects need careful instruction on allowable limits for the temporal relationship between the migraine attack and the first day of menstruation. The primary efficacy measure should be the percentage of subjects who achieve freedom from pain at 2 hours after treatment (refer to Section 1.3.2), but in subjects experiencing these often long-lasting attacks with a high risk of recurrence, sustained pain-free (refer to Section 1.3.4.2.) is also an important measure.

2.4. Children and adolescents

Migraine attacks are usually short-lasting in children and adolescents, and the placebo response tends to be high. The IHS is developing a separate set of recommendations for clinical trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in children and adolescents.

### Migraine: beyond pain [^113b7bK1]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Most people who see, treat or experience migraine will be aware that its clinical manifestations exceed the symptom of head pain. However, available acute treatments so far have targeted migraine symptoms only in the context of the pain phase of an attack. The associated disability clearly involves more than just these symptoms, and the phenotype can include additional painless features, including alterations in mood, cognition and homeostasis and sensory sensitivities. Recognising these symptoms, understanding their neurobiological basis and systematically recording them prospectively in clinical therapeutic trials are likely to offer valuable pathophysiological and therapeutic insights into this complex brain disorder, ultimately helping to improve the quality of lives of sufferers. We aim to explore the multifaceted disorder that is migraine, with a particular focus on the non-painful non-aura symptoms.

### An update on migraine: current understanding and future directions [^114bQ3z8]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is the most common neurological cause of disability in the world. Notwithstanding, clinicians and researchers have seen little progress in the therapeutic options available to treat this condition in the last two decades. Recent advances in our understanding of migraine pathophysiology have allowed the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that offer the advantage of targeting mechanisms known to be active in the disorder leading to better management of patients.

The current review follows this bench to bedside approach, with an outline of relevant mechanisms in migraine biology, followed by an up-to-date summary of the most important therapies used in migraine at the present stage.

### Current practice and future directions in the prevention and acute management of migraine [^1136rLZy]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Migraine is a common and disabling brain disorder with a strong inherited component. Because patients with migraine have severe and disabling attacks usually of headache with other symptoms of sensory disturbance (eg, light and sound sensitivity), medical treatment is often required. Patients can be managed by use of acute attack therapies (eg, simple analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or specific agents with vasoconstrictor properties (ie, triptans or ergot derivatives). Future non-vasoconstrictor approaches include calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. Preventive therapy is probably indicated in about a third of patients with migraine, and a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical options exist. Medication overuse is an important concern in migraine therapeutics and needs to be identified and managed. In most patients, migraine can be improved with careful attention to the details of therapy, and in those for whom it cannot, neuromodulation approaches, such as occipital nerve stimulation, are currently being actively studied and offer much promise.

American College of Physicians — clinical considerations before initiating preventive pharmacotherapy: This guideline assessed the comparative effectiveness of medications that are beneficial to prevent episodic migraine to help clinicians select which medications to use for prevention. Before initiating any pharmacologic treatment to prevent episodic migraine, explore whether there are modifiable triggers and factors that contribute to an acute migraine headache, discuss the importance of lifestyle interventions such as staying hydrated and maintaining regular and adequate sleep and physical activity, and evaluate whether the patient is using appropriate and adequate-strength medications to treat an acute migraine headache. There are no evidence-based definitions or thresholds that can be used as a reference to guide initiation of pharmacologic treatments for episodic migraine headache prevention, and clinicians should consider pharmacologic treatment for prevention in people experiencing severe debilitating headaches despite adequate acute treatment.

Step 4: Acute treatment

Acute treatments can be classified as first-line, second-line, third-line and adjunct (Table 3), and should be used in a stepped care approach(Fig. 2). Our recommendations for each line of treatment are outlined below. The medications at each stage were selected on the basis of efficacy, tolerability, safety, cost and availability.

Table 3
Acute migraine treatment

Fig. 2
Stepped care across migraine attacks.

Preventive therapy, in addition, may be indicated at any stage. In general, initiation of preventive therapy is indicated in patients who are adversely affected on ≥ 2 days per month despite acute treatment optimized according to the stepped care approach. NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

First-line medication

Over-the-counter analgesics are used worldwide for acute migraine treatment. Those with proven efficacy include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the strongest evidence supports use of acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen and diclofenac potassium as first-line medications –. Paracetamol has less efficacyand should be used only in those who are intolerant of NSAIDs.

Second-line medication

Patients for whom over-the-counter analgesics provide inadequate headache relief should be offered a triptan. All triptans have well-documented effectiveness, but availability of and access to each vary between countries. Triptans are most effective when taken early in an attack, when the headache is still mild. However, no evidence supports the use of triptans during the aura phase of a migraine attack. If one triptan is ineffective, others might still provide relief. When all other triptans have failed or in patients who rapidly reach peak headache intensity or cannot take oral triptans because of vomiting, sumatriptan by subcutaneous injection can be useful.

Some patients can experience relapses, which are defined as a return of symptoms within 48 h after apparently successful treatment. Upon relapse, patients can repeat their triptan treatment or combine the triptan with simultaneous intake of fast-acting formulations of naproxen sodium, ibuprofen lysine or diclofenac potassium. However, patients should be informed that repeating the treatment does not preclude further relapses and ultimately increases the risk of developing MOH.

2.8. Independent data safety monitoring board

An independent data safety monitoring board and predefined stopping rules for futility or safety are recommended for phase III trials. Independent interim analysis by the data safety monitoring board should be considered for assessment of the pre-defined stopping rules.

2.9. Steering committee

For phase III trials sponsored by industry, the formation of a Steering Committee comprised of academics, statisticians, and (if appropriate) company representatives is recommended. For investigator-initiated trials (i.e. developed and sponsored by independent investigators or academia), a Steering Committee is not necessary. Whether or not a committee is formed, investigators and sponsors are responsible for all aspects of a clinical trial, including conception; design; operational execution; data handling; data analysis and interpretation; subsequent reporting and publication; and compliance with all local laws and regulations.

2.10 Trial registration

Prior to the initiation, any trial should be pre-registered in a register acknowledged by regulatory authorities, such as clinicaltrials.gov, clinicaltrialsregister.eu, or a similar regional or national official database.

2.10. Post-approval registries

The IHS recommends post-approval product registries (i.e. prospective open-label observational studies) to evaluate the use of newly approved acute treatments in clinical practice. Registries generate real-world data on long-term efficacy, tolerability, and safety. They also measure compliance and adherence. Registries for acute migraine treatments may also include individuals with relevant coexistent and comorbid diseases (e.g. chronic pain syndromes, cardiovascular disease) who were excluded from clinical trials for acute migraine.

Evidence gaps and research needs — comparative effectiveness trials are prioritized and should emphasize combination therapy comparators and inadequate responders. "There is a critical need for funding agencies, such as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute or National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to support well-designed, comparative effectiveness trials of newer medications to treat moderate to severe episodic migraine compared with the combination of a triptan and an NSAID or acetaminophen". "These trials should focus on the combination therapies as initial treatment options and in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment after a moderate to severe episodic migraine", and "The trials should aim to treat multiple migraine headaches". The systematic review "did not identify head-to-head comparative studies for lasmiditan, celecoxib, eletriptan, frovatriptan, or naratriptan", and "did not find comparative effectiveness evidence eligible for this clinical guideline to evaluate the efficacy of switching pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine headache".

### Efficacy of ubrogepant in the acute treatment of migraine with mild pain vs moderate or severe pain [^1149JMGs]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

During migraine attacks, mild pain at onset often escalates to moderate or severe pain. The escalation in pain intensity is often associated with emergence or exacerbation of migraine-associated symptoms including nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia. The temporal evolution of migraine pain and associated symptoms is variable person to person and within individuals from attack to attack.

For acute treatments, regulatory guidance for acute treatment trials requires the treatment of migraine when pain is moderate or severe. However, clinical guidance recommends treatment early in the migraine attack, when pain is mild. Despite clinical advice to treat early, many patients delay treatment to preserve limited medication supplies, avoid side effects, reduce the risk of medication overuse, or hope for spontaneous remission. Research has shown that acute treatment of migraine, especially with triptans, early in the attack or when pain is mild results in improved outcomes for the patient.

Ubrogepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist approved for the acute treatment of migraine, with efficacy demonstrated in 2 phase 3 trials. Multiple studies demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of migraine with moderate or severe pain. The efficacy of ubrogepant when patients treat during mild pain has not yet been studied. The primary hypothesis was that the treatment of migraine with ubrogepant when pain is mild would increase the likelihood of achieving positive outcomes, including pain freedom, relative to the treatment of moderate or severe pain, in adults with migraine. This post hoc analysis examines the efficacy of ubrogepant in treating migraine attacks with mild pain vs moderate or severe pain in a 1-year, long-term treatment trial (, NCT02873221).

### Migraine: preventive treatment [^1114kAYC]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease. Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Migraine headache… [^113MXe7z]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Migraine is a recurrent headache disorder with intense pain that may be unilateral and accompanied by nausea or vomiting as well as photosensitivity and phonosensitivity. The lifetime prevalence is 25% in women and 8% in men. Migraine also affects about 5% to 10% of children and adolescents. Some people who have migraine headaches experience an aura in the minutes before the onset of pain. The aura may consist of seeing flashing lights, having numbness or tingling in the face or extremities, having a disturbed sense of smell, or having difficulty speaking. However, only about one-third of individuals who have migraine headaches experience auras. Migraines are painful but fortunately are not life-threatening. The June 24, 2009, issue of JAMA includes an article about migraine headache.

Causes The exact cause of migraine headaches is unknown. Current research suggests that inflammation in the blood vessels of the brain causes them to swell and press on nearby nerves, causing pain. This inflammation may arise in or be stimulated by signals from the trigeminal nerve. Many individuals with migraine headaches can identify triggers that cause or aggravate the headache. Because there is no cure, avoiding triggers may help to reduce the frequency or severity of migraine headaches. Some triggers include. Treatment There are 2 medication strategies used to treat migraine headaches. Treating the pain at the onset offers the best relief. Over-the-counter analgesics such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen Prescription drugs called triptans are used for headaches not relieved by over-the-counter medications.

These are generally not used for people who have high blood pressure or heart disease. For those whose headaches are not adequately relieved with these medications, the second medication strategy involves medications prescribed prophylactically. These medications are normally prescribed to treat other disorders but have been successful at reducing the frequency or severity of migraine headaches. Blood pressure medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers Antidepressant medications such as amitriptyline or venlafaxine.

### Migraine headaches: how to deal with the pain… [^113MFRP5]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

What causes migraine headaches. Migraine headaches seem to be caused by changes in the amount of a chemical called serotonin you have in your body. When serotonin levels are high, your blood vessels shrink. When serotonin levels are low, your blood vessels swell. This swelling can cause pain and other problems. Many things can affect the level of serotonin in your body, including certain foods and your level of blood sugar. In women, changes in the amount of a hormone called estrogen can affect serotonin levels. What does a migraine feel like. Migraines can cause very bad pain that can get in the way of your normal routine. Migraines aren't the same for everyone.

Some symptoms include: Throbbing or dull pain on one or both sides of your head Stomachache or throwing up Changes in how you see, such as blurry vision or blind spots Being bothered by light, noise, or smells Feeling tired or confused Stuffy nose Feeling cold or sweaty Stiff neck Feeling dizzy. Are there different kinds of migraines. Yes. The most common are classic migraines and common migraines. Classic migraines start with a warning sign called an aura. An aura can change the way you see things. You may see flashing lights and colors, or you might not be able to see things to your side. Auras last about 15 to 30 minutes. Pain usually comes after the aura, but sometimes the pain and aura happen at the same time, or the pain never happens. The pain of classic migraines might be on one side of your head or on both sides. You may also have a strange prickly or burning feeling, or feel weak on one side of your body. You may have trouble talking.

You may also feel depressed, grouchy, and restless. Common migraines don't start with an aura. Common migraines may start more slowly than classic migraines and last longer. The pain of common migraines may be on only one side of your head. What things may set off a migraine. Certain things can set off migraines in some people. These include: Strong smells, bright lights, or loud noises Changes in weather Being tired, stressed, or depressed Changes in the time you go to sleep or wake up Missing meals or fasting Menstrual periods, birth control pills, or hormones.
