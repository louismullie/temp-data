## Question

Catscan to order for gi bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which CT scan to order for gastrointestinal bleeding and how to structure the request and protocol based on clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hemodynamic stability and suspected bleeding location. Then, I should verify the optimal CT protocol for unstable versus stable patients. Next, I will review guideline-backed indications and when to avoid CT. After that, I need to check the technical parameters and whether to include a non-contrast phase. Finally, I will consider alternatives if CT is contraindicated and synthesize a concise, actionable recommendation with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: in suspected GI bleeding, I need to distinguish hemodynamically unstable from stable patients and consider whether the source is likely upper (UGIB), lower (LGIB), or obscure/small bowel, because this drives the choice of CT protocol and timing of imaging relative to resuscitation and endoscopy [^113cnfDP] [^112y9oyo] [^117Rsdhs].

> For hemodynamically unstable patients or those with ongoing, hemodynamically significant hematochezia, I should order a CT angiography (CTA) as first-line imaging to localize active bleeding and guide urgent therapy. Hold on, I should verify the protocol — most centers use a triphasic study (non-contrast, arterial, and portal venous/delayed phases) to maximize detection of contrast extravasation and improve specificity, and I should explicitly request "CT angiography for GI bleeding" with multiphasic imaging from diaphragm to anus to cover the entire GI tract [^113cnfDP] [^112y9oyo] [^113jynn6] [^113jynn6].

> Wait, let me verify the non-contrast phase question because it adds radiation. Recent data suggest the non-contrast series rarely changes management and contributes substantially to dose, so in many cases a biphasic arterial and portal venous study may suffice, but I should acknowledge that some centers still prefer triphasic for problem-solving and to avoid false positives. I will note this nuance and tailor to local protocol while prioritizing dose-sparing when feasible [^115XquYz] [^113XZ9Ak].

> For hemodynamically stable patients with suspected active bleeding, I should still consider CTA when endoscopy is not immediately available or when localization will change management. Let me reconsider the protocol — single portal venous phase CT is often used in practice, but multiphasic CTA increases the likelihood of identifying the bleeding source compared with single-phase, so I should request multiphasic CTA when active bleeding is suspected and the patient can tolerate contrast [^113faUop] [^117Rsdhs].

> I need to ensure I do not over-order CT in low-yield scenarios. CTA has low yield in minor LGIB or when bleeding has clinically subsided, so in stable patients with minimal bleeding I should favor colonoscopy after appropriate preparation rather than immediate CTA, reserving CT for ongoing or high-risk presentations [^111ZRext] [^113cnfDP].

> For obscure or suspected small-bowel bleeding after negative upper and lower endoscopy, I should confirm whether CT enterography (CTE) is the right cross-sectional study. Yes, CTE is preferred to evaluate for small-bowel masses, vascular lesions, or inflammatory disease, and I should request multiphasic CTE with neutral oral contrast and IV contrast to optimize mural and luminal assessment, considering MR enterography if radiation avoidance is a priority [^112ove2g] [^112AbL8w] [^116MCX4T].

> If endoscopy is contraindicated or unavailable, I should double-check that CTA remains appropriate. Indeed, guidelines support CTA as an alternative diagnostic pathway in UGIB when endoscopy cannot be performed, and in LGIB when colonoscopy is not feasible, with the same emphasis on multiphasic coverage and rapid acquisition [^111rRRFF] [^113cnfDP].

> I should confirm technical details when ordering: specify "CT angiography for GI bleeding", request coverage from diaphragm to below the pubic symphysis to include anorectum, and indicate multiphasic contrast (arterial and portal venous phases; add non-contrast selectively if local protocol requires), with a high-rate IV contrast injection (typically 4–5 mL/s) and appropriate bolus timing. If dual-energy CT is available, it can reduce dose and enhance iodine detection, which I can mention as an adjunct [^113jynn6] [^114kusTd].

> But wait, what if contrast is contraindicated or renal function is a concern? In that case, I should avoid iodinated contrast and consider nuclear medicine tagged RBC scintigraphy for intermittent bleeding detection, recognizing its superior sensitivity for slow bleeding but inferior localization. If scintigraphy is positive, angiography should follow promptly to enable therapy [^114MHyef] [^117YCjTe].

> Next, I should review downstream steps after a positive CTA. If extravasation is identified, I need to ensure urgent interventional radiology consultation for catheter angiography and possible embolization, ideally within 60 minutes in unstable patients at centers with 24/7 IR, and coordinate with gastroenterology for potential endoscopic therapy depending on the source and local expertise [^113d2uyp] [^111Wvs1q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about yield. I should acknowledge contemporary data showing rising CTA utilization with falling test-positive rates, underscoring the need for judicious ordering tied to clinical probability of active bleeding and hemodynamic status, and I should communicate the indication clearly on the order to trigger the appropriate multiphasic protocol and improve diagnostic yield [^113VeJK5] [^113faUop].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is: for suspected active GI bleeding, order "CT angiography for GI bleeding" with multiphasic contrast (arterial and portal venous phases; add non-contrast per local protocol) from diaphragm to anus in hemodynamically unstable patients or those with ongoing significant hematochezia, and consider multiphasic CTA in stable patients when active bleeding is suspected and endoscopy is delayed or will be guided by imaging. For obscure/suspected small-bowel bleeding after negative upper and lower endoscopy, order multiphasic CT enterography. Avoid routine CTA in minor or resolved bleeding where colonoscopy is preferred, and use scintigraphy when CT contrast is contraindicated or bleeding is likely intermittent [^113cnfDP] [^112y9oyo] [^113XZ9Ak] [^112ove2g] [^114MHyef].

For suspected GI bleeding, order a **multiphasic CT angiography (CTA)** of the abdomen and pelvis with arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases [^113XZ9Ak] to detect active extravasation and localize the bleeding source [^112wbY5C]. CTA is the **first-line test** for hemodynamically unstable patients or those with ongoing significant bleeding [^112y9oyo] [^113cnfDP], with high sensitivity (85–90%) and specificity (92–95%) [^114EUTMr] [^114uCCTu]. For stable patients with suspected small-bowel bleeding or negative endoscopy, use **CT enterography** [^112AbL8w] to evaluate mucosal and mural disease [^112ove2g]. Avoid CTA in minor or resolved bleeding [^111ZRext]; if contrast is contraindicated, consider nuclear medicine bleeding scans [^112P2coL] or MRI [^112ove2g].

## Indications for CT in GI bleeding

CT is indicated in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Hemodynamically unstable patients**: CTA is recommended as the initial diagnostic test in patients with ongoing hemodynamically significant bleeding [^112y9oyo] [^113cnfDP].

- **Suspected active bleeding**: CTA is indicated when active bleeding is suspected, particularly in the lower GI tract [^113cnfDP] [^112wbY5C].

- **Obscure GI bleeding**: CT enterography is recommended for stable patients with obscure GI bleeding, especially when endoscopy fails to identify the source [^112wbY5C] [^116MCX4T].

- **Contraindications to endoscopy**: CT is indicated when endoscopy is contraindicated or unavailable [^112zbrrD] [^111rRRFF].

## Recommended CT protocols

### CT angiography (CTA)

CTA is the **primary CT modality** for acute GI bleeding and requires a **multiphasic contrast protocol** to maximize detection of active bleeding [^114kusTd]:

| **Phase** | **Purpose** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-contrast | Baseline; detect calcifications, hematoma | Before contrast |
| Arterial | Detect active extravasation | 20–30 s after injection |
| Portal venous | Detect ongoing bleeding, venous sources | 60–70 s after injection |
| Delayed | Confirm persistent bleeding, slow leaks | 90–120 s after injection |

---

Contrast administration should use **high-concentration iodinated contrast** (e.g. 370 mg/mL) at 4–5 mL/s with a 100–120 mL bolus, followed by a saline flush. Coverage extends from the **diaphragm to the symphysis pubis** to ensure complete evaluation of the GI tract [^113jynn6].

---

### CT enterography

CT enterography is indicated for stable patients with suspected small-bowel bleeding or when endoscopy is negative. It uses **neutral oral contrast** (e.g. polyethylene glycol) to distend the bowel and a **multiphasic IV contrast protocol** (arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases) to evaluate mucosal and mural disease [^112wbY5C].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of CT

CTA demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy for detecting active GI bleeding, with pooled sensitivity and specificity of approximately 85–90% and 92–95%, respectively [^114EUTMr] [^111ZRext]. However, accuracy depends on the **rate of active bleeding** and the timing of imaging relative to bleeding episodes [^114uCCTu] [^113faUop].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

CT has several limitations and contraindications:

- **Contrast nephropathy**: Risk in patients with renal impairment [^111y6qrQ].

- **Radiation exposure**: Particularly concerning in younger patients and pregnant women [^notfound].

- **Low yield in minor bleeding**: CTA is less effective in patients with minor or resolved bleeding [^111ZRext].

- **Allergic reactions**: Risk of contrast allergy [^notfound].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

When CT is contraindicated or inconclusive, **alternative imaging modalities** include:

- **Nuclear medicine bleeding scans**: Useful for detecting intermittent or slow bleeding [^114MHyef].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Useful in patients with contraindications to CT or to avoid radiation exposure [^112ove2g].

- **Conventional angiography**: Gold standard for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients [^1136V8tX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the role of CT in acute GI bleeding:

- **ACG 2023 guidelines**: Recommend CTA as the initial diagnostic test in patients with ongoing hemodynamically significant hematochezia [^113cnfDP] [^111uUTA1].

- **BSG 2019 guidelines**: Recommend CTA to localize bleeding before endoscopic or radiological therapy in hemodynamically unstable patients [^112y9oyo].

- **ACG/SAR 2024 consensus**: Endorses CTA as first-line imaging for hemodynamically unstable patients and select stable patients with suspected active bleeding [^1177z94A].

---

CT angiography is the **preferred CT study** for acute GI bleeding, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients or those with ongoing significant bleeding [^112wbY5C]. CT enterography is indicated for stable patients with suspected small-bowel bleeding or when endoscopy is negative [^112wbY5C]. Alternative imaging modalities should be considered when CT is contraindicated or inconclusive [^112ove2g].

### Gastroenterologic and radiologic approach to obscure gastrointestinal bleeding: how, why, and when? [^1116HzdK]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common clinical condition that is increasingly seen in an aging population and frequently requires hospitalization and intervention, with significant morbidity and mortality. Obscure GI bleeding (OGIB) is defined as loss of blood with no source identified after upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Whether an obscure site of bleeding is clinically evident or silent, it constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Gastroenterology and radiology provide the essential diagnostic tools used to evaluate suspected OGIB, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Small bowel series and conventional enteroclysis have a limited role in OGIB. Computed tomographic (CT) enterography and CT enteroclysis are noninvasive techniques with promising results in evaluation of small bowel disease and silent OGIB. CT angiography is a useful triaging tool for diagnosing or excluding active GI hemorrhage, localizing the site of bleeding, and guiding subsequent treatment. Tagged red blood cell scanning is the most sensitive technique for detection of active GI bleeding and allows imaging over a prolonged period, making it useful for detecting intermittent bleeding. Capsule endoscopy has emerged as an important tool for investigating OGIB, but it may soon have competition from double-balloon enteroscopy, a diagnostic technique that can also facilitate therapy.

### Dual-energy CT evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding [^114kusTd]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a potentially life-threatening condition accounting for more than 300000 annual hospitalizations. Multidetector abdominopelvic CT angiography is commonly used in the evaluation of patients with GI bleeding. Given that many patients with severe overt GI bleeding are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation, and inpatient colonoscopy is frequently limited by suboptimal preparation obscuring mucosal visibility, CT angiography is recommended as a first-line diagnostic test in patients with severe hematochezia to localize a source of bleeding. Assessment of these patients with conventional single-energy CT systems typically requires the performance of a noncontrast series followed by imaging during multiple postcontrast phases. Dual-energy CT (DECT) offers several potential advantages for performing these examinations. DECT may eliminate the need for a noncontrast acquisition by allowing the creation of virtual noncontrast (VNC) images from contrast-enhanced data, affording significant radiation dose reduction while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. VNC images can help radiologists to differentiate active bleeding, hyperattenuating enteric contents, hematomas, and enhancing masses. Additional postprocessing techniques such as low-kiloelectron voltage virtual monoenergetic images, iodine maps, and iodine overlay images can increase the conspicuity of contrast material extravasation and improve the visibility of subtle causes of GI bleeding, thereby increasing diagnostic confidence and assisting with problem solving. GI bleeding can also be diagnosed with routine single-phase DECT scans by constructing VNC images and iodine maps. Radiologists should also be aware of the potential pitfalls and limitations of DECT. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available through the Online Learning Center.

Gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy SPECT/CT acquisition and CT settings are specified: If applied, a typical SPECT acquisition uses a 128 x 128 matrix over a 360 arc, optimally obtaining 120 (minimum of 60) projections at 20–30 s per projection (every 3–6 degrees); an equivalent total number of counts should be acquired if continuous acquisition is used; three-dimensional iterative ordered-subsets expectation maximization is the usual reconstruction algorithm; and typical CT parameters include a tube current ranging from 100–200 mAs, voltage of 120 kVp (ranging from 100–140 kVp), pitch 1.0, rotation time 0.6 s, and a slice thickness of 2.5–5 mm.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^111y6qrQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

CTA-guided triage and limitations in suspected gastrointestinal bleeding include management pathways and safety considerations. CTA can also be used to help triage patients for further management, with one study reporting 64/86 CTA programs were negative and 92% of these patients required no further intervention, and there were no cases with a negative CTA that had a subsequent positive conventional angiogram within 24 h. Therefore, some have recommended watchful waiting in cases with a negative CTA as the bleeding rate may be too low for intervention and conventional angiography rarely shows an additional site of bleeding. Factors predictive for a positive conventional angiogram following a positive CTA include non-diverticular etiologies and lower hemoglobin levels and it should be performed soon after CTA to enhance detection. CTA has some limitations however, including that to detect contrast extravasation the patient must be actively bleeding at the time of the exam, and in elderly patients with decreased renal function intravenous contrast administration for CT may increase the risk of renal complications if subsequent conventional angiography is required.

Methods

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at a 1011-bed quaternary care urban academic medical center with a 66-bed ED evaluating approximately 110 000 patient visits annually. All adult patients (aged 18 years or older) who underwent CTA of the abdomen and/or pelvis for suspected acute GIB between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2023, were eligible. Examinations performed for indications unrelated to GIB were excluded.

Eligible patients were identified by electronic query of the institutional radiology information system using examination codes for abdominal and pelvic CTA, further filtered by clinician-documented reason for examination containing terms such as gastrointestinal bleed or equivalent. Details of this selection process are summarized in Figure 1.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^112ove2g]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis using radiographic techniques — recommendations state: "Barium studies should not be performed in the evaluation of small bowel bleeding (strong recommendation, high level of evidence)". For negative capsule endoscopy, "CTE should be performed in patients with suspected small bowel bleeding and negative capsule endoscopy because of higher sensitivity for the detection of mural-based small bowel masses, superior capability to locate small bowel masses, and ability to guide subsequent deep enteroscopy. (strong recommendation, low level of evidence)". Additionally, "CT is preferred over MR imaging for the evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding. MR can be considered in patients with contraindications for CT or to avoid radiation exposure in younger patients (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence)". "CTE could be considered before VCE in the setting of established inflammatory bowel disease, prior radiation therapy, previous small bowel surgery, and/or suspected small bowel stenosis (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence)". Finally, "In patients with suspected small bowel bleeding and negative VCE examination, CTE should be performed if there is high clinical suspicion for a small bowel source despite the performance of a prior standard CT of the abdomen (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence)".

### Preliminary estimate of triphasic CT enterography performance in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding [^111ARNJh]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the performance of triphasic CT enterography and identify causes of false-negative CT results in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of 48 patients (male-female ratio, 22:26) with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding (first-episode gastrointestinal bleed, n = 19; obscure gastrointestinal bleed, n = 29) who underwent triphasic CT enterography was performed. All patients had endoscopic, pathologic, or other imaging confirmation within 3 months of triphasic CT enterography. The sensitivity and specificity of triphasic CT enterography were calculated using pathology, endoscopy, or other imaging confirmation as the reference standard. Results were retrospectively reviewed to determine the cause of missed findings at triphasic CT enterography.

Results

The overall sensitivity and specificity of triphasic CT enterography for detecting gastrointestinal bleeding was 33% (7/21) and 89% (24/27), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were higher in first-episode gastrointestinal bleed cases (42% and 100%, respectively) than in obscure gastrointestinal bleed cases (22% and 85%). In the subset of patients undergoing capsule endoscopy (n = 17), only triphasic CT enterography identified two of three bleeding sources. Triphasic CT enterography did not identify six ulcers, four vascular malformations, two hemorrhoids, a duodenal mass, and a bleeding colonic diverticulum. The missed findings at triphasic CT enterography were attributed to being CT occult (n = 9), perception errors (n = 4), and technical errors (n = 1). If perception errors are excluded, the sensitivity of triphasic CT enterography increases to 52% (11/21).

Conclusion

Triphasic CT enterography can be a useful and complementary test in the evaluation of clinically stable patients with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding by identifying the bleeding source in one third to one half of patients. Because of the potential for perception errors, radiologists should familiarize themselves with the appearance of bleeding sources at CT enterography.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding-computed tomographic angiography, colonoscopy or both? [^115w7xVk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common clinical problem, representing 20 to 30% of patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. LGIB incidence is increasing over time, as it is associated with older age and pre-existing comorbidities. Very distal bleeding, e.g. due to hemorrhoids and low rectal cancer, is rather easy to diagnose, but bleeding from the colon and small bowel remains a diagnostic challenge. According to recent guidelines, hemodynamic stabilization and resuscitation must be performed prior to search any bleeding source. While nasogastric lavage and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy can be considered to rule out upper gastrointestinal bleeding for patients presenting severe hematochezia, lower endoscopy (LE) is the preferred diagnostic approach for LGIB. Nevertheless, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for evaluation of GI bleeding is increasingly used and may challenges lower endoscopy as most appropriate tool. This non-invasive diagnostic modality is readily available in most hospitals and can be rapidly performed without any bowel preparation. Reported sensitivity and specificity rates are 86 and 95%, respectively and bleeding as low as 0.4ml/min can be detected.

So far, there is only limited evidence on the routine use of CTA in the initial management of LGIB. Its accuracy compared to LE remains unclear; and subsequently, its use as a first-line diagnostic modality is not considered in current management algorithms.

This current study aimed to compare the accuracy of CTA and colonoscopy in the diagnosis of LGIB and their influence on bleeding control.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^115qHrDb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding — non-colonoscopy interventions: A surgical consultation should be requested in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding, and surgery for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered after other therapeutic options have failed with careful localization of the source whenever possible (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Radiographic interventions should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding who have a negative upper endoscopy and do not respond adequately to hemodynamic resuscitation and are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and urgent colonoscopy (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a diagnostic test is desired for localization of the bleeding site before angiography, computed tomographic angiography should be considered (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### The SNMMI procedure standard / ACNM practice guideline for gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy 3.0 [^115xDoD2]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy — SPECT/CT hybrid imaging can better pinpoint sites of bleeding when planar images are not well localized or equivocal, and has reported performance and practical considerations as follows: in one study SPECT/CT was required in 37% of patients to precisely localize or exclude gastrointestinal bleeding; authors used a 30-min SPECT acquisition but approximately 15 min may be adequate; another group reported correct localization in 44% patients with incorrect planar localization; accuracy to determine the bleeding site was 92.3–93% with SPECT/CT versus 73.8–83% with planar scans; when combined with planar scans, SPECT/CT had the highest ability to correctly localize the GI bleeding site; SPECT/CT can be particularly helpful in slow gastrointestinal bleeding, can estimate the length of tract leading to the bleeding site to help choose endoscopy, helps clarify pitfalls, can be especially useful with prior surgery and altered anatomy, and can reveal unsuspected bleeding outside the GI tract; however, more studies are needed, no data exists on use when planar GIBS is negative, there has been no direct comparison to CTA, and no data exists for oral/IV contrast use for the low-dose CT component.

### Outcome following a negative CT angiogram for gastrointestinal hemorrhage [^114nJfs1]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to evaluate the role of a negative computed tomography angiogram (CTA) in patients who present with gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage.

Methods

A review of all patients who had CTAs for GI hemorrhage over an 8-year period from January 2005 to December 2012 was performed. Data for patient demographics, location of hemorrhage, hemodynamic stability, and details of angiograms and/or the embolization procedure were obtained from the CRIS/PACS database, interventional radiology database, secure electronic medical records, and patient's clinical notes.

Results

A total of 180 patients had 202 CTAs during the 8-year period: 87 CTAs were performed for upper GI hemorrhage (18 positive for active bleeding, 69 negative) and 115 for lower GI hemorrhage (37 positive for active bleeding, 78 negative); 58.7% (37/63) of patients with upper GI bleed and 77.4% (48/62) of patients with lower GI bleed who had an initial negative CTA did not rebleed without the need for radiological or surgical intervention. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04). The relative risk of rebleeding, following a negative CTA, in lower GI bleeding versus upper GI bleeding patients is 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.32–0.95).

Conclusions

Patients with upper GI bleed who had negative CTAs usually require further intervention to stop the bleeding. In contrast, most patients presenting with lower GI hemorrhage who had a negative first CTA were less likely to rebleed.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding-computed tomographic angiography, colonoscopy or both? [^115pqVjJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations besides its retrospective design and a limited number of patients. Within the study period, there was a change in care providers and hence in practice. Furthermore, the choice of the first diagnostic exam was decided by the treating physician. Significant lower MAP and trends to lower Hb level and higher SI indicate a selection bias as the severely affected patients were more likely to undergo CTA first. Longer LOS in the CTA group also probably reflects the greater severity of the bleeding. Patients' co-morbidites, medication, medical or surgical history also probably led to a selection bias in the choice of the first exam. The retrospective nature of the study precluded us to ensure a valid comparison. We could not account for the delay in performing LE during the night, as the gastroenterology consultant's availability was lower outside office hours.

### Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage: what you need to know [^112rKvE9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common cause for hospital admission that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management to optimize clinical outcomes. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) includes both upper and lower GI tract sources with an extensive list of differential pathologies. This review provides a systematic approach to both upper and lower GIB management, emphasizing initial resuscitation, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation to identify the source, and treatment modalities. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnostic and interventional purposes, significantly reducing the need for surgical procedures. However, lower GIB and severe or refractory cases may necessitate additional imaging and interventions, including surgical management. Integrating clinical guidelines, evidence-based strategies, and individualized care, this review delineates what you need to know to diagnose and manage acute GI hemorrhage.

### Prospective study comparing multi-detector row CT and endoscopy in acute gastrointestinal bleeding [^114soN3r]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Upper and lower acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The latest computerized tomography (CT) imaging techniques play an important role in the treatment of this pathology.

Methods

Twenty-nine patients with severe AGIB (11 upper, 18 lower), all hemodynamically stable, underwent endoscopy followed by a multi-detector row CT (MDCT) scan. Endoscopic and MDCT accuracy for the anatomical localization and etiology of AGIB was assessed, the diagnosis being considered correct when the two procedures were concordant or when the diagnosis was confirmed by angiographic, surgical, or post-mortem findings.

Results

The sensitivity in identifying the site and etiology of bleeding was, respectively, 100% and 90.9% for the MDCT scan, compared with 72.7% and 54.5% for endoscopy in upper AGIB, and 100% and 88.2% for the MDCT scan, compared with 52.9% and 52.9% for endoscopy, in lower AGIB.

Conclusions

Considering the advantages of MDCT over endoscopy, we propose a new diagnostic algorithm for AGIB.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding at CT angiography and CT enterography: imaging atlas and glossary of terms [^114g26vg]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common potentially life-threatening medical condition frequently requiring multidisciplinary collaboration to reach the proper diagnosis and guide management. GI bleeding can be overt (eg, visible hemorrhage such as hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena) or occult (eg, positive fecal occult blood test or iron deficiency anemia). Upper GI bleeding, which originates proximal to the ligament of Treitz, is more common than lower GI bleeding, which arises distal to the ligament of Treitz. Small bowel bleeding accounts for 5–10% of GI bleeding cases commonly manifesting as obscure GI bleeding, where the source remains unknown after complete GI tract endoscopic and imaging evaluation. CT can aid in identifying the location and cause of bleeding and is an important complementary tool to endoscopy, nuclear medicine, and angiography in evaluating patients with GI bleeding. For radiologists, interpreting CT scans in patients with GI bleeding can be challenging owing to the large number of images and the diverse potential causes of bleeding. The purpose of this pictorial review by the Society of Abdominal Radiology GI Bleeding Disease-Focused Panel is to provide a practical resource for radiologists interpreting GI bleeding CT studies that reviews the proper GI bleeding terminology, the most common causes of GI bleeding, key patient history and risk factors, the optimal CT imaging technique, and guidelines for case interpretation and illustrates many common causes of GI bleeding. A CT reporting template is included to help generate radiology reports that can add value to patient care. An invited commentary by Al Hawary is available online.

### The SNMMI procedure standard / ACNM practice guideline for gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy 3.0 [^117YCjTe]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy — imaging duration and workflow emphasize continuous monitoring for intermittent bleeding; acquiring dynamic images in 10- to 20-min sequences may facilitate review but results in fragmented clips, so adding all images into one continuous sequence at scan conclusion is beneficial for interpretation. Since gastrointestinal bleeding occurs intermittently, the patient should be imaged continuously for as long as is practical to identify the bleeding source, and initial imaging for a minimum of 60 min is recommended if no gastrointestinal bleeding is detected; if abnormal focal RBC activity is detected, acquisition should continue for a sufficient time to confidently identify the bleeding site. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography/ Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) may also be helpful in this context.

### Localization and etiological stratification of non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding via CT imaging: a 10-year study [^112bRyKC]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Several studies have highlighted the important role of CT in diagnosing small bowel bleeding and guiding further treatment options. Although the detection rate of CT for small bowel bleeding is approximately 40% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33–49%), research has shown that CT can detect lesions missed by endoscopy, such as vascular diseases and inflammatory disorders. The potential of enhanced CT to detect active bleeding has been highlighted in several small-sample studies, making it the first-line diagnostic modality for many institutions in diagnosing gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the lack of systematic grouping has hindered clinicians' clear understanding of its significance. Endoscopy has been considered the primary diagnostic tool in guidelines, with enhanced CT not yet a highly recommended method. Therefore, it is essential to conduct comprehensive and robust analyses and comparisons of relevant cases to provide the necessary evidence for refining clinical diagnostic guidelines.

This retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced CT in diagnosing small bowel bleeding, analyzing all non-neoplastic cases at our institution since 2013, including detailed clinical data and CT images.

### Acute gastrointestinal bleeding: emerging role of multidetector CT angiography and review of current imaging techniques [^112FRCy6]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in the United States. The evaluation and treatment of acute gastrointestinal bleeding are complex and often require a multispecialty approach involving gastroenterologists, surgeons, internists, emergency physicians, and radiologists. The multitude of pathologic processes that can result in gastrointestinal bleeding, the length of the gastrointestinal tract, and the often intermittent nature of gastrointestinal bleeding further complicate patient evaluation. In addition, there are multiple imaging modalities and therapeutic interventions that are currently being used in the evaluation and treatment of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Initial experience indicates that multidetector computed tomographic angiography is a promising first-line modality for the time-efficient, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis or exclusion of active gastrointestinal hemorrhage and may have a profound impact on the evaluation and subsequent treatment of patients who present with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

CT Scanning

A CT scan to diagnose the site of GI bleeding was performed in 14.5% (90/618). A further 20 should have undergone a CT. The CT identified the site of bleeding in 32% (29/90). This real world figure is considerably lower than the reported meta-analysis pooled literature sensitivity of 89%. Whilst comprehensive data on the timing of CT were not readily available to the reviewers, their free text comments suggested that the much lower diagnostic rate was related to referrals for CT after the patient had been resuscitated and had clinically stopped bleeding or delays in performing the CT, including because of difficulties obtaining anaesthetic support.

Interventional Radiology

7.8% (36/459) underwent an IR procedure, the reasons for which are shown in Table 7.

Table 7
Reasons for interventional radiology procedures (answers may be multiple)

11 were haemodynamically stable at the time of the IR procedure. In 89% (32/36), the IR procedure was within an appropriate time for the patient's condition. There were six re-bleeds post IR and two complications (one intestinal necrosis and one coil misplacement).

18 patients had intervention performed with 16 embolisations. Whether treatment is performed or not, a re-bleed plan should be documented. This occurred in 65% (21/32).

TIPSS only accounted for two IR interventions. This is explained by its availability in very few centres, combined with the equal sampling across all hospitals along with difficulties in obtaining complete case notes from two separate institutions for patients who had an inter-hospital transfer for TIPSS resulting in the exclusion of a number of TIPSS cases.

A further 21 patients (6.3%) did not undergo an IR procedure but should have done in the opinion of the reviewing panel. In total, 14.1% did or should have undergone an IR procedure.

Equipment Replacement Programme

42% (78/186) of hospitals had a formal high-cost equipment programme for imaging equipment including CT scanners and angiography. It has been recommended by The European Society of Radiology that all hospitals should have an equipment replacement programme which looks forward a minimum of 5 years and is reviewed annually. Equipment older than 10 years of age is no longer state-of-the-art and replacement is recommended.

Question 2.15

What are the optimal diagnostic techniques for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and when should these different techniques be employed?

Recommendation: Colonoscopy is the preferred initial investigation for minor or major acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in stable patients. CT angiography is preferred in unstable patients.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)

Colonoscopy is the most effective initial intervention for stable patients allowing a diagnosis to be made, the site of a malignancy to be tattooed and giving an opportunity for therapy in cases of active bleeding. Patients who have had a major bleed should be admitted to hospital and undergo colonoscopy on the next available list. Bowel preparation, either orally or by nasogastric administration, should be used to increase the diagnostic yield and caecal intubation rate.

As the majority of ALGIB settle spontaneously, using radiological investigations to form a diagnosis is not necessary in all cases; only 25.9% of patients required a CT or CT angiogram in the UK audit, which was diagnostic for the source of bleeding in 55.8% and 49.7% respectively. CT angiogram is preferred in an unstable patient due to its speed of access and assessment of the whole GI tract; in general this will be a triple phase examination (unenhanced, arterial and portal venous/delayed phase) from diaphragm to below the inferior pubic ramus in order to ensure that the anorectum is covered. Radionuclide imaging is unlikely to be helpful in the context of ALGIB due to a colorectal malignancy as colonoscopy and CT/CT angiogram will nearly always be able to localize a tumour.

### Diagnostic utility of CT angiography compared with endoscopy in patients with acute GI hemorrhage [^113VUfd1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Because it is minimally invasive, CT angiography (CTA) has emerged as an attractive diagnostic tool for investigation of acute GI hemorrhage.

Methods

This study examined patients with acute GI bleeding who underwent CTA.

Results

CTA was the initial diagnostic examination in 177 patients, identifying upper and lower GI bleeding lesions in 16 and 27 patients, respectively. In 103 patients with an initial negative CTA, 78 had endoscopy (32 EGD and 46 colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy), of whom 52 (67%) had a bleeding lesion identified, including 23 with a high-risk bleeding lesion requiring therapy. Peptic ulcer disease and diverticular bleeding were the most commonly identified bleeding lesions. With endoscopy as a criterion standard, the sensitivity of CTA for the detection of a source of GI bleeding was 20%.

Conclusions

CTA has very poor sensitivity for identification of a GI bleeding source or lesion, suggesting that CTA should not be used as an initial diagnostic test.

### Clinical risk stratification for gastrointestinal hemorrhage: still no consensus [^116PQGkT]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

A lack of consensus exists in the pre-endoscopic risk stratification of patients with upper or lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The work by Das and colleagues in the previous issue of Critical Care serves to externally validate the BLEED criteria. Their results suggest that hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of ongoing bleeding or unstable comorbidities may be at lower risk for hospital complications. While their results reinforce previous studies, further investigation is needed before comprehensive practice guidelines can be established.

### Computed tomographic angiography and yield for gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^1146EjVa]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How has use of computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department (ED) increased, and has it led to improved diagnostic detection or possible overuse?

Findings

In this retrospective cohort study of 954 ED patients from 2017 to 2023, the proportion of total CTA examinations related to gastrointestinal bleeding increased from 0.09% to 0.7%. The test-positive proportion declined from 20.0% to 6.3%.

Meaning

These findings suggest potential overuse of CTA in the ED setting for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^112zL5Mj]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding — nonendoscopic management and surgical considerations: Multidetector row CT "may be superior to the nuclear red blood cell scan" for LGIB and "has therefore replaced the nuclear red blood cell scan at several centers". Mesenteric angiography can detect bleeding "at a rate of 0.5 mL/minute". For first-line embolization in LGIB, successful hemostasis was "85%" in diverticular bleeding versus "50%" from other sources at "30-day follow-up (P < .01)", though early rebleeding after embolization has been reported in "22% of patients with LGIB". Major adverse events with angiography "may occur in up to 17%", and for angiectasias there is a "rebleeding rate of up to 40%". Surgery "is rarely required and should be reserved for the minority" with persistent or refractory diverticular bleeding; criteria include "transfusion of ≥ 6 units of packed red blood cells", and "surgery should be performed on an elective basis" due to "a high mortality rate with emergent" intervention.

### Test sequence in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding [^116Uj9eC]. Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aim

A large variety of test procedures is available to diagnose and treat patients with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of the study was to investigate which test sequence should be utilized in managing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Methods

For each endoscopic, radiologic, or laboratory test procedure, professional fees and facility costs were estimated based on payments allowed by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the fiscal year 2010. A threshold analysis was used to compare the costs associated with different test sequences of varying clinical scenarios.

Results

A threshold represents the lowest expected probability of success, for which a test would still be indicated. In a work-up including all possible management options, the threshold associated with laboratory tests and gastric lavage was 1%, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) 8%, colonoscopy 9%, nuclear scan 9%, enteroscopy 11%, computed tomography (CT) angiography 14%, capsule endoscopy 23%, and angiography with transcatheter embolization 25%. Varying sets of thresholds were calculated for different clinical scenarios. The thresholds of EGD and colonoscopy remained low in most scenarios. In sensitivity analysis, rising risk of complications or costs of a procedure also lead to rising threshold values for it, potentially rendering the particular procedure untenable.

Conclusions

A low threshold indicated a preferred management option that should be used early rather than late in a sequence of multiple possible test procedures to work up instances of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Detection of active gastrointestinal hemorrhage with CT angiography: a 4 (1 / 2)-year retrospective review [^112Kt48G]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To retrospectively evaluate the performance of computed tomography (CT) angiography in the detection and localization of clinically active gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage of an unknown source.

Materials and Methods

Eighty-six CT angiograms were obtained in 74 patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute GI hemorrhage of an unknown source. Results of CT angiography were recorded, and the patients' electronic medical records were reviewed for documentation of subsequent interventional procedures performed within 24 hours of the reference CT angiogram to diagnose or control ongoing GI hemorrhage. Surgical, endoscopic, and final pathologic reports, if available, were reviewed.

Results

Twenty-two of the 86 CT angiograms (26%) were positive for active hemorrhage, with findings confirmed in 19 of the 22 cases (86%). Thirteen cases were confirmed with angiography, five cases were confirmed with surgery, and one case was confirmed with autopsy. Sixty-four of the 86 CT angiograms were negative, and 59 (92%) of the CT angiograms required no further intervention. These patients were discharged without incident. There were no cases in which CT angiography was negative and subsequent angiography within 24 hours was positive. The overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive value of CT angiography in the detection of active GI hemorrhage within this study population were 79%, 95%, 91%, 86%, and 92%, respectively.

Conclusions

CT angiography provides valuable information that can be used to determine the appropriateness of catheter angiography and guide mesenteric catheterization if a bleeding source is localized. The authors' experience with this study cohort supports its use before angiography in those patients with acute GI bleeding of an unknown source who are being considered for catheter-directed intervention.

### Severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage: summary of a national quality of care study with focus on radiological services [^116nQVmF]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is challenging due the long length of the GI tract, the wide range of potential pathologies, the intermittent nature of bleeding and its occurrence in patients with multiple co-morbidities which may restrict the diagnostic and therapeutic options.

Traditionally, GI bleeding is split into upper GI (proximal to the ligament of Treitz, the limit of reach of a standard upper endoscope) and lower GI bleeding with management by medical and surgical teams, respectively. Lower GI bleeding is three times less common than upper GI bleeding. Interventional radiology (IR) is established as the second-line intervention for upper GI bleeding when oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) fails to control bleeding and the first-line intervention in lower GI bleeding when medical management is ineffective.

GI bleeding is the second commonest medical reason for transfusion in the UK after haematological malignancy, accounting for 14% of all blood transfusions.

Around 15% of upper GI bleeds occur in patients who are already in hospital and these are associated with higher mortality rates. There are no comparable data available for lower GI bleeding. The significance of this is that the burden of caring for patients with a GI bleed, at least in the initial phase of their illness, may fall to any medical team, ward or hospital.

This paper reports selected findings and recommendations from a quality of care study "Time to get control" published by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD 1) 2015 with focus on the findings related to radiology services.

### CT for evaluation of acute gastrointestinal bleeding [^112wbY5C]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is common and necessitates rapid diagnosis and treatment. Bleeding can occur anywhere throughout the GI tract and may be caused by many types of disease. The variety of enteric diseases that cause bleeding and the tendency for bleeding to be intermittent may make it difficult to render a diagnosis. The workup of GI bleeding is frequently prolonged and expensive, with examinations commonly needing to be repeated. The use of computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of acute GI bleeding is gaining popularity because it can be used to rapidly diagnose active bleeding and nonbleeding bowel disease. The CT examinations used to evaluate acute GI bleeding include CT angiography and multiphase CT enterography. Understanding the clinical evaluation of acute GI bleeding, including the advantages and limitations of endoscopic evaluation, is necessary for the appropriate selection of patients who may benefit from CT. Multiphase CT enterography is used primarily to evaluate stable patients who have undergone upper and lower endoscopy without identification of a bleeding source. CT angiography is used to examine stable and unstable patients who respond to resuscitation, are believed to be actively bleeding, and are considered unlikely to have an upper GI source of hemorrhage. In the emergent setting, CT may yield critical information regarding the presence, location, and cause of active bleeding-data that can guide the choice of subsequent therapy. Recent developments in the use of and techniques for performing CT angiography have made it a potential first-line tool for evaluating acute GI bleeding. © RSNA, 2018.

### Localization and etiological stratification of non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding via CT imaging: a 10-year study [^115Kx9E2]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel bleeding refers to bleeding between the ligament of Treitz and the ileocecal valve, accounting for approximately 10% of gastrointestinal bleeding. In clinical practice, it poses significant diagnostic challenges. Moreover, Chen et al found that diagnosing bleeding in the descending part of the duodenum and its distal segment is challenging and shares similarities with diagnosing small intestinal bleeding. In clinical practice, small intestine bleeding should be broadened to include bleeding from the descending part of the duodenum and its distal segment.

Causes of small bowel bleeding include inflammatory disorders (27.4%), tumors (18.5%), vascular diseases (16.1%), and small bowel diverticula (11.9%). Chen et al found that intestinal bleeding caused by tumors can be diagnosed and treated via Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). Its diagnostic rate varies from 20% to 77%, influenced by the bleeding rate (bleeding rates: 0.5–1.0 mL/min). Diverticulosis, inflammatory diseases, and vascular disorders are considered potential non-neoplastic causes of bleeding. Diagnosing non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding is difficult due to subtle and hidden bleeding, complicating endoscopy, angiography, and radionuclide scanning.

Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is the primary diagnostic tool for small bowel bleeding and can also offer therapeutic interventions. However, 15–20% of patients undergoing endoscopic therapy had recurrent bleeding, likely from multiple lesions and limited endoscopic visibility of the entire digestive tract. CT is a valuable adjunct to endoscopic assessment of gastrointestinal bleeding. Contrast-enhanced CT serves two purposes: it locates the bleeding site and potential causes, and provides a detailed view of the small bowel's anatomy for informed medical decisions. In clinical practice, patients with gastrointestinal bleeding often undergo periods of fasting, abstaining from food and water, as part of their treatment. However, to achieve high-quality enhanced CT images, patients need to consume sufficient fluids to distend the intestines. The priority is given to the stability of a patient's vital signs over obtaining high-quality images, leading to scans often being performed without complete intestinal distension.

### Multidetector CT angiography in acute gastrointestinal bleeding: why, when, and how [^113Uey7n]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding remains an important cause of emergency hospital admissions, with substantial related morbidity and mortality. Bleeding may relate to the upper or lower GI tract, with the dividing anatomic landmark between these two regions being the ligament of Treitz. The widespread availability of endoscopic equipment has had an important effect on the rapid identification and treatment of the bleeding source. However, the choice of upper or lower GI endoscopy is largely dictated by the clinical presentation, which in many cases proves misleading. Furthermore, there remains a large group of patients with negative endoscopic results or failed endoscopy, in whom additional techniques are required to identify the source of GI bleeding. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) with its speed, resolution, multiplanar techniques, and angiographic capabilities allows excellent visualization of both the small and large bowel. Multiphasic multidetector CT allows direct demonstration of bleeding into the bowel and is helpful in the acute setting for visualization of the bleeding source and its characterization. Thus, multidetector CT angiography provides a time-efficient method for directing and planning therapy for patients with acute GI bleeding. The additional information provided by multidetector CT angiography before attempts at therapeutic angiographic procedures leads to faster selective catheterization of bleeding vessels, thereby facilitating embolization.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding [^115wspph]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding encompasses a broad array of clinical scenarios. The spectrum is diverse because of the multiple types of lesions that can cause bleeding, and because bleeding can occur from virtually anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The fundamental tenets of management of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding include the following: (1) the patient must undergo immediate assessment and stabilization of hemodynamic status, (2) the source of bleeding must be identified, (3) active bleeding should be stopped, (4) the underlying abnormality should be treated, and (5) recurrent bleeding should be "prevented.

### Severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage: summary of a national quality of care study with focus on radiological services [^117NtG1f]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Recommendations to Improve Care

The report makes 26 recommendations to improve the quality care of patients with GI bleeding, including six principle recommendations. Many of the issues identified in the report will be familiar to all those who regularly manage GI bleeds, but providing the evidence to support change can be difficult. Quality of care studies can provide that evidence and drive change.

The six principle recommendations were as follows:
Patients with acute GI bleeds should only be admitted to hospitals with 24/7 on-site endoscopy and surgery and on-site or formally networked IR services.

A 24/7 on-site recommendation for IR services could not be justified as the current level of provision was so low that such a recommendation would have meant restricting acute GI bleed admissions to less than a quarter of hospitals, which would likely have a negative effect on overall care.

2 Hospitals that do not admit patients with GI bleeds must have 24/7 access to endoscopy, interventional radiology and GI bleed surgery for patients who develop a GI bleed whilst as an in-patient for another condition by either an on-site service or a formal network.
3 The traditional separation of care for upper and lower GI bleeding in hospitals should stop. All acute hospitals should have a single integrated service for all GI bleeds.

The lack of specificity of presenting features documented in the report means that the commonest current arrangement in the UK results in two separate teams is managing a mixture of upper and lower GI bleeds. There are opportunities to improve care by sharing nursing and medical expertise in a single service.
4 All patients who present with a major 2 upper or lower GI bleed, either on admission or as an in-patient, should be discussed the consultant on-call for the GI bleed service within 1 hour of the diagnosis of a major bleed.
5 The ongoing management for patients with a major bleed is the responsibility of the duty consultant for the GI bleed service; to ensure timely investigation and treatment to stop bleeding and reduce unnecessary blood transfusion.
6 All patients with a GI bleed must have a clearly documented re-bleed plan agreed at the time of each diagnostic or therapeutic intervention

### An initial experience: using helical CT imaging to detect obscure gastrointestinal bleeding [^113yxQWs]. Clinical Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common but frustrating disease for clinicians because of its elusive nature despite extensive work-up. We evaluate the role of helical computed tomography (CT) imaging using rapid infusion of intravenous contrast and water as oral contrast in the work-up of patients who are actively bleeding. Helical CT may be a useful noninvasive, alternative study to consider when routine work-up fails to determine the cause of active GI bleeding. Our preliminary study shows that helical CT was able to identify a wide variety of causes of obscure GI bleeding.

### Challenges in diagnosis and management of hemobilia [^111dqED1]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemobilia, or hemorrhage within the biliary system, is an uncommon form of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that presents unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Most cases are the result of iatrogenic trauma, although accidental trauma and a variety of inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic processes have also been implicated. Timely diagnosis can often be difficult, as the classic triad of upper GI hemorrhage, biliary colic, and jaundice is present in a minority of cases, and there may be considerable delay in the onset of bleeding after the initial injury. Therefore, the radiologist must maintain a high index of suspicion for this condition and be attuned to its imaging characteristics across a variety of modalities. CT is the first-line diagnostic modality in evaluation of hemobilia, while catheter angiography and endoscopy play vital and complementary roles in both diagnosis and treatment. The authors review the clinical manifestations and multimodality imaging features of hemobilia, describe the wide variety of underlying causes, and highlight key management considerations. © RSNA, 2021.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^1136V8tX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Small bowel bleeding — diagnostic angiography is most useful with active, brisk bleeding and specific clinical predictors. Conventional angiography is used, especially in hemodynamic instability, but requires higher bleeding rates (0.5–1.0 ml/min) and carries complications that can occur in up to 10%. Across GI studies, yields range 20–77% with a mean near 50%. Predictors of positive angiography include hemodynamic instability and transfusion requirement of ≥ 5 U, with positive yield increasing to 87% in more massive GI bleeding; yields are highest when the patient is actively bleeding with minimal delay from presentation. Patients with a negative tagged RBC scan or negative computed tomography (CT) angiogram are unlikely to have a positive conventional angiogram, whereas a positive CT angiogram, non-diverticular etiologies, and lower hemoglobin increase the likelihood of a subsequent positive conventional angiogram.

### Imaging of gastrointestinal bleeding [^114P35Ls]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Radiological techniques are important in evaluating patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Scintigraphic, computed tomographic angiographic, and enterographic techniques are sensitive tools in identifying the source of bleeding and may be useful in identifying patients likely to have a benign course and in selecting patients for therapeutic intervention. Angiography plays a key role in bleeding localization, and modern embolization techniques make this a viable therapeutic option. With the refining developments in body imaging and related reconstructive techniques, it is likely that radiological interventions will play an expanding and critical role in evaluating patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the future.

### Who orders a head CT? perceptions of the cirrhotic bleeding risk in an international, multispecialty survey study [^112bjspv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Traditional coagulopathic indices, including elevated international normalized ratio, do not correlate with bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. For this reason, head computed tomography (CT) has a low yield in cirrhotic patients with altered mental status and no trauma history. The initial diagnostic evaluation, however, is often made by nongastroenterologists influenced by the so-called "coagulopathy of cirrhosis". We sought to examine the prevalence, impact, and malleability of this perception in an international, multispecialty cohort.

Design

An electronic survey was distributed to internal medicine, surgery, emergency medicine, and gastroenterology physicians. Respondents were presented with a cirrhotic patient with hepatic encephalopathy, no history of trauma, and a nonfocal neurological examination. Respondents rated likelihood to order head CT at presentation, after obtaining labs [international normalized ratio (INR) 2.4 and platelets 59×10/μL], and finally after reading the results of a study demonstrating the low yield of head CT in this setting.

Results

In total, 1286 physicians from 6 countries, 84% from the United States. Of these, 62% were from internal medicine, 25% from emergency medicine, 8% from gastroenterology, and 5% from surgery. Totally, 47% of respondents were attending physicians. At each timepoint, emergency physicians were more likely, and gastroenterologists less likely, to scan than all other specialties (P < 0.0001). Evidence on the low yield of head CT reduced likelihood to scan for all specialties. Qualitative analysis of open-ended comments confirmed that concern for "coagulopathy of cirrhosis" motivated CT orders.

Conclusions

Perceptions regarding the coagulopathy of cirrhosis, which vary across specialties, impact clinical decision-making. Exposure to clinical evidence has the potential to change practice patterns.

### No catheter angiography is needed in patients with an obscure acute gastrointestinal bleed and negative CTA [^111AViZs]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the negative predictive power of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for the identification of obscure acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (GI bleeding not visualized/treated by endoscopy) on subsequent mesenteric angiography (MA) with the intention to treat.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients was performed who underwent mesenteric angiography for the evaluation/treatment of acute GI bleeding between November 2012 and July 2016. Patients with negative CTA examinations that proceeded to MA were identified. Negative predictive value (NPV) was calculated.

Results

20 patients (14 male, 6 female; average age: 73.1 ± 12.8years) underwent 20 negative CTA examinations for the evaluation and treatment of GI bleeding followed by mesenteric angiography. Eighteen of 20 patients had negative subsequent MA (negative predictive value, NPV = 90%). Both false negative cases were upper GI bleed (vs 0 lower GI bleed); this difference was significant (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The high NPV of CTA for the evaluation of GI bleeding suggests utility for excluding patients that are unlikely to benefit from MA and subsequent endovascular therapy. CTA may be considered for the first line diagnostic study for the evaluation of obscure GI bleeding.

Occult gastrointestinal bleeding — endoscopic workup includes that "Patients with occult GI bleeding should undergo colonoscopy for evaluation of underlying colorectal neoplasia". "CT colonography may be an alternative in patients who are at high risk for colonoscopy-related adverse events and for the detection of proximal lesions in those who have had an incomplete colonoscopy". "An EGD should be considered if a bleeding source is not identified in the colon, especially in those patients with upper GI symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or NSAID use". "The overall yield of EGD has been reported to range from 13% to 41%, with the predominant findings of peptic ulcer and esophagitis". Additionally, "Small-bowel evaluation may be necessary in patients who have fecal occult blood and persistent anemia, after negative EGD and colonoscopy results".

### Multidetector CT angiography for acute gastrointestinal bleeding: technique and findings [^116if6m6]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common reason for emergency department admissions and an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Factors that complicate its clinical management include patient debility due to comorbidities; intermittence of hemorrhage; and multiple sites of simultaneous bleeding. Its management, therefore, must be multidisciplinary and include emergency physicians, gastroenterologists, and surgeons, as well as radiologists for diagnostic imaging and interventional therapy. Upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding is usually managed endoscopically, with radiologic intervention reserved as an alternative to be used if endoscopic therapy fails. Endoscopy is often less successful in the management of acute lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, where colonoscopy may be more effective. The merits of performing bowel cleansing before colonoscopy in such cases might be offset by the resultant increase in response time and should be weighed carefully against the deficits in visualization and diagnostic accuracy that would result from performing colonoscopy without bowel preparation. In recent years, multidetector computed tomographic (CT) angiography has gained acceptance as a first-line option for the diagnosis and management of lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding. In selected cases of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, CT angiography also provides accurate information about the presence or absence of active bleeding, its source, and its cause. This information helps shorten the total diagnostic time and minimizes or eliminates the need for more expensive and more invasive procedures.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^114MHyef]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — red blood cell (RBC) scintigraphy and CT angiography: There is considerable debate about using tagged RBC scintigraphy before angiography, but if tagged RBC scintigraphy is positive, angiography should be performed immediately following; tagged RBC scintigraphy localizes bleeding suboptimally (65–80%) and is most suitable for intermittent, obscure-overt GI bleeding, whereas CT angiography is widely available and highly accurate at localizing the bleeding site (nearly 100%); in the only back-to-back comparison tagged RBC scintigraphy was positive in 46% of patients and CT angiography in 27%, yet only 2 of 11 with a positive RBC study and negative CT angiography required treatment, and standard precautions should be taken to avoid contrast-induced nephropathy.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding-computed tomographic angiography, colonoscopy or both? [^113Q2SE7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lower endoscopy (LE) is the standard diagnostic modality for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). Conversely, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) offers an immediate non-invasive diagnosis visualizing the entire gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to compare these 2 modalities with regards to diagnostic value and bleeding control.

Methods

Tertiary center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted for LGIB between 2006 and 2012. Comparison of patients with LE vs. CTA as first exam, respectively, with emphasis on diagnostic accuracy and bleeding control.

Results

Final analysis included 183 patients; 122 (66.7%) had LE first, while 32 (17.5%) had CTA; 29 (15.8%) had neither of both exams. Median time to CTA was shorter compared to LE (3 (IQR = 8.2) vs. 22 (IQR = 36.9) hours, P < 0.001). Active bleeding was identified in 31% with CTA vs. 15% with LE (P = 0.031); a non-actively bleeding source was found by CTA and LE in 22 vs. 31%, respectively (P = 0.305). Bleeding control required endoscopy in 19%, surgery in 14% and embolization in 1.6%, while 66% were treated conservatively. Post-interventional bleeding was mostly controlled by endoscopic therapy (57%). 80% of patients with active bleeding on CTA required surgery.

Conclusions

Post-interventional LGIB was effectively addressed by LE. For other causes of LGIB, CTA was efficient, and more available than colonoscopy. Treatment was conservative for most patients. In case of active bleeding, CTA could localize the bleeding source and predict the need for surgery.

### CT-angiography in acute bleeding: is a non-enhanced scan necessary? [^115XquYz]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

In clinical routine CT-angiography is frequently used to detect hemorrhage and to locate its source. Many centers use a triple phase protocol consisting of non-contrast, arterial and portal venous phase scan. The aim of this study was to clarify the added value of the non-contrast CT scan in detection of hemorrhage and to provide evidence for or against its usage.

Materials & Methods

We retrospectively included all patients between 2014 and 2020 who underwent triphasic CT angiography for suspected bleeding and interventional angiography within 6 h of CT confirming bleeding. Two experienced observers re-evaluated all CT scans and established consensus on whether the bleeding could confidently be detected without the non-enhanced CT scan. Additionally, we recorded data on radiation exposure.

Results

We included 75 patients (44 male, 31 female, median age 64 years) in the final dataset. Of all bleedings 33 (43%) were GI bleedings. After consensus reading, non-enhanced CT scan was deemed helpful in only 3 cases (5.2%) with all of these being GI bleeding. Non-enhanced series contributed substantially to the overall radiation exposure (mean DLP non contrast 927.9 mGy*cm, mean DLP arterial 631.3 mGy*cm, mean DLP portal venous 915.0 mGy*cm).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that in the vast majority of cases non-contrast CT is not necessary to detect hemorrhage. Omission of non-enhanced CT scans results in relevant dose reduction. However, in few cases non-contrast scan can be helpful to exclude false positive findings in particular in suspected gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Multi-detector CT: review of its use in acute GI haemorrhage [^117KEMMk]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The advent of multi-section computed tomography (CT) technology allows the non-invasive assessment of the arterial tree. Using current software, it is now possible to produce high-quality, angiographic-like images that can be used to plan and guide therapeutic procedures. One such clinical situation is the assessment of patients with acute gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage. Multi-section CT has a number of advantages over conventional angiography in this situation. The simplicity and non-invasive nature of the technique compared with conventional angiography make CT angiography possible in situations where conventional angiography is not available. Movement artefact from respiration and peristalsis is a common problem in the interpretation of conventional angiography; this is essentially abolished with rapid acquisition times and the use of multi-planar images to remove overlying bowel loops. Cross-sectional imaging with the ability for multi-planar reconstruction allows the accurate anatomical localization of the bleeding site, as well as an assessment of the underlying pathology: this can be used to plan therapy (embolization or surgery). The aim of this paper is to review the current use of CT in the investigation of patients with GI haemorrhage, illustrated with images from our Institution. For patients in whom GI endoscopy has failed to establish a diagnosis, we propose multi-section CT angiography as the initial imaging investigation in acute GI haemorrhage.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^112Mmb6Q]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) predictors and yield in lower gastrointestinal bleeding — In a retrospective analysis of 930 patients with LGIB, 10% of the population underwent initial CTA, and only 9 of 93 patients had a positive CTA. In another larger retrospective cohort study of 854 patients undergoing CTA for LGIB, 20% of scans were positive. Factors associated with a positive CTA included recent bowel resection or endoscopic intervention, transfusion of more than 3 units of PRBC per day, use of antiplatelet agents, tachycardia, and hypotension. Performance of CTA within 4 hours of hematochezia increases the likelihood of a positive test, and a shock index (heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure) of ≥ 1 can also be used as a supplemental tool to predict active bleeding on CTA, with additional variables including recent use of NSAIDs or DOACs. In a large, multicenter Japanese cohort of patients admitted with LGIB, urgent CTA was performed in 97.5% of the cohort, with 22.9% demonstrating extravasation on CT.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^1138Lf3P]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Imaging strategies during active or ongoing small bowel bleeding state that in hemodynamically stable patients with evidence of active bleeding, multiphasic CT (CTA) can be performed to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management, whereas in acute overt massive GI bleeding, conventional angiography should be performed emergently for hemodynamically unstable patients. In patients with acute overt GI bleeding and slower rates of bleeding (0.1–0.2 mL/min), or uncertainty if actively bleeding, tagged red blood cell scintigraphy should be performed if deep enteroscopy or VCE are not performed to guide timing of angiography. In brisk active overt bleeding, CT angiography (CTA) is preferred over CTE, conventional angiography should not be performed as a diagnostic test in patients without overt bleeding, and provocative angiography can be considered in the setting of ongoing overt bleeding and negative VCE, deep enteroscopy, and/or CT examination. In younger patients with ongoing overt bleeding and normal testing with capsule endoscopy and enterography examinations, a Meckel's scan should be performed.

### The SNMMI procedure standard / ACNM practice guideline for gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy 3.0 [^115JtNy8]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). High credibility.

Patient preparation and precautions for GIBS specify that patients with gastrointestinal bleeding who are considered hemodynamically unstable should be monitored by a physician, advanced practice provider, or nurse while in the nuclear medicine department. Reinjection of radiolabeled blood taken from one patient poses the risk of incorrect administration to a different patient; written policies must be in place with special safeguards regarding the handling and administration of blood to eliminate any possibility of administration to the wrong patient, particularly when two or more RBC labeling studies are performed simultaneously, and universal precautions must be followed to avoid staff exposure to blood products. Fasting is not required for GIBS, although fasting may be required for subsequent procedures such as angiography or surgery, and patients should be instructed to void immediately before imaging so they are comfortable during a potentially long scan and to facilitate scan interpretation.

### The role of imaging for gastrointestinal bleeding: consensus recommendations from the American College of Gastroenterology and society of abdominal radiology [^117Rsdhs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most common GI diagnosis leading to hospitalization within the United States. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of GI bleeding is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing high healthcare utilization and costs. Radiologic techniques including computed tomography angiography, catheter angiography, computed tomography enterography, magnetic resonance enterography, nuclear medicine red blood cell scan, and technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy (Meckel scan) are frequently used to evaluate patients with GI bleeding and are complementary to GI endoscopy. However, multiple management guidelines exist which differ in the recommended utilization of these radiologic examinations. This variability can lead to confusion as to how these tests should be used in the evaluation of GI bleeding. In this document, a panel of experts from the American College of Gastroenterology and Society of Abdominal Radiology provide a review of the radiologic examinations used to evaluate for GI bleeding including nomenclature, technique, performance, advantages, and limitations. A comparison of advantages and limitations relative to endoscopic examinations is also included. Finally, consensus statements and recommendations on technical parameters and utilization of radiologic techniques for GI bleeding are provided.

Abdominal imaging usage in suspected small bowel bleeding — barium examinations have low diagnostic yield and are not advised, while optimized CT or MR techniques are more commonly used. Specifically, "barium examinations of the small bowel have had low yields (3–17%)… and therefore are not recommended in the evaluation of patients with suspected small bowel bleeding". Also, "These optimized small bowel techniques can be performed using CT or MR. CT is more widely used in the setting of GI bleeding because of the superior temporal and spatial resolution compared with MR and is more widely available".

### ACR appropriateness criteriaNonvariceal Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding [^111rRRFF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality with mortality rates as high as 14%. This document addresses the indications for imaging UGIB that is nonvariceal and unrelated to portal hypertension. The four variants are derived with respect to upper endoscopy. For the first three, it is presumed that upper endoscopy has been performed, with three potential initial outcomes: endoscopy reveals arterial bleeding source, endoscopy confirms UGIB without a clear source, and negative endoscopy. The fourth variant, "postsurgical and traumatic causes of UGIB; endoscopy contraindicated" is considered separately because upper endoscopy is not performed. When endoscopy identifies the presence and location of bleeding but bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically, catheter-based arteriography with treatment is an appropriate next study. CT angiography (CTA) is comparable with angiography as a diagnostic next step. If endoscopy demonstrates a bleed but the endoscopist cannot identify the bleeding source, angiography or CTA can be typically performed and both are considered appropriate. In the event of an obscure UGIB, angiography and CTA have been shown to be equivalent in identifying the bleeding source; CT enterography may be an alternative to CTA to find an intermittent bleeding source. In the postoperative or traumatic setting when endoscopy is contraindicated, primary angiography, CTA, and CT with intravenous contrast are considered appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Computed tomographic angiography and yield for gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^113VeJK5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Overuse of advanced imaging in the emergency department (ED) contributes to higher costs, reduced efficiency, and crowding. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a recommended first-line diagnostic for acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), yet its increasing use may not always improve detection of active bleeding.

Objective

To evaluate recent trends in CTA use for suspected GIB in the ED and assess changes in diagnostic yield.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients who underwent CTA of the abdomen and pelvis for suspected GIB at a 1011-bed urban academic medical center between January 2017 and December 2023.

Exposure

Suspected GIB prompting a CTA order in the ED.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the annual number and proportion of GIB-related CTAs among all ED computed tomography (CT) examinations. The secondary outcome was the test-positive proportion (diagnostic yield), defined as the percentage of CTAs showing active bleeding or evidence of hemorrhage. All CTAs were interpreted by board-certified emergency radiologists and reviewed by a fellowship-trained emergency radiologist.

Results

Among 954 ED patients (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [6.3] years; 427 female [44.8%]), the number of GIB-related CTA examinations increased from 30 of 32 197 ED CT examinations (0.09%) in 2017 to 288 of 44 423 (0.65%) in 2023. Over the same period, the test-positive proportion declined from 6 of 30 (20.0%) in 2017 to 18 of 288 (6.3%) in 2023. Multivariable analysis showed that more recent calendar year was associated with lower odds of a test-positive examination (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; p = 0.01), older age with higher odds (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00–1.04; p = 0.02), and active cancer with lower odds (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12–1.00; p = 0.05).

Conclusions and Relevance

CTA use increased substantially over 7 years while diagnostic yield declined. This trend highlights the need to balance the diagnostic benefit of CTA with interpretation time, radiation exposure, and operational strain. These findings support a need for evidence-based ordering criteria and decision-support tools to help guide CTA use in the ED evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Computed tomography imaging for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel ischemia [^114URLKK]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is one of the main diagnostic methods for assessing both acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and bowel ischemia due to its widespread availability, excellent spatial resolution, and high accuracy. While endoscopy is the preferred diagnostic tool for workup of upper GIB, CT is used in select instances as a complementary modality or when endoscopy is impractical. For lower GIB, CT is one of the first-line imaging tools. Mesenteric ischemia is primarily diagnosed with CT, which can exquisitely assess the vasculature and demonstrate bowel findings of ischemia or infarction.

### Adding non-contrast and delayed phases increases the diagnostic performance of arterial CTA for suspected active lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^113XZ9Ak]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

When assessing for lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) using CTA, many advocate for acquiring non-contrast and delayed phases in addition to an arterial phase to improve diagnostic performance though the potential benefit of this approach has not been fully characterized. We evaluate diagnostic accuracy among radiologists when using single-phase, biphasic, and triphasic CTA in active LGIB detection.

Method and Materials

A random experimental block design was used where 3 blinded radiologists specialty trained in interventional radiology retrospectively interpreted 96 CTA examinations completed between Oct 2012 and Oct 2017 using (1) arterial only, (2) arterial/non-contrast, and (3) arterial/non-contrast/delayed phase configurations. Confirmed positive and negative LGIB studies were matched, balanced, and randomly ordered. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, positive and negative predictive values, and time to identify the presence/absence of active bleeding were examined using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with sandwich estimation assuming a binary distribution to estimate relative benefit of diagnostic performance between phase configurations.

Results

Specificity increased with additional contrast phases (arterial 72.2; arterial/non-contrast 86.1; arterial/non-contrast/delayed 95.1; p < 0.001) without changes in sensitivity (arterial 77.1; arterial/non-contrast 70.2; arterial/non-contrast/delayed 73.1; p = 0.11) or mean time required to identify bleeding per study (s, arterial 34.8; arterial/non-contrast 33.1; arterial/non-contrast/delayed 36.0; p = 0.99). Overall agreement among readers (Kappa) similarly increased (arterial 0.47; arterial/non-contrast 0.65; arterial/non-contrast/delayed 0.79).

Conclusion

The addition of non-contrast and delayed phases to arterial phase CTA increased specificity and inter-reader agreement for the detection of lower gastrointestinal bleeding without increasing reading times.

Key Points

- A triphasic CTA including non-contrast, arterial, and delayed phase has higher specificity for the detection of lower gastrointestinal bleeding than arterial-phase-only protocols.
- Inter-reader agreement increases with additional contrast phases relative to single-phase CTA.
- Increasing the number of contrast phases did not increase reading times.

### Computed tomographic angiography and yield for gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^114BLxKC]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of 954 ED patients who underwent CTA examinations for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding, the proportion of total ED GIB-related CTA examinations rose from 0.09% in 2017 to 0.7% in 2023, while the test-positive proportion declined from 20.0% to 6.3%. In multivariable analysis, older age was associated with higher odds of a test-positive examination, whereas active cancer was associated with lower odds. Sex and race were not independently associated with a test-positive result. These findings suggest that expanding CTA use has been accompanied by diminishing diagnostic yield.

Multiple factors may contribute to increased CTA examination volume for suspected GIB. Although current ACG/SAR guidelines provide direction on appropriate use, clinicians may still order CTA examinations in borderline scenarios when intermittent GIB is suspected as a potential etiology, such as unexplained abdominal pain, drop in hemoglobin, or historical bleeding. Pressures to expedite ED disposition, defensive practice, and increasing patient expectations may further influence ordering behavior. While a test-negative examination can facilitate triage by excluding active bleeding, the declining test-positive proportion in this study may highlight a need for clearer imaging criteria for ordering CTA.

The association between older age and a higher likelihood of a test-positive examination may reflect an increased baseline risk of bleeding among older adults due to greater prevalence of vascular disease, frailty, and more frequent anticoagulant use. The lower test-positive proportion in patients with active cancer could be influenced by both clinical practice patterns and disease-related factors. For example, ED clinicians may adopt a lower threshold for ordering CTA examinations in patients who have known cancer, especially gastrointestinal. For these patients, CTA can assess for active bleeding, tumor progression, and vascular complications. However, bleeding in patients with malignancy, especially from mucosal or metastatic lesions, is frequently intermittent or slow. This pattern can reduce the likelihood of detection on a single CTA examination.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^111uUTA1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute LGIB — diagnostic evaluation and timing: We recommend performance of colonoscopy for most patients who are hospitalized with LGIB because of its value in detecting a source of bleeding (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest performing a computed tomography (CT) angiography as the initial diagnostic test in patients with ongoing hemodynamically significant hematochezia; however, CT angiography is of low yield in patients with minor LGIB or those in whom bleeding has clinically subsided (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We recommend that patients who have a CT angiography demonstrating extravasation be promptly referred to interventional radiology for transcatheter arteriography and possible embolization, and for specialized centers with experience performing endoscopic hemostasis, a colonoscopy can also be considered after a positive CT angiography (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For patients hospitalized with LGIB requiring a colonoscopy, we recommend performing a nonemergent inpatient colonoscopy, as performing an urgent colonoscopy within 24 hours has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114tr6eo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Bleeding peptic ulcer

Diagnosis

In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, which biochemical and imaging investigations should be requested?

In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, we recommend blood-typing, determinations of hemoglobin, hematocrit and electrolytes, and coagulation assessment (strong recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 1D).

In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, when endoscopy is not available, we suggest performing contrast-enhanced CT scan (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D)

Peptic ulcer is still the primary cause of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hypovolemic shock or its consequences is a major cause of mortality in acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In the acute setting, with the suspicion of bleeding peptic ulcer, blood tests that include blood-typing and cross-matching with determinations of hemoglobin, hematocrit, electrolytes, and coagulation assessment should be performed in all patients. Alteration of coagulation with INR greater than 1.5 is associated with an increased risk of mortality.

Data are limited in the literature on the use of CT-scan in the evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding. Given the assumption that gastroscopy is the first diagnostic step, in patients where it is negative or not feasible, CT-scan may be a valuable tool to detect the site and the degree of the bleeding. Otherwise, CT angiography is the first-line investigation of choice for undifferentiated major gastrointestinal hemorrhage (being particularly useful for the localization of small and large intestinal acute hemorrhage). There are increasing data to suggest that CT-scan should be the "next step" investigative procedure in cases of active GI hemorrhage.

In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, what is the diagnostic role of endoscopy?

In patients with suspected bleeding peptic, ulcer, we recommend performing endoscopy as soon as possible, especially in high-risk patients (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C)

### Importance of communication of CT indication for imaging yield in patients with gastrointestinal bleed [^113faUop]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The indications for requesting a diagnostic test are important for the selection and timing of imaging protocols. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic yield and impact on patient disposition when evaluating computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis in adult patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) to the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This study was an observational cohort study of consecutive adult ED patients with ICD10 codes related to GIB between 5/5/2018 and 6/1/2020. CT reports were reviewed for indications, exam type and findings. Reports were classified as positive (active bleeding, recent bleeding or suspected etiology for GIB), negative or other significant findings. Methodological guidelines for reporting observational studies were followed (STROBE).

Results

Among 943 patients with GIB during the study period, 33% (n = 312) had an abdominopelvic CT ordered. Most CTs included contrast, 64.1% (n = 200) used a single portal venous phase and 28.9% (n = 90) were multi-phase. CT identified active bleeding in 4.2% (n = 13/312) and intraluminal blood in 2.9% (n = 9/312) patients. Patients that had GIB indications on the CT order (n = 142) were more likely to receive a multiphase study compared to those without GIB indication (n = 94) (43.0% vs. 8.5%, difference 34.5%, 95% CI 23.7% to 43.7%, p < 0.0001). Patients that received multiphase studies were more likely to have a source of GIB identified compared to single-phase (18.9% vs 1.5%, OR 15.3, 95% CI 4.4 to 53.7, p < 0.0001). In 40.3% (n = 117/290) of patients without bleeding, an intra-abdominal cause for their symptoms was identified. Those with GIB or with an identified cause were more likely to be admitted.

Conclusions

One-third of patients evaluated in the ED with GIB had a CT ordered. Active GIB was detected more often when multiphase exams were performed. Multiphase exams are done more often if GIB is listed in the CT indication. When a CT is positive, patients are more likely to be admitted or observed. Accurate indications are critical to optimize exam performance.

### Computed tomographic angiography and yield for gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^116Do7sb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In a high-volume ED, GIB-related CTA examination volume increased substantially over 7 years, while the proportion of test-positive findings declined. This trend raises considerations about the balance between diagnostic benefit and the demands of advanced imaging, including increased interpretation time, radiation exposure, and system-level strain. These findings support a need for evidence-based criteria and clinical decision-support tools to promote more targeted use of CTA in the ED evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage: summary of a national quality of care study with focus on radiological services [^111PA1Ai]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose of Study

To identify the remediable factors in the quality of care provided to patients with severe gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Method

All hospital admissions in the first four months of 2013 with ICD10 coding for GI bleeding who received a transfusion of 4 units or more of blood. Up to five cases/hospital randomly selected for structured case note peer review. National availability of GI bleeding services data derived from organisational questionnaire completed by all hospitals.

Results

4563/29,796 (15.3%) of GI bleeds received 4 or more units of blood with a mortality rate of 20.2% compared to 7.3% without blood transfusion. 30.8% of GI bleeds received a blood transfusion. 32% (60/185) of hospitals admitting acute GI bleeds lacked 24/7 endoscopy. 26% (48/185) had on-site embolisation 24/7 with a further 34% (64/185) accessing embolisation by transfer within a validated formal network. Blood product use was inappropriate in 20% (84/426). Improved management, principally earlier senior gastroenterologist review and/or endoscopy, would have reduced blood product use in 25% (113/457). 14.5% (90/618) had a CT scan which identified the site of bleeding in 32% (29/90). 7.8% (36/459) underwent an Interventional Radiology (IR) procedure but a further 6.3% (21/33) should have had IR. 6% (36/586) underwent surgery with 21/36 for uncontrolled bleeding. In 20/35 IR was not considered despite the majority being suitable for IR. Overall 44% (210/476) received an acceptable standard of care according to peer review.

Conclusions

26 recommendations were made to improve the quality of care in GI bleeding, with six principle recommendations.

### Computed tomographic angiography and yield for gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^1178mWhp]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. It was conducted at a single urban academic center, which may restrict generalizability to other settings. Tagged red blood cell scintigraphy is a comparator modality to CTA for assessing GIB, but it is not available in our ED. More detailed clinical variables, such as laboratory values, medication use, and the frequency of direct-to-endoscopy or endovascular management, were not available for systematic extraction. Downstream clinical management and patient disposition following each CTA examination were not assessed within the scope of this study, and test-negative examinations may have revealed alternative actionable findings that influenced disposition. Consequently, we do not draw conclusions regarding the necessity of imaging itself. Although all reports were reviewed by a fellowship-trained emergency radiologist, interrater reliability was not formally measured.

Balancing the diagnostic advantages of CTA with concerns about radiation exposure, radiologist workload, and resource use remains a challenge in emergency radiology. Future studies should incorporate more granular clinical data, include outcome assessment after both test-positive and test-negative CTA examinations, and evaluate the impact of decision-support tools and risk-stratification frameworks across multiple centers. Such efforts may help optimize CTA use and ensure that imaging is reserved for clinical contexts where it provides the greatest benefit.

### Helical CT in the diagnosis of acute lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage [^114UHuro]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

A pilot study to evaluate helical computer tomography (CT) as a diagnostic tool for acute lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) bleeding. CT was compared to conventional angiography (CA) and colonoscopy for the diagnosis and detection of bleeding site in suspected cases of acute lower GIT bleeding.

Methods

Seven patients presenting with acute lower GIT bleeding, between June and November 2002, underwent CT examinations. All of these seven patients underwent CA following CT. Emergency colonoscopies were performed on five patients investigated with both CT and CA. Median delay from the most recent episode of hematochezia to CT was two and a half hours, to CA was 3h, and to colonoscopy was 4h. None of the patients underwent nuclear medicine (NM) bleeding studies.

Results

Haemoglobin drop in all patients was greater than 15 g/L in the first 24h of presentation. The mean age was 68.86 years (range, 49–83 years). Comparing CT and CA, there were four concordant and three discordant results. Both modalities had concordant findings of two active bleeding sites, one non-bleeding rectal tumour, and one negative case result. In three patients, the source of bleeding was found on CT whereas CA was negative. Emergency colonoscopies performed in all of these three patients confirmed blood in the colon/ileum.

Conclusion

Early experience suggests that CT is a safe, convenient and accurate diagnostic tool for acute lower GIT haemorrhage. It raises questions regarding the sensitivity of CA. A new management algorithm for acute lower GIT haemorrhage using CT as the pre-CA screening tool is being proposed based on the preliminary findings. Positive CT will allow directed therapeutic angiography, while negative CT will triage patients into alternative management pathways.

### Conventional angiography findings in hemodynamically unstable patients with acute abdominal hemorrhage and a negative CT bleeding study [^1177Pfm8]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal hemorrhage (AAH) can be intraluminal (upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding) or extra luminal (bleeding into the parenchyma of an organ, peritoneal cavity or abdominal wall). Acute upper and lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI) treatment guidelines typically suggest endoscopy is the first line investigation (Strate and Gralnek), with CT angiography (CTA), nuclear medicine red cell labelled imaging and conventional angiography (CA) appropriate as second line investigations (ACR appropriateness guidelines). The recently published British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines have advised CTA as first line investigation in hemodynamically unstable patients, prior to endoscopy, CA or surgery (Oakland et al.). Prior studies of CTA in acute GI hemorrhage suggest that patients with a negative CTA are likely to stop bleeding without intervention (Chan et al; Foley et al.).

There are no specific guidelines for investigating extra luminal hemorrhage in the abdomen outside of the setting of blunt and penetrating trauma (the American Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines). CTA is regularly requested in AAH with haemodynamic instability by clinical teams and interventional radiologists because CTA can; detect arterial bleeding at low rates of hemorrhage, accurately localize the bleeding point, characterize the etiology (E.G. bleeding ulcer), display the vascular anatomy, determine the arterial access site and aid selection of angiographic equipment.

How best to manage an unstable patient who has an AAH with a haematoma and no acute vascular findings on CTA represents a difficult clinical scenario for treating physicians and Interventional Radiologists.

The purpose of our study is to review the CA findings and clinical outcome of hemodynamically unstable patients with acute abdominal hemorrhage who had a preceding negative CTA.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding-computed tomographic angiography, colonoscopy or both? [^1138DnNW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis describes current practice of management for LGIB in a "real-world" setting in order to propose a new treatment algorithm that needs to be evaluated prospectively. The present study suggests that CTA is an efficient and readily available tool to manage patients with LGIB. CTA could be considered a suitable first diagnostic option for acute LGIB except for post-interventional bleeding which should entail immediate LE. However, most patients with LGIB can be treated conservatively.

### Acute gastrointestinal bleeding: detection of source and etiology with multi-detector-row CT [^112iTfRk]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to determine the ability of multi-detector-row computed tomography (CT) to identify the source and etiology of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Eighteen patients with acute upper (n = 10) and lower (n = 8) gastrointestinal bleeding underwent 4-detector-row CT (n = 6), 16-detector-row CT (n = 11), and 64-slice CT (n = 1) with an arterial and portal venous phase of contrast enhancement. Unenhanced scans were performed in nine patients. CT scans were reviewed to determine conspicuity of bleeding source, underlying etiology, and for potential causes of false-negative prospective interpretations. Bleeding sources were prospectively identified with CT in 15 (83%) patients, and three (17%) bleeding sources were visualized in retrospect, allowing the characterization of all sources of bleeding with CT. Contrast extravasation was demonstrated with CT in all 11 patients with severe bleeding, but only in 1 of 7 patients with mild bleeding. The etiology could not be identified on unenhanced CT scans in any patient, whereas arterial-phase and portal venous-phase CT depicted etiology in 15 (83%) patients. Underlying etiology was correctly identified in all eight patients with mild GI bleeding. Multi-detector-row CT enables the identification of bleeding source and precise etiology in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding — We suggest performing a CTA as the initial diagnostic test in patients with ongoing hemodynamically significant hematochezia. However, CTA is of low yield in patients with minor LGIB or those in whom bleeding has clinically subsided. (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). In a meta-analysis of 14 observational studies, the sensitivity and specificity of CTA in the diagnosis of LGIB were 90% and 92%, respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^114J7eFX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Overt acute gastrointestinal bleeding — recommendations for imaging and angiography are as follows: In acute overt massive GI bleeding, conventional angiography should be performed emergently for hemodynamically unstable patients (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). In hemodynamically stable patients with evidence of active bleeding, multiphasic CT (CTA) can be performed to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). In patients with acute overt GI bleeding and slower rates of bleeding (0.1–0.2 ml/min), or uncertainty if actively bleeding, tagged red blood cell (RBC) scintigraphy should be performed if deep enteroscopy or VCE are not performed to guide timing of angiography (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). In brisk active overt GI bleeding, CTA is preferred over CTE (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Conventional angiography should not be performed as a diagnostic test in patients with overt bleeding (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Provocative angiography can be considered in the setting of ongoing overt bleeding and negative VCE, deep enteroscopy, and/or CT examination (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). In younger patients with ongoing overt bleeding and normal testing with VCE and enterography examinations, a Meckel's scan should be performed (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### Computed tomographic angiography and yield for gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^1177z94A]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common and potentially life-threatening condition encountered in emergency department (ED) settings, contributing to high morbidity, mortality, and health care resource consumption, remaining the leading cause of gastrointestinal–related hospitalizations in the US. Prompt, accurate evaluation of suspected GIB in the ED is therefore essential for improving outcomes and reducing costs.

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has become a principal diagnostic tool for suspected GIB, providing high sensitivity (85% to 90%), specificity (approximately 92%), and accuracy (approximately 95%). Its robust negative estimative value is associated with reduced rebleeding and lower intervention rates, supporting its use as a potential means to decrease hospital admissions. Accordingly, joint guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology and Society of Abdominal Radiology (ACG/SAR) endorse CTA as first-line imaging for hemodynamically unstable patients and select hemodynamically stable patients with strong suspicion for active GIB. However, CTA's utility presents tradeoffs — CTA is a multiphase examination that requires the radiologist to review a relatively high number of images, and findings of active bleeding can be subtle, increasing interpretive complexity and radiologist workload. These factors may exacerbate ED crowding and delay patient throughput. Rising imaging volumes in ED settings further impact workflow and resource allocation.,

While CTA is well established in diagnosing and guiding treatment in patients with clear evidence of GIB, increased use of CTA in the ED may be driven by nonguideline-based practice, defensive medicine, or heightened patient expectations. Few studies have examined longitudinal trends in CTA ordering for suspected GIB or assessed changes in test-positive proportion (ie, diagnostic yield) over time. Determining whether higher CTA use increases GIB detection or reflects potential overuse is essential for imaging stewardship.

This retrospective cohort study evaluated 7-year trends in CTA use for suspected acute GIB in the ED of a large academic medical center, quantified changes in test-positive proportion, and assessed shifts in patient and examination characteristics. These findings may inform evidence-based imaging criteria and promote judicious CTA use in the evaluation of acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Accuracy of CT angiography in the diagnosis of acute gastrointestinal bleeding: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114EUTMr]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) angiography in the evaluation of patients with an episode of acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate pooled accuracy indices. A bivariate random effects model was adjusted to obtain a summary receiver-operating characteristic (sROC) curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC).

Results

Twenty-two studies were included and provided data on 672 patients (range of age 5–74) with a mean age of 65 years. The overall sensitivity of CT angiography for detecting active acute GI haemorrhage was 85.2% (95% CI 75.5% to 91.5%). The overall specificity of CT angiography was 92.1% (95% CI 76.7% to 97.7%). The likelihood ratios for positive and negative test results were 10.8 (95% CI 3.4 to 34.4) and 0.16 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.27) respectively, with an AUC of 0.935 (95% CI 0.693 to 0.989). The sources of heterogeneity explored had no significant impact on diagnostic performance.

Conclusions

CT shows high diagnostic accuracy and is an excellent diagnostic tool for detection and localising of intestinal bleeding sites. It is highly available, provides fast detection and localisation of the bleeding site, and is minimally invasive.

Key Points

- CT angiography is increasingly used for investigating severe gastrointestinal bleeding.
- This systematic review and meta-analysis updates previous ones.
- In patients with massive gastrointestinal bleeding, CT angiography/MDCT detects bleeding accurately.
- CT angiography is useful in locating the bleeding site and determining appropriate treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^117WGKUp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting 36 to 48 per 100,000 persons annually. Aggressive resuscitation and upper endoscopy remain the cornerstones of therapy; however, in cases refractory to endoscopic diagnosis and management, radiology plays an increasingly vital and often lifesaving role, thanks to improvements in both imaging and interventional techniques. The various etiologies of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed along with specific management recommendations based on an extensive literature review of current radiographic methods.

### Severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage: summary of a national quality of care study with focus on radiological services [^115hx2xy]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Interventional Radiology Services for GI bleeding are limited in their on-site availability with only 26% of hospitals who admit GI bleeds having a 24/7 on-site service. Approximately, a half of hospitals have not made arrangements, in the form of formal networks, to compensate for this deficiency despite established national guidelines identifying the importance of IR in management algorithms. Peer review of case notes demonstrates IR is underused and often not considered, and CT has a much lower diagnostic rate that suggested by well-controlled clinical studies. Greater efforts are required to integrate IR into locally agreed management plans for upper and lower GI bleeding, preferably as part of a single integrated GI bleed unit.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^114uCCTu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) — diagnostic performance in acute gastrointestinal bleeding shows capability to detect low bleeding rates and good accuracy. CTA has been shown to be able to detect bleeding rates as slow as 0.3 ml/min compared with 0.5–1.0 ml/min for conventional angiography and 0.2 ml/min for 99mTc tagged RBC scintigraphy. A meta-analysis of 9 studies with 198 patients showed CTA had a pooled sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 85% in diagnosing acute GI bleeding throughout the GI tract. Other studies have shown sensitivities of 79–94% and specificity of 95–100% for detecting active bleeding throughout the GI tract. In a study of 113 consecutive patients with active GI bleeding, CTA was positive in 80/113 (70.8%), whereas negative studies were seen in 33 patients (29.2%); of the 33, 27 were not bleeding and 6 were bleeding at a rate of 0.3 ml/min or below.

SNMMI/ACNM gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy — localization and reporting: The report should include the "Location of any abnormal activity (quadrant of abdomen and pelvis, gastric, small bowel [duodenum, jejunum, or ileum], or large bowel [cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum])". If the bleeding site cannot be definitively localized, "giving an approximate site based on the imaging characteristics is appropriate", and when SPECT/CT is used "an attempt should be made to approximate the distance from the ampulla of Vater to the bleeding site". The text adds that "Any significant CT findings on the low dose CT should be reported", gastrointestinal hemorrhage "can occasionally be seen as increased attenuation within bowel on the low dose CT", and "the report should give the impression (whether the study was positive or negative for active gastrointestinal bleeding and, for a positive scan, the originating site of gastrointestinal bleeding, if known)".

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^112Xjm9Q]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Non-colonoscopy interventions for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: A surgical consultation should be requested in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding. In general, surgery for acute LGIB should be considered after other therapeutic options have failed and should take into consideration the extent and success of prior bleeding control measures, severity and source of bleeding, and the level of comorbid disease. It is important to very carefully localize the source of bleeding whenever possible before surgical resection to avoid continued or recurrent bleeding from an unresected culprit lesion (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Radiographic interventions should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding who have a negative upper endoscopy and do not respond adequately to hemodynamic resuscitation efforts and are therefore unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and urgent colonoscopy (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a diagnostic test is desired for localization of the bleeding site before angiography, CT angiography should be considered (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).
