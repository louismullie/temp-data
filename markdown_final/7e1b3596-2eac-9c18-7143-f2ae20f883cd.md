## Question

Tremfya bloodwork

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what bloodwork is needed for Tremfya (guselkumab), including baseline testing, on-treatment monitoring, and how the requirements differ by indication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled prerequisites and baseline evaluations. Then, I should verify indication-specific testing, especially liver enzymes and bilirubin. Next, I will review on-treatment monitoring intervals and triggers for additional labs. After that, I need to check immunogenicity and drug-level testing, even though they are not routinely required. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and note special populations and exceptions, anchoring everything to the label and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the universal baseline requirements. The FDA label instructs that all patients must be evaluated for tuberculosis prior to initiation, which in practice means a tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay, with chest imaging if indicated, and treatment of latent TB before starting Tremfya if detected, given documented cases of active TB in Crohn's trials and the mechanistic concern around IL-23 and mycobacterial immunity, even though large datasets show no signal for progression of latent TB with IL-23 inhibitors [^faf3b4bb] [^9670dc10] [^c2fc86ab].

> Wait, let me verify the indication-specific liver testing language, because I initially thought liver enzymes were universally required at baseline for everyone. Hold on, I should verify the exact wording. The label states that for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, liver enzymes and bilirubin should be obtained at baseline, for at least 16 weeks of treatment, and periodically thereafter, whereas for plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, baseline liver tests are recommended only if clinically indicated, with periodic checks thereafter if clinically indicated, so I need to correct my earlier assumption that all patients require baseline LFTs [^1cfa7bb2] [^faf3b4bb].

> I need to ensure I capture the rationale for stricter hepatotoxicity monitoring in IBD. The label includes a boxed warning about serious drug-induced liver injury in Crohn's disease, including a case with ALT 18× ULN, AST 11× ULN, and bilirubin 2.4× ULN, which explains the mandate for baseline, 16-week, and periodic LFTs in UC/CD, whereas psoriasis and PsA cohorts had lower and generally transient transaminase elevations without Hy's law cases, supporting a more selective approach in dermatologic indications [^1cfa7bb2] [^b72dcaaf] [^8d8cfbd4].

> Next, I should review on-treatment monitoring cadence. For UC and CD, I should confirm that LFTs are checked at baseline, again around 16 weeks, and then periodically according to routine management, with a low threshold to interrupt therapy and investigate if drug-induced liver injury is suspected, which aligns with the label's cautionary language and the observed hepatotoxicity signal in IBD [^1cfa7bb2]. For psoriasis and PsA, I should double-check that routine LFTs are not mandated; instead, tests are guided by symptoms, concomitant hepatotoxic drugs, or abnormal baselines, though some clinicians still obtain periodic LFTs as best practice, which is reasonable but not label-required [^faf3b4bb].

> Let me consider hematologic monitoring. I should confirm whether CBC or neutrophils are routinely required. The label does not mandate routine CBC monitoring, but phase 3 PsA trials reported transient grade 2–3 neutropenia in a minority of patients, generally resolving without intervention, so if clinically indicated or if infection risk is a concern, a baseline or periodic CBC is reasonable even if not universally required [^fdd303b2] [^8d8cfbd4]. Hold on, I should verify that no dose-related hematologic trends were seen; indeed, pooled analyses did not show clear dose-related hematologic toxicity, supporting selective rather than routine testing [^a35a7e21].

> I will now examine immunogenicity and therapeutic drug monitoring. Routine anti-drug antibody testing is not required; across indications, antidrug antibodies occur in roughly 2–18% depending on assay and population, with low rates of neutralizing antibodies and no consistent association with loss of efficacy or injection-site reactions, so immunogenicity testing should be reserved for suspected loss of response or unusual adverse events rather than routine monitoring [^495b9386] [^993650e2]. But wait, what if a patient loses response? In that scenario, measuring trough guselkumab and considering ADA testing can be reasonable, acknowledging that data linking levels to outcomes are exploratory and not yet practice-standard [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and exceptions. In patients with chronic HBV, case series suggest guselkumab can be used with antiviral prophylaxis and close LFT monitoring, given the risk of HBV reactivation with immunosuppression, even though the label does not provide specific HBV guidance, so I need to ensure individualized risk mitigation and shared decision-making in this setting [^804c2c1c]. For elderly patients, real-world cohorts show good tolerability with routine labs similar to younger adults, again supporting a symptom- and risk-guided approach rather than age-specific panels [^955d69cf].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. Universal baseline: TB screening for all. Indication-specific: obtain LFTs and bilirubin at baseline, Week 16, and periodically for UC/CD; consider baseline and periodic LFTs for psoriasis/PsA if clinically indicated or if using hepatotoxic concomitant medications. Ongoing: repeat LFTs if symptoms of hepatitis, jaundice, or dark urine occur, or if new hepatotoxic drugs are added; consider CBC if infection risk, cytopenia symptoms, or concomitant myelosuppressive therapy arise. Immunogenicity/drug levels: not routine; consider only with suspected secondary failure or atypical reactions [^faf3b4bb] [^1cfa7bb2] [^495b9386].

> Finally, I should confirm that my synthesis aligns with guideline-level sources and pivotal trials. The AAD-NPF biologics guidance emphasizes periodic clinical and laboratory safety assessments tailored to patient risk and concomitant therapies, which fits with a selective rather than blanket lab strategy for IL-23 inhibitors, and the long-term psoriasis safety pools through 5 years support the absence of new safety signals requiring additional routine labs beyond what the label already specifies [^98cfc53d] [^1edfe132]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while some clinicians prefer fixed-interval labs, the evidence base and regulatory labeling support a risk-adapted approach, with stricter hepatotoxicity monitoring in IBD and symptom-triggered testing in dermatologic indications [^faf3b4bb] [^1cfa7bb2].

Tremfya (guselkumab) **does not require routine bloodwork** for most patients [^notfound], but **baseline TB screening is essential** [^faf3b4bb] and liver enzymes should be checked at baseline and periodically in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease [^1cfa7bb2]. For plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, routine lab monitoring is not mandated; obtain liver enzymes and bilirubin only if clinically indicated [^faf3b4bb]. Monitor for infections during treatment and avoid live vaccines [^9670dc10] [^1cfa7bb2].

---

## Baseline laboratory evaluations

### Tuberculosis screening

All patients should have **latent TB screening** (TST or IGRA) [^faf3b4bb] before starting Tremfya; treat latent TB before initiation [^9670dc10].

---

### Liver function tests

For ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, obtain **baseline liver enzymes and bilirubin** [^faf3b4bb] and monitor periodically, especially during the first 16 weeks [^1cfa7bb2]. For plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, obtain baseline liver enzymes and bilirubin only if clinically indicated [^faf3b4bb].

---

### Complete blood count (CBC)

Routine CBC is **not required**; consider only if clinically indicated or if infection is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring during treatment

### Liver function tests

For ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, **monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin** at least every 16 weeks [^1cfa7bb2] and periodically thereafter. For plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin only if clinically indicated [^faf3b4bb].

---

### Infection surveillance

Monitor for **signs of infection** during treatment; serious infections occurred in ≤ 2% in UC/CD trials and ≤ 0.2% in psoriasis trials [^9670dc10]. If a serious infection occurs, discontinue Tremfya until resolved [^9670dc10].

---

## Special considerations

### Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies can develop but are **generally not associated** with loss of efficacy or increased adverse events [^495b9386] [^993650e2]. Routine antibody testing is not recommended [^notfound].

---

### Drug interactions

Guselkumab has **minimal CYP450 interactions**, but consider monitoring narrow therapeutic index drugs when starting therapy [^76ec8e66].

---

## Summary of recommended bloodwork

| **Indication** | **Baseline labs** | **Monitoring during treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| Plaque psoriasis | - TB screening <br/> - LFTs if indicated | - LFTs if indicated <br/> - Monitor for infections |
| Psoriatic arthritis | - TB screening <br/> - LFTs if indicated | - LFTs if indicated <br/> - Monitor for infections |
| Ulcerative colitis | - TB screening <br/> - LFTs and bilirubin | - LFTs and bilirubin every 16 weeks <br/> - Monitor for infections |
| Crohn's disease | - TB screening <br/> - LFTs and bilirubin | - LFTs and bilirubin every 16 weeks <br/> - Monitor for infections |

---

Tremfya generally **does not require routine bloodwork** [^notfound]; prioritize **TB screening** [^faf3b4bb] and **liver monitoring** in IBD [^1cfa7bb2], and monitor for infections during therapy [^9670dc10].

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

A serious adverse reaction of drug-induced liver injury was reported in a clinical trial subject with Crohn's disease following three doses of a higher than the recommended induction regimen. This subject had peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 18x the upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 11x ULN, and total bilirubin of 2.4x ULN. TREMFYA was subsequently discontinued, and the liver test abnormalities resolved following administration of corticosteroids [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

In patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, evaluate liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline, for at least 16 weeks of treatment, and periodically thereafter according to routine patient management.

In patients with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, if clinically indicated, evaluate liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline, and periodically thereafter according to routine patient management.

Consider other treatment options in patients with evidence of acute liver disease or cirrhosis. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. Interrupt treatment if drug-induced liver injury is suspected, until this diagnosis is excluded. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction.

5.5 Immunizations

Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with TREMFYA. Medications that interact with the immune system may increase the risk of infection following administration of live vaccines. Prior to initiating therapy with TREMFYA, complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. No data are available on the response to live or inactive vaccines.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with post market use of TREMFYA. Some cases required hospitalization. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue TREMFYA and initiate appropriate therapy.

5.2 Infections

TREMFYA may increase the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

In placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to 48 weeks in subjects with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, serious infections occurred in ≤ 2% of subjects who received TREMFYA. In the 16-week placebo-controlled trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the rate of serious infections for the TREMFYA group and the placebo group was ≤ 0.2%. A similar rate of serious infections was seen in placebo-controlled trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. The overall rates of infections were similar between subjects in the TREMFYA groups and subjects in the placebo groups in clinical trials for all indicated populations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

Treatment with TREMFYA should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing TREMFYA. Instruct patients to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue TREMFYA until the infection resolves.

5.3 Tuberculosis

Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating TREMFYA treatment. Do not administer TREMFYA to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering TREMFYA. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating TREMFYA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after TREMFYA treatment.

In clinical trials, 105 subjects with plaque psoriasis, 71 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 43 subjects with ulcerative colitis, and 36 subjects with Crohn's disease with latent TB who were concurrently treated with TREMFYA, and appropriate TB prophylaxis did not develop active TB. In clinical trials of TREMFYA in subjects with Crohn's disease, active TB was reported in 2 subjects during treatment with TREMFYA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling:

Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Tuberculosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in Adults with Plaque Psoriasis

In clinical trials, a total of 1823 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis received TREMFYA. Of these, 1393 subjects were exposed to TREMFYA for at least 6 months and 728 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year.

Data from two placebo- and active-controlled trials (PsO1 and PsO2) in 1441 subjects (mean age 44 years; 70% males; 82% white) were pooled to evaluate the safety of TREMFYA (100 mg administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by every 8 weeks).

Weeks 0 to 16:

In the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the pooled clinical trials (PsO1 and PsO2), adverse events occurred in 49% of subjects in the TREMFYA group compared to 47% of subjects in the placebo group and 49% of subjects in the U.S. licensed adalimumab group. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.9% of subjects in the TREMFYA group (6.3 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up) compared to 1.4% of subjects in the placebo group (4.7 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up), and in 2.6% of subjects in U.S. licensed adalimumab group (9.9 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up).

Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the TREMFYA group than in the placebo group during the 16-week placebo-controlled period.

Adverse reactions that occurred in < 1% but > 0.1% of subjects in the TREMFYA group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 16 in trials PsO1 and PsO2 were migraine, candida infections, and urticaria.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 CYP450 Substrates

The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, interferon) during chronic inflammation.

Results from an exploratory drug-drug interaction trial in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis suggested a low potential for clinically relevant drug interactions for drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 but the interaction potential cannot be ruled out for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. However, the results were highly variable because of the limited number of subjects in the trial.

Upon initiation of TREMFYA in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and consider dosage adjustment as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Ulcerative Colitis

Up to Week 56 in trials UC1, UC2 and UC3, 11% (48/435) of adult subjects treated with TREMFYA at the recommended dosages developed antidrug antibodies. Of these subjects who tested positive for anti-guselkumab antibodies and were evaluable for neutralizing antibodies, 16% (6/38) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. Two subjects with the highest antibody titers exhibited low trough levels of guselkumab. Up to Week 24 in UC4, 9% (24/279) of subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies. Of the subjects who tested positive for anti-guselkumab antibodies and were evaluable for neutralizing antibodies 13% (2/16) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. There was no identified clinically significant effect of antidrug antibodies on injection site reactions, or effectiveness of guselkumab, over the treatment duration of 56 weeks (trials UC1, UC2 and UC3) or 24 weeks (trial UC4).

Crohn's Disease

Up to Week 48 in trials CD1, CD2, and CD4; 5% (30/634) of adult subjects treated with a recommended dosage of TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies. Of the subjects who tested positive for anti-guselkumab antibodies and were evaluable for neutralizing antibodies, 5% (1/22) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. Up to Week 48 in CD3, 9% (24/273) of subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies. Of the subjects who tested positive for anti-guselkumab antibodies and were evaluable for neutralizing antibodies, none had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. There were no identified clinically significant effects of antidrug antibodies on pharmacokinetics, injection site reactions, or effectiveness of guselkumab, over the treatment duration of 48 weeks.

Plaque Psoriasis

Adult Subjects

Up to Week 52, approximately 6% of adult subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies. Of the subjects who developed antidrug antibodies, approximately 7% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. Among the 46 subjects who developed antibodies to guselkumab and had evaluable data, 21 subjects exhibited lower trough levels of guselkumab, including one subjects who experienced loss of efficacy after developing high antibody titers. Up to Week 156, approximately 9% of subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies and of these subjects approximately 6% were classified as neutralizing antibodies. However, antibodies to guselkumab were generally not associated with changes in clinical response or development of injection-site reactions.

Pediatric Subjects

Up to Week 44, 18% (n=21/114) of pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older treated with TREMFYA developed anti-drug antibodies, none of the anti-drug antibodies were classified as neutralizing. The development of antibodies to guselkumab did not impact the pharmacokinetics of guselkumab and was not associated with changes in clinical response or development of injection-site reactions. However, the small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab limits definitive conclusions.

Psoriatic Arthritis

Up to Week 24, 2% (n=15) of adult subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies. Of these subjects, 1 had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. Overall, the small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab limits definitive conclusion of the effect of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of guselkumab.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Guselkumab is a human monoclonal IgG1λ antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23 (IL-23) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Guselkumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In evaluated adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, guselkumab reduced serum levels of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 relative to pre-treatment levels based on exploratory analyses of the pharmacodynamic markers.

In evaluated adult subjects with active psoriatic arthritis, serum levels of acute phase proteins C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and IL-6, and Th17 effector cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were elevated at baseline. Serum levels of these proteins measured at Week 4 and Week 24 were decreased compared to baseline following guselkumab treatment at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter.

The relationship between these pharmacodynamic markers and the mechanism(s) by which guselkumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Guselkumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics in healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous injections. In subjects with plaque psoriasis, following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of TREMFYA at Weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 1.2 mcg/mL.

The pharmacokinetics of guselkumab in adult subjects with psoriatic arthritis was similar to that in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of TREMFYA at Weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 1.2 mcg/mL.

Following subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 100 mg TREMFYA every 8 weeks or 200 mg TREMFYA every 4 weeks in adult subjects with ulcerative colitis, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations were approximately 1.4 mcg/mL and 10.7 mcg/mL, respectively.

Following subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 100 mg TREMFYA every 8 weeks, or 200 mg TREMFYA every 4 weeks, in adult subjects with Crohn's disease mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations were approximately 1.2 mcg/mL and 10.1 mcg/mL, respectively.

Fatigue Response

In trial UC1, subjects treated with TREMFYA experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in fatigue, assessed by the PROMIS-Fatigue Short form 7a, at Week 12, compared to placebo-treated subjects. The effect of TREMFYA to improve fatigue after 12 weeks of induction has not been established.

Maintenance Trial: UC2

The maintenance trial (UC2) evaluated 568 subjects who received one of two intravenous TREMFYA induction regimens, including the recommended 200 mg regimen, for 12 weeks in trials UC1 or UC3 (induction dose-finding study) and demonstrated clinical response per mMS after 12 weeks. Subjects were re-randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks, TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo for up to an additional 44 weeks.

In trial UC2, 42% of subjects had failed (inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance) treatment with one or more biologics or JAK inhibitors.

The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 44 defined by mMS. Secondary endpoints included corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, all at Week 44 and maintenance of clinical remission at Week 44 in subjects who achieved clinical remission 12 weeks after intravenous TREMFYA induction treatment (see Table 12).

Trial UC2 was not designed to evaluate the relationship of histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement at Week 44 to disease progression and long-term outcomes.

Endoscopic Assessment

Normalization of the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa (endoscopic remission) was defined as ES of 0. In UC2, greater proportions of subjects treated with TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks or TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks achieved endoscopic remission at Week 44 compared to placebo-treated subjects (35% and 34%, respectively, vs. 15%).

Trials UC1, UC2 and UC3

In the induction trials (UC1 and UC3), 522 subjects received at least one dose of the TREMFYA intravenous induction regimen (i.e., 200 mg at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8). Clinical response was defined as a decrease in modified Mayo score (mMS) of ≥30% and ≥2 points from baseline with either a ≥1 decrease from baseline in rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) or RBS of 0 or 1. In the maintenance trial (UC2), subjects who achieved clinical response after 12 weeks of TREMFYA intravenous induction treatment were randomized and received either TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 4 of trial UC2) or TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 0 of trial UC2), by subcutaneous (SC) injection for up to an additional 44 weeks.

Respiratory tract infections occurred in ≥2% of subjects treated with TREMFYA and at a higher rate than placebo (8.8% TREMFYA-treated subjects vs. 7.3% placebo-treated subjects) through Week 12 in the induction trials (UC1 and UC3). Respiratory tract infections included COVID-19, influenza, nasopharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and viral respiratory tract infection.

Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥3% of subjects treated with TREMFYA and at a higher rate than placebo through Week 44 in the maintenance trial (UC2) are shown in Table 2.

Trial UC4

In trial UC4, 418 subjects were enrolled, of whom 279 subjects were randomized to receive TREMFYA. Randomization was 1:1:1 to subcutaneous TREMFYA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by subcutaneous TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 16) for up to an additional 8 weeks (from Week 16 through Week 24); subcutaneous TREMFYA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by subcutaneous TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 12 for up to an additional 12 weeks (from Week 12 through Week 24); or placebo.

Adverse reactions reported in trial UC4 through Week 24 in ≥3% of subjects treated with either subcutaneous TREMFYA dosing regimen and at a higher rate than placebo are shown in Table 3.

Maintenance and Durability of Response

To evaluate maintenance and durability of response (trial PsO2), subjects randomized to TREMFYA at Week 0 and who were PASI 90 responders at Week 28 were re-randomized to either continue treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks or be withdrawn from therapy (i.e., receive placebo).

At Week 48, 89% of subjects who continued on TREMFYA maintained PASI 90 compared to 37% of subjects who were re-randomized to placebo and withdrawn from TREMFYA. For responders at Week 28 who were re-randomized to placebo and withdrawn from TREMFYA, the median time to loss of PASI 90 was approximately 15 weeks.

Patient Reported Outcomes

Greater improvements in symptoms of psoriasis (itch, pain, stinging, burning and skin tightness) at Week 16 in TREMFYA compared to placebo were observed in both trials based on the Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD). Greater proportions of subjects on TREMFYA compared to U.S. licensed adalimumab achieved a PSSD symptom score of 0 (symptom-free) at Week 24 in both trials.

Trial PsO3

Trial PsO3 [NCT02203032] evaluated the efficacy of 24 weeks of treatment with TREMFYA in subjects (N=268) who had not achieved an adequate response, defined as IGA ≥2 at Week 16 after initial treatment with U.S. licensed ustekinumab (dosed 45 mg or 90 mg according to the subject's baseline weight at Week 0 and Week 4). These subjects were randomized to either continue with U.S. licensed ustekinumab treatment every 12 weeks or switch to TREMFYA 100 mg at Weeks 16, 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Baseline characteristics for randomized subjects were similar to those observed in PsO1 and PsO2.

In subjects with an inadequate response (IGA ≥2 at Week 16 to U.S. licensed ustekinumab), greater proportions of subjects on TREMFYA compared to U.S. licensed ustekinumab achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 with a ≥2 grade improvement at Week 28 (31% vs. 14%, respectively; 12 weeks after randomization).

### Guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis in Japanese patients: efficacy and safety results from a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^b0def92e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Safety assessments included treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAE) and laboratory evaluations through week 52. Antibodies to guselkumab in serum were detected using a validated, specific, sensitive and drug‐tolerant electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method using the Meso Scale Discovery platform (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) that incorporates an acid dissociation step to improve detection of antibodies to guselkumab in the presence of excess guselkumab.

Statistical analysis

The randomized analysis set included all randomized patients for efficacy analyses, and data were analyzed by treatment groups. The co‐primary end‐points were assessed in a multiplicity‐adjusted, fixed‐sequence testing procedure. Except for PsA, binary efficacy end‐points at week 16 (e.g. co‐primary end‐points) were analyzed using Fisher's exact test; continuous efficacy end‐points at week 16 were evaluated usingwith treatment as a factor and baseline as a covariate; categorical efficacy end‐points at week 16 with two or more levels were analyzed using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. Based on the previous phase 2 study, 16 a sample size of 180 patients (n = 60 per group) was estimated to provide 98% or more power to detect significant differences between guselkumab and placebo treatments in the co‐primary end‐points. All statistical tests were two‐sided (α = 0.05).

Patients who discontinued the study drug because of lack of efficacy, a TEAE of worsening psoriasis or starting a protocol‐prohibited psoriasis treatment were considered non‐responders for binary end‐points or had baseline values carried forward for continuous end‐points. Last observation was carried forward for other patients with missing data. Safety analyses included all patients receiving one or more study drug administration and were summarized by actual treatment received.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^89703178]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Following achievement of early and complete clearance of psoriasis, guselkumab dosing at an extended every 16 weeks interval was noninferior to every 8 weeks dosing for maintaining disease control. Patient-reported outcomes and findings for key immunologic parameters support the clinical observations. Data from the GUIDE trial add new insights into the concepts of disease modification and long-term maintenance of efficacy. Future analyses from the GUIDE trial will assess the association between clinical response and biomarker and pharmacokinetic data, and further evaluate maintenance of long-term response after treatment withdrawal.

2.5 Preparation and Administration Instructions for Subcutaneous Injection

TREMFYA is available for subcutaneous use in the following presentations: prefilled pen (TREMFYA PEN), One-Press injector, and prefilled syringes [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)] .

Each prefilled pen, One-Press injector, or prefilled syringe is for one time use in one patient only. Instruct patients to inject the full amount: 100 mg or 200 mg of TREMFYA (1 mL or 2 mL, respectively).
TREMFYA is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare professional. After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique: Adults Pediatric Patients 6 Years of Age and Older Who Also Weigh at Least 40 kg
Adults may self-inject with the TREMFYA prefilled syringe, One-Press injector, and prefilled pen.
Inject into the front of the thighs, the lower abdomen except for the 2 inches around the navel, or the back of the upper arms (healthcare professional or caregiver only).
Pediatric self-administration is not recommended. Administration of TREMFYA to pediatric patients with the prefilled syringe, One-Press injector and prefilled pen should be performed by a healthcare provider or by a caregiver who has received training and demonstrated proper subcutaneous injection technique.
Inject into the front of the thighs or the lower abdomen except for the 2 inches around the navel. For the prefilled syringe only, injection can also be given in the back of the upper arms.
Before injection, remove TREMFYA from the refrigerator and allow to reach room temperature up to 25 °C (77 °F) (30 minutes) without removing the needle cap.
Do not inject TREMFYA into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, or affected by psoriasis [see Instructions for Use].
The TREMFYA Instructions for Use contains more detailed patient instructions on the preparation and administration of TREMFYA [see Instructions for Use] .
If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time.
Inspect TREMFYA visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. TREMFYA is a clear and colorless to light yellow solution that may contain small translucent particles. Do not use if the liquid contains large particles, is discolored or cloudy. TREMFYA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the prefilled pen, One-Press injector, or prefilled syringe.

### Real world practice indirect comparison between guselkumab and risankizumab: results from an Italian retrospective study [^d745aa1d]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

An Italian single‐center retrospective cohort study enrolling moderate‐to‐severe patients attending the Psoriasis Care Center of the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy from 1 − September‐2018 and 31‐December‐2020, was performed to indirectly compare guselkumab and risankizumab efficacy and safety. Inclusion criteria were: (i) moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis diagnosed since at least 1 year; (ii) subjects starting guselkumab or risankizumab treatments and being treated for at least 12 weeks. Patients were treated with standard dose of guselkumab (100 mg sc administered by subcutaneous injection at Week 0 and Week 4, followed by a maintenance dose every 8 weeks) or with standard dose of risankizumab (two injections of 75 mg subcutaneously at Week 0, Week 4, and then every 12 weeks). At baseline, the following items were registered for each patient: (i) personal and demographic data; (ii) duration of psoriasis and eventual psoriatic arthritis (PsA); (iii) comorbidities; (iv) previous psoriasis systemic treatments; (v) Psoriasis severity using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Body Surface Area (BSA), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores. At every follow‐up the following items were evaluated: psoriasis severity (PASI, BSA and DLQI), routine blood tests [blood count with formula, transaminases, creatinine, azotaemia, glycaemia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels protein electrophoresis], and adverse events (AEs). Safety was assessed by treatment‐emergent AEs, physical examinations and laboratory monitoring. Effectiveness data were analyzed using a last observation carried forward method, where if a patient dropped out of the study the last available value was ‘carried forward’ until the end of the treatment. The present study was performed respecting the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.1 Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were displayed as mean ± SD, whereas categorical variables or as number and proportion of patients. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample were described through absolute and relative frequencies (%), means and/or SDs where appropriate. T ‐test and Chi‐squared test were used to compare the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the populations treated with the two different drugs. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad‐Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA).

### Long-term efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, through two Years: results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^f1f271e8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A total of 727 patients received ≥1 administration of guselkumab and had available serum samples through week 112. Fifty‐three guselkumab‐treated patients (7.3%) tested positive for antibodies to guselkumab; of these, 3 (5.7%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies. Among 22 guselkumab‐randomized patients who tested positive for antibodies through week 100 and had ACR evaluations at week 100, 18 (81.8%) achieved ACR20 response and 12 (54.5%) achieved ACR50 response. Median steady‐state trough guselkumab concentrations were maintained from week 52 to week 100, with both the every‐4‐weeks regimen (4.53 to 3.86 μg/ml) and every‐8‐weeks regimen (1.15 to 0.97 μg/ml).

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an interleukin-23p19-specific monoclonal antibody, through one year in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis [^b72dcaaf]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Through week 52, elevated ALT and/or AST concentrations of NCI CTCAE grade 2 or higher (>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) occurred in 7.4% and 6.6%, respectively, of 243 patients receiving guselkumab every 4 weeks from week 0 and 2.0% and 3.2%, respectively, of 247 patients receiving guselkumab every 8 weeks from week 0. No additional grade 3 ALT or AST values (>5–20 times the ULN), which were uncommon during weeks 0–24 (1.4% and 1.2%, respectively, of 493 guselkumab‐randomized patients), occurred after week 24. No grade 4 ALT or AST values (>20 times the ULN) occurred through week 52 (Supplementary Table 4). No instance of elevated liver function test findings satisfied the criteria for Hy’s Law (total bilirubin >2 times the ULN and ALT or AST ≥3 times the ULN) among guselkumab‐treated patients. Most abnormal findings were transient, resolved, and did not require discontinuation of study agent. As exceptions and as reported previously, 2 patients randomized to receive guselkumab every 4 weeks discontinued guselkumab prior to week 24 (1 each with acute hepatitis B and isoniazid‐induced liver injury). Another patient, in the guselkumab every 4 weeks group, had an extended interruption of treatment before week 24 (owing to physician concerns surrounding alcohol use, hepatic steatosis, and chronic cholecystitis with persistently elevated transaminase levels [AST dominant]). One patient who switched from placebo to guselkumab every 4 weeks, with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, had a grade 1 ALT elevation (>1–3 times the ULN) at week 52 and discontinued guselkumab after week 52.

### Guselkumab, a human interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody in Japanese patients with generalized pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis: efficacy and safety analyses of a 52-week, phase 3, multicenter, open-label study [^6a9134bb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Efficacy end‐points

The primary efficacy end‐point was the proportion of patients achieving treatment success, defined as a CGI score of “very much improved”, “much improved” or “minimally improved” at week 16. The CGI score is defined as 1 = “very much improved”, 2 = “much improved”, 3 = “minimally improved”, 4 = “no change”, 5 = “minimally worse”, 6 = “much worse” and 7 = “very much worse” since the initiation of treatment (Table S1). 20 In the present study, CGI scores of “minimally worse”, “much worse” and “very much worse” are combined into “worsened”.

The secondary efficacy end‐points were assessed through week 52 and were as follows: proportion of patients achieving treatment success over time; change from baseline in JDA severity index total score (0 [best] to 17 [worst]) and component score (skin symptoms and systemic symptoms/laboratory findings) for patients with GPP; change from baseline in BSA involvement for patients with EP; the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of cleared or minimal (0/1); percentage improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI); change from baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 21 and percentage of patients achieving DLQI 0/1 among those with a baseline DLQI score of more than 1; percentage of patients with a reduction of 5 points or more in the DLQI; and change from baseline in the Physical Component Scores (PCS), Mental Component Scores (MCS) of the 36‐item Short‐Form Health Assessment Questionnaire (SF‐36). 22

Safety assessments

Safety assessments included treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAE), including injection site and allergic reactions, serious TEAE, electrocardiograms, vital signs, physical examinations, concomitant medications reviews and tuberculosis testing. Determination of the toxicity grade of clinical laboratory parameters was based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading. The presence of antibodies to guselkumab in serum was evaluated using a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform.

### Guselkumab, an inhibitor of the IL-23p19 subunit, provides sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis: 1 year results of a phase III randomised study of patients who were biologic-naïve or TNF α inhibitor-experienced [^ad848923]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Through Week60, ISRs occurred in four (3%), two (2%) and two (2%) patients in the guselkumab Q4W, guselkumab Q8W and PBO→Q4W groups, respectively. All ISRs were mild; none required study agent discontinuation. No anaphylactic, serum sickness or serum sickness-like reaction was reported.

Relatively few patients had clinically meaningful postbaseline abnormalities in laboratory values through Week60 (online supplemental table S1). For neutrophil, leucocyte and platelet counts, no further mean decreases after Week24 and no dose-related trends were observed through 1 year of guselkumab. NCI-CTCAE grade ≥2 decreased neutrophil counts generally (see online supplemental table S1 for exceptions) were not associated with infections, resolved spontaneously without treatment and did not necessitate study agent discontinuation. With one exception (see online supplemental table S1), NCI-CTCAE grade ≥2 elevations in ALT or AST concentrations in guselkumab-treated patients were not associated with total bilirubin elevations. No elevation satisfied the criteria for Hy’s Law (total bilirubin >2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and either ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN) in guselkumab-treated patients through Week60. The majority of ALT and AST elevations were transient, resolved and did not require study agent discontinuation. Among patients with baseline values at or below the ULN, ALT and AST concentrations increased to above the ULN in 32% (64/200) and 27% (54/200), respectively, of guselkumab-treated patients receiving methotrexate and in 26% (43/167) and 24% (40/166), respectively, of those not receiving methotrexate, at baseline. Total bilirubin increases in guselkumab-treated patients were NCI-CTCAE grade ≤2, not associated with direct bilirubin elevation, and generally <2 × ULN (see online supplemental table S1 for exceptions).

In guselkumab-treated TNFi-naïve (n=258) and TNFi-experienced (n=111) patients, 62% and 64%, respectively, reported ≥1 AE, 3% and 6% had SAEs, 0.4% and 3% had serious infections, 3% and 2% had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation, 7% and 4% had AEs of increased ALT levels, and 7% and 3% had AEs of increased AST levels through Week60.

### Guselkumab-treated patients with plaque psoriasis who achieved complete skin clearance for ≥ 156 consecutive weeks: a post-hoc analysis from the VOYAGE 1 clinical trial [^23a76f5d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, Week 4 guselkumab plasma concentration (Week 4 of the study for those in the guselkumab arm of the study and Week 20 of the study for those in the placebo crossover arm) was also included in the regression model. Guselkumab plasma trough concentrations in both response groups were assessed prior to treatment between Weeks 4 and 156 after the start of guselkumab treatment. Plasma levels at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24 were measured 4 weeks after guselkumab treatment; plasma levels at Week 12 and every 8 weeks until Week 156 were measured 8 weeks after guselkumab treatment.

The odds ratios obtained from multiple logistic regression analysis indicate the level of association between each given factor and maintaining a PASI score of 0, with the Wald test to ascertain confidence intervals; p values of ≤ 0.05 indicated a statistically significant association, and p values of ≤ 0.1 identified potential parameters of interest. PASI scores over time, and time to achieving PASI = 0, were also reported. Data from patients assigned to either response group were analyzed as observed, without further imputation.

### Safety of guselkumab with and without prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor treatment: pooled results across 4 studies in patients with psoriatic arthritis [^7c44e661]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Assess pooled safety results through the end of the phase II/III studies of guselkumab (GUS; ≤ 2 years) in tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi)-naïve and -experienced patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

Methods

Data were pooled from the Phase 2 and DISCOVER-1 (both TNFi-naïve and -experienced), DISCOVER-2 (TNFi-naïve), and COSMOS (TNFi-experienced) studies. Patients with active PsA were randomized to GUS 100 mg every 4 or 8 weeks (Q4W + Q8W = Combined GUS) or placebo (PBO) with crossover to GUS Q4W or Q8W at week 24. Time-adjusted adverse event (AE) rates (events/100 patient-years [PY]) and clinical laboratory findings were assessed during the PBO-controlled period and through end of study (≤ 2 years).

Results

Of 1554 randomized patients (n = 373 [GUS Q4W], 664 [GUS Q8W], and 517 [PBO]), 1138 (73.23%) were TNFi-naïve and 416 (26.77%) were TNFi-experienced. Respective AE rates through week 24 were 220.8/100 PY (TNFi-naïve) and 251.6/100 PY (TNFi-experienced) in the Combined GUS group and 196.1/100 PY (TNFi-naïve) and 303.0/100 PY (TNFi-experienced) in the PBO group. Among all GUS-treated patients (including those who crossed over from PBO), low AE rates were maintained during long-term evaluation in both TNFi-naïve (139.7/100 PY) and TNFi-experienced (174.0/100 PY) patients. Rates/100 PY of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, serious AEs, and other AEs of interest, as well as occurrence of elevated hepatic transaminase levels and decreased neutrophil counts were consistent between PBO and GUS-treated patients through week 24 regardless of prior TNFi use and remained low through the end of the studies.

Conclusion

The safety profile of GUS in TNFi-experienced patients was consistent with that in TNFi-naïve patients, which remained favorable for up to 2 years. [ClinicalTrials.gov: Phase 2 (NCT02319759), DISCOVER-1 (NCT03162796), DISCOVER-2 (NCT03158285), and COSMOS (NCT03796858)].

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an interleukin-23p19-specific monoclonal antibody, through one year in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis [^47da761e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Increased ALT and AST concentrations occurred in 26% and 25%, respectively, of 436 guselkumab‐treated patients receiving methotrexate, and in 24% and 20%, respectively, of 292 such patients not receiving methotrexate, at baseline.

Total bilirubin elevations in guselkumab‐treated patients were either grade 1 (>1–1.5 times the ULN; 5% of all guselkumab‐treated patients) or grade 2 (>1.5–3 times the ULN; 1% of all guselkumab‐treated patients) (Supplementary Table 4). All such elevations were <2 times the ULN and not associated with direct bilirubin elevation.

### Guselkumab induces robust reduction in acute phase proteins and type 17 effector cytokines in active psoriatic arthritis: results from phase 3 trials [^d51dc4f3]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

A limitation of this study is that peripheral serum biomarkers may not accurately reflect the situation in the skin or musculoskeletal tissues. Although tissue assays would provide more detailed pathogenetic information, these procedures are invasive and would not be feasible for the numbers of participants reported here. Furthermore, in order for a biomarker to be of use in clinical practice, it needs to be easy to obtain on repeated occasions. An additional limitation is that the data reported here is from phase III studies, which required participants to have highly active PsA for inclusion, and thus may not reflect the wider PsA population, although patients receiving biologic therapies in most clinical settings have active disease.Data presented here are of relatively short follow-up but do have the advantage of a 24-week placebo-controlled period, which would not be available in observational studies. These data are from single intervention studies, and head-to-head and observational studies are required to evaluate these biomarkers with other agents targeting the IL-23/Th17 and other pathways to better understand their relevance.

In conclusion, inhibition of IL-23 p19 with guselkumab led to a high reduction of Th17 effector cytokine levels to the range seen in healthy controls and greater than the reduction seen with IL-12/IL-23 p40 inhibition with ustekinumab. While IL-17A and IL-17F levels correlated with disease activity and response to therapy in cutaneous psoriasis in PsA, these levels were not associated with disease activity or response to therapy in the joints in PsA, suggesting that local and/or other systemic factors also play a role in the musculoskeletal disease.

Clinical Response

In both trials, subjects treated with TREMFYA 100 mg q8w demonstrated a greater clinical response including ACR20, compared to placebo at Week 24 (Tables 8 and 9). Similar responses were seen regardless of prior anti-TNFα exposure in PsA1, and in both trials similar responses were seen regardless of concomitant cDMARD use, previous treatment with cDMARDs, gender and body weight.

The percentage of subjects achieving ACR20 response in PsA2 by visit is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Percentage of Adult Subjects with Active Psoriatic Arthritis Achieving ACR 20 Response by Visit Through Week 24 in Trial PsA2

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria are shown in Table 10.

Treatment with TREMFYA resulted in an improvement in the skin manifestations of psoriasis in subjects with PsA.

Treatment with TREMFYA resulted in improvement in dactylitis and enthesitis in subjects with pre-existing dactylitis or enthesitis.

Physical Function

TREMFYA treated subjects in the TREMFYA 100 mg q8w group in both trials PsA1 and PsA2 showed greater mean improvement from baseline in physical function compared to subjects treated with placebo as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Weeks 16 and 24. In both trials, the proportion of HAQ-DI responders (≥0.35 improvement in HAQ-DI score) was greater in the TREMFYA q8w dose group compared to placebo at Weeks 16 and 24.

Other Health-Related Outcomes

General health status was assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36). At Week 24, subjects in the TREMFYA 100 mg q8w dose group in both trials PsA1 and PsA2 showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) compared with placebo. There was not a statistically significant improvement observed in the SF-36 MCS. At Week 24, there was numerical improvement in the physical functioning, role-physical, bodily-pain, general health, social-functioning and vitality domains but not in the role-emotional and mental health domains. Fatigue was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score (FACIT-F) in trials PsA1 and PsA2. Treatment with TREMFYA resulted in improvement in fatigue as measured by FACIT-F.

### Safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated through 100 weeks: a pooled analysis from the randomized VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 studies [^fbee1c06]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term evaluation is required to confirm the safety profile of newer biologic agents.

Objectives

To report on pooled safety data from the ongoing VOYAGE 1 (NCT02207231) and VOYAGE 2 (NCT02207244) trials through 100 weeks of follow-up.

Methods

Patients were randomized to either guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter; placebo at weeks 0, 4, 12 followed by guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 16 and 20 and every 8 weeks thereafter; or adalimumab 80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at week 1, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. Patients who received adalimumab crossed over to guselkumab at week 52 (VOYAGE 1) and at/after week 28 based on clinical response (VOYAGE 2). Open-label extensions, in which all patients received guselkumab, started at week 52 (VOYAGE 1) and week 76 (VOYAGE 2). Rates of adverse events (AEs) per 100 patient-years (PYs) are presented through 100 weeks of follow-up.

Results

Through week 52, observed rates for guselkumab- and adalimumab-treated patients, respectively, were 262·45 per 100 PYs and 328·28 per 100 PYs for AEs, 6·20 per 100 PYs and 7·77 per 100 PYs for serious AEs (SAEs), 1·22 per 100 PYs and 1·79 per 100 PYs for serious infections (SIs), 0·28 per 100 PYs and 0·40 per 100 PYs for malignancies other than nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), 0·56 per 100 PYs and 0·40 per 100 PYs for NMSCs, and 0·47 per 100 PYs and 0·40 per 100 PYs for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Rates among patients treated with guselkumab through week 52 and week 100, respectively, were 262·45 per 100 PYs and 210·41 per 100 PYs for AEs, 6·20 and 6·29 per 100 PYs, for SAEs, 1·22 per 100 PYs and 1·06 per 100 PYs for SIs, 0·28 per 100 PYs and 0·38 per 100 PYs for malignancies, 0·56 per 100 PYs and 0·39 per 100 PYs for NMSCs, and 0·47 per 100 PYs and 0·38 per 100 PYs for MACEs. Among patients treated with adalimumab, rates of AEs, SAEs, SIs, malignancies, NMSCs, and MACEs showed some variability before and after crossover to guselkumab, although no new safety signals were noted after crossover.

Conclusions

The safety profile for guselkumab remains favourable through 100 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

TABLE 1 
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics

Major comorbidities reported for study patients are presented in Table 2. Overall, 53.5% of patients had one or more comorbidity, including hypertension (20.9%), diabetes (10.9%), hyperuricemia (5.6%), dyslipidemia (4.9%), and hyperlipidemia (4.6%). Among six patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), five had HBV‐DNA levels below the limit of quantification (one patient was untested) and one had received a DNA analog before starting GUS because of a positive hepatitis B antigen test. No patient had active tuberculosis (TB). Regarding latent TB, among 324 patients who underwent either a tuberculin reaction test or an interferon‐γ release test, eight patients were found to be positive for the tuberculin test, while six tested positive for the interferon‐γ release test. In addition, five patients in each group had received prophylactic anti‐TB drugs. Among the 239 patients for whom chest computed tomography scans were performed, no evidence of current or past TB infection was found.

Background

Long-term maintenance treatment is required for patients with psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis through 3 years of treatment.

Methods

In 2 ongoing, phase 3 trials of guselkumab (VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2), the proportions of patients achieving at least 90% and 100% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90 and PASI 100, respectively) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores of 0/1 and 0 were summarized for the guselkumab group (including placebo-to-guselkumab crossover). Patients who met treatment failure rules were considered nonresponders. Safety outcomes (rates/100 patient-years [PY]) were evaluated based on data pooled across studies through week 156.

Results

Three-year response rates for the guselkumab group in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2, respectively, were 82.8% and 77.2% for PASI 90, 50.8% and 48.8% for PASI 100, 82.1% and 83.0% for IGA score of 0/1, and 53.1% and 52.9% for IGA score of 0. Safety event rates across studies occurred through week 156 as follows: serious adverse events, 5.68/100 PY; serious infections, 1.15/100 PY; nonmelanoma skin cancers, 0.28/100 PY; malignancies other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, 0.47/100 PY; and major adverse cardiovascular events, 0.28/100 PY. Week 156 and week 100 rates were consistent.

Limitations

There was no comparator arm beyond 1 year.

Conclusions

Guselkumab shows durable efficacy and a consistent safety profile in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated for up to 3 years.

### Anti-interleukin-23 for psoriasis in elderly patients: guselkumab, risankizumab and tildrakizumab in real-world practice [^955d69cf]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Naples Federico II (Naples, Italy), and performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed an informed consent before starting the study, and gave consent to publication of case details and images, where applicable.

Study design

This was a single‐centre retrospective study performed in Italy, which enrolled patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who attended the Psoriasis Care Center, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy during the period October 2018 to March 2021.

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were: (i) moderate to severe plaque‐psoriasis diagnosis since at least 1 year; (ii) patients aged ≥ 65 years; (iii) patients starting treatment with guselkumab, risankizumab or tildrakizumab; and (iv) treatment period of at least 44 weeks for risankisumab, 40 weeks for guselkumab and 28 weeks for tildrakizumab (owing to its more recent availability in Italy).

Data collection

At baseline, the following items were registered for each patient: (i) personal and demographic data; (ii) duration of psoriasis and any eventual psoriatic arthritis (PsA); (iii) comorbidities; (iv) previous systemic treatments for psoriasis; and (v) psoriasis severity as measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and body surface area (BSA) tools.

At every follow‐up, psoriasis severity (PASI and BSA), routine blood tests [complete blood count, transaminases, creatinine, azotaemia, glycaemia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C‐reactive protein, levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, protein electrophoresis] and AEs were evaluated. Safety was assessed by treatment‐emergent AEs, physical examination and laboratory monitoring.

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean ± SD (for continuous variables) or as number and percentage of patients (for categorical variables). The significance of differences in mean values obtained at the different time points of treatment was assessed by the unpaired Student t ‐test, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0; GraphPad Software Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA).

### Guselkumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in the improvement of response until week 48, a real-life study [^69a3570c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)–interleukin 23(IL‐23)‐IL17 axis is the basis of the pathophysiology of psoriasis. Anti‐IL‐23 drugs, the most recently introduced group, act upstream of the inflammatory cascade, where this interleukin stimulates and maintains the activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells whose products (IL‐17 and IL‐22) create a feedforward mechanism.

Guselkumab is the first biologic drug available that specifically inhibits IL‐23 downstream intercellular signaling by binding to its p19 subunit; it is approved for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The safety and efficacy of guselkumab were demonstrated by two randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled, comparator‐controlled, phase III clinical trials: VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2.The NAVIGATE study demonstrated the efficacy of guselkumab in patients who had inadequately responded to ustekinumab.

Real‐life studies are useful in everyday practice as they deal with more complex patients, compared to clinical trials, characterized by multiple comorbidities, multiple therapies, previous failures of biotechnological treatments.

Safety outcomes

All 21 patients enrolled in the study experienced at least one TEAE through week 52. After dose escalation to 100 mg q8w, three of the five patients with GPP and both patients with EP experienced at least one TEAE. The most common TEAE reported overall were nasopharyngitis (6/21, 28.6%), gastroenteritis, nausea, arthralgia and alopecia (2/21, 9.5% each) (Table 3).

Table 3 
Safety outcomes through week 52 (safety analysis set)

In total, four serious TEAE were reported in three of the 21 patients: two GPP patients (n = 1, fall and loss of consciousness; n = 1, squamous cell carcinoma of skin) and one EP patient (rib fracture). The GPP patient who experienced the serious TEAE of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin on day 29 discontinued the study agent on the same day. This patient had received phototherapy for psoriasis prior to study participation. All TEAE were mild to moderate in severity except for the event of squamous cell carcinoma, which was considered to be severe. The dose‐escalated patients (100 mg q8w) did not experience any serious TEAE or any TEAE leading to study discontinuation. TEAE of tinea pedis in one GPP patient and abnormal hepatic function in one EP patient were considered “reasonably related” to the study agent. No deaths or injection‐site reactions were reported. There was no new occurrence of psoriasis observed in any patient through week 52, although one GPP patient experienced worsening of psoriasis with mild severity on day 3 after the first dose administration.

There were no clinically meaningful changes or time‐related patterns observed in laboratory assessments, vital signs and electrocardiogram through week 52. For pre‐specified laboratory parameters of special interest, such as neutrophils, platelets and liver functions tests, a post‐baseline worse CTCAE grade of 2 or more was noted in three EP patients, one with grade 2 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation and two with grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation. These three patients had a comorbidity of chronic liver disease, such as fatty liver or alcohol‐induced liver disease. Both patients with a grade 3 AST elevation had an abnormal AST level at baseline. None of these laboratory test shifts were associated with a clinical diagnosis of hepatitis and all patients continued in the study. No patient was found to be positive for antibodies against guselkumab through week 52.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, through two Years: results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^8d8cfbd4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Through week 112, grade 2 and grade 3 decreased neutrophil counts occurred in ~4% and 0.7%, respectively, of all guselkumab‐treated patients, with no apparent differences between the 2 dosing regimens (Supplementary Table 1,). One patient (in the every‐4‐weeks group) had a grade 4 decreased neutrophil count. Generally, these decreased levels were transient and resolved spontaneously without discontinuation of study treatment. One infection (mild nasopharyngitis) was associated with a grade 2 decreased neutrophil count.

Among 725 patients who received guselkumab and had postbaseline samples available, grade 2 or 3 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were seen in ~5% of guselkumab‐treated patients through week 112 (Supplementary Table 1,); no grade 4 ALT or AST elevation occurred. Grade 2 ALT elevations were reported in 7.0% of those in the every‐4‐weeks group and 2.4% in the every‐8‐weeks group; grade 3 ALT elevations were reported in 2.1% and 1.6% of these patients, respectively. Grade 2 increased AST levels occurred in 4.5% and 3.6%, of patients in these 2 groups, respectively, and grade 3 AST elevations occurred in 3.3% and 1.2% of patients. Most increased ALT and AST levels were transient and resolved without discontinuation of guselkumab, with few exceptions: 3 patients in the every‐4‐weeks group (1 each with acute hepatitis B, isoniazid‐induced liver injury, and hepatic steatosis [this patient had a history of chronic liver disease]) discontinued the study, and another in the every‐4‐weeks group had an extended interruption in treatment primarily due to investigator concerns of alcohol use, hepatic steatosis, and chronic cholecystitis with persistently elevated transaminase levels, and discontinued due to investigator decision.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^98cfc53d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

General comments and special circumstances for IL-23 inhibitors—assessment timeline, adjunctive options, and malignancy considerations are outlined: Definitive response (positive or negative) to treatment with IL-23 antagonists is best ascertained after 12 weeks of continuous therapy. Consider dose escalation in partially responding patients, and consider the addition of other modalities (such as topical corticosteroids or vitamin D analogues, methotrexate, or ultraviolet B light) in partially responding patients. Although there are no published data supporting combination therapy for the IL-23 inhibitors, there is no reason to consider such combination therapy unsafe. The effect of guselkumab on solid tumor or lymphoreticular malignancy, when used as monotherapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, is unknown, and large long-term follow-up studies are necessary to more fully define the risk of cancer associated with IL-23 inhibitors.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis afferent to our center were prospectively recruited between December 2019 and August 2021. The inclusion criterion was the absence of response or contraindication or intolerance to traditional systemic therapies and/or ineffectiveness with previous biologic therapy (anti‐TNFa, anti‐IL17, or anti‐IL12/23). Patients were treated with the standard dose of guselkumab: 100 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at week 0 and week 4, followed by a maintenance dose every 8 weeks.

Patient demographic data, comorbidities, disease characteristics, and previous treatments were collected. Clinical data relating to drug efficacy and safety were acquired at the start of the treatment and in subsequent clinical follow‐up visits. The primary endpoint was the 90% and 100% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline (PASI90 and PASI100) at week 12, week 24, and week 48.

All patients gave written informed consent.

Demographic and clinical data were included in the analysis. The student t test was used to compare means between normal continuous variables; Mann–Whitney‐ U test was used for non‐normal distribution. Categorical values were compared with the chi‐square test and fisher's exact test if needed.

All statistical tests were on two sides: p ‐values <0.05 were considered significant; statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE12.0 Statistical Software (STATA, College Station, TX).

Single radiographs of the hands (posteroanterior) and feet (anteroposterior), obtained at week 0 and week 24 (or at discontinuation if before week 24) for the first reading session and at week 0, week 24, and week 52 (or at discontinuation if between weeks 24 and 52) for the second reading session, were independently evaluated by 2 central primary readers, with a third reader for adjudication (assignment of readers to primary reader/adjudicator roles differed between reading sessions; see Supplementary Methods, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at). Readers were blinded with regard to clinical data and radiograph ordering when scoring films using the modified Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) for PsA.

Investigators assessed the severity of skin disease using the Investigator’s Global Assessment of psoriasis (IGA; total score 0–4 as averaged across induration, erythema, and scaling, graded on a scale of 0–4, where 0 = cleared, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe). The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; total score 0–72) assessed the extent (percentage of body surface area [BSA] affected) and degree of associated redness, thickness, and scaling (each graded on a scale of 0–4, where 0 = none and 4 = maximum).

The Short Form 36 (SF‐36) health survey physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores were used to assess health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). The presence of suicidal ideation/behavior or nonsuicidal self‐injurious behavior was surveyed using electronic Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale [eC‐SSRS] questionnaires. Adverse events (AEs) and routine hematology and chemistry parameters were monitored. Details of guselkumab pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments have been reported previously.

Discontinuation

Only four patients (11.7%) discontinued the treatment: three patients stopped because of secondary inefficacy; one patient stopped because of a diagnosis of bladder cancer 18 weeks after guselkumab initiation. Mild and nonclinically relevant blood test alterations were experienced by 23.5% of patients.

Adverse effects

Potential registered AEs were found in 29.4% of patients, including pharyngitis (12.5%), headache (12.5%), influenza‐like illness (8.3%) and diarrhoea (2.9%), none of which required treatment discontinuation. Again, no significant differences in discontinuation rate or safety were observed between the three investigated drugs. No other cases of serious AEs, injection site reaction, Candida infection, malignancy or cardiovascular events (CVEs) were reported. Detailed data on overall study population and on the three groups separately are displayed in Table 1.

IL-23 inhibitors—infection risk and adverse effects are summarized as follows: Phase III studies indicate that both guselkumab and tildrakizumab are well tolerated; nevertheless, there is an increased risk of infection, and combination of IL-23 inhibitors with methotrexate can increase the risk of infection. Rare cases of increased liver transaminase levels have occurred with use of IL-23 inhibitors, and IL-23 inhibitors have demonstrated no unique adverse events of interest.

Disease prevention

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in disease interception in rheumatology including in PsA. If we can accurately identify people at high risk of PsA, then potential strategies can be tested to reduce this risk. To successfully take this idea forward, we need to design optimal trials considering the population, intervention, control and outcomes required. A risk prediction model, that works for individual people, is key to identifying who should be included in a trial. A model needs to indicate a significant risk to ensure that the trial is statistically powered and that interventions have a reasonable risk/benefit balance.

There are likely two key types of interventions that could be used: lifestyle or drugs. Research has suggested that maintaining a healthy body weight and regular physical activity are associated with a lower risk and interventions supporting lifestyle changes towards these goals may be beneficial. Some observational studies have suggested that biologic therapies used for psoriasis may be associated with a lower risk of PsA development.This seems biologically plausible, despite many biases that will affect such retrospective data. However, we cannot be sure if these drugs are really preventing or changing the risk of PsA or whether they are only delaying clinical evidence of disease. Studies are currently ongoing investigating drug treatment for PsA prevention including the Preventing Arthritis in a Multi-Center Psoriasis At-Risk Cohort (PAMPA) study which is testing guselkumab versus placebo in patients with psoriasis and subclinical ultrasound inflammation.However, the control group in these studies is potentially problematic. It is ideal to include patients with severe psoriasis as they are known to be at increased risk of arthritis, but then systemic treatment for psoriasis is indicated and it would be unethical to withhold this.

Results

Of the 1027 patients randomized, 89% (465 of 520) in the ixekizumab arm and 91% (459 of 507) in the guselkumab arm completed the 24‐week trial (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics were described previously. 3

Figure 1 
Disposition of the patients. Details are given according to the CONSORT statement for reporting randomized controlled trials.

Clinical outcomes

The final major secondary outcome for IXORA‐R tested the superiority of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab for the proportion of patients achieving PASI 100 at week 24. Similar percentages of patients receiving ixekizumab and guselkumab achieved PASI 100 at week 24: 50% (260 of 520) for ixekizumab vs. 52% (265 of 507) for guselkumab; P = 0·41 (Figure 2a). The superiority test for PASI 100 at week 24 was the last in the hierarchical testing scheme, and thus its result did not affect the other major outcomes. Ixekizumab was noninferior to guselkumab at week 24 (difference of −2·3%; 95% confidence interval −8·4 to 3·8).

### Pooled safety results through 1 year of 2 phase III trials of guselkumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis [^a35a7e21]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the safety of guselkumab (monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin [IL]-23p19) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) through 1 year (1Y) of the phase III DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 trials.

Methods

Patients with active PsA (n = 1120; biologic-naïve except 118 patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in DISCOVER-1) were randomized to subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or at Week 0, Week 4, then every 8 weeks (Q8W); or placebo. At Week 24, patients in the placebo group switched to guselkumab 100 mg Q4W. Treatment continued through 1Y and 2 years for DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, respectively. In this pooled analysis, patients with ≥ 1 adverse event (AE) through 1Y were standardized for 100 patient-years [100 PYs] of follow-up.

Results

Through Week 24, adverse events (AEs) were consistent between patients treated with placebo and guselkumab (Q4W + Q8W). AEs were 142.8/100 PYs and 150.6/100 PYs, serious AEs were 7.1/100 PYs and 4.4/100 PYs, and AEs leading to study agent discontinuation were 4.1/100 PYs and 3.8/100 PYs, respectively. Through 1Y in patients treated with guselkumab, no uveitis, active tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, or inflammatory bowel disease were observed, and low rates of malignancy and major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events were observed. Injection-site reactions occurred in 1.7%, and antibodies to guselkumab in 4.5% of patients treated with guselkumab through 1Y; the vast majority of antibodies to guselkumab were nonneutralizing. Serum hepatic transaminase elevations (more common with Q4W than Q8W dosing) and decreased neutrophil counts were generally mild, transient, and did not require treatment discontinuation, with minimal change from Week 24 to 1Y.

Conclusion

Guselkumab 100 mg Q4W and Q8W were well tolerated in patients with PsA, with no new safety concerns through 1Y of the phase III DISCOVER trials. Guselkumab safety through 1Y in patients with PsA is consistent with that established in patients with psoriasis who were treated with guselkumab. [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03162796 and NCT03158285].

The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Study design

This was a phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study conducted in Japan (35 sites) from 15 January 2015 to 11 November 2016. The study comprised a placebo‐controlled period (weeks 0–16), a placebo cross‐over and active treatment period (weeks 16–52) and a long‐term extension phase (Fig. 1). Eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1) to guselkumab 50 mg, 100 mg or placebo, with s.c. injections at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter. Patients receiving placebo were crossed over to receive (1:1) guselkumab 50 mg or 100 mg at weeks 16 and 20 and every q8w thereafter (Fig. 1). Randomization was performed centrally using a computer‐generated randomization scheme, balanced using randomly permuted blocks and stratified by presence of PsA. Study site personnel, investigators and patients were blinded to treatment allocation until week 52 database lock. The study was approved by the institutional review board and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice standards. Patients provided written informed consent before study participation. The study's Clinical Trial Registration number was NCT02325219.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

DISCOVER‐2 sample size estimates have been previously reported. All patients continuing treatment at week 24 received guselkumab going forward; no formal hypothesis testing was planned after week 24.

As previously reported, treatment failure rules were applied to all clinical efficacy analyses through week 24: patients who discontinued study treatment, terminated study participation, initiated/increased doses of DMARDs or oral glucocorticoids, or initiated protocol‐prohibited PsA treatment were considered nonresponders for binary end points, or were considered to have no change from baseline for continuous end points. Missing data were imputed as nonresponse for categorical end points or using multiple imputation (assumed to be missing at random) for continuous end points. After week 24, the statistical analysis plan prespecified using observed data through week 100. Post hoc clinical efficacy (but not radiographic) analyses employed nonresponder imputation (NRI) in which patients with missing data were classified as nonresponders for categorical end points, and missing continuous end point data were imputed as having no change (for patients who discontinued study treatment), or were imputed using multiple imputation (assumed to be missing at random for patients with missing data for any other reason). Results of these post hoc analyses have been reported through week 52 and are reported here through week 100. Additional post hoc analyses assessed the maintenance of ACR20/50/70 responses (NRI) at week 100 among patients with a response at week 52, the proportions of patients achieving ≥20% improvement in the individual ACR components (NRI) through week 100, and the median time to onset of treatment effect (for ACR20) using Kaplan–Meier curves. Least squares mean (LSM) changes in clinical efficacy and HRQoL measures were determined using analysis of covariance.

Observed changes in Sharp/van der Heijde scores from reading session 3 were summarized using descriptive statistics for patients who continued treatment at week 52. Cumulative probability plots show the observed cumulative distribution of these scores, ranked from lowest to highest, against the actual value according to study period (weeks 0–52 and weeks 52–100).

AEs were summarized by actual treatment received for patients who received ≥1 study agent administration. To account for the shorter placebo‐controlled period compared to active treatment, incidences of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, infections, and serious infections are also reported as the number of events per 100 patient‐years of follow‐up with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

### Long-term efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, through two Years: results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^73091a2e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

Clinical efficacy through week 24 and week 52 has been previously detailed. Briefly, the primary end point was achieved, with 64% of patients in both guselkumab dosing groups achieving an ACR20 response at week 24 versus 33% of patients in the placebo group. At week 100, 76% of patients in the guselkumab every‐4‐weeks group and 74% in the every‐8‐weeks group had an ACR20 response, 56% and 55%, respectively, had an ACR50 response, and 35% and 36%, respectively, had an ACR70 response (all NRI accounting for ~12% of patients with missing data) (Figure 1). Trends in ACR response rates over time using observed data were consistent with those determined using NRI (Figure 1). When evaluating the time to ACR20 response, separation from placebo was observed at week 4, with continued increases in response rate through week 24 for patients in the guselkumab groups (Supplementary Figure 2,). Among ACR components, 45–62% of guselkumab‐treated patients achieved ≥20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts, physician global assessment score, and CRP level by week 4 (Supplementary Figure 3,). In the guselkumab groups, the proportions of patients achieving ≥20% improvement were maintained or continued to increase through week 100 for all ACR components. In addition, at a group level, response rates for increasing levels of response (ACR50 and ACR70) increased over time through the second year of treatment. This suggests that individual patients may be improving over time and achieving higher levels of improvement with continued guselkumab treatment.

### Maintenance of response through up to 4 years of continuous guselkumab treatment of psoriasis in the VOYAGE 2 phase 3 study [^94994752]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Guselkumab effectively treats moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

Objectives

Results of continuous guselkumab treatment through 4 years from VOYAGE 2 are presented.

Methods

At baseline, 992 patients were randomized to receive guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks, placebo, or adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks. Placebo-treated patients crossed over to guselkumab at week 16. Weeks 28-76 incorporated randomized withdrawal, and all patients received open-label guselkumab through to week 204. Efficacy was analyzed using pre-specified treatment failure rules (patients were considered nonresponders after discontinuing due to lack of efficacy, worsening of psoriasis, or use of a prohibited treatment). There was no missing data imputation after treatment failure rules. Safety was analyzed through 4 years.

Results

The proportions of guselkumab-treated patients who achieved and maintained designated clinical responses at weeks 100 and 204, respectively, were as follows: at least a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index from baseline (PASI 75): 94.1% and 92.3%; PASI 90: 79.1% and 79.7%; PASI 100: 48.4% and 51.0%; Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1: 83.1% and 81.9%; IGA score of 0: 52.7% and 52.7%; Dermatology Life Quality Index score of 0/1: 70.2% and 69.1%; Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) symptom score of 0: 35.7% and 39.7%; PSSD sign score of 0: 22.0% and 27.2%;≥5% improvement in Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component score: 48.8% and 45.0%; ≥ 5% improvement in SF-36 mental component score: 45.1% and 43.2%; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS)-anxiety score≥8: 22.9% and 21.7%; and HADS-depression score≥8: 16.6% and 21.0%. Similar findings were reported for the adalimumab→guselkumab group. No new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

High efficacy levels were maintained from week 100 through to week 204 with continuous guselkumab treatment, across multiple endpoints, in VOYAGE 2. Guselkumab was well tolerated.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^66cdaf04]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn’s disease refractory therapy and precision medicine—nonresponse rates, alternative classes, monitoring, and strategic priorities: Despite existing treatments, approximately 20%–30% of patients experience primary nonresponse to anti-TNF therapies, and 30%–40% lose their response or become intolerant (secondary non-responders) within the first year of treatment. These secondary non-responders often require dose escalation, switching to another anti-TNF agent, or transitioning to a different therapeutic class, such as anti-integrins (vedolizumab), anti-IL-12/23 agents (ustekinumab), anti-IL-23 agents (guselkumab, mirikizumab or risankizumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib), or novel mechanisms. Managing patients with refractory CD poses a considerable challenge because they often cycle through the available advanced therapies, and a therapeutic ceiling effect has been observed in some patients, limiting the efficacy of existing treatments. Routine monitoring of disease activity with biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is recommended. Precision medicine is emerging as a solution for CD, seeking to integrate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into clinical decision-making, and key proposals to improve CD treatment strategies include the following: Disease Classification; Endpoints; and Longitudinal Assessment.

### Assessing the need for routine safety testing for patients being treated with dupilumab for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^a353eec0]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (also known as AD or eczema) is a common skin disease that can cause intense and persistent itching and rashes. Skin creams or ointments are not suitable or effective for some patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In these patients, oral (taken by mouth) or injected medications may be required. Some of those oral or injected treatments could be toxic and often have unwanted side effects, especially when used for a longer period of time, so patients must be regularly tested to see whether those treatments are harming their blood or organs. Dupilumab is a newer injectable drug for treating moderate-to-severe AD. Dupilumab specifically targets key molecules in the body that cause AD. Dupilumab has been tested for up to one year in more than 2000 patients enroled in placebo-controlled clinical trials. During those trials, patients provided blood and urine samples for laboratory testing while they were being treated with dupilumab or placebo (dummy drug). In this paper, the authors from Germany and the U.S.A, analysed how blood cells, blood chemistry, and urine chemistry changed during treatment, to check whether dupilumab is safe to use without the need for regular laboratory tests. After performing many routine laboratory tests on patients' blood and urine, they found that there were no clinically important changes in test results that could be linked to dupilumab. They concluded that patients using dupilumab for moderate-to-severe AD do not need routine laboratory testing. This is a summary of the study: Laboratory safety of dupilumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: results from three phase III trials (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1, LIBERTY AD SOLO 2, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS).

Patients and methods

Study design

IXORA‐R was a multicentre, randomized, double‐blinded, parallel‐group, phase IV study with the primary end point at 12 weeks and the blinded study continuing to 24 weeks. The study design is shown in Figure S1 (see Supporting Information). The results reported here were obtained between 9 November 2018 and 15 July 2019 by 124 investigators at 124 sites in the U.S.A. and Canada (for a list of investigators see Appendix 2, for a list of investigators by study site see File S1 in the Supporting Information).

All patients were required to give informed consent for participation in the study. The IXORA‐R protocol was approved by local ethical review boards and was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Two amendments were made to the protocol and are described in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

Randomization and masking

Patients were allocated to treatment by a computer‐generated random sequence. Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive subcutaneous injections of ixekizumab or guselkumab at the approved dosing. For ixekizumab, patients received a 160‐mg starting dose at week 0 (two 80‐mg injections), followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks from weeks 2 to 12. For guselkumab, patients received 100 mg injections at weeks 0, 4 and 12. To maintain blinding, patients on guselkumab received one placebo injection at weeks 0, 2, 6, 8 and 10.

Patients, investigators and all other personnel involved in the conduct of this ongoing study are to remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until all patients have completed the study. Additional details on randomization and masking are provided in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

### Guselkumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who were biologic-naive or had previously received TNF α inhibitor treatment (DISCOVER-1): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^9ac197c7]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Many patients with psoriatic arthritis have an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Guselkumab, a specific inhibitor of interleukin-23 (IL-23) via IL-23 p19 subunit binding, significantly improved psoriatic arthritis signs and symptoms with an acceptable safety profile in a phase 2 trial.

Methods

This multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 86 sites in 13 countries across Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America and enrolled adults with active psoriatic arthritis (at least three swollen and three tender joints; and C-reactive protein ≥0·3 mg/dL) despite standard therapies. Eligibility criteria included inadequate response to or intolerance of standard treatment, including at least 4 months of apremilast, at least 3 months of non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or at least 4 weeks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for psoriatic arthritis. About 30% of study participants could have previously received one or two TNF inhibitors. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1, computer-generated permuted blocks; stratified by baseline DMARD and previous TNF inhibitor use) to subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks; guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0, 4, then every 8 weeks; or matching placebo. The primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) at week 24 in all patients per assigned treatment group using non-responder imputation. Safety was assessed in all patients per treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03162796 (active, not recruiting).

Findings

From Aug 28, 2017, to Aug 17, 2018, we screened 624 patients, of whom 381 were randomly assigned and treated with guselkumab every 4 weeks (n=128), guselkumab every 8 weeks (n=127), or placebo (n=126). 362 patients continued study treatment up to week 24. The primary endpoint was met: ACR20 at week 24 was achieved by significantly greater proportions of patients in the guselkumab every 4 weeks group (76 [59%] of 128 [95% CI 50-68]) and every 8 weeks group (66 [52%] of 127 [43-61]) than in the placebo group (28 [22%] of 126 [15-30]), with percentage differences versus placebo of 37% (95% CI 26-48) for the every 4 weeks group and 30% (19-41) for the every 8 weeks group (both p<0·0001). Serious adverse events up to week 24 occurred in no patients receiving guselkumab every 4 weeks, four (3%) patients receiving guselkumab every 8 weeks, and five (4%) patients receiving placebo. Up to week 24, one patient in the placebo group died from cardiac failure and two had serious infections; no guselkumab-treated patient died or had serious infections.

Interpretation

Guselkumab demonstrated a favourable benefit-risk profile and might be an effective treatment option for patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

### Joint position statement from the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board and the international psoriasis council on routine testing for latent tuberculosis infection prior to and during treatment of psoriasis patients with IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors [^48949856]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

IL-23 inhibitors—mechanism, agents, and tuberculosis considerations: IL-23 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and consists of two protein subunits, p40 and p19; the former is shared with IL-12 whereas p19 is specific for IL-23; IL-23 inhibitors that block p19 include guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab; although IL-23 has been implicated in protective responses against M. tuberculosis, IL-12-mediated Th1 responses are dominant in controlling TB infection with IL-23/Th17 responses more protective when Th1 is compromised; individuals genetically deficient in IL-12p40 or IL-23R are susceptible to TB infection, yet current clinical data do not indicate an increased risk of progression of latent TB infection to active disease with therapeutic inhibition of IL-23; many reviews have highlighted the safety of IL-23 inhibitors in treating psoriasis and other IMIDs, including in the setting of latent TB infection.

In conclusion, this 20‐week interim analysis of the GUS PMS study in Japan found no new safety concerns. In addition, the favorable effectiveness profile of GUS in patients with psoriasis, including those who switched to GUS from APR and a biologic, was reaffirmed. However, longer‐term data from this ongoing study and other sources are needed to better understand the safety and effectiveness profile of GUS in Japanese patients with psoriasis.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

IL-23 inhibitors in psoriasis—clinical trial data on latent tuberculosis (TB) infection show no observed progression to active disease across large datasets and noted cohorts. Analyses including 4,399 patients treated with guselkumab with an exposure of 10,787 patient- years, 1,413 patients treated with tildrakizumab, and 2,072 patients treated with risankizumab with an exposure of 7,927 patient-years revealed no cases of progression of latent TB infection to active disease in clinical trials utilizing IL- 23 inhibitors, and similarly no cases were reported in trials treating other IMIDs. In the IMMhance risankizumab psoriasis trial, a subset of 31 patients who screened positive for latent TB infection and did not receive TB preventive therapy prior to study initiation were exposed to risankizumab for 55 weeks and none progressed. In pooled guselkumab studies, 7 patients began TB preventive therapy concurrently with initiation and 5 began after starting guselkumab, with none of these 12 progressing. The page also notes that patients with latent TB infection were typically included in IL-23 inhibitor studies only if they had previously received TB preventive therapy, introducing confounding when evaluating safety in the setting of latent TB infection.

### Safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in Japanese patients with psoriasis: 20-week interim analysis of a postmarketing surveillance study [^58efba76]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

GUS, a fully human IgG1λ monoclonal against the p19 subunit of IL‐23 (IL‐23p19), has been shown to be effective and have a favorable safety profile in the treatment of psoriasis in previous clinical trials.,,In 2018, GUS was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PsV), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and erythrodermic psoriasis (EP), who have not adequately responded to conventional therapies. The ongoing postmarketing surveillance (PMS) study, which was required by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) as part of the Risk Management Plan and Pharmacovigilance Plan for GUS approval, has been planned and is being conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of GUS in Japanese patients with psoriasis in clinical practice over a period of 52 weeks. This report presents results from the 20‐week interim analysis of the PMS for GUS in real‐world patients with psoriasis.

Although randomized controlled trials are generally considered the gold standard for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new treatments, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria often result in trial populations that are not representative of real‐world patients who may have comorbidities and use other concomitant medications.Therefore, real‐world studies are becoming increasingly important to provide evidence supporting treatment safety and effectiveness in actual clinical settings.The limited body of prospective real‐world data currently available for GUS in patients with psoriasis highlights the importance of this study.,,,

This interim analysis provides valuable insights into the characteristics of Japanese patients with psoriasis treated with GUS in real‐world clinical practice and early safety and effectiveness outcomes with GUS treatment. The results of this analysis are expected to inform ongoing discussions on the appropriate use of biologics for psoriasis in Japan.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

This is a multicenter, single‐arm, prospective, observational longitudinal follow‐up cohort study in patients with PsV, PsA, GPP, and EP who initiated treatment with GUS in Japan. The observation period is 52 weeks after the initial dosing of GUS. GUS is administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 followed by maintenance dosing with 100 mg every 8 weeks (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1 
Study design. CGI, Clinical Global Impression; DAS28, Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints; DLQI, Dermatology Life Quality Index; NAPSI, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index; PASI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index.

The protocol, including all ethical aspects, was submitted for internal review board approval and confirmed by PMDA. The study is conducted in accordance with the Japanese regulations for Good Post‐Marketing Study Practice, as specified by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Ministerial Ordinance no. 171. Initiation of the study occurred following establishment of a contract between the participating institutions and Janssen Pharmaceutical KK in Tokyo, Japan.

This is the interim report for a series of analyses of the ongoing study. This 20‐week interim analysis report presents results for patients who initiated treatment with GUS between May 2018 and October 2020.

2.2 Data collection and outcomes

Patient demographic and other baseline characteristics including medical history and comorbidities, as well as information pertaining to GUS treatment and concomitant drugs, were collected throughout the observation period. Investigators recorded adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, adverse drug reactions (ADRs; defined as AEs for which a causal relationship to drug treatment cannot be ruled out), and serious ADRs (SADRs) for safety assessments. AEs were coded by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 25.0. Based on the Risk Management Plan for GUS, serious infections and serious hypersensitivity reactions were categorized as “important identified risks,” while malignancy, decreased neutrophil count, and major adverse cardiovascular events were classified as “important potential risks” for safety assessments.

The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) measure, which is evaluated by the treating clinician based on five potential responses (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, and worse),Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI),and Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)were used for assessment of effectiveness (Figure 1).

### Long-term efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, through two Years: results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^38f485dc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Efficacy was assessed through week 100. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response components (tender joint count [0–68], swollen joint count [0–66], pain [0–10 cm visual analog scale (VAS)], physician global assessment [0–10 cm VAS], patient global assessment [0–10 cm VAS], physical function as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index [HAQ DI; 0–3], and CRP level [mg/dl]) were determined as previously described. Enthesitis (Leeds Enthesitis Index; total 0–6) and dactylitis (Dactylitis Severity Score; total 0–60) were also assessed.

Single radiographs of hands (posteroanterior) and feet (anteroposterior) were obtained at weeks 0, 24, 52, and 100 (or at discontinuation) and scored using the Sharp/van der Heijde modified scoring method for PsA. Findings previously described through week 24 and week 52 were derived from the first and second reading sessions, respectively. The third reading session included radiographs from all time points and were independently evaluated by 2 central primary readers, with a third reader for adjudication, blinded with regard to treatment group and time point. Assignment of readers to primary reader/adjudicator roles was the same for reading sessions 1 and 3, and scores of the 2 primary readers in each session were averaged together. Scores from a third adjudicator were utilized when the difference in change scores between the primary readers was >10 or if change scores from 1 primary reader were missing.

Skin symptoms were assessed using the Investigator’s Global Assessment of psoriasis (IGA; 0 [cleared] to 4 [severe]). The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; 0–72) also assessed the extent (percentage body surface area affected) and degree of associated redness, thickness, and scaling (each graded from 0 [none] to 4 [maximum]). Health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated using Short Form 36 (SF‐36) physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores.

Adverse events (AEs) and routine hematology and chemistry parameters were monitored. Serum samples collected through week 112 were assayed to measure guselkumab concentrations and detect antibodies to guselkumab.

The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Out of 220 patients screened, 192 were randomized to placebo (n = 64), guselkumab 50 mg (n = 65) or 100 mg (n = 63). At week 16, patients in the placebo group were re‐randomized to guselkumab 50 mg or 100 mg (n = 26 each). Overall, 173 of the 192 (90.1%) patients completed the study till week 52. A total of 19 patients discontinued the study agent through week 52; 15 patients prior to week 16 (placebo, n = 12; guselkumab 50 mg, n = 2; guselkumab 100 mg, n = 1) and four patients from weeks 16–52 (guselkumab 50 mg, n = 3; placebo to 100 mg, n = 1; Fig. 2). Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally well‐balanced across groups, except for the lower mean bodyweight in the guselkumab 50 mg group (67.76 kg) versus the guselkumab 100 mg (74.27 kg) and placebo group (71.56 kg) (Table 1).

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-interleukin 23 monoclonal antibody, for palmoplantar pustulosis: a randomized clinical trial [^541d3671]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a recalcitrant skin disease with no biologics currently approved for treatment. The involvement of interleukin 23 (IL-23) and cytokines of the type 17 helper T cell lineage in the pathogenesis of PPP has been recently postulated.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, in Japanese patients with PPP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 24-week trial was conducted between May 14, 2013, and September 27, 2014, at 11 centers in Japan. Participants were patients with moderate to severe PPP that did not respond adequately to conventional treatments.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive guselkumab, 200 mg, by subcutaneous injection or matching placebo at weeks 0 and 4.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in total scores of skin-related outcomes from baseline at the end of week 16 (primary clinical cutoff) and through week 24 were measured. Serum biomarker analyses were performed at baseline, week 4, and week 16, and safety was monitored through week 24.

Results

Of 49 randomized patients (35 [71%] women; median [range] age, 52 [28-77] years), 41 completed the study at week 24. Mean (SD) PPP severity index total scores (primary end point) improved significantly from baseline in guselkumab-treated patients (-3.3 [2.43]) vs placebo (-1.8 [2.09]) (least squares mean difference, -1.5; 95% CI, -2.9 to -0.2; P=.03). At week 16, PPP area and severity index scores (least squares mean difference, -5.65; 95% CI, -9.80 to -1.50; P=.009) and proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in these scores (difference in proportion, 39.2; 95% CI, 14.0-64.3; P=.009) improved significantly. A numerically higher proportion of patients had a physician's global assessment score of 1 or less in the guselkumab group vs placebo. Improvement in efficacy scores was maintained through week 24 in the guselkumab group. Significant reductions from baseline in serum IL-17A and IL-17F cytokine levels were observed at weeks 4 and 16. Frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between the guselkumab group (19 of 25 patients [76%]) and the placebo group (18 of 24 patients [75%]). Frequent adverse effects included nasopharyngitis (14 patients [29%]), headache (3 patients [6%]), contact dermatitis (3 patients [6%]), and injection site erythema (3 patients [6%]). No major safety concerns emerged during the study.

Conclusions and Relevance

Targeting IL-23 and its associated immune cascade with guselkumab may be a safe and useful therapeutic option for treatment of PPP.

### Safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in Japanese patients with psoriasis: 20-week interim analysis of a postmarketing surveillance study [^fa0327f4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

After 20 weeks of GUS treatment, mean PASI scores ranged from 2.1 to 2.6 across the above‐mentioned subgroups. These outcomes underscore the consistent effectiveness of GUS in treating psoriasis, regardless of variations in patient profiles. The efficacy of GUS across diverse patient subgroups has also been demonstrated in phase 3 trials of VOYAGE 1 (A Study of Guselkumab in the Treatment of Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque‐Type Psoriasis) and VOYAGE 2 (A Study of Guselkumab in the Treatment of Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque‐Type Psoriasis With Randomized Withdrawal and Retreatment).Moreover, in recent years, consideration of the absolute PASI scores has been increasingly recognized as an important measure for assessing treatment effectiveness in clinical practice. Achieving an absolute PASI score below the threshold of 2 or 3 holds considerable clinical importance, representing a concrete and clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms.Noticeably, our findings highlight how GUS treatment effectively enables the achievement of this high level of response, which is well‐aligned with established treatment goals.

In addition, the subgroup analysis provides new insights into the effectiveness of GUS among patients switching from APR. Previous reports,have indicated varying persistence rates for APR in real‐world use, with patients discontinuing due to perceived challenges in achieving desired effectiveness. Our findings support that GUS not only improves PASI scores among patients switching from APR but also provides a therapeutic advantage for patients exhibiting an inadequate response to APR.

The use of biologics in combination with other systemic therapies is controversial in clinical practice. JDA guidance advises against combining biologics with CyA.However, in some situations, CyA may be used in combination with a biologic, primarily due to concerns about temporary worsening of psoriasis. Our exploratory analysis investigated two CyA patient subgroups: one with patients maintaining CyA at the start of GUS treatment (five patients), and the other with patients who discontinued CyA before starting GUS (10 patients). Patients in both subgroups experienced notable decreases in PASI scores within 4 weeks, without any observed exacerbations. These findings suggest that, depending on the level of disease control, discontinuing CyA before initiating GUS might not have a substantial impact on maintaining efficacy.

### Safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in Japanese patients with psoriasis: 20-week interim analysis of a postmarketing surveillance study [^43d13080]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune‐mediated skin disorder that may lead to adverse health outcomes.Particularly in advanced stages, psoriasis is associated with various comorbidities, which also have a negative impact on patients' quality of life.,

Conventional treatments for psoriasis include topical drugs, oral immunosuppressants, and phototherapies. In addition, there are more than 10 biologics that target various cytokines, along with new small‐molecule therapeutics such as phosphodiesterase‐4, Janus kinase, and tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitors, for treating psoriasis with cytokine‐driven inflammation. In Japan, the first biologics for psoriasis were infliximab and adalimumab (anti–tumor necrosis factor α [TNF‐α] antibodies) introduced in 2010, followed by ustekinumab (anti–interleukin 12/IL‐23 subunit 40 [IL‐p40] antibody) in 2011. Since 2015, a variety of other biologics have become available including secukinumab and ixekizumab (anti–IL‐17A antibodies), brodalumab (anti–IL‐17R antibody), guselkumab (GUS), risankizumab and tildrakizumab (anti–IL23p19 antibodies), certolizumab pegol (anti–TNF‐α antibody Fab fragment), and bimekizumab (anti–IL‐17A/F antibody). These treatments provide patients and physicians with an expanded range of therapeutic options for psoriasis.,The Japanese guidance on the use of biologics for the treatment of psoriasis from the Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA) states that it is important for physicians to select appropriate biologic therapy for each patient with psoriasis after due consideration of disease factors, treatment factors, and patient background factors, sharing such information with patients. The JDA guidance also notes that when selecting biologics, factors to be considered include not only the drug's effectiveness (such as likelihood of high level response, time to onset of effectiveness, effectiveness against arthritis, and failure rates) but also safety (such as the risk of infections, administration‐related reactions, and potential for exacerbating comorbidities), convenience for patients (e.g. hospital visit intervals, self‐injection, maintenance therapy at clinics, feasibility of drug discontinuation/readministration), and payment (medical costs) borne by patients.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 12-week efficacy, safety and speed of response from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^3d51978d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

The sample size was estimated to have 98% power for testing the superiority of ixekizumab to guselkumab for the PASI 100 outcome at week 12 at a two‐sided 5% type I error rate (for details see File S2 ; see Supporting Information).

Efficacy analyses for the blinded treatment dosing period included all randomized patients according to the treatment to which they were assigned (intent‐to‐treat population). Safety data up to the week 12 database lock were summarized using the safety population (all randomized patients who received one or more dose of a trial drug) per the assigned treatments.

For the primary and major secondary end points, odds ratios and P ‐values were obtained using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by pooled site. Missing data were imputed using a nonresponder imputation method. A multiple testing strategy was implemented for primary and major secondary end points to control the overall familywise type I error rate at a two‐sided alpha level of 0·05. Exploratory analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. One interim analysis was planned and executed when all patients completed their week 12 visit or early termination visit. This paper presents the results of this interim analysis and is considered the primary report of the trial. Additional details regarding statistical analyses are in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

Safety data on terms related to cerebrocardiovascular events and suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were adjudicated by external clinical event committees (for details see File S2 in the Supporting Information). Because this study is ongoing, some efficacy and safety data are not described in this article to maintain study blinding. These details will be included in future publications. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03573323).

### Safety of guselkumab treatment for up to 5 years in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis: pooled analyses across seven clinical trials with more than 8600 patient-years of exposure [^1edfe132]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Guselkumab has demonstrated favourable safety and efficacy across individual clinical studies in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis using pooled data from seven phase II/III studies (X-PLORE, VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2, NAVIGATE, ORION, ECLIPSE, Japan registration).

Methods

All studies, except NAVIGATE and ECLIPSE (active comparator-controlled only), included a 16-week placebo-controlled period; X-PLORE, VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 included both placebo and active controls. In most studies, guselkumab-treated patients received 100-mg subcutaneous injections at week 0, week 4, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Safety data were summarized for the placebo-controlled period (weeks 0-16) and through the end of the reporting period (up to 5years). Incidence rates of key safety events were integrated post hoc, adjusted for the duration of follow-up and reported per 100 patient-years (PY).

Results

During the placebo-controlled period, 544 patients received placebo (165 PY) and 1220 received guselkumab (378 PY). Through the end of the reporting period, 2891 guselkumab-treated patients contributed 8662 PY of follow-up. During the placebo-controlled period, in the guselkumab and placebo groups, respectively, rates of adverse events (AEs) were 346/100 PY and 341/100 PY, and infections were 95.9/100 PY and 83.6/100 PY. Rates of serious AEs (6.3/100 PY vs. 6.7/100 PY), AEs leading to discontinuation (5.0/100 PY vs. 9.7/100 PY), serious infections (1.1/100 PY vs. 1.2/100 PY), malignancy (0.5 patients/100 PY vs. 0.0 patients/100 PY) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; 0.3/100 PY vs. 0.0/100 PY) were low and comparable between guselkumab and placebo. Through the end of the reporting period, safety event rates were lower than or comparable to the placebo-controlled period in guselkumab-treated patients: AEs, 169/100 PY; infections, 65.9/100 PY; serious AEs, 5.3/100 PY; AEs leading to discontinuation, 1.6/100 PY; serious infections, 0.9/100 PY; malignancy, 0.7/100 PY; and MACE, 0.3/100 PY. There were no cases of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, opportunistic infection or active tuberculosis related to guselkumab.

Conclusions

In this comprehensive analysis of 2891 guselkumab-treated patients with psoriasis followed for up to 5years (8662 PY), guselkumab demonstrated favourable safety, consistent with previous reports. Safety event rates in guselkumab-treated patients were similar to those observed with placebo and were consistent throughout long-term treatment.

### Absolute psoriasis area and severity index as a valuable marker to determine initial treatment response in psoriasis patients treated with guselkumab in routine clinical care [^b92b8103]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Guselkumab is an anti-interleukin-23p19 monoclonal antibody approved as a first-line medication in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis and second-line in active psoriatic arthritis. In the clinic, patients who have shown a lack of previous treatment efficacy and/or tolerability are often prescribed guselkumab. These patients generally have less severe psoriasis compared to clinical trial cohorts, reflected in lower Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). To evaluate treatment response in a real-world setting, we conducted a multicenter-retrospective chart review in three specialized dermatological centers. Seventy-four patients who received guselkumab treatment were included in the study and baseline characteristics were described. The mean PASI at baseline was 13.0 (±6.7). After 12weeks of treatment 40 patients could be followed up at the participating centers and efficacy was assessed: 72.5% of these patients achieved an absolute PASI ≤5 (55.0% ≤3; 42.5% ≤2) whereas only 57.5% of patients were able to gain a delta PASI reduction of at least 75%. Using the absolute PASI as a treatment goal rather than response rate revealed that guselkumab was highly effective in this real-world setting. In conclusion, the absolute PASI proved to be a more valuable tool to measure treatment outcome.

### Real-life experience of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis [^47835416]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

High levels of efficacy were demonstrated in randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of guselkumab; however, real-life data are lacking. In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in a cohort of psoriasis patients heavily pretreated with biologic agents. Primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving ≥psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 90 response at week 24. The cohort included 33 patients of mean age 60±13years. Guselkumab was initiated after a mean of 4.0 ±1.0 prior biologics failed over a mean period of 7. 4 ±3.8years. The mean duration of guselkumab treatment was 9.5 ±3.7 months; 29 patients completed at least 24weeks of treatment. At week 24, 22 patients (76%) achieved response of PASI 75 or higher, 18 (62%) achieved PASI 90 or higher, five (17%) PASI 100, and seven (24%) ≤PASI 50. No adverse effects were observed. This study confirms the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in real-world clinical practice, although for a lesser degree compared with clinical trials.

Through week 52, decreased neutrophil counts of NCI CTCAE grade 2 or higher (<1.5 × 10 9 /liter) were infrequent, occurring in 3.7% of patients (9 of 243) who received guselkumab every 4 weeks from week 0 and 3.6% of patients (9 of 247) who received guselkumab every 8 weeks from week 0. Fewer than 1% of guselkumab‐treated patients (5 of 731) had decreased neutrophil counts of grade 3 or higher, including 4 with grade 3 values (<1.0–0.5 × 10 9 /liter) and 1 with grade 4 values (<0.5 × 10 9 /liter). These findings were generally transient and reversible, resolved spontaneously without treatment, and did not require discontinuation of study agent. No associated infections were seen, except a case of mild nasopharyngitis temporally associated with grade 2 neutropenia. Decreased white blood cell counts of NCI CTCAE grade 2 (<3.0–2.0 × 10 9 /liter) occurred in 2.1% of patients (5 of 243) who received guselkumab every 4 weeks from week 0 and 2.4% of patients (6 of 247) who received guselkumab every 8 weeks from week 0; no guselkumab‐treated patient exhibited leukopenia of grade 3 or 4 (>2.0 × 10 9 /liter) (Supplementary Table 4, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at).

Fig 2 
Effect of IL-23 inhibition on TNF-α and IFN-α. (Created with BioRender.com.) A, IL-23 induces upregulation of TNF-α through T H 17 cells. TNF-α inhibits plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) secretion of IFN-α, a known inducer of inflammatory skin lesions. B, Inhibition of TNF-α by a TNF-α inhibitor can lead to an unopposed increase in IFN-α, resulting in inflammatory skin lesions. C, As IL-23 induces upregulation of TNF-α through T H 17 cells, one could argue that an IL-23 inhibitor partially acts as a TNF-α inhibitor. Through this mechanism, it could increase IFN-α, possibly explaining the paradoxical skin reaction in our patient.

This case report might contribute to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of paradoxical inflammatory reactions. As our antipsoriatic treatments gain affinity for their respective targets, a more potent inhibition of inflammatory pathways can be expected. It is conceivable that in predisposed individuals, this shift in production of a specific T H cell line leads to a change in inflammatory phenotype.

Especially when targeting pivotal cytokines, the role of therapeutic drug monitoring can become more prominent in the future. It is conceivable that dose adjustments based on serum drug concentrations not only positively influence the health economics balance but might also prevent certain side effects.

### Guselkumab in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis (DISCOVER-2): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^bcd92bc3]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The interleukin-23 (IL-23)/T-helper 17 cell pathway is implicated in psoriatic arthritis pathogenesis. Guselkumab, an IL-23 inhibitor that specifically binds the IL-23 p19 subunit, significantly and safely improved psoriatic arthritis in a phase 2 study. DISCOVER-2 was a phase 3 trial to assess guselkumab in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis.

Methods

This phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was done at 118 sites in 13 countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. We enrolled biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis (at least five swollen joints, at least five tender joints, and C-reactive protein ≥0·6 mg/dL) despite standard therapies. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1, computer-generated permuted blocks; stratified by baseline disease-modifying antirheumatic drug use and C-reactive protein concentration) to subcutaneous injections of guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks; guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0, 4, then every 8 weeks; or placebo. The primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) response at week 24 in all patients per assigned treatment group. Safety was assessed in all patients per treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03158285 (active, not recruiting).

Findings

From July 13, 2017, to Aug 3, 2018, 1153 patients were screened, of whom 741 were randomly assigned to receive guselkumab every 4 weeks (n=246), every 8 weeks (n=248), or placebo (n=247). One patient in the every 4 weeks group and one in the placebo group did not start treatment, and the remaining 739 patients started treatment; 716 patients continued treatment up to week 24. Significantly greater proportions of patients in the guselkumab every 4 weeks group (156 [64%] of 245 [95% CI 57-70]) and every 8 weeks group (159 [64%] of 248 [58-70]) than in the placebo group (81 [33%] of 246 [27-39]) achieved an ACR20 response at week 24 (percentage differences vs placebo 31% [95% CI 22-39] for the every 4 weeks group and 31% [23-40] for the every 8 weeks group; both p<0·0001). Up to week 24, serious adverse events occurred in eight (3%) of 245 patients receiving guselkumab every 4 weeks (three serious infections), three (1%) of 248 receiving guselkumab every 8 weeks (one serious infection), and seven (3%) of 246 receiving placebo (one serious infection). No deaths occurred.

Interpretation

Guselkumab, a human monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits IL-23 by binding the cytokine's p19 subunit, was efficacious and demonstrated an acceptable benefit-risk profile in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who were naive to treatment with biologics. These data support the use of selective inhibition of IL-23 to treat psoriatic arthritis.

### Guselkumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in the improvement of response until week 48, a real-life study [^13e2f964]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Guselkumab is an IL‐23 inhibitor that has been demonstrated to be effective and safe for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in clinical trials. The data pool relating to the use of guselkumab in a real‐life setting is still lacking. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in a real‐life setting, focusing on predictors of early clinical response, a single‐center prospective study was conducted enrolling patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. The clinical data relating to the efficacy and safety of the drug were acquired at initiation of treatment and at all subsequent clinical follow‐ups: the primary endpoint was PASI90 and PASI100 response at week 12, 24, and 48. Out of the total cohort of 74 patients, 62 (83.8) reached a 48‐week follow‐up 64 (87.8%) reached a 24‐week follow‐up, while 72 (97.3%) a 12‐week follow‐up. Treatment with guselkumab reduced the mean PASI from the initial 11 ± 6.3 to 2.5 ± 3.1 at 12 weeks, to 1.2 ± 1.8 at 24 weeks, and to 0.8 ± 1.6 at 48 weeks. At week 12, a PASI 90 and PASI 100 response was achieved by 44.4% and 23.6% of patients, respectively. After 24 weeks, 63% of patients reported a PASI 90 while 46.1% achieved PASI 100. Previous treatment with one or more other biologics did not impact significantly on the achievement of the PASI 90 and 100 at any endpoints analyzed. We reported no difference between bio‐naïve and non‐naïve patients in the response to guselkumab, high safety, and efficacy was showed in both populations.

3.2.1 Responses

The proportion of patients with an absolute PASI of ≤ 3, ≤ 2, or ≤ 1 increased over time, reaching a maximum of 96.0%, 86.7%, and 59.0%, respectively, at visit 7 in the overall population (Figure 1).

The proportion of patients with a PASI75 response increased after the start of treatment, reaching 98.5% at visit 7. The proportions of patients with PASI90 and PASI100 responses also increased over time, reaching 74.3% and 25.4%, respectively, at visit 7 (Figure S3). Compared with the biologic‐experienced group, a significantly greater proportion of biologic‐naïve patients achieved PASI75 (biologic‐naïve vs. biologic‐experienced, 99.4% vs. 94.9%, p = 0.0141) and PASI90 (78.0% vs. 59.0%, p = 0.0006) responses at visit 7.

### Treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with guselkumab: a review of phase II and phase III trials [^5be88fe2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody was recently approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. This article will review the available phase II and phase III guselkumab clinical trial data.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was conducted using the terms guselkumab, interleukin-23, psoriasis, adalimumab, and ustekinumab (January 2014 to August 2017).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles detailing the results of phase II and phase III clinical trials were selected for review.

Data Synthesis

In 1 phase II and 2 phase III clinical trials, guselkumab was more effective than adalimumab and placebo in reducing Physician's Global Assessment and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scores in those with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In a separate phase III trial, transitioning to guselkumab treatment was more effective than continued ustekinumab use in reducing IGA scores in those who were minimally responsive to ustekinumab ( P = 0.001). Trial results did not reveal specific patterns in adverse event (AE) incidence; the most commonly reported AEs were nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper-respiratory-tract infections. No increased incidence of malignancy, tuberculosis, or serious infections were observed with the use of guselkumab.

Conclusions

Guselkumab appears to be a safe and effective option for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in patients who have been screened for susceptibility to infection and are candidates for systemic treatment or phototherapy. However, long-term safety data are lacking.

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an interleukin-23p19-specific monoclonal antibody, through one year in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis [^087d91dd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Guselkumab, a human monoclonal antibody specific to interleukin-23p19, demonstrated efficacy and safety versus placebo through week 24 of the phase III DISCOVER-2 trial in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Here we report 1-year DISCOVER-2 findings.

Methods

Adults with active PsA (≥5 swollen and ≥5 tender joints; C-reactive protein level ≥0.6 mg/dl) despite standard nonbiologic treatment were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks, guselkumab 100 mg at week 0, week 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter, or placebo with crossover to guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks at week 24. We primarily evaluated clinical efficacy through week 52 by imputing missing data (nonresponse for categorical end points; no change/using multiple imputation for continuous end points). Observed radiographic scores and adverse events (AEs) were summarized.

Results

Of 739 randomized, treated patients, 93% completed week 52. The proportions of patients in whom a ≥20% improvement from baseline in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) was achieved were maintained after week 24, reaching 71% (173 of 245) and 75% (185 of 248) for patients randomized to receive treatment every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks, respectively, by week 52. The proportions of patients in whom ACR50/ACR70 and skin responses, minimal or very low disease activity, and dactylitis or enthesitis resolution were achieved at week 24 were also maintained through week 52. Further, low levels of radiographic progression, along with improvements in physical function and health-related quality of life, were sustained through week 52 with continued guselkumab treatment. Few patients experienced serious infections through week 52, with no evidence of a dosing regimen response or increase from weeks 0-24 (4 of 493 [0.8%]) to weeks 24-52 (3 of 493 [0.6%]) among guselkumab-randomized patients. No patient developed an opportunistic infection or died.

Conclusion

In biologic-naive PsA patients, guselkumab provided sustained improvements across diverse manifestations and maintained a favorable risk-benefit profile through week 52.

### Guselkumab efficacy after withdrawal is associated with suppression of serum IL-23-regulated IL-17 and IL-22 in psoriasis: VOYAGE 2 study [^33fd3d64]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guselkumab selectively inhibits IL-23 and in psoriasis, produces high clinical responses, including durable maintenance after treatment withdrawal in some patients. The relationships between IL-23 blockade, serum markers downstream of IL-23 signaling, and withdrawal were explored with guselkumab in VOYAGE 2.

Methods

At week 28, patients with ≥90% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index improvement from baseline (PASI 90) were rerandomized to withdrawal and received placebo (n = 182), or maintenance therapy (n = 193). The guselkumab withdrawal group reinitiated guselkumab upon loss of ≥50% of week- 28 PASI improvement or by week 72. Cytokine changes associated with psoriasis recurrence (serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23) after withdrawal were evaluated.

Results

Efficacy in the guselkumab maintenance group was sustained through week 72, whereas efficacy diminished in the guselkumab withdrawal group (PASI 90, 86.0% vs. 11.5%). After 20 weeks of retreatment, 80.4% of guselkumab withdrawal patients achieved PASI 90 responses versus baseline. Maintenance of response after withdrawal was associated with suppression of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. Increases in cytokine levels had poor predictive power for psoriasis reoccurrence as these increases lagged behind increases in PASI scores.

Conclusion

Upon guselkumab withdrawal, most patients lost clinical response and regained responses with retreatment. Correlation of IL-23 signaling serum cytokines increased with disease recurrence, supporting the role of IL-23 in expansion and maintenance of CD4+ T helper type 17, T helper type 22, and related CD8+ T-cell subsets producing IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22.

### Guselkumab, an inhibitor of the IL-23p19 subunit, provides sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis: 1 year results of a phase III randomised study of patients who were biologic-naïve or TNF α inhibitor-experienced [^80b2d7b7]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-23p19 subunit, in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) through 1year.

Methods

Adults who met ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis, with active disease (≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender joints; C reactive protein ≥0.3mg/dL) despite standard treatment (31% previously received ≤2 tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)), were randomised (1:1:1) to guselkumab 100mg every 4 weeks (Q4W); guselkumab 100mg at Week0, Week4, then Q8W; or placebo with cross-over to guselkumab 100mg Q4W at Week24 (PBO→Q4W) through Week48. Clinical efficacy through Week52 (employing non-responder imputation) and adverse events (AEs) through Week60 were evaluated.

Results

Of 381 treated patients, 90% completed the study. Numerical increases in the proportions of patients achieving ≥20% improvement in ACR criteria (ACR20) were observed post-Week24, reaching 73% (94/128) and 60% (76/127) for Q4W-randomised and Q8W-randomised patients, respectively, by Week52. Proportions of patients achieving ACR50/ACR70/skin responses and minimal/very low disease activity were maintained, as were improvements in physical function and health-related quality of life, through Week52 in guselkumab-randomised patients. Response to guselkumab was maintained in both TNFi-naïve and TNFi-experienced patients. Serious AEs and serious infections occurred in similar proportions of guselkumab Q4W-randomised (3% and 0%) and Q8W-randomised (6% and 2%) patients through Week60, with no new safety concerns versus observations through Week24. No guselkumab-treated patient and two patients receiving placebo died; no study participant developed opportunistic infection or inflammatory bowel disease.

Conclusion

Guselkumab provided sustained improvement across multiple clinical manifestations of PsA, maintaining a favourable benefit-risk profile, through 1year regardless of prior TNFi exposure.

Statistical analysis

DISCOVER‐2 sample size estimates were previously reported. All patients who continued treatment at week 24 received guselkumab; no formal hypothesis testing was planned.

As previously reported, treatment failure rules were applied to all clinical efficacy analyses through week 24, i.e. patients who discontinued study treatment, terminated study participation, initiated or increased doses of DMARDs or oral glucocorticoids, or initiated protocol‐prohibited PsA treatment were considered nonresponders for binary end points, or as having no change from baseline for continuous end points. Missing data were imputed as nonresponders for binary end points, and using multiple imputation (MI; assumed to be missing‐at‐random) for continuous end points. Radiographic data through week 24 were imputed using MI with no treatment failure rules. The week 24 data have been reported previously and are provided herein as context for evaluating week 52 data.

The statistical analysis plan prespecified summarizing observed efficacy data from week 24 to week 52 for patients continuing study treatment after week 24 (n = 712) (Figure 1). We also evaluated clinical (but not radiographic) efficacy data in all treated patients by randomized group (n = 739) with post hoc application of missing data imputation rules. Data missing due to treatment discontinuation were considered nonresponders for binary end points, or as having no change from baseline for continuous end points. Data missing for other reasons were imputed as nonresponders for binary end points, and using MI (assumed to be missing‐at‐random) for continuous end points. In this analysis, data provided for the 246 patients randomized to receive placebo followed by guselkumab every 4 weeks included 238 patients who crossed over to guselkumab treatment every 4 weeks and 8 patients who received only placebo prior to discontinuing treatment. Results based on these imputed data are the focus of this article; observed ACR responses are shown for reference.

### Long-term efficacy of guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis: results from the phase 3 VOYAGE 1 trial through two years [^1048e688]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Due to the chronic nature of psoriasis, it is important to assess the sustained response of treatments over time.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of continuous treatment with guselkumab (an interleukin-23 blocker) through two years in the phase 3 VOYAGE 1 trial.

Methods

Patients were randomized to placebo, guselkumab, or adalimumab at baseline. Placebo-randomized patients crossed over to guselkumab at week 16 (placebo→guselkumab) and adalimumab-randomized patients crossed over to guselkumab at week 52 (adalimumab→guselkumab); all patients received open-label guselkumab beyond week 52. Efficacy was assessed based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; proportion of patients achieving ≥75%, 90%, or 100% improvement [PASI 75/90/100]) and the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA; proportion achieving nearly clear [IGA 0/1] or completely clear [IGA 0]). As pre-specified, efficacy data were analyzed using non-responder imputation (NRI; patients with missing data counted as non-responders) after applying treatment failure rules (TFR; patients meeting TFR counted as non-responders thereafter) through week 48 and by applying TFR only from week 52 through 100. All endpoints were also analyzed using NRI and As Observed methodology for the guselkumab group through week 100.

Results

The clinical responses were maintained through week 100 based on all three analyses. Based on pre-specified analyses, proportions of patients who achieved PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100, IGA 0/1, and IGA 0 were 94.8%, 82.1%, 49.0%, 82.4%, and 53.8%, respectively, at week 100. Results were similar for the placebo→guselkumab and adalimumab→guselkumab groups at week 100. As expected, proportions of patients achieving these endpoints were similar based on As Observed analyses and slightly lower when the more conservative NRI rules were applied.

Conclusions

High levels of efficacy were maintained through two years of continuous treatment among guselkumab-treated patients, and efficacy improved through two years among adalimumab-treated patients who crossed over to guselkumab at one year. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(8):826-832.

### Guselkumab: mid-term effectiveness, drug survival, and safety in real clinical practice [^062ad387]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Guselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin-G1-lambda (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23. Few series of real clinical practice that reflect the use of guselkumab have been published so far, including the measure of survival at more than 52weeks. An observational, longitudinal, retrospective study of real clinical practice of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving treatment with guselkumab 100mg subcutaneous every 8weeks in five tertiary hospitals in Andalusia (Spain) was carried out. A total of 87 patients were included in this study. Disease severity and treatment response was assessed by PASI, BSA, VAS pruritus, and DLQI at baseline and after 4, 12, 24, 36, 52, and 76weeks. Data are presented as mean±SD for continuous variables, and number and percentage for categorical variables. To determine the differences between visits in PASI, BSA, VAS pruritus, and DLQI a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was performed. The survival of guselkumab was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Our population presented with a mean age of 49.9years, 60.9% of them were male, had a mean PSO evolution of 20.4 (9.5) years. A total of 79.3% were obese or presented with overweight and had several comorbidities (dyslipidemia 28.7%, arterial hypertension 23% and 20% diabetes among others). At baseline their disease parameters were: PASI = 14.6 (7.2), BSA = 22.3 (16.6), VAS pruritus = 6.0 (2), and DLQI = 15.8 (5). After 52weeks their disease improved to PASI = 0.9 (1.1), BSA = 1.0 (1.8), VAS pruritus = 0.47 (0.88), and DLQI = 1.54 (2.50). The percentage of patients who achieved PASI 75, 90, and 100 at 52weeks was 90.3%, 71%, and 51.6%, respectively. The patients evaluated at week 76 (n = 3) reached PASI 0, BSA 0, and DLQI 0. After 93.4weeks (1year, 9months, and 14days), the overall survival rate was 94% (4 events were reported). A total of four patients discontinue to AE or lack of efficacy after 76weeks. Guselkumab showed excellent results in the control of psoriasis in the mid-term with an elevated number of patients maintaining treatment after 52 to 76weeks and a good safety profile.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 12-week efficacy, safety and speed of response from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^1442ea6e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 1393 patients screened for the study, 1027 patients were randomized to receive treatment: 507 to guselkumab and 520 to ixekizumab, including 209 (20%) patients from Canada and 818 (80%) from the U.S.A. The completion rate was 94% (970/1027) for the first 12 weeks. More details are provided in Figure 1.

Figure 1 
Disposition of the patients. Details are given according to thestatement for reporting randomized controlled trials.

Baseline characteristics were well‐balanced between the randomized treatment groups (Table 1). The patients had a mean (± SD) age of 49·0 ± 14·4 years and 37% (375/1027) were women. The primary outcome was complete skin clearance, as measured by PASI 100 response at week 12. PASI 100 was achieved in 41% (215/520) of patients in the ixekizumab group vs. 25% (126/507) of patients in the guselkumab group with an odds ratio (OR) of 2·14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·63–2·81, P < 0·001; Fig. 2 a, Table 2].

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 12-week efficacy, safety and speed of response from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^e6f27a87]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Patients with psoriasis value rapid and complete skin clearance. No head‐to‐head studies have focused on early responses to interleukin ‐17 vs.‐23 inhibitors.

Objectives

To compare early and complete skin clearance by the‐17A inhibitor ixekizumab vs. the‐23p19 inhibitor guselkumab.

Methods

‐R, a 24‐week, randomized, double‐blinded study, enrolled adults with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis [static Physician's Global Assessment of Disease score of ≥ 3, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ≥ 12, and ≥ 10% body surface area]. Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive the approved dose of subcutaneous ixekizumab or guselkumab. Primary end point was 100% improvement in(100) at week 12. Major secondary end points included other levels of improvedandat different time points. Comparisons were made using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test with a multiple testing strategy. Nonresponder imputation was used for missing data. After the completion of the study, the final secondary end point (100 at 24 weeks) and safety data through week 24 will be reported.

Results

In total, 1027 patients were randomized. The primary end point100 at week 12 was met [215/520 ixekizumab (41%); 126/507 guselkumab (25%); P < 0·001]. All major secondary end points measured up to week 12 were met, including50 at week 1 and75 at week 2. Serious adverse event frequency was 3% for each group; no new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

Ixekizumab was superior to guselkumab for rapidly improving signs and symptoms in patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis by week 12. Adverse events were similar to previous ixekizumab and guselkumab studies. Compared with the‐23 inhibitor guselkumab, ixekizumab can offer complete skin clearance more rapidly to patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis.

What's already known about this topic?

Patients with plaque psoriasis desire both high levels of clearance and rapid onset of treatment effects.
Ixekizumab, a high‐affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin (IL)‐17A, has demonstrated greater and faster skin clearance than etanercept and ustekinumab, with consistent long‐term efficacy, safety and durability of response.
Clinical trial data and systematic reviews have suggested that IL‐17 inhibitors can improve a patient's psoriasis more rapidly than IL‐23 inhibitors.

What does this study add?

The head‐to‐head study design directly compares the efficacy and speed of response of ixekizumab and the IL‐23 inhibitor guselkumab in moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis.
The primary end point was met, showing superiority of ixekizumab over guselkumab for achieving complete skin clearance at week 12.
The safety profile of ixekizumab was consistent with previous studies.
Ixekizumab can deliver patients complete skin clearance and improved quality of life more rapidly than guselkumab.

### The use of interleukin 23 inhibitors in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection: a case series [^804c2c1c]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 1–guselkumab

A 14-year-old Guatemalan woman presented to our dermatology clinic with severe generalized plaque psoriasis primarily involving her scalp, forehead, elbows, abdomen, and shins. She was previously treated with ultrapotent topical steroids, methotrexate, and ustekinumab without sufficient improvement.

At the initial presentation, she had an affected total body surface area (BSA) of 7% and a physician global assessment (PGA) score of 3. She had tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core IgG antibody in the past. Her HBV DNA load at baseline was 1.5 IU/mL (log10). Baseline liver function tests results showed normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 36 and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 59. Given the laboratory test results, she was considered to be in a chronic inactive carrier state for HBV.

Despite 28 weeks of ustekinumab therapy, the patient still had 3% BSA/PGA 3 with residual plaques on the scalp and forehead. Because the only other biologic that was approved for her age at the time of treatment was etanercept, the decision was made to use off-label guselkumab with concurrent entecavir 0.5 mg daily.

After 36 weeks on guselkumab, her BSA was 2% with a PGA of 2. She continued to have low-grade transaminitis (ALT, 71 and AST, 80) but her HBV DNA load remained low. Guselkumab treatment was stopped at 39 weeks because of limited improvement and she switched to ixekizumab, which she eventually achieved PGA 0 on. Refer to Table II for laboratory test results.

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, compared with adalimumab for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis with randomized withdrawal and retreatment: results from the phase III, double-blind, placebo-and active comparator-controlled VOYAGE 2 trial [^0dce86ac]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Phase II data suggested that guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, was efficacious in psoriasis.

Objective

We sought to assess efficacy and safety of guselkumab in moderate to severe psoriasis versus placebo and adalimumab, including interrupted treatment and switching adalimumab nonresponders to guselkumab.

Methods

Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg (weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; n = 496); placebo→guselkumab (weeks 0, 4, and 12 then guselkumab at weeks 16 and 20; n = 248); or adalimumab (80 mg week 0, then 40 mg week 1, and every 2 weeks through week 23; n = 248). At week 28, guselkumab 90% or greater improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline (PASI 90) responders were rerandomized to guselkumab or placebo with guselkumab after loss of response. Placebo→guselkumab responders and adalimumab responders received placebo, then guselkumab after loss of response. Nonresponders received guselkumab.

Results

At week 16, more patients receiving guselkumab achieved an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score 0/1 (cleared/minimal) (84.1% vs 8.5%) and PASI 90 (70.0% vs 2.4%) versus placebo (coprimary end points). Guselkumab was superior to adalimumab at week 16 (IGA score 0/1, 75% or greater improvement in PASI score from baseline, and PASI 90) and week 24 (IGA score 0/1 and 0, PASI 90, 100% improvement in PASI score from baseline) (P < .001). From weeks 28 to 48, better persistence of response was observed in guselkumab maintenance versus withdrawal groups (P < .001). Of adalimumab nonresponders who switched to guselkumab, 66.1% achieved PASI 90 at week 48. Guselkumab improved patient-reported outcomes. Adverse events were comparable among groups.

Limitations

One-year follow-up limits retreatment data.

Conclusions

Guselkumab is a highly effective, well-tolerated, maintenance therapy, including in adalimumab nonresponders.
