## Question

52 yo F with metastatic breast cancer (ER-, HER2+) presenting with severe back pain due to newly diagnosed spinal mets; current meds: trastuzumab, dexamethasone, sertraline. Given inadequate pain control with acetaminophen, palliative consulting recommends starting codeine 30 mg q4h PRN. She has a history of severe itching and rash with morphine (not anaphylaxis). Proceed to prescribe codeine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether codeine should be prescribed for a 52-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer and severe back pain from spinal metastases, given a history of severe itching and rash with morphine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pain syndrome and whether a weak opioid like codeine is appropriate for severe cancer pain. Then, I should verify cross-reactivity and the risk of repeating a morphine-like reaction with codeine. Next, I will review codeine's pharmacology, including CYP2D6 dependence and prodrug status. After that, I need to check guideline recommendations for opioid selection in moderate-to-severe cancer pain and in renal impairment. Finally, I will consider safer alternatives, dosing principles, and a practical recommendation with monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pain severity. Severe cancer pain from bone metastases, especially spinal disease, typically requires a strong opioid rather than a weak opioid, and guidelines emphasize initiating strong opioids for moderate-to-severe pain with early titration to effect, reserving weak opioids for mild-to-moderate pain or when strong opioids are contraindicated [^04f38a2b] [^3eaed686] [^ce1ccd98].

> Wait, let me verify the cross-reactivity concern before jumping to conclusions. Codeine and morphine are both phenanthrene opioids, and cross-sensitivity for pruritus and rash is plausible; case-based evidence documents delayed-type systemic allergic dermatitis to morphine with positive patch testing to codeine, supporting structural cross-reactivity within this class, so a prior severe pruritic rash to morphine meaningfully increases the risk of a similar reaction to codeine [^a9c483a8] [^2fe95eec] [^cef705ec].

> I need to check codeine's pharmacology next. Codeine is a prodrug that requires CYP2D6 metabolism to morphine for analgesia, with only about 5–10% converted to morphine; patients with CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status may have little to no analgesia, while ultrarapid metabolizers can have excessive morphine exposure and toxicity, and sertraline can inhibit CYP2D6, further reducing codeine's effectiveness in this patient [^5d247ff6] [^1fe09ccb] [^ed1d7f3e] [^743f1552].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions on codeine for cancer pain. Contemporary ASCO guidance notes that tramadol and codeine have limitations that make them less desirable in many settings, and for moderate-to-severe pain, strong opioids are preferred; ESMO similarly recommends oral morphine as first-line for moderate-to-severe cancer pain, with weak opioids considered only for mild-to-moderate pain or when strong opioids are not tolerated or available [^de34e76b] [^3eaed686] [^ccacf578].

> I should confirm renal considerations as well. Codeine and its metabolites are renally cleared, and in significant renal impairment, accumulation of active metabolites can increase toxicity; guidelines advise avoiding morphine, codeine, and tramadol in renal impairment unless no alternatives exist, and to prefer agents with non-renal pathways or careful monitoring if used, which argues against routine codeine use in this context without a compelling rationale [^9d298630] [^908f0ad1] [^25300182].

> Let me consider safer, more effective alternatives. Given severe pain and the prior morphine reaction, a synthetic opioid from a different class, such as fentanyl (phenylpiperidine) or methadone (diphenylheptane), reduces cross-reactivity risk and offers distinct pharmacokinetics; fentanyl is commonly used transdermally or transmucosally and is less associated with pruritus than morphine/codeine, while methadone is useful in renal impairment but requires experienced prescribers; if a strong oral opioid is preferred, oxycodone or hydromorphone are reasonable, with close monitoring for tolerability and rotation if adverse effects emerge [^a9c483a8] [^61298a8e] [^12330cb4] [^aebcddee].

> But wait, what if the team is concerned about starting too high on the "ladder"? I should double-check that the WHO ladder has evolved. The WHO no longer mandates a stepwise approach, and modern guidance supports initiating opioids at the level commensurate with pain severity, so moving directly to a strong opioid for severe pain is appropriate, with PRN immediate-release dosing and early reassessment for titration and breakthrough needs [^ce1ccd98] [^04f38a2b] [^9cfdf102].

> I will now examine practical prescribing and safety steps. If a strong opioid is chosen, start low and titrate to effect, provide education on constipation prophylaxis and nausea management, and ensure naloxone access when indicated; for breakthrough pain, use an immediate-release dose approximating 5–20% of the total daily morphine equivalent, and in renal impairment, monitor closely and consider rotation to methadone if accumulation or neurotoxicity is a concern [^f83d0bb7] [^a91242fe] [^9d298630].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, I would not prescribe codeine here. The pain is severe and requires a strong opioid, codeine's analgesia is unreliable due to CYP2D6 variability and may be further reduced by sertraline, and the prior severe pruritic rash to morphine raises a meaningful risk of cross-reactivity with codeine; instead, I would initiate a strong opioid such as fentanyl, methadone, oxycodone, or hydromorphone, selected based on renal function, prior opioid exposure, and prescriber expertise, with close monitoring and a plan for adverse effect prevention and breakthrough dosing [^04f38a2b] [^3eaed686] [^a9c483a8] [^743f1552] [^9d298630].

---

Do not prescribe **codeine** for this patient. Given her severe back pain from spinal metastases, codeine is unlikely to provide adequate analgesia because it is a weak opioid and a prodrug requiring CYP2D6 metabolism, which is variable and may be inhibited by sertraline [^de34e76b] [^743f1552]. More importantly, her prior severe pruritus and rash with morphine signals a high risk of cross-reactivity with codeine, as both are phenanthrene opioids [^a9c483a8] [^2fe95eec]. ASCO recommends avoiding codeine in patients with prior opioid adverse effects and instead using a synthetic opioid (e.g. fentanyl, methadone, or meperidine) or a different chemical class to minimize cross-reactivity [^notfound]. If a strong opioid is needed, start low and titrate cautiously, and consider opioid rotation if adverse effects recur [^61298a8e].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

### Codeine metabolism and analgesic efficacy

Codeine is a **prodrug** that requires CYP2D6 metabolism to morphine for analgesia; about 5–10% is converted to morphine, with the rest forming inactive metabolites [^5d247ff6]. Analgesic response varies with CYP2D6 genotype, and poor metabolizers may have little to no effect, while ultrarapid metabolizers risk toxicity [^ed1d7f3e]. Sertraline inhibits CYP2D6, which can reduce codeine's analgesic efficacy [^notfound].

---

### Cross-reactivity and hypersensitivity

Morphine and codeine are both phenanthrene opioids; cross-reactivity for pruritus and rash is common, and prior morphine reactions predict codeine reactions [^a9c483a8] [^2fe95eec]. ASCO advises avoiding codeine in patients with prior opioid adverse effects and choosing agents from different chemical classes to reduce cross-reactivity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized opioid selection** based on prior reactions, comorbidities, and drug interactions:

- **ASCO**: Avoid codeine in patients with prior opioid adverse effects; consider synthetic opioids (fentanyl, methadone, meperidine) or different chemical classes to minimize cross-reactivity [^notfound].
- **ESMO**: For moderate-to-severe cancer pain, prefer strong opioids (e.g. morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone); use weak opioids (codeine, tramadol) only if strong opioids are contraindicated or unavailable [^notfound].
- **WHO**: Recommends rapid, effective pain control with opioids tailored to severity, but does not specifically address cross-reactivity; nonetheless, it supports avoiding agents with prior adverse reactions [^ce1ccd98].

---

## Alternative opioid options

Given the risk of cross-reactivity and codeine's limited efficacy, consider:

| **Opioid** | **Chemical class** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Fentanyl | Phenylpiperidine | - Synthetic <br/> - Minimal cross-reactivity with phenanthrenes <br/> - Suitable for severe pain |
| Methadone | Diphenylheptane | - Different class <br/> - Minimal cross-reactivity <br/> - Useful in renal impairment |
| Meperidine | Phenylpiperidine | - Synthetic <br/> - Minimal cross-reactivity <br/> - Short-acting for acute pain |
| Oxycodone | Phenanthrene | - Different class <br/> - Minimal cross-reactivity <br/> - Useful if fentanyl/methadone unavailable |

---

## Clinical management strategies

If an opioid is still indicated, use the following strategies:

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at the lowest effective dose and titrate cautiously, monitoring for adverse effects [^9cfdf102].
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for recurrence of pruritus, rash, or other hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Opioid rotation**: If adverse effects occur, rotate to a different opioid class or agent with different pharmacokinetics [^61298a8e].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Consider NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, or antidepressants to enhance analgesia and reduce opioid requirements [^8a81d039].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not prescribe **codeine** for this patient. The risk of cross-reactivity with morphine is high, and codeine's analgesic efficacy is uncertain due to CYP2D6 variability and sertraline inhibition. Choose a synthetic opioid from a different class (e.g. fentanyl or methadone) and titrate cautiously with close monitoring.

Since the establishment of the WHO three-step ladder for management of cancer pain, several controversies have arisen, which are partly due to new drug development, reformulations of older analgesics, and technological advancements. As a result, clinicians need clarification of several questions. Is morphine the opioid of choice for moderate to severe pain in cancer? Should combinations of opioids be used? When should spinal opioids be used to treat pain in cancer? What are the appropriate opioid doses for breakthrough pain? Should selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 2 inhibitors be used? What is the best tactic to treat neuropathic pain, and what first-line adjuvant analgesic should be used? And do bisphosphonates relieve bone pain in cancers other than breast cancer and myeloma? This review addresses these questions.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results Recommendations Introduction 1In most cases, moderate-to-severe cancer pain can be effectively managed with available medications, including opioids. Opioids have long been the foundation of cancer pain management, yet serious challenges to their use exist, including a striking lack of research to guide clinical practice in this population. Compounding an insufficient scientific foundation are interventions designed to combat the current epidemic of opioid misuse and related deaths.

23; methadone in relation to morphine 27; transdermal fentanyl in relation to oral morphine or other active agents. 40This was based largely on a 2016 trial by Bandieri et al, 71which compared weak opioids to low-dose morphine in 240 patients with moderate cancer pain. A ≥ 20% reduction in pain intensity occurred in 88% of patients treated with low-dose morphine and 58% of patients treated with a weak opioid. Clinical interpretation. 62-65These drugs were considered step 2 in the three-step opioid analgesic ladder by the WHO and a step required before starting strong immediate-release and extended-release opioids. A number of studies found no major advantage in using the step 2 drugs, 71and the most recent WHO guideline dropped the analgesic ladder as universally required for opioid initiation. 63However, these drugs are usually well tolerated and inexpensive.

Moreover, it is possible to determine in just a few days if they will be able to control pain or if a strong regularly dosed opioid without acetaminophen will be needed. 72) may have less response to codeine. Although tests for CYP2D6 polymorphism are available, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against their use in guiding opioid selection or dosing. In addition, drugs that inhibit or compete for CYP2D6 might reduce the analgesic effects of codeine.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^aebcddee]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — opioid-induced pruritus — reports it is "More frequent after neuraxial delivery" and "May be more common with opiates (eg, morphine and codeine) than synthetic agents". Recommended measures are to "Rule out other causes (uremia, cholestasis, some malignancies, HIV, and medications)", "Rotate to synthetic opioid (eg, fentanyl)", use "Nonsedating antihistamines before opioid administration if feasible" or "Sedating antihistamines such as hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine if no excessive sedation", consider "5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron (although conflicting data)" and "Mixed agonist/antagonists such as nalbuphine alone or in combination with existing opioid (caution is advised in patients who are opioid-tolerant as this may reduce analgesic effect or cause abstinence)", and that "Low-dose naloxone (0.25 μg/kg/h) infusion may be considered".

Regarding medical management for cancer pain, more specifically with respect to opioids, dose adjustments, AAHPM/ASCO/HPNA/MASCC/NICSO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider rotating to methadone for patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid, if not contraindicated, as this agent is excreted fecally. Carefully titrate and frequently monitor opioids primarily eliminated in urine, such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, for risk of accumulation of the parent drug or active metabolites. Avoid using morphine, meperidine, codeine, or tramadol in this population unless there are no alternatives.

### Codeine, alone and with paracetamol (acetaminophen), for cancer pain [^919da0e6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is very common in patients with cancer. Opioid analgesics, including codeine, play a significant role in major guidelines on the management of cancer pain, particularly for mild to moderate pain. Codeine is widely available and inexpensive, which may make it a good choice, especially in low-resource settings. Its use is controversial, in part because codeine is not effective in a minority of patients who cannot convert it to its active metabolite (morphine), and also because of concerns about potential abuse, and safety in children.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of codeine used alone or in combination with paracetamol for relieving cancer pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 2), MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to 5 March 2014, supplemented by searches of clinical trial registries and screening of the reference lists of the identified studies and reviews in the field.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomised, double-blind, controlled trials using single or multiple doses of codeine, with or without paracetamol, for the treatment of cancer pain. Trials could have either parallel or cross-over design, with at least 10 participants per treatment group. Studies in children or adults reporting on any type, grade, and stage of cancer were eligible. We accepted any formulation, dosage regimen, and route of administration of codeine, and both placebo and active controls.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently read the titles and abstracts of all studies identified by the searches and excluded those that clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. For the remaining studies, two authors read the full manuscripts and assessed them for inclusion. We resolved discrepancies between review authors by discussion. Included studies were described qualitatively, since no meta-analysis was possible because of the small amount of data identified, and clinical and methodological between-study heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 15 studies including 721 participants with cancer pain due to diverse types of malignancy. All studies were performed on adults; there were no studies on children. The included studies were of adequate methodological quality, but all except for one were judged to be at a high risk of bias because of small study size, and six because of methods used to deal with missing data or high withdrawal rates. Three studies used a parallel group design; the remainder were cross-over trials in which there was an adequate washout period, but only one reported results for treatment periods separately. Twelve studies used codeine as a single agent and three combined it with paracetamol. Ten studies included a placebo arm, and 14 included one or more of 16 different active drug comparators or compared different routes of administration. Most studies investigated the effect of a single dose of medication, while five used treatment periods of one, seven or 21 days. Most studies used codeine at doses of 30 mg to 120 mg. There were insufficient data for any pooled analysis. Only two studies reported our preferred responder outcome of 'participants with at least 50% reduction in pain' and two reported 'participants with no worse than mild pain'. Eleven studies reported treatment group mean measures of pain intensity or pain relief; overall for these outcome measures, codeine or codeine plus paracetamol was numerically superior to placebo and equivalent to the active comparators. Adverse event reporting was poor: only two studies reported the number of participants with any adverse event specified by treatment group and only one reported the number of participants with any serious adverse event. In multiple-dose studies nausea, vomiting and constipation were common, with somnolence and dizziness frequent in the 21-day study. Withdrawal from the studies, where reported, was less than 10% except in two studies. There were three deaths, in all cases due to the underlying cancer.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified only a small amount of data in studies that were both randomised and double-blind. Studies were small, of short duration, and most had significant shortcomings in reporting. The available evidence indicates that codeine is more effective against cancer pain than placebo, but with increased risk of nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Uncertainty remains as to the magnitude and time-course of the analgesic effect and the safety and tolerability in longer-term use. There were no data for children.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^16d49225]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Nonopioid-refractory pain and the role of step 2 combination opioids: Most patients who report unrelieved pain with nonopioids initially receive as-needed, immediate-release opioid agents such as codeine, hydrocodone, or oxycodone combined with acetaminophen; these drugs were considered step 2 in the three-step opioid analgesic ladder by the WHO and a step required before starting immediate-release and extended-release opioids (step 3), but the most recent WHO guideline dropped the analgesic ladder as universally required for opioid initiation; these agents are usually well tolerated and inexpensive, and response can often be determined in just a few days to decide whether a strong regularly dosed opioid without acetaminophen will be needed.

### Current and future management of HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer | JCO oncology practice… [^b561f75d]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

For most patients, a taxane combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the first-line setting, followed by trastuzumab-emtansine in second line, should be considered the standard of care today. However, chemo-free anti-HER2 strategies in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer could also be considered in selected patients. In the third-line setting and beyond, several emerging anti-HER2 therapies are becoming available, including tucatinib, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, neratinib, and margetuximab-cmkb. In addition, new compounds and combinations are showing promising results in the late-line setting. First-line Treatment Options Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Chemotherapy The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab and a single-agent chemotherapeutic should be the standard first-line treatment for most patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.

Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 extracellular domain II, which prevents dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors and together with trastuzumab allow a more comprehensive signaling blockade. 7, 8The approval of pertuzumab is based on the results of the CLEOPATRA trial. 9This phase III study compared the efficacy of trastuzumab and docetaxel with pertuzumab or placebo as first-line treatment in 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Of note, only 10% of patients had already received trastuzumab in early disease with an interval of at least 12 months between completion of the adjuvant therapy and the diagnosis of metastasis. 9, 13This is consistent with results from the PHEREXA trial, where pertuzumab added to capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients previously treated in the advanced disease with trastuzumab-based therapy showed consistent activity.

14Of note, no data exist about the value of pertuzumab in patients who received prior pertuzumab or T-DM1 in the adjuvant setting. In our opinion, pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy should be considered in most patients relapsing > 12 months from the last dose of anti-HER2 therapy. Another important aspect is that CLEOPATRA did not allow maintenance endocrine therapy. Thus, the value of endocrine therapy in this setting is unknown. 13 Beyond Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, and T-DM1 Today, there is no clear therapeutic algorithm for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have progressed to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1. Fortunately, several drugs have been recently approved in this setting and should be considered, although the optimal sequence of drugs is unknown.

Therefore, the treatment choice is complicated and must consider characteristics of the patients, such as their medical history, toxicities with prior lines, time to progression, location of metastasis, personal preferences, and cost. 32The phase II trial HER2CLIMB evaluated tucatinib combined with trastuzumab and capecitabine in 612 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1. 33Patients with brain metastases were included unless they needed immediate local intervention. Of note, brain magnetic resonance imaging at baseline was required for all patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either tucatinib or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. In this trial, 47. 5% of patients had brain metastases at baseline. The study was positive for its primary end point, with a median PFS of 7. 8 months in the tucatinib arm versus
5. 6 months in the placebo group.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^c3a20ac9]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid prescribing — agent selection and cautions: Reasonable, first line opioid choices for mild pain often include tramadol, codeine, Tapentadol, or hydrocodone; for second line mild to moderate pain therapy, clinicians can start with hydrocodone or oxycodone; and for severe pain, first line therapy may begin with hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, or morphine, with second line therapy with fentanyl and third line therapy with methadone. Buprenorphine should be considered as a viable alternative to strong opioids in moderate to severe chronic pain therapy, and the literature suggests that codeine and tramadol may confer a lower abuse risk than more potent opioids. Meperidine is not recommended for chronic pain treatment due to adverse neurological events, which are increased with long-term use, renal insufficiency, and concurrent benzodiazepine use.

Cancer pain — dose-directed pain management algorithm: After full clinical and pain assessment with categorization as mild, moderate, or severe, the algorithm specifies for mild pain to begin treatment acetaminophen 1 g q 4–6 hours, max 4 g/24 hours, and add NSAID (e.g. ibuprofen 400 mg q 6–8 hours) with ulcer prophylaxis if required; for moderate pain, add a weak opioid, e.g. codeine phosphate 15–60 mg q 4–6 hours, max 240 mg/24 hours; for severe pain, begin with strong opioid, e.g. oral morphine 30 mg/24 hours (opioid naive), 60 mg/24 hours (has had previous opioid treatment), and titrate using immediate release or sustained release morphine; if cancer pain persists, continue dose titration and consider switching opioid or route of administration or both if pain is not controlled or side effects are intractable; if not, continue current management and review pain regularly.

### Systemic therapy for HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer: moving into a new era… [^90abc9eb]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, first-line treatment should be pertuzumab–trastuzumab–docetaxel/paclitaxel regardless of hormone receptor status. A taxane should be given for at least six cycles, if tolerated, followed by maintenance pertuzumab–trastuzumab until progression. In patients with hormone receptor–positive disease, ovarian function suppression should also be added for pre- and perimenopausal women. Based on the DESTINY-Breast03 study, trastuzumab deruxtecan seems to be the preferred second-line therapy after patient progression while receiving a taxane and trastuzumab in the first-line setting. The combination of tucatinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab or trastuzumab deruxtecan may be used in the second-line setting in select patients with brain metastases.

If trastuzumab deruxtecan is not available, trastuzumab emtansine continues to be the preferred second-line treatment option after progression while taking a taxane and trastuzumab. Tucatinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab; trastuzumab deruxtecan; and T-DM1 appear to be the most active individual treatment options in the third-line setting. The choice of treatment depends on prior second-line therapy, patient characteristics, toxicity profile, and availability. In later lines of therapy, lapatinib is an evidence-based therapy option to be used preferably in combinations. Neratinib or margetuximab can be considered reasonable approaches in the late-line scenario. Although there are no comparative data, the most appropriate setting might be in patients who have exhausted all standard therapy options.

First-line Therapy When HER2-positive MBC is diagnosed, HER2 blockade should be usually offered based on the great benefit obtained in different clinical trials conducted in the past two decades. In a pivotal study, Slamon and colleagues 1showed that adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy improved both progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone. This study was a revolutionary change in the way of treating these patients. Since then, different approaches have tried to optimize trastuzumab-based therapy. For patients with previously untreated MBC, the combination of a taxane with trastuzumab and pertuzumab is the current best option of treatment. The phase III CLEOPATRA clinical trial included 808 patients randomly assigned to two arms: 75 mg/m. 2of intravenous docetaxel and 8 mg/kg of a trastuzumab loading dose and then 6 mg/kg intravenously plus 840 mg of a pertuzumab loading dose and then 420 mg intravenously or placebo every 3 weeks.

The duration of chemotherapy is recommended for no fewer than six cycles of docetaxel. 2Paclitaxel is also an alternative for these patients, with evidence from the PERUSE clinical trial, a phase IIIb study of either docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel administered in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The role of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and endocrine therapy has been explored in the randomized phase II PERTAIN trial. This study enrolled postmenopausal patients into two arms: pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus aromatase inhibitors or trastuzumab plus aromatase inhibitors. 4 Although the role of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with no chemotherapy has not been explored in large phase III studies, there is a small, randomized phase II study that suggests chemotherapy should be given to the double blockade.

Results

Patients

A total of 1105 women met the eligibility criteria. Patients had a median age of 61 (range, 52–70); 57% were Caucasian and 23% were African-American (Table 1). Slightly over half (55%) had metastases to the bone only, while 45% also had metastases to another site (25% liver, 18% lung, and 14% brain). Data were not collected on which site of metastases was the first to be diagnosed. For those who had a stage recorded in the electronic medical record (n = 749), 307 (49%) had stage IV disease as the earliest stage recorded. We note that the stage distribution does not reflect a typical distribution at diagnosis because patients had to have bone metastases to be included in the study. The median time from cancer diagnosis to diagnosis of bone metastases was 20.5 months. Fifteen percent had breast cancer and bone metastases diagnoses on the same day, and another 10% had the bone metastases diagnosis within 30 days of the original cancer diagnosis.

### Enhertu effective in HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer-NCI… [^2adea5ee]. NCI (2021). Medium credibility.

Enhertu May Be Preferred Therapy for Some Metastatic Breast Cancers, by Elia Ben-Ari UPDATE: On May 4, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan for the treatment of some adults with HER2-positive breast cancer who have previously received a HER2-targeted therapy. Under the approval, the drug can be used in such adults.
- if their cancer has spread or cannot be treated with surgery
- if they received the HER2-targeted therapy before or after surgery for early-stage breast cancer and their cancer returned during, or within 6 months of completing, that treatment The approval was based on the results of the DESTINY-Breast03 trial, details of which are discussed in the story below. A new targeted drug markedly lengthened the time that people with an aggressive subtype of metastatic breast cancer lived without their cancer progressing, new study results show.

In a head-to-head comparison, trastuzumab deruxtecan was also better at shrinking tumors than another targeted drug, trastuzumab emtansine. Since 2013, trastuzumab emtansine, commonly abbreviated as T-DM1, has been the preferred second-line treatment for people with metastatic breast cancer that overproduces the HER2 protein, known as HER2-positive breast cancer. Interim results of the clinical trial, which compared the two drugs in people whose disease had progressed after treatment with at least one earlier regimen for metastatic breast cancer, were presented September 18 at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2021. Although the trial is ongoing, a planned interim analysis of data from the study showed a clear difference between the two treatments.

Twelve months after treatment started, the cancer was still under control in nearly 76% of people in the trastuzumab deruxtecan, or T-DXd group, compared with 34% of those treated with T-DM1, said senior study investigator Sara Hurvitz, M. D., of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. The superior response to T-DXd was "very impressive" and suggests that this drug should be the new standard second-line treatment for such patients, said Alexandra Zimmer, M. D., clinical director of the Women's Malignancies Branch in NCI's Center for Cancer Research, who was not involved with the study. "In my 15 years of experience as a breast cancer clinician, I've never seen such a marked improvement in efficacy with a new drug compared to the current standard therapy for metastatic breast cancer, so it really is quite exciting for our patients, " Dr. Hurvitz said.

Trastuzumab and other drugs called monoclonal antibodies that target HER2 have been quite successful as treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer. As a result, researchers have been developing new drugs based on these antibodies. Both T-DM1 and T-DXd, which are given by infusion into a vein, are drugs known as antibody–drug conjugates. Such drugs consist of a monoclonal antibody, in this case trastuzumab, chemically linked to a cell-killing chemotherapy drug. Findings from a smaller clinical trial called DESTINY-Breast01, which were published last year, led the Food and Drug Administration to grant accelerated approval to T-DXd as a treatment for people with inoperable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had received at least two prior lines of HER2-targeted treatment. Those results, which showed that tumors responded to T-DXd in about 60% of patients who had already received numerous prior treatments, "were already impressive, " Dr. Zimmer said.

Genetic variability in codeine metabolism — prodrug status and CYP2D6 dependence — emphasizes that codeine lacks intrinsic analgesia and requires metabolic activation: Codeine is a prodrug with limited affinity for the μ-opioid receptor and no analgesic effects, and after an oral dose the majority undergoes hepatic glucuronidation or n-demethylation to inactive metabolites; analgesic properties derive from conversion of codeine to morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide, with conversion regulated by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme system.

### Catalyzing pharmacogenomic analysis for informing pain treatment (C-PAIN): a randomized trial of preemptiveGenotyping in cancer palliative care [^6b91af83]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer patients frequently suffer from pain, often managed with opioids. However, undertreated pain remains a significant concern. Opioid effectiveness varies due to genetic differences in how individuals metabolize some of these medications. While prior research suggests promise in tailoring opioid prescriptions based on CYP2D6 genetic makeup, its application in cancer pain management remains limited. This study investigates the potential benefits of preemptive CYP2D6 genotyping for cancer patients initiating opioid therapy, focusing on codeine, tramadol, and hydrocodone, whose efficacy is demonstrably impacted by CYP2D6 variations.

Methods

This is a randomized, prospective study to evaluate the effects of preemptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing on opioid dosing decisions/selections and composite pain score in oncology patients. Patients with metastatic solid tumors for whom near-future opioid therapy is anticipated will be randomized to PGx and control arms, stratified by the presence or absence of bony metastases and history of opioid use. In the PGx arm, patients will be preemptively tested using a panel of pharmacogenomic genetic variants, and providers will receive opioid dosing guidance via an electronic medical record-embedded clinical decision support tool. In the control arm, pain prescribing will occur per standard of care without genotype information.

Planned Outcome

The primary study outcome will be composite pain intensity during the first 45 days after an index opioid prescription for codeine, tramadol, or hydrocodone. Safety will be assessed by comparing opioid-related adverse event rates between the two study arms. Secondary outcomes will include rates of hospitalization/emergency room visits, cumulative morphine equivalents received, and type of first opioid prescribed.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^5337b982]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 4-week history of an itchy, painful, pink-red progressively worsening rash on her chest and neck (Fig 1). Her history included remote breast cancer and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with known axillary nodal involvement. At presentation, she was undergoing treatment of her metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed for the last 6 months, and had undergone radiation to axillary lymph node metastases in previous months. Physical examination found thin pink-red plaques around her neck and chest. She denied fever or chills. She was prescribed a 2-week prednisone taper and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment with 1-month follow-up arranged where she demonstrated no response to treatment.

Question 1: What is the best next step in caring for this patient?
A. Perform biopsy of lesion.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin.

Answers:
A. Perform biopsy of lesion – Correct. In this patient with history of malignancies, biopsy should be done of the lesion to rule out metastasis of internal malignancy.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily – Incorrect. This patient had attempted oral and topical steroids with no relief of symptoms/rash. At this point, another round of steroids would be inappropriate.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction – Incorrect. This would be appropriate if herpes zoster was suspected. This patient's rash does not consist of papules or vesicles expected of herpes zoster and does not follow a dermatomal distribution.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve – Incorrect. This patient's rash has persisted for greater than 4 weeks. Her history of malignancy is concerning, and as such reassurance would be inappropriate at this time.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin – Incorrect. This would be the correct option if erysipelas or severe cellulitis was suspected. We would expect this patient to display acute-onset systemic symptoms such as fever; her rash developed slowly over 4 weeks and not as acutely as one would expect with erysipelas.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^b7af49c0]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Selecting an opioid for rotation: patient characteristics

Chronic pain care must begin with a careful patient assessment that includes a complete history and physical examination to establish a clear pain diagnosis to support a rational multimodal treatment program that might include opioids. Before initiating treatment, clinicians should assess the risk of opioid abuse and the potential for idiosyncratic reactions to opioids by inquiring about previous therapeutic experience with opioids, previous use of sedating prescription or over-the-counter medications, and any previous substance abuse by the patient or family members.–

A thorough patient history may also include very simple information indicating the presence or absence of genetic anomalies that might influence response and tolerability. For example, about 10% of the white population have impaired function of the cytochrome (CYP) P450 2D6 enzyme and consequently cannot efficiently metabolize codeine to its active metabolite, morphine. Patients with a history of inadequate response to codeine should be switched with great caution from codeine to a substitute opioid that is not metabolized by CYP2D6 (eg, morphine, fentanyl, oxymorphone) because these patients may not have developed opioid tolerance during previous treatment.

When assessing patients, it is important to remember that most patients with chronic pain have more than three specific and individual pain problems at their first visit, making careful assessment a significant challenge. Factors to be considered when selecting a substitute opioid include patient characteristics, comorbidities, concurrent medications, and adverse effects of the opioid being replaced, as summarized in Table 2.

### Codeine sulfate [^8aab0a63]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1
Important Dosage
and Administration
Instructions

Codeine sulfate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of codeine sulfate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with codeine sulfate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of
Opioid Overdose

Discussthe availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with codeine sulfate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Causes and management of acute oncological pain: a narrative review [^383c9368]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Opioids are effective in treating moderate to severe acute pain and in the oncological patient population they remain a mainstay of analgesia. There has been specific interest in the direct and indirect impact of opioids on both primary tumour development and metastatic potential. There is abundant evidence of wide‐ranging influences in vitro and in vivo studies on the immunomodulatory effects of opioids, although there is a degree of inter‐drug variability. Impairment of the innate and adaptive immune systems occurs through a number of mechanisms including reductions in gut barrier mucus production; changes in natural killer cell and macrophage function; and the ability of cells to present antigens. However, in the context of acute pain (which is also immunosuppressive), opioid administration in analgesic doses may be immunoprotective, thus arbitrating on the relative risks and benefits of opioid use in patients with cancer. The clinical relevance of these findings remains opaque, with large population‐level studies failing to show an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients taking opioids or increased risks of malignancy in those patients taking opioids for persistent pain. Where evidence remains contradictory, a strategy using the lowest possible dose, initially in an immediate‐release preparation, is supported by recent guidelines.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^9cfdf102]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Opioid initiation and titration — ASCO recommendations: Opioids should be initiated at the lowest possible dose to achieve acceptable analgesia and patient goals, and should be initiated as immediate release and PRN (as needed) to establish an effective dose with early assessment and frequent titration; patients already taking other analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may continue these after opioid initiation if they provide additional analgesia and are not contraindicated; evidence remains insufficient to recommend for or against genetic testing such as polymorphisms of CYP2D6 to guide dosing; evidence remains insufficient to recommend any single set of ranges for dose escalation, with the note that in general the minimum dose increase is 25%-50%; and for patients with a substance use disorder, clinicians should collaborate with a palliative care, pain, and/or substance use disorder specialist to determine the optimal approach to pain management.

Even with no chance of cure, palliative chemotherapy can be used to optimize symptom control and maintain QOL in advanced cancer. When used within the shared decision-making model, palliative chemotherapy can mitigate the need for emergency room visits as well as improve other domains of suffering such as poor appetite, tiredness, and poor QOL.

With regard to cancer pain, the analgesic ladder developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) is the medication standard of care, with suggestions related to augmentation to this approach. Per the WHO analgesic ladder, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen (with or without adjuvants) is recommended for mild pain. Weaker opioids (hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol) (with or without non-opioid analgesics, and with or without adjuvants) are recommended for moderate pain. Stronger opioids (morphine, methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone, buprenorphine, hydromorphone, etc.) (with or without non-opioid analgesics, and with or without adjuvants) are recommended for severe, persistent pain. For acute pain, the initial therapy should be the strongest analgesic based on pain intensity. For those with persistent pain, medication should be given on a regular schedule with breakthrough medication available as needed. Due to neural adaptation of opiates, patients with a history of opioid use may need higher doses of opioids than expected for pain control or the addition of adjuvant medication to achieve adequate analgesia.

Adjuvants can include additional opiates, antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, etc.), anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin), topical anesthetics (lidocaine), topical therapies (capsaicin), corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, and/or cannabinoids. The International Association for the Study of Pain has suggested focusing on the type of pain and on the mechanism of action of the drugs used to treat it. Thus, inflammatory pain may first be treated with steroids or NSAIDs, and neuropathic pain may be first treated with antidepressants or anticonvulsants, as examples. Ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative, has recently been demonstrated to be helpful in the treatment of cancer-related neuropathic pain. Ketamine has also proven effective at reducing acute pain in opioid-tolerant patients. Neurolytic blocks and intrathecal pumps have shown efficacy in managing pain symptoms when traditional therapies have been ineffective.

### Morphine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reaction following occupational diacetylmorphine contact dermatitis: a case report [^cef705ec]. Contact Dermatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

CASE REPORT

A 55‐year‐old woman with a history of occupational contact dermatitis caused by diacetylmorphine underwent surgery for a mammary carcinoma. In the past, she had worked at a municipal treatment centre for drug addicts until 2000. At that time, she developed allergic contact dermatitis after contact with diacetylmorphine. Patch testing was performed with our departmental extended European baseline series (TRUE Test panels 1 and 2, supplemented with additional investigator‐loaded allergens), a cosmetic series, and an opiate series (SmartPractice Europe, Reinbek, Germany). All investigator‐loaded allergens were tested in Van der Bend square chambers (Van der Bend, Brielle, The Netherlands), and all patch tests were attached to the back with Fixomull stretch (BSN Medical, Hamburg, Germany) for 2 days. Readings were performed on day (D) 2 and D3.

Patch testing showed positive reactions to morphine hydrochloride, morphine, diacetylmorphine, and codeine dihydrophosphate (Table 1). The patient was one of the occupation‐related cases described previously. 1, 2 Sixteen years later, she underwent a mastectomy. One day after surgery, she developed an erythematous papular itchy facial rash, which spread over the body on the next day. In addition, vesicles were seen on the face and neck. No signs of fever, laryngitis or pustules were seen. The patient was treated with clobetasol ointment for 1 week, with good results.

Table 1
Patch test results with the opiate series obtained in 2000

During mastectomy, the patient had received morphine, cefazolin, dexamethasone, naproxen, propofol, paracetamol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. After surgery, she was treated with naproxen, paracetamol, pantoprazole, fraxiparine, and ondansetron. She had never reacted to paracetamol, ibuprofen, or naproxen. According to Litt's drug eruption & reaction database, delayed‐type reactions to and exanthemas caused by the other administered drugs are very rare. 7 Hypersensitivity to propofol is also rare, and is almost always reported in terms of anaphylactoid reactions or anaphylaxis 8 We assume that the patient developed a morphine‐induced delayed‐type cutaneous adverse drug reaction following occupational diacetylmorphine contact dermatitis. An intravenous provocation test to reproduce the skin reaction was not performed, because of the patient's severe rash.

### Codeine sulfate [^5d247ff6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolism: About 70% to 80% of the administered dose of codeine is metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid to codeine-6-glucuronide (C6G) and via O -demethylation to morphine (about 5% to 10%) and N -demethylation to norcodeine (about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major enzymes mediating glucuronidation of codeine to C6G. Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for conversion of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the major enzyme mediating conversion of codeine to norcodeine. Morphine and norcodeine are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Morphine and M6G are known to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is unknown. Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to possess analgesic properties.

Excretion: Approximately 90% of the total dose of codeine is excreted through the kidneys, of which approximately 10% is unchanged codeine. Plasma half-lives of codeine and its metabolites have been reported to be approximately 3 hours.

Opioids and buprenorphine — general classification and hypersensitivity features state that opioids are generally used to treat both acute and chronic pain and, structurally, can be placed into 4 chemical classes: phenanthrenes (including morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, and buprenorphine), benzomorphans (only pentazocine), phenylpiperidines (fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, and meperidine), and diphenylheptanes (propoxyphene and methadone), and based on interaction with µ, κ, and δ receptors opioids can be classified as agonists (eg, morphine), partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine), or antagonists (eg, naloxone), with the latter used to treat opioid overdose. Major symptoms of hypersensitivity are noted with true type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions to opioids rare and limited to case reports, and both possibilities able to cause pruritus, flushing, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, and hypotension.

### The cystine / glutamate antiporter system XC-drives breast tumor cell glutamate release and cancer-induced bone pain [^8a86bc7e]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Cancer pain is reportedly experienced by 75% to 90% of patients with late-stage cancerwith metastatic cancer–induced bone pain (CIBP) being the most common complaint. Although reports of pain with primary breast, lung and prostate cancers are rare, bone metastases produce excruciating pain, the etiology of which is not fully understood. Patients with metastatic breast cancer survive on average 1.5 to 3 years, during which time they have a number of comorbidities, including intractable pain. Current management of CIBP involves a treatment progression from radiation to strong opioids with adjuvant supplementation to treat worsening pain. In many cases, however, pain relief may be incomplete, unsatisfactory, or plagued with dose-limiting side effects further compromising patient quality of life. Additionally, narcotics for cancer pain are associated with the substantial rise in rates of diversion and substance abuse, contributing to the "opioid epidemic". Novel analgesics are desperately needed for the > 42% of patients with cancer pain who do not achieve acceptable pain relief.

### A software tool to adjust codeine dose based on CYP2D6 gene-pair polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions [^8e937d36]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Codeine is metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme, and individuals with certain genetic variations of the CYP2D6 gene may metabolize codeine differently, leading to variable efficacy and toxicity. Drug-drug interactions can also affect the metabolism of codeine. A tool to adjust codeine dose based on these factors does not currently exist. Healthcare providers should use their clinical judgment and reference different established dosing guidelines to determine the appropriate dose of codeine for individual patients. The study provides a tool that assists prescribers in adjusting codeine dose based on CYP2D6 gene-pair polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions. Highlighted is the need to consider pharmacogenetics and drug-drug interactions when determining the appropriate dosing of codeine and provide a framework for implementing individualized dosing based on these factors.

### Opioids for cancer pain-an overview of cochrane reviews [^4e3b7b11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common symptom with cancer, and 30% to 50% of all people with cancer will experience moderate to severe pain that can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Opioid (morphine-like) drugs are commonly used to treat moderate or severe cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the World Health Organization (WHO) pain treatment ladder. The most commonly-used opioid drugs are buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, tramadol, and tapentadol.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the analgesic efficacy of opioids in cancer pain, and to report on adverse events associated with their use.

Methods

We identified systematic reviews examining any opioid for cancer pain published to 4 May 2017 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes were no or mild pain within 14 days of starting treatment, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Main Results

We included nine reviews with 152 included studies and 13,524 participants, but because some studies appeared in more than one review the number of unique studies and participants was smaller than this. Most participants had moderate or severe pain associated with a range of different types of cancer. Studies in the reviews typically compared one type of opioid or formulation with either a different formulation of the same opioid, or a different opioid; few included a placebo control. Typically the reviews titrated dose to effect, a balance between pain relief and adverse events. Various routes of administration of opioids were considered in the reviews; oral with most opioids, but transdermal administration with fentanyl, and buprenorphine. No review included studies of subcutaneous opioid administration. Pain outcomes reported were varied and inconsistent. The average size of included studies varied considerably between reviews: studies of older opioids, such as codeine, morphine, and methadone, had low average study sizes while those involving newer drugs tended to have larger study sizes. Six reviews reported a GRADE assessment (buprenorphine, codeine, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, and tramadol), but not necessarily for all comparisons or outcomes. No comparative analyses were possible because there was no consistent placebo or active control. Cohort outcomes for opioids are therefore reported, as absolute numbers or percentages, or both. Reviews on buprenorphine, codeine with or without paracetamol, hydromorphone, methadone, tramadol with or without paracetamol, tapentadol, and oxycodone did not have information about the primary outcome of mild or no pain at 14 days, although that on oxycodone indicated that average pain scores were within that range. Two reviews, on oral morphine and transdermal fentanyl, reported that 96% of 850 participants achieved that goal. Adverse event withdrawal was reported by five reviews, at rates of between 6% and 19%. Participants with at least one adverse event were reported by three reviews, at rates of between 11% and 77%. Our GRADE assessment of evidence quality was very low for all outcomes, because many studies in the reviews were at high risk of bias from several sources, including small study size.

Authors' Conclusions

The amount and quality of evidence around the use of opioids for treating cancer pain is disappointingly low, although the evidence we have indicates that around 19 out of 20 people with moderate or severe pain who are given opioids and can tolerate them should have that pain reduced to mild or no pain within 14 days. This accords with the clinical experience in treating many people with cancer pain, but overstates to some extent the effectiveness found for the WHO pain ladder. Most people will experience adverse events, and help may be needed to manage the more common undesirable adverse effects such as constipation and nausea. Perhaps between 1 in 10 and 2 in 10 people treated with opioids will find these adverse events intolerable, leading to a change in treatment.

ASCO guideline — clinical interpretation for renal impairment notes that in patients with significant renal function impairment, morphine use may result in the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites such as morphine-3-glucuronide and normorphine, and opioid-induced neurotoxicity; other opioids such as hydromorphone or fentanyl are less likely to result in accumulation of active metabolites in renal failure; methadone can also be a good alternative since it is primarily metabolized in the liver, but it should only be used by experienced clinicians.

### The burden of metastatic cancer-induced bone pain: a narrative review [^44d7a2d9]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Further Research

Although patients with bone metastases have limited longevity, for many patients, cancer pain due to bone metastases impacts their QOL for months or even years. For some cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, the median survival of patients with bone metastases is approximately 2 years. There is a great need for therapeutic options that can provide pain relief and improve emotional, social, and physical functioning and overall HRQOL.

As described in this review, pain relief and improvements in HRQOL have been demonstrated for substantial proportions of patients treated with RT, although the improvements may take time to manifest and then wane over subsequent months. For patients continuing to experience moderate to severe cancer pain after RT for bone metastases, the current nonsurgical strategy is to treat the patient with strong opioids. However, evidence on opioid treatment patterns by pain severity suggests that opioids are underutilized in this patient population. The studies of undertreatment for cancer pain due to bone metastases were not designed to determine why patients were undertreated. A thorough, systematic investigation of opioid treatment patterns in patients with mCIBP is warranted.

Likely explanations for underuse are stigma around opioid addiction, prescribing limitations, and opioid side effects. Side effects include severe drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, breathing difficulties, and constipation, with the constipation persisting throughout treatment. Although persistent constipation can now be medically managed, in the US, patients with legitimate need for opioids now face stigma, fear, and guilt for using opioids.US patients also face access issues relating to pharmacy obstacles to filling prescriptions, insurance companies' rules about types or amounts of medication allowed, and decreased manufacturing of opioids as a measure to limit inappropriate access. Outside the US in countries that did not experience an opioid crisis, physician and patient awareness and attitudes about pain and analgesics to control pain may still be contributing to the rise in undertreatment over time. Additionally, the lack of opioid availability and socioeconomic factors in some countries may negatively impact access to health care and pain management.

### Complication avoidance, rehabilitation, pain therapy and palliative care for patients with metastatic spine tumors: WFNS spine committee recommendations [^24d07c99]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

These nine final consensus statements provide current, evidence-based guidelines on the complication avoidance, rehabilitation, pain therapy and palliative care for patients with spinal metastases. Preoperative assessment for complications following surgery is obligatory and must include assessment of general condition of the patient, site of primary tumor, number of spinal and visceral metastasis, ASA score and preoperative Hb value. Advanced age > 65 years as well as preoperative ASA score of 3 and 4 are risk factors for complications and special care needs to be taken in such patients. Surgery with greater blood loss increases likelihood for cardiovascular and cerebral events and pulmonary insufficiency, so these patients need careful postoperative monitoring. Multimodal pain management according to WHO analgesic ladder and early mobilization are encouraged. For moderate to severe cancer pain the first-choice opioid must be oral morphine. Use of IV-PCA for severe pain can be useful, however close monitoring of delirium and toxicity is mandatory. In patients with good prognosis, non-localized pain and no availability of radiation therapy, bisphosphonates may be considered for the treatment.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^b09f6e07]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Special considerations — surgery and perioperative care in mastocytosis: Mast cell activation can occur in patients with mastocytosis undergoing surgical procedures and may persist for several hours after surgery; the primary goal is prevention during and immediately after the procedure. Multidisciplinary management is recommended, with careful review of prior anesthetic records and identification and avoidance of known triggers such as temperature extremes (hypothermia or hyperthermia) and unnecessary trauma, which are strongly recommended. The efficacy and safety of perioperative drugs in SM have not been fully established, though some are considered safer by anecdotal reports; nevertheless, perioperative drugs are not contraindicated. Analgesics should not be withheld, but caution should be exercised with opioids (eg, codeine or morphine).

### Morphine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reaction following occupational diacetylmorphine contact dermatitis: a case report [^2fe95eec]. Contact Dermatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We assume that the patient described here developed delayed‐type (type IV) systemic allergic dermatitis caused by morphine in the context of her past occupational contact sensitization to diacetylmorphine. In 2000, besides stopping occupational exposure, the patient was advised to avoid treatment with morphine, diacetylmorphine, and codeine, because of the chemical similarities between these opiates. Nevertheless, she received morphine during surgery in 2016.

Contact dermatitis and AGEP caused by diacetylmorphine and morphine have been reported before. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Furthermore, the chemical similarities between morphine, diacetylmorphine and codeine are well known. 9 Thyssen and Maibach, along with Schnyder and Pichler, reviewed the possible pathomechanisms of systemic allergic dermatitis. 10, 11 The exact mechanism remains unclear. However, the pharmacological interactions of drugs with immune receptors concept may explain the predominant skin involvement in T cell‐mediated reactions to systemically applied drugs. 11

In conclusion, although definite proof by means of a provocation test could not be provided, we feel that reporting this case is of importance to alert those who are occupationally sensitized to opiates to the risk of skin and systemic reactions in cases of future medication with these drugs.

### Association of current opioid use with serious adverse events among older adult survivors of breast cancer [^92dc30ea]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Opioids remain a mainstay of cancer pain management; however, increasing evidence indicates that the benefits of long-term opioid use for cancer pain may be limited. Our findings add to these concerns by demonstrating that opioid therapy significantly increases the risk of multiple preventable serious adverse drug events. Clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and comprehensive risks of opioid therapy in older adult survivors of breast cancer who have completed active breast cancer treatment.

### Evidence-based standards for cancer pain management [^5d51d6d3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

High-quality management of cancer pain depends on evidence-based standards for screening, assessment, treatment, and follow-up for general cancer pain and specific pain syndromes. We developed a set of standards through an iterative process of structured literature review and development and refinement of topic areas and standards and subjected recommendations to rating by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Providers should routinely screen for the presence or absence and intensity of pain and should perform descriptive pain assessment for patients with a positive screen, including assessment for likely etiology and functional impairment. For treatment, providers should provide pain education, offer breakthrough opioids in patients receiving long-acting formulations, offer bowel regimens in patients receiving opioids chronically, and ensure continuity of opioid doses across health care settings. Providers should also follow up on patients after treatment for pain. For metastatic bone pain, providers should offer single-fraction radiotherapy as an option when offering radiation, unless there is a contraindication. When spinal cord compression is suspected, providers should treat with corticosteroids and evaluate with whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging scan or myelography as soon as possible but within 24 hours. Providers should initiate definitive treatment (radiotherapy or surgical decompression) within 24 hours for diagnosed cord compression and should follow up on patients after treatment. These standards provide an initial framework for high-quality evidence-based management of general cancer pain and pain syndromes.

### Opioid poorly-responsive cancer pain. part 1: clinical considerations [^7c04724e]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Pain that is poorly responsive to opioid analgesics is challenging for physicians who deal with cancer patients. Numerous factors may influence analgesic response during the course of the illness. These include changing nociception associated with disease progression, the appearance of intractable side effects, the development of tolerance, the presence of neuropathic pain, the temporal pattern, the effects produced by the production of opioid metabolites, and many others. These factors influence the delicate balance between pain relief and opioid toxicity that must be achieved in cancer patients with pain.

### Pattern and quality of care of cancer pain management. results from the cancer pain outcome research study group [^ce59dea4]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

To construct the index, we determined which of four levels of analgesic drug therapy was the most potent one used: 0, no analgesic drug; 1, a non-opioid (e.g. a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug); 2, a weak opioid (e.g. codeine or tramadol); and 3, a strong opioid (e.g. morphine, fentanyl, buprenorphine, oxycodone and so on). We then determined the patient's level of pain from the Brief Pain Inventory (1–3, mild; 4–7, moderate; 8–10, severe). No pain was scored as 0; mild pain, 1; moderate pain, 2; and severe pain, 3. The PMI, computed by subtracting the pain level from the analgesic level, ranges from −3 (a patient with severe pain receiving no analgesic drugs) to +3 (a patient receiving morphine or an equivalent and reporting no pain). Negative scores are considered to indicate pain undertreatment, and scores of 0 or higher are considered a conservative indicator of acceptable treatment (see Figure 1).

As the PMI provides only a rough estimate of how pain is treated in a sample taking into account only some attributes of the pain characteristics, we also assembled a list of clinical indicators to capture the appropriateness of the analgesic care delivered more directly. Operationally, we identified four specific clinical conditions where there was evidence that pain should be treated with a specific approach according to available guidelines: presence of episodes of breakthrough pain to be treated with a strong opioid as rescue/escape therapy, presence of neuropathic pain to be treated with a specific adjuvant drug, pain with intensity higher than 7 points, calling for a strong opioid as around-the-clock therapy, and presence of bone metastasis to be treated with bisphosphonates. Then, we estimated the proportion of patients in each group who did not receive the recommended therapy, as additional indicators of the quality of analgesic therapy. Frequencies were then associated with some variables, such as type of patient and recruiting centre.

Given the large number of centres, we used a web-based system to optimise the handling of all aspects of the clinical study, including data entry, quality assurance and validation. A general data entry engine for clinical trials developed by the Mario Negri Institute was used, which was compliant with current laws concerning ethical and regulatory issues. Before implementation, it was tested with a pilot feasibility study in 130 centres in 2005.

### Codeine intoxication associated with ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolism [^ed1d7f3e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Life-threatening opioid intoxication developed in a patient after he was given small doses of codeine for the treatment of a cough associated with bilateral pneumonia. Codeine is bioactivated by CYP2D6 into morphine, which then undergoes further glucuronidation. CYP2D6 genotyping showed that the patient had three or more functional alleles, a finding consistent with ultrarapid metabolism of codeine. We attribute the toxicity to this genotype, in combination with inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by other medications and a transient reduction in renal function.

### Burden of symptoms associated with development of metastatic bone disease in patients with breast cancer [^f6bd0ad9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the decrease in pain after diagnosis of bone metastases, a substantial increase in analgesic use after bone metastases diagnosis was not observed in the present study, with just 16% of patients having new or increased pain medication after diagnosis. A major limitation to this dataset is that analgesic medication may have been provided by clinicians outside of the oncology practice. The proportion of patients in this study receiving opioid medications in the period leading up to diagnosis of bone metastases was approximately 10%. This percentage is similar, although slightly lower, than the percentages of strong opioid use reported in an observational study evaluating the prescription of analgesics in patients with solid tumors (13%) and for patients with breast cancer and bone disease enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial (16%).

The decrease in pain observed after the diagnosis of bone metastases may be associated with the use of bone-targeted agents and/or external beam radiation to manage pain without use of opioid analgesics. Nearly half of the patients were receiving bone-targeted agents and these agents were prescribed rapidly following the diagnosis of bone metastases. We note that the data for bone-targeted agents are far more robust than for pain medication, as the former medications were administered in the oncologist's office and were therefore far more likely to be recorded. The observation that half of the patients did not receive any treatment with bone-targeted agents points to an opportunity to further improve management of bone metastases in this population.

A unique aspect of this dataset was that patient-reported outcomes were captured as part of routine assessment in the clinical practice setting, thereby allowing symptom burden to be studied over time relative to the diagnosis of bone metastases in the absence of a clinical trial. In addition, many patients included in this study would otherwise have been excluded from a prospective clinical trial due to low ECOG performance scores and/or limited life expectancy. Our study describes real-world findings in a population of over 1000 women treated in clinical practice across the USA that is representative of women treated in the community setting and therefore more generalizable to the broader breast cancer population of the USA than the population studied in clinical trials. Of note, the median time to diagnosis of bone metastases was 20 months in this population (in which half of the patients had stage IV disease), shorter than that recently reported for patients with local (stages 0–II) or regional disease (stage III) (30 and 33 months, respectively).
