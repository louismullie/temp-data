## Question

How far apart do tv tests need to be donw

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how far apart thyroid function tests (TFTs) should be done in different clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context because the interval depends on whether this is screening, diagnosis, treatment monitoring, or special populations. Then, I should verify the biological variability of TSH and free T4 to justify repeating tests rather than acting on a single value. Next, I will review guideline-based intervals for asymptomatic screening, subclinical disease, overt disease, pregnancy, pediatrics, and postoperative care. Finally, I will synthesize practical intervals and note exceptions and assay considerations that could alter timing or interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that change the interval: screening asymptomatic adults, confirming a new diagnosis of subclinical disease, monitoring treated hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, managing pregnancy, caring for children, and post-thyroidectomy follow-up. I need to ensure I anchor each interval to the appropriate guideline and physiology, because a one-size-fits-all answer would be misleading [^d80df50d] [^d4ff3d32] [^e9abbbe1] [^39bee5aa].

> I will now examine biological variability to justify repeating tests. TSH has substantial day-to-day and serial variation, with up to 40–50% fluctuation in same-time measurements, and many individuals with mildly abnormal TSH revert to normal over time, which is why a single abnormal TSH should not trigger treatment without confirmation. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of that variability: yes, USPSTF documents up to 40% variation and notes that 37% of those with initially elevated TSH and 29% with initially low TSH normalized over 3 years without intervention, reinforcing the need for serial testing before labeling disease [^8cdd9023] [^942e5fb1] [^06af451d].

> For asymptomatic adults with a mildly abnormal TSH, I should confirm the standard interval. The USPSTF recommends repeating TFTs over a 3–6 month interval to confirm persistence before diagnosing subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and this approach reduces overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to TSH 4.5–10.0 mIU/L for subclinical hypothyroidism and mildly suppressed TSH for subclinical hyperthyroidism; yes, that is correct and consistent with the evidence review and recommendation statements [^d80df50d] [^e78c85b1] [^472a8176].

> For treated hypothyroidism, I need to check the steady-state kinetics. After a levothyroxine dose change, TSH reaches a new steady state in about 6–8 weeks, so TSH should be rechecked at 6–8 weeks and then every 6–12 months once stable. Let me verify that this aligns with endocrine guidance; yes, AACE/ATA guidelines endorse TSH as the primary monitoring test and support 6–8 week checks after dose changes, with periodic monitoring thereafter [^d4ff3d32].

> For hyperthyroidism treatment, I should confirm early monitoring cadence. With methimazole, TSH may remain suppressed for months, so free T4 and total T3 are the key early markers; tests are typically obtained every 2–6 weeks initially, then every 2–3 months once stable. I should double-check that this interval is guideline-supported; the ATA guidance specifies 2–6 weeks after initiation, again at 4–6 weeks, and then every 2–3 months when stable, which matches this approach [^8c2496a0].

> In pregnancy, I need to ensure trimester-specific timing. For euthyroid patients with positive thyroid antibodies, TSH should be measured at pregnancy confirmation and then every 4 weeks through mid-pregnancy because of the risk of progression. For patients on antithyroid drugs, TSH and free T4 should be checked every 2–4 weeks in the first half of pregnancy, with tighter intervals after dose changes, and every 4–8 weeks after 20 weeks. Hold on, I should verify that these intervals are RCOG-endorsed; yes, RCOG 2025 supports these monitoring frequencies and emphasizes trimester-specific reference ranges for interpretation [^86cc5461] [^65a4eae3] [^77932ea0].

> For post-thyroidectomy patients, I should confirm the first postoperative check. TSH is typically checked at 6–8 weeks after surgery to guide levothyroxine dosing, with subsequent intervals individualized to clinical context. Let me verify that this is consistent with surgical guidance; the AAES guideline explicitly recommends TSH at 6–8 weeks postoperatively and coordination with endocrinology for ongoing monitoring, which fits this plan [^39bee5aa].

> In pediatrics, I need to be cautious not to overtest. For screening, TSH alone is appropriate, and if results are only mildly abnormal, repeating in 3–6 months is reasonable given spontaneous reversion rates. For congenital hypothyroidism, immediate confirmatory testing and urgent treatment are indicated, so the interval is "stat", not weeks. Wait, let me verify the newborn urgency; yes, pediatric endocrine guidance calls for STAT serum TSH and free T4 when newborn screening is abnormal, with treatment started promptly to protect neurodevelopment [^cfb7df02] [^1527ec8c].

> For inpatient or acute illness settings, I should confirm that routine TFTs are discouraged. Nonthyroidal illness syndrome confounds interpretation, so if TFTs are obtained, any abnormalities should prompt repeat testing after recovery rather than immediate treatment. I need to ensure this aligns with endocrine practice; Endocrine Practice advises against routine inpatient TFTs and supports reassessment after recovery, which is the prudent approach [^977d68be] [^4d274995].

> But wait, what if there are assay interferences or discordant results? I should double-check that repeating tests using a different platform or sending to a reference lab is appropriate when results do not fit the clinical picture. Contemporary reviews emphasize recognizing biotin, heterophile antibodies, and drug effects that can distort TSH or free T4, and recommend confirmatory strategies when discordance persists, which may necessitate repeating tests sooner with alternative methods [^8a96a349] [^43ec003f].

> Let me synthesize practical intervals by scenario while keeping the variability principle in mind: for asymptomatic adults with mildly abnormal TSH, repeat in 3–6 months. For treated hypothyroidism, recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks after dose changes, then every 6–12 months. For hyperthyroidism on therapy, check free T4 and total T3 every 2–6 weeks initially, then every 2–3 months when stable. In pregnancy, monitor every 4 weeks if antibody positive or on antithyroid drugs, with tighter intervals after dose changes. Post-thyroidectomy, check TSH at 6–8 weeks. In children with mild abnormalities, repeat in 3–6 months. And in inpatient or acute illness, avoid routine testing and repeat after recovery if tested. Hold on, I should verify that these align with the cited guidance; yes, these intervals map to USPSTF, ATA, RCOG, AAES, and pediatric guidance as above [^d80df50d] [^d4ff3d32] [^8c2496a0] [^86cc5461] [^39bee5aa] [^cfb7df02].

> Finally, I need to ensure I state the overarching principle clearly: never act on a single abnormal TSH outside the clinical context. Given biological variability and spontaneous reversion, confirm persistence over 3–6 months before diagnosing subclinical disease, and tailor monitoring frequency to treatment phase, pregnancy status, and special populations to balance timely care with avoidance of overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^8cdd9023] [^472a8176].

Thyroid function tests should be spaced based on the clinical context: **repeat TSH in 3–6 months** for mild abnormalities or subclinical disease to confirm persistence [^d80df50d] [^e78c85b1], and **recheck every 6–8 weeks** after starting or changing levothyroxine until stable [^notfound]. In pregnancy, monitor **every 4–6 weeks** [^a8c60d87] and adjust dose as needed [^a8c60d87]. For hyperthyroidism on antithyroid drugs, check every 2–6 weeks initially, then every 2–3 months once stable [^8c2496a0]. After thyroidectomy, check TSH at 6–8 weeks [^39bee5aa], then every 6–12 months. Avoid testing during acute illness or when interferences are suspected; repeat after recovery or resolution of interference [^977d68be] [^43ec003f].

## General principles for thyroid function test spacing

- **Biological variability**: TSH has significant intra-individual variation (up to 40%), so single abnormalities should be confirmed [^8cdd9023] [^adf0aec3].
- **Clinical context**: Spacing depends on whether the patient is asymptomatic, symptomatic, pregnant, on therapy, or postoperative.
- **Assay considerations**: Interferences (e.g. biotin, heterophile antibodies) can distort results; repeat testing or use alternative methods if suspected [^8a96a349] [^43ec003f].

## Specific clinical scenarios and recommended intervals

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended interval** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Asymptomatic adults with mild TSH abnormalities (subclinical hypo/hyperthyroidism) | Repeat TSH in 3–6 months [^d80df50d] [^e78c85b1] | Confirm persistence before diagnosing or treating [^472a8176] |
| Initiation or dose change of levothyroxine | Recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^notfound] | Steady-state TSH is reached in ~6 weeks |
| Stable hypothyroidism on levothyroxine | Every 6–12 months | Monitor adherence and stability |
| Hyperthyroidism on antithyroid drugs | Every 2–6 weeks initially, then every 2–3 months once stable [^8c2496a0] | Frequent adjustment until euthyroid |
| Pregnancy (euthyroid or treated hypothyroidism) | Every 4–6 weeks [^a8c60d87] | Hormonal changes require close monitoring |
| Post-thyroidectomy | TSH at 6–8 weeks, then every 6–12 months [^39bee5aa] | Adjust replacement and monitor recurrence |
| Acute illness or suspected assay interference | Repeat after recovery or interference resolved [^977d68be] [^43ec003f] | Nonthyroidal illness and interferences can mislead |

---

## Factors influencing test spacing

- **Age**: Older adults may have higher TSH reference limits; interpret results accordingly [^1423e630].
- **Medications**: Amiodarone, lithium, and others can alter thyroid function; monitor more frequently [^09075b10].
- **Pregnancy**: Increased demand warrants closer monitoring [^a8c60d87].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease or diabetes may necessitate tighter surveillance [^notfound].

---

## Consequences of inappropriate spacing

Inappropriate spacing can cause **missed progression** — delayed detection of overt disease from infrequent testing — or **unnecessary treatment** from overly frequent testing that leads to overtreatment. Both outcomes increase healthcare costs and patient burden [^58654cd1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Mild abnormalities**: Repeat TSH in 3–6 months [^d80df50d] [^e78c85b1].
- **Therapy changes**: Recheck in 6–8 weeks [^notfound].
- **Stable patients**: Monitor every 6–12 months.
- **Pregnancy**: Monitor every 4–6 weeks [^a8c60d87].
- **Post-thyroidectomy**: Check at 6–8 weeks, then every 6–12 months [^39bee5aa].
- **Interference**: Repeat after resolution [^977d68be] [^43ec003f].

Thyroid function test spacing should be **individualized** to the clinical context, balancing the need to detect change with the risks of overtesting and overtreatment.

### What should be done when thyroid function tests do not make sense? [^2263dc4f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is generally straightforward. However, in a minority of contexts the results of thyroid hormone and thyrotropin measurements either conflict with the clinical picture or form an unusual pattern. In many such cases, reassessment of the clinical context provides an explanation for the discrepant TFTs; in other instances, interference in one or other laboratory assays can be shown to account for divergent results; uncommonly, genetic defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are associated with anomalous TFTs. Failure to recognize these potential 'pitfalls' can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management. Here, focusing particularly on the combination of hyperthyroxinaemia with nonsuppressed thyrotropin, we show how a structured approach to investigation can help make sense of atypical TFTs.

The art and science of medicine has changed so much in the last 40 years, not only in the manner that physicians treat medical diseases but also in how they diagnose them. Technological advances have made it possible to have a test for almost anything. These technological advances, however, are important contributing factors to the rising cost of healthcare. More than ever, cost containment is an important element in all aspects of patient care. Minimizing costly diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests is essential in keeping healthcare costs reasonable but these tests should not be excluded at the risk of compromising patient care. For patients with thyroid disorders, the multiplicity of tests available do not make diagnoses more accurate or treatment more effective. A single test, the sensitive thyrotropin assay, most eloquently allows an organized, streamlined approach to the diagnoses and management of patients with thyroid disease. Even the most technologically advanced tests that are available cannot replace the clinical skills of the physician. Clinical acumen combined with the judicious use of diagnostic testing is one of the most important elements in diagnosing and treating a patient.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^87f9238e]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

Presently there are a sufficient number of sensitive and specific tests of thyroid function to establish a diagnosis of thyroid disease with a high degree of precision. A variety of clinical situations, however, including but not limited to thyroid hormone resistance states, alterations in thyroid-binding proteins and nonthyroidal illness, challenge the clinician to evaluate the thyroid status of the patient beyond that which can be done with routine laboratory tests. This article reviews several clinical, cardiac, skeletal muscle, and other laboratory studies that have been suggested to complement the overall assessment of thyroid status.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^2e1d0674]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^97eb0961]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions — practice implications and laboratory–clinician interface: over the past five decades, testing for TSH and thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) has greatly improved in selectivity and sensitivity. Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement, and there is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. Laboratories often receive requests missing clinical and pharmacological information; the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interpretations and should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. Standardization, quality, performance, and harmonization of assays (TSH, T4, T3) need to be maintained and improved to enable exchange, application, and interpretation of test results within clinical standards.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Nonthyroidal illness syndrome: evaluation of thyroid function in sick patients [^977d68be]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Altered thyroid function tests as a consequence of illness have been recognized for many years, yet the cause and clinical implications remains uncertain. The routine testing of thyroid function in hospitalized patients should be discouraged, as the results are less predictive of primary thyroid disease than in ambulatory patients. Clinicians should be aware of the methods used for thyroid function testing, as the effect of illness on thyroid function varies among the different tests. The most commonly used free T4 assays likely are influenced significantly by nonthyroidal illness. Advances in understanding the basic mechanisms of thyroid hormone metabolism and thyroid hormone action have given insights into the changes in thyroid function tests as a consequence of nonthyroidal illness. In the future, thyroid hormone receptor isoform-specific agonists and antagonists may allow for more specific treatment of select patients with nonthyroidal illness syndrome.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^05ae4a8f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^dc94c18e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

### When should we be conducting thyroid function tests in newborns and young infants? [^6844cc0c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

An audit of local practice was undertaken as regards requests for thyroid function tests (TFT) in children aged between birth and 3 months at two local hospitals in South West England between 2005 and 2008. A total of 406 tests were performed (2.6 tests per week) over a 2-year period at a teaching hospital (70 tests per 1000 live births yearly), with 233 tests (1.5 tests per week) performed over a 3-year period at a local district hospital (39 tests per 1000 live births yearly). The highest proportion of all the tests was performed as routine investigation of prolonged neonatal jaundice (64% and 55%, respectively). Other common indications were maternal thyroid disorders (5.4% vs 4.7%) and suspected neonatal thyroid disorders (3% vs 9%). There was no confirmed diagnosis of infantile thyroid disease. Available evidence and this audit suggest that too many thyroid function tests are unnecessarily performed in young infants.

### Abnormal thyroid function tests in psychiatric patients: a red herring? [^58f9972c]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Thyroid abnormalities can induce mood, anxiety, psychotic, and cognitive disorders. Thus, thyroid function tests are routinely checked in psychiatric patients. However, up to one-third of psychiatric patients may demonstrate thyroid function test abnormalities that do not reflect true thyroid disease, but rather are a manifestation of secondary effects on one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Originally termed the euthyroid sick syndrome, this phenomenon is now more commonly referred to as "non-thyroidal illness". In psychiatric patients with non-thyroidal illness, patterns of thyroid function test abnormalities may vary considerably based upon factors such as the underlying psychiatric disorder, the presence of substance abuse, or even the use of certain psychiatric medications. Thus, any abnormal thyroid function tests in psychiatric patients should be viewed with skepticism. Given the fact that thyroid function test abnormalities seen in non-thyroidal illness usually resolve spontaneously, treatment is generally unnecessary, and may even be potentially harmful.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^39bee5aa]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Postoperative thyroid function monitoring — testing schedule and coordination: After total thyroidectomy, testing of thyroid function should be coordinated with the patient's endocrinologist and/or primary care physician, and TSH level should be checked at 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and T4 dose adjusted accordingly. The appropriate TSH level depends on multiple factors, including whether the patient has a diagnosis of TC of follicular cell origin and has ongoing features of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation — testing timing recommendation: When possible, thyroid function testing should be performed either before or 1–2 weeks after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation because results obtained during the course of controlled ovarian stimulation may be difficult to interpret, and this is a weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^472a8176]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### The "slightly" abnormal thyroid test: what is the pediatrician to do? [^cfb7df02]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid disorders are common in pediatrics. Tests of thyroid function are widely available and frequently ordered in the pediatric healthcare setting. This is sometimes driven by common signs or symptoms of thyroid disease. All too often, it is driven by patients and their parents requesting thyroid tests for nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, obesity or family history of thyroid disease. The decision to order thyroid tests, as well as which test(s) of thyroid function to order, deserves careful thought rather than a reflexive "thyroid panel" for every patient. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the single most appropriate test of thyroid function when screening a pediatric or adolescent for thyroid disorders. Adding more tests only increases the likelihood that a minor (and often insignificant) abnormality will be found. These incidental abnormalities can create anxiety for the parent and child, and usually results in additional testing, referral to a pediatric endocrinologist, and further expense. This review will aim to guide the pediatric primary care provider on the choice of appropriate screening test(s) for acquired thyroid dysfunction in children and adolescents, as well as the proper interpretation of the test(s). Emphasis will be placed on the "slightly" abnormal thyroid screening test. Specific thyroid tests to be reviewed include TSH, (free) T4, (free) T3, and thyroid antibodies. Finally, this review will aim to guide decisions on follow-up, additional testing, and reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Congenital hypothyroidism, including abnormalities on state newborn screening, will not be discussed.

### Thyroid disease in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 223 [^e71082af]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Thyroid disease in pregnancy — screening and indications for testing: Indicated testing of thyroid function should be performed in women with a personal or family history of thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or clinical suspicion of thyroid disease, and in a pregnant woman with a significant goiter or with distinct thyroid nodules, whereas the performance of thyroid function studies in asymptomatic pregnant women who have a mildly enlarged thyroid is not warranted because up to a 30% enlargement of the thyroid gland is typical during pregnancy. Randomized trial data demonstrate that screening and treatment of women with subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy does not improve the cognitive function of their children at age 3 years and 5 years, respectively. Therefore, professional societies recommend against universal screening for thyroid disease in pregnancy and recommend testing during pregnancy only for women who are at an increased risk of overt hypothyroidism, while the American Thyroid Association finds that there are insufficient data to recommend for or against universal thyroid screening.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^5ab7491c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^9686ae2a]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

### Laboratory testing in hyperthyroidism [^c0954134]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism is difficult (full text available online: http://education.amjmed.com/pp1/272). Clinical symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and there is incomplete correlation between structural and functional thyroid gland changes. Laboratory testing is therefore indispensible in establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Similar considerations apply to treatment monitoring. Laboratory testing also plays a crucial role in establishing the most likely cause for a patient's hyperthyroidism. Finally, during pregnancy, when isotopic scanning is relatively contraindicated and ultrasound is more difficult to interpret, laboratory testing becomes even more important.

### Assessment of thyroid function tests and harmonization: opinion on thyroid hormone harmonization [^af314f54]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

As noted in a 1973 Clinical Chemistry editorial, automation has resulted in precision displacing accuracy as the predominant standard for acceptable laboratory results; the author argues that 'meaningful measurement' must also address accuracy. Because measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in conjunction with total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), free T3 (FT3), and free T4 (FT4) is used for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disorders, it is important for all these assays to achieve optimal accuracy. A College of American Pathologists survey reported significant biases, so that more than 50% of results were unacceptably inaccurate in 13–60% of assays evaluated. This inaccuracy, coupled with dissimilar reference intervals, complicates test interpretation and impacts the creation of clinical guidelines.

The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Working Committee cofunded a project to harmonize thyroid hormone immunoassays (IAs), with the goal of achieving similar results with each IA method. To do this, clinical serum samples were run in multiple assays. All IAs were recalibrated to the statistically inferred targets with a robust mass spectrometry reference method. Here, we describe some of the current limitations of thyroid hormone measurements by IAs that cannot be resolved by assay harmonization.

- delayed growth, macroorchidism, hearing loss, other signs of hypothyroidism

- causative mutations in CeH candidate genes

- insufficiency of other pituitary hormone secretion

- blunted (< 4 mU/L) or delayed (peak after 60 minutes) TSH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (200 mcg IV)

PREFACE

This document aims to provide a state-of-the-art status report on the progress achieved in thyroid testing, including thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). The target audience for this document includes general practitioners, endocrinologists, and laboratory professionals. It is not a systematic review or a guidance document addressing currently encountered diagnostic and clinical challenges related to these three key parameters of thyroid testing (Box 1). It does not cover the use of thyroid antibodies for investigating the etiology of thyroid dysfunction, or the use of thyroglobulin as a tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer or the investigation of primary congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

Box 1.
Key Clinical Points for Interpreting Thyroid Tests

Clinically relevant aspects of thyroid pathophysiology and the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral axis have recently been reviewed elsewhere. Generic abbreviations for thyroid hormones (THs), T4 and T3, are used in this text, if both total and free TH are meant. Total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) are used for total and free T4 (fT4) or free T3 (fT3) for free TH concentrations, respectively.

Conclusion

Findings of this meta-analysis indicated preeclamptic women were more at risk of changes in thyroid function tests. Therefore, thyroid function tests should be considered in preeclamptic women. Identification of changes in thyroid hormones in preeclampsia might be of help in preventing the thyroid disorders.

These results provide insights into the optimizing clinical decision-making strategies that should provide thyroid screening in women with preeclampsia.

### Screening for overt thyroid disease in early pregnancy may be preferable to searching for small aberrations in thyroid function tests [^cc39579d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones are important regulators of foetal development, and in recent years, there has been much focus on the screening and treatment of pregnant women for even small aberrations in thyroid function tests. We searched PubMed for publications on thyroid function and pregnancy outcomes including child cognition, and included references from the retrieved articles. Both small aberrations in thyroid function tests in early pregnancy and an increase in risk of pregnancy complications may be caused by a functional change in the uteroplacental unit. Thus, the association found in several studies between small thyroid test abnormalities and pregnancy complications may be due to confounding, and thyroid hormone therapy will have no effect. On the other hand, screening of thyroid function in early pregnancy may identify 200–300 women with undiagnosed overt hypothyroidism per 100,000 pregnancies, which is at least five times more than the number of hypothyroid newborns identified by screening. A number of studies indicate that untreated overt thyroid disease in pregnancy may lead to complications. The potential benefit of screening and early therapy is supported by evidence, indicating that even severe maternal hypothyroidism does not lead to neurocognitive deficiencies in the child, if the condition is detected and treated during the first half of pregnancy. Screening and therapy for overt thyroid dysfunction in early pregnancy may be indicated, rather than focusing on identifying and treating small aberrations in thyroid function tests.

Background

The cost of our nation's healthcare has been on the rise since its inception. In 2014, 4.1% ($971.8 billion) of the Federal budget was attributed solely to hospital care, increased from 3.5% in 2013. The American College of Physicians, "High Value Care", recommends for physicians to give the finest, yet most efficient, care to patients by eliminating unnecessary costs. The American Medical Association, "Choosing wisely", also believes in the same ideology of "more care is not always better care". Thus, in accord with these ideologies along with one of the bedrocks of the Toyota Production System (TPS) Lean Methodology, eliminate muda (waste), our hospital embarked in a Zero Unnecessary Studies (ZEUS) initiative to identify and eliminate waste.

It has been shown that Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs) are ordered far more frequently than the number of patients with symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.TFTs are ordered more often than just a TSH level alone, even though the TSH level is substantial enough on admission to determine if future studies should be pursued. The clinical symptoms of thyroid dysfunction are very sensitive yet less specific, and thus, a majority of symptomatic patients will have normal TFTs. Furthermore, non-symptomatic patients with established hypothyroidism and compliance with treatment may not need fT3 and fT4 levels measured upon admission, as treatment can be adjusted as an outpatient if the TSH is appropriate during the hospital course.

The literature has illustrated that it is not effective to order TFTs for in-patients due to high false positives associated with Non-Thyroidal Illnesses. – During the stress of an illness, there are changes on the pituitary-thyroid axis, changes in the metabolism, and clearance of thyroid hormones. Small changes in T4 can create large changes in TSH. T3 is difficult to accurately interpret due to its short half-life and it can remain normal in severe cases of thyroid dysfunction. The most sensitive test for thyroid dysfunction is a TSH level. If the TSH level is abnormal, it is then appropriate to measure fT3 and fT4.

Specifically regarding TFTs orders, each facility would have their own ordering capabilities and regulations. As per literature searches, there has not been any attempts to solve the problem of only ordering a fT3 and/or fT4 level after the TSH is abnormal, through changes in an EMR. Thus, there was no evidence found regarding which changes would benefit or inhibit the issue of waste in an inpatient setting.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^077124d9]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

- non-thyroidal illness

- isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia (interpret in the context of trimester-specific free T4 reference ranges for pregnant patients)

- levothyroxine withdrawal syndrome

- recovery from thyrotoxicosis

- technical assay problems or interference, or defects in TBG (TBG defects in case of total T4 determination or calculation of free T4 index)

COMPARABILITY AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF fT4 AND TSH ASSAYS

The results of hormone assays must be reliable given the high clinical impact on diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring of patients' health and disease. Thus, guarantee of their specificity, accuracy, and precision requires external reference points, standardized and certified reference materials, and regular documented proficiency testing. Compliance of the methods used in each laboratory with the International Guideline ISO 17511:2020 114 on harmonization should be sought, as this will guarantee that the result for the patient samples is traceable to the SI units or the highest available standards.

Comparability of results: The need for standardization/harmonization

TH laboratory results ideally should be comparable over time, location, and independent of the method used. In 2017, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine's Committee of Standardization of Thyroid Function Tests (IFCC C-STFT) documented the status of comparability of results for both fT4 and TSH assays from 13 of 15 assay manufacturers. Depending on the selected assay reagents and equipment, laboratory results may differ by up to 50% for both fT4 and TSH (Fig. 1). If method-specific reference intervals are not employed, the classification of a numerical test result may be different depending on the assay used.

FIG. 1.
Status of comparability of results for both TSH and fT4 as documented in 2017 by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine's Committee of Standardization of Thyroid Function Tests. Median deviations for each assay for a panel of ∼100 patient samples (serum) with concentrations spread over the entire measurement interval versus the reference are shown (the black lines and squares; the 15th, 50th, and 85th centiles, the vertical line; reference free thyroxine: candidate reference measurement procedure based on equilibrium dialysis — isotope dilution — mass spectrometry/reference thyrotropin: all procedure trimmed mean). For more details, we refer to the original publications. Modified and updated from Thienpont et al.and De Grande et al.with permission.

In addition, the C-STFT also proposed a way to improve the current situation by standardizing fT4 and harmonizing TSH assays to reference measurement systems established according to ISO 17511. Their proof-of-concept study showed that for both fT4 and TSH, implementation of standardization/harmonization can reduce calibration differences between manufacturers. Note that the expected impact of standardization of fT4 values on patient results and reference intervals requires a carefully prepared transition as changes up to 30–50% are expected.

### Risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities during pregnancy: a systematic review of the literature to validate current risk factors and identify novel ones [^f5adb052]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: International guidelines recommend that the indication to perform thyroid function testing during pregnancy is based on the presence of risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities. However, the discriminative ability of currently recommended risk factors is questionable. To inform on an update of the American Thyroid Association Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease in Preconception, Pregnancy, and the Postpartum, we aimed to systematically review the literature to evaluate evidence for current risk factors and potential novel ones for thyroid function test abnormalities in pregnancy. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed on Embase, Medline Ovid, and the Cochrane Library from inception to October 17, 2024, to identify articles on the associations of any candidate variables with thyroid function test abnormalities, thyroid antibody positivity, or results of continuous thyroid function tests in pregnancy. Additional records were identified through citation searching. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We summarized the results using a narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 81 articles were included, describing 36 candidate variables. Thyroid antibody positivity was associated with a higher risk of overt or subclinical hypothyroidism compared with antibody negativity (absolute risks: 2.4–7.0% vs. 0.1–0.2% for overt hypothyroidism and 1.9–29.0% vs. 2.0–5.7% for subclinical hypothyroidism). In cases of iodine deficiency, sufficiency, and intake above pregnancy requirements or excess, the absolute risks for subclinical hypothyroidism were 2.2–42.6%, 1.42–16.0%, and 3.8–24.3%, respectively. A limited number of studies were available for history of autoimmune diseases, family history of thyroid disease, symptoms of hypothyroidism, and history of pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, or infertility. There was little or no association of current risk factors with isolated hypothyroxinemia or (subclinical) hyperthyroidism. We did not identify novel risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities. Conclusions: Evidence for most currently recommended risk factors remains limited and heterogeneous, and no novel risk factor was identified. While risk factors can help guide thyroid function testing in pregnancy, a clinical risk assessment cannot be replaced. Future studies are needed to detect novel risk factors that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of identifying pregnant women at high risk of thyroid function test abnormalities, in particular, overt hypothyroidism.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring thyroid function tests before and within the first 3 months following the initiation of amiodarone therapy, and at 3- to 6-month intervals thereafter.

### Thyroid and the heart [^23a092d6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones modulate every component of the cardiovascular system necessary for normal cardiovascular development and function. When cardiovascular disease is present, thyroid function tests are characteristically indicated to determine if overt thyroid disorders or even subclinical dysfunction exists. As hypothyroidism, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease all increase with advancing age, monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone, the most sensitive test for hypothyroidism, is important in this expanding segment of our population. A better understanding of the impact of thyroid hormonal status on cardiovascular physiology will enable health care providers to make decisions about thyroid hormone evaluation and therapy in concert with evaluating and treating hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this review is to access contemporary understanding of the effects of thyroid hormones on normal cardiovascular function and the potential role of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in a variety of cardiovascular diseases.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TSH MEASUREMENT

Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can in most cases be easily diagnosed based on using TSH measurement. In addition, the availability of high quality, sensitive and specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for the practice of high-quality cost-effective medicine.TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turn-around time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different (Box 2). Patient age presents an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns < 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due the postnatal TSH surge. In newborns between the ages of 3 days and 1 month, serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally considered as a clinical action limit requiring immediate action. At the other age extreme, in the elderly, the upper bound of the TSH reference interval progressively increases with age and should be reflected in laboratory reports and taken into consideration for clinical interpretation of TSH test results.

Box 2.
Points to Consider for Clinical Thyrotropin Measurements

As well as the initial clinical indication for which TSH is measured, other independent variables must be kept in mind when using and interpreting TSH measurements. Human thyroid function is affected by nutritional, environmental, geographical, genetic, and various (patho-)physiological endogenous or exogenous factors. These include population-specific iodine intake, patient age and sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used (see Comparability and Quality Assessment of fT4 and TSH Assays section).

### Thyroid dysfunction in the elderly [^09ea4246]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is common in the general population, and mild or subclinical forms can be present in more than 10% of individuals aged > 80 years. The diagnosis of abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations in people aged > 60 years poses a challenge, as the clinical presentation of thyroid dysfunction is usually nonspecific, and ageing is associated with a number of physiological changes that can affect thyroid function test results. Furthermore, the presence of acute or chronic nonthyroidal illnesses and the use of medications that interfere with thyroid function tests are common confounders in the determination of thyroid status in the elderly. Early diagnosis and treatment of overt thyroid dysfunction is crucial in this population in view of the marked effects of abnormal circulating thyroid hormone levels on a number of organ systems, including the heart, the skeleton and the neurological system. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity remains uncertain, and the need for treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. A number of large epidemiological studies have identified associations between mild thyroid dysfunction and short-term as well as long-term adverse outcomes, and a small but increasing number of randomized controlled intervention studies have been reported. Guidelines recommend treatment of thyroid dysfunction on the basis of the degree of abnormal serum TSH concentrations, patient age and associated comorbidities. This Review describes the current evidence on the prevalence, diagnosis, management and long-term consequences of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly.

Recommendations

3.3.6 If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose) and a full re-evaluation carried out at the end of this period, with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed (2|⊕○○).

3.3.7 If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than to obtain an exact diagnosis, L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, then continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. By contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting (2|⊕⊕○).

3.3.6–3.3.7 Evidence

By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

3.4 Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH

Recommendations

3.4.1 For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, we recommend an immediate increase in L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% after a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test (1|⊕○○).

3.4.2 TSH and FT4 (or TT 4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose (1|⊕⊕⊕).

3.4.3 The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester and below 3 mU/L later in pregnancy (1|⊕○○).

3.4.1–3.4.3 Evidence

There is currently no specific evidence for treatment schedules in pregnant women with CH. We therefore refer to the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and The Endocrine Society regarding the management of thyroid disease during pregnancy.

### Thyroid hormones and modulation of diastolic function: a promising target for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^24463124]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Thyroid hormones have an important role in cardiac and vascular function through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms. HFpEF is a clinical syndrome characterized by diastolic dysfunction and extra-cardiac disturbances, for which there is no proven therapy to improve its prognosis. Thyroid hormone axis modulation holds potential for improving the prognosis in patients with HFpEF. Although different therapeutic approaches may allow the optimization of thyroid hormone effects in HFpEF, it is still not clear which have more potential for clinical use. Furthermore, a more comprehensive characterization of the thyroid system in HFpEF patient cohorts and further pre-clinical tests in animal models of HFpEF are needed to hasten translation to clinical trials in a disease that has so far eluded conventional therapeutic approaches.

LABORATORY TESTS

Laboratory Tests — Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

2.0 Criteria for Diagnosis

2.1 Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration

Recommendations

2.1.1 We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is < 40 mU/L of whole blood, the clinician may postpone treatment, pending the serum results, for 1–2 days (1|⊕⊕○).

2.1.2 We recommend starting treatment immediately if serum FT4 concentration is below the norm for age, regardless of TSH concentration (1|⊕⊕⊕).

2.1.3 We suggest that treatment should be started if venous TSH concentration is persistently > 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal (2|⊕○○).

2.1.4 When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis (2|⊕○○). If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T 4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment (2|⊕○○).

2.1.1–2.1.4 Evidence

L-T 4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT 4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment if DBS TSH concentration is above this value. Given that the period between birth and the age of 3 years is a critical time for neurocognitive development, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L, carefully monitoring thyroid function to avoid overtreatment, and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located. Management remains a matter of debate for cases in which TSH concentrations are high, but to a lesser extent (6–20 mU/L), and FT4 levels are normal. The family should be informed that this is a "gray area" but that many clinicians would advise "playing safe" and treating during early childhood in this situation.

Key Points

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care.
Adjustment of the screening strategy will reduce costs, unnecessary follow-up and patient concerns.
An alternative strategy is to elevate the TSH cutoff value; this also led to improved positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism

### The complex web of interferences with thyroid function tests [^8a96a349]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thyroid disorders are common. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone is frequently measured and is the single best initial biomarker to diagnose thyroid disease. Automated immunoassays used to evaluate thyroid function are susceptible to interferences that can affect test results and therefore clinical decisions. In this comprehensive review, our aim is to discuss common assay and drug interferences leading to abnormal thyroid function tests.

Methods

Authors conducted a literature review of PubMed to include studies on drug related and laboratory assay interferences leading to primary and secondary thyroid dysfunction in addition to interferences with thyroid hormone replacement and thyroid function tests.

Results

Overall, there are several assay interferences as well as drug interferences leading to primary thyroid dysfunction including iodine-containing drugs such as amiodarone, lithium, immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, drug interferences leading to secondary thyroid dysfunction such as glucocorticoids, and drug interferences affecting thyroid hormone absorption, metabolism, and thyroid binding globulin levels. In addition, assay interferences from biotin, heterophile antibodies, macro-thyrotropin or anti-streptavidin antibodies may occur without underlying thyroid dysfunction, leading to abnormal thyroid function tests.

Conclusion

For appropriate patient management, it is imperative to identify assay interferences when discrepancies between clinical presentation and thyroid function test results are noted.

### Standardization of free thyroxine and harmonization of thyrotropin measurements: a request for input from endocrinologists and other physicians [^6424f9a2]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Dear Editor:

Given the prevalence of thyroid disorders and the subtle signs and symptoms that may accompany subclinical disease, reliable laboratory testing for serum thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroid hormones is important for both primary-care physicians and endocrinologists. The laboratory community has recognized the need for standardization of thyroid function tests to achieve comparability of measurement results between methods. This applies particularly for free thyroxine (fT4) tests, which may be considered controversial in terms of clinical and analytical validity. However, there is also variability in TSH testing — a fact that has not been emphasized in ongoing discussions regarding lowering the upper limit of normal and/or common decision limits to start treatment for hypothyroidism.

In response to this need, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) formed a Working Group for Standardization of Thyroid Function Tests (WG-STFT) in 2005. Today, the working group is a full Committee (C-STFT), and we authors are respectively chair, member, and past president at the IFCC. We have worked over the years toward the goal of standardization of fT4 and TSH testing. Because, unlike fT4, there is no reference measurement procedure for TSH, we have proposed an alternative to standardization for this test called harmonization. Different phases of method comparison studies were performed to investigate and confirm the feasibility of standardization of fT4 and harmonization of TSH tests, but also with attention to fit-for-purpose analytical quality.

In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended during AVONEX therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6, 5.10)]. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. Thyroid function should be monitored periodically. If patients have or develop symptoms of thyroid dysfunction (hypo- or hyperthyroidism), thyroid function tests should be performed according to standard medical practice.

Pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer pulmonary metastases — safety limits and supportive testing emphasize that re-treatment of pulmonary metastases with 131I is not recommended in children who do not have uptake on a DxWBS and who have not demonstrated a previous response to 131I (Recommendation rating: E). Pulmonary function testing should be considered in all children with diffuse pulmonary metastases, especially if multiple 131I treatments are planned (Recommendation rating: C). Because diffuse RAI uptake in the lungs raises concern for treatment-induced pulmonary fibrosis, administering lower 131I activities and employing dosimetry should be considered to limit radiation exposure, and many experts recommend that pulmonary function testing be done intermittently in such children, especially if multiple 131I treatments are planned.

### Utility of thyroid function testing in the inpatient setting [^4d274995]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Previous studies have reported a low value of ordering inpatient thyroid function tests (TFTs), with few changes in clinical management resulting from these tests. This study was designed to evaluate how often testing the thyroid function during hospitalization leads to medication initiation or adjustment and to determine whether the frequency of medication initiation or adjustment differs based on the indication for testing.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study of 2278 patients who underwent TFTs tested while admitted to an academic hospital during a 5-month period. The indications for ordering TFTs were determined by reviewing clinical documentation, and those with abnormal test results were reviewed to assess whether thyroid medication was initiated or adjusted.

Results

The percentage of abnormal TFTs that led to medication initiation or adjustment was 15.1%, 12.2%, and 6.0%, for those tested based on a history of functional thyroid disease, suspicion of thyroid dysfunction, and reasons not directly related to thyroid dysfunction, respectively. Overall, 63 patients were started on thyroid medication or had their thyroid medication dose adjusted, which represented 10.1% of those with abnormal TFTs and only 2.8% of those tested.

Conclusion

Abnormal TFTs are common, but a disproportionate number of tests are needed to find a small percentage of clinically significant thyroid dysfunction, of which only a low percentage leads to changes in management. Education on this topic should be provided to inpatient providers to limit thyroid function testing to instances in which they are clinically indicated and abnormal results would lead to changes in management.

Conclusion

NTI is a very common syndrome in the intensive care setting, and routine thyroid function testing is generally not recommended. However, if there is a high suspicion for underlying thyroid disease, a thyroid function test should be performed and interpreted with caution. Thyroid function tests should be repeated after recovery from acute illness to ascertain euthyroid status. An evaluation for primary thyroid disease is essential, particularly when TSH is undetectable or > 20 μIU/mL.

### Thyroid, unspecified (thyroid) [^01a21d10]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Thyroid Suppression Therapy

Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.

For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T4 and T3 levels and lack of response to TSH.

Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.

Pediatric Dosage

Pediatric dosage should follow the recommendations summarized in Table 1. In infants with congenital hypothyroidism, therapy with full doses should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis has been made.

### Variation in thyroid function tests in patients with stable untreated subclinical hypothyroidism [^adf0aec3]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Knowledge of variation in thyroid function is important for interpretation of thyroid function tests. We aimed to describe intra-individual variation in thyroid function in patients with stable, untreated subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) compared to euthyroid individuals to assess the importance of monitoring SCH patients.

Design

We measured thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and free triiodothyronine (fT3) monthly for 1 year in a longitudinal study of 15 untreated SCH patients with initial TSH 5–12 mU/L, without trends in TSH, and compared findings with results from 15 euthyroid individuals.

Main Outcome

CV% was 17.0, 6.1, and 6.2 for TSH, fT4, and fT3, respectively. Overall CV% for TSH was lower in SCH patients than controls. Contrary to euthyroid individuals, CV% in SCH patients increased with rising mean TSH (r2 = 0.29, p = 0.04). Individual disease set points were established with 45, 6, and 6 tests for TSH, fT4, and fT3, with 95% confidence. Differences required between two test results were 40%, 15%, and 15%, respectively, with 90% confidence.

Conclusion

Percent variation in TSH was lower in SCH than in euthyroid controls, but increased with higher mean TSH. The number of tests needed to establish disease set points was high. The difference required between two tests to be truly different was 40% for TSH and 15% for fT4 and fT3.

### Thyroid function before, during, and after COVID-19 [^6371a721]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this observational study, we investigated the acute effects of COVID-19 on thyroid function in the largest cohort of patients to date. Most patients were euthyroid at admission with COVID-19. We did however observe a small reduction in TSH and FT4 in patients with COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 cases. We confirmed with matched samples that there was a reduction in TSH and FT4 from 2019 baselines to admission with COVID-19, and this was not seen in patients admitted without COVID-19. Muller et al recently reported overt thyrotoxicosis in 15% of patients admitted to a high-dependency ITU with COVID-19, compared to 2% in those treated in low-intensity settings; however, this study defined thyrotoxicosis as TSH less than 0.28 mU/L and/or FT4 greater than 21.9 pmol/L, reflecting the fact that TSH was the first-line thyroid function test and FT4 was measured in only 24% of their patients. We also note that in their study, TSH was routinely measured in all high-dependency ITU patients but less frequently measured in all low-dependency ITU patients, possibly introducing bias. Lania and colleagues similarly reported overt thyrotoxicosis in 10.8% of their cohort of 287 patients with COVID-19 who were treated outside intensive care, but measured thyroid hormones in only 25% of patients. In contrast, our study included complete sets of FT4 and TSH measurements and the measurement of thyroid function was applied across the board as part of a standard workup. In our data set we did not see any patients with overt thyrotoxicosis (using a conservative definition of TSH < 0.30 and FT4 > 23.0), even in our 40 cases of COVID-19 admitted to the ITU. Therefore, in our cohort, there was no suggestion of a novel COVID-19–related thyroiditis/thyrotoxicosis.

### Use of electronic clinical decision support and hard stops to decrease unnecessary thyroid function testing [^a2abb0fc]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital embarked on a Zero Unnecessary Study (ZEUS) initiative, whereby all aspects of clinical care were evaluated and strategies were implemented to mitigate waste. An opportunity was found in regards to thyroid function testing. It has been shown that certain TFTs are ordered far more often than clinically indicated. Free T3 (fT3) and Free T4 (fT4) are only indicated when the TSH is abnormal in the inpatient setting, with rare exceptions.

Thus, a clinical algorithm for Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Hard Stops (HS) were incorporated into the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to prevent fT3 or fT4 to be ordered without an abnormal TSH, with certain predefined exceptions. In addition, a reflex rule was built which automatically orders (reflex) fT3 and fT4 if the TSH is abnormal. The pre and post-intervention ratios of fT3 and fT4 orders per total TSH orders were analyzed.

Pre-intervention data revealed that fT4 was the most frequently ordered TFT laboratory test on admission, after TSH. Post-Intervention, there was a decrease in the ratio of fT4 to TSH orders (fT4/TSH) of 35.2%, from 44.6% to 28.9%. The percentage of fT4 ordered due to abnormal TSH increased by 126.1%, from 36.8% to 83.2%. The fT3 to TSH ordering ratio similarly decreased by 55.2%, from 6.2% to 2.9%. The decreases in both fT3/TSH and fT4/TSH ratios were statistically significant.

Any unnecessary orders are a burden on healthcare. It is now possible to achieve goals that were not previously thought to be possible because of advancement in medicine and technology. By making small changes and saving costs, we can target our energy and resources toward effectively treating patients.

### Standardization of free thyroxine and harmonization of thyrotropin measurements: a request for input from endocrinologists and other physicians [^9e7453d4]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

For fT4, the variability is substantial. Standardization will change results significantly — perhaps as much as 80% at the upper limit of the normal range — for some assays. For TSH, the alterations introduced by harmonization will be milder (approximately 20%). The Committee, comprising laboratory professionals and manufacturers, has received a positive response for this approach from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), albeit with the caveat to investigate the risks associated with changes in the numerical results for some of the assays.

To this end, we are reaching out to stakeholders to seek views on the benefits and risks arising from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization.

1.000000000000000e+00 Benefits: We wish to learn about the benefits that you think would be achieved if all fT4 and TSH assays gave comparable results on patient samples.
2.000000000000000e+00 Risks: We wish to learn about the risks to patient safety and clinical outcomes that you think may arise as a consequence of a change in the numerical results for patients with thyroid disorders who are being followed, despite appropriate adjustments of the reference intervals. Particular attention should be paid to the question of whether standardization for uncomplicated hypo- and hyperthyroidism may detract from assay differences for important clinical populations (nonthyroidal illness, and elderly and pregnant individuals).
3.000000000000000e+00 Implementation: We wish to hear your views on how clinical laboratories can minimize the identified risks from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization, and about the role that you could play for the patients you treat.

This call is being launched to several clinical journals in parallel and to professional organizations for physicians and laboratory specialists.

### Thyroid function before, during, and after COVID-19 [^ec06d8c6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The effects of COVID-19 on the thyroid axis remain uncertain. Recent evidence has been conflicting, with both thyrotoxicosis and suppression of thyroid function reported.

Objective

We aimed to detail the acute effects of COVID-19 on thyroid function and determine if these effects persisted on recovery from COVID-19.

Design

A cohort observational study was conducted.

Participants and Setting

Adult patients admitted to Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, London, UK, with suspected COVID-19 between March 9 to April 22, 2020, were included, excluding those with preexisting thyroid disease and those missing either free thyroxine (FT4) or thyrotropin (TSH) measurements. Of 456 patients, 334 had COVID-19 and 122 did not.

Main Outcome Measures

TSH and FT4 measurements were recorded at admission, and where available, in 2019 and at COVID-19 follow-up.

Results

Most patients (86.6%) presenting with COVID-19 were euthyroid, with none presenting with overt thyrotoxicosis. Patients with COVID-19 had a lower admission TSH and FT4 compared to those without COVID-19. In the COVID-19 patients with matching baseline thyroid function tests from 2019 (n = 185 for TSH and 104 for FT4), TSH and FT4 both were reduced at admission compared to baseline. In a complete case analysis of COVID-19 patients with TSH measurements at follow-up, admission, and baseline (n = 55), TSH was seen to recover to baseline at follow-up.

Conclusions

Most patients with COVID-19 present with euthyroidism. We observed mild reductions in TSH and FT4 in keeping with a nonthyroidal illness syndrome. Furthermore, in survivors of COVID-19, thyroid function tests at follow-up returned to baseline.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^a0d51f90]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Screening for thyroid dysfunction is frequently performed in older individuals presenting with fatigue and general malaise to exclude thyroid disease. The diagnosis of thyroid disease is largely biochemical. Hence, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) cutoff values, which vary significantly between laboratories, are important determinants of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. Current screening guidelines for thyroid dysfunction in primary care suggest a TSH assay followed by analysis of fT4, if TSH results are outside the reference interval (reflex testing). TSH is a sensitive marker. Linear changes in fT4 lead to exponential changes in TSH. Hence, TSH has traditionally been the first choice screening test.

A consistently elevated TSH with an fT4 within the reference range results in the diagnosis subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT). Although associations between SCHT and some areas of medicine such as cardio-renal metabolic disease are still under investigation, in older persons (65 years and over) SCHT is generally believed not to be associated with quality of life, symptom burden, physical or cognitive functioning, other diseases or mortality. Additionally, multiple studies have shown that older adults with SCHT do not benefit from levothyroxine supplementation. Still, in daily practice, the diagnosis SCHT leads to additional monitoring, unnecessary treatment and increased patient concerns.

Therefore, fT4-based screening to identify clinical thyroid disease would potentially be a more efficient screening strategy for older adults with possible symptoms of thyroid disease. This strategy could reduce costs and patient concerns. Several reports dating from the '80's and '90's have already suggested such a testing algorithm. Alternatively, TSH decision limits could be adjusted to reduce unnecessary reflex testing and thus reduce unwarranted monitoring.

In this retrospective study we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction in older adults in primary care compared with TSH-based screening. Furthermore, the alternative approach of elevating TSH decision limits was investigated in parallel.

### Iothalamate meglumine (cysto-conray II) [^e28de862]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Information for the Patient

Patients receiving diagnostic agents for instillation urography should be instructed to:

Inform your physician if you are pregnant.
Inform your physician if you are allergic to any food, drugs or dyes used for x-ray procedures (see PRECAUTIONS, General).
Consult with your physician if, at some future date, any thyroid tests are planned. The iodine in this agent may interfere with later thyroid tests.
Inform your physician about any other medications you are currently taking.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction

Thyroid Function Tests – If indicated, these tests generally should be performed prior to the administration of any iodinated agent. However, thyroid function can be evaluated after use of these agents by using T3resin uptake or free thyroxine assays.
