## Question

Is augmentin hepatotoxic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) is hepatotoxic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define hepatotoxicity in a clinically meaningful, reference-aligned way. Then, I should verify what the regulatory labeling says about liver injury with Augmentin. Next, I will review epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence to quantify risk and characterize patterns. After that, I should identify risk factors and latency. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications, including monitoring, causality assessment, and management, and reconcile any conflicting statements I might encounter along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: hepatotoxicity here should mean drug-induced liver injury (DILI), which can be direct and dose-dependent or idiosyncratic and dose-independent. Clinically significant DILI is typically defined by AST or ALT greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal, ALP greater than 2 times ULN, or total bilirubin greater than 2.5 mg/dL with enzyme elevations, and it requires exclusion of alternative causes before attribution to a drug [^b4a7bcd5].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before drawing inferences: multiple FDA labels consistently warn that hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, has been associated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible, but deaths have been reported, and prior cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction with Augmentin is a contraindication to reuse, which is a strong signal of established hepatotoxicity risk [^f80dab7a] [^05192d09] [^bd6c3a14].

> I need to check the epidemiology to quantify risk rather than rely on anecdotes: large cohort and registry data show amoxicillin-clavulanate is among the most frequently implicated agents for idiosyncratic DILI in Western countries, with population estimates around 1 in 2300 users developing liver injury in Iceland and substantial representation in DILI registries, including 12.8% of cases in a Spanish series and 14% in a prospective registry, underscoring a real, albeit uncommon, risk signal [^a7449b62] [^1b3d9086] [^810828c8].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical patterns and latency because they guide vigilance: amoxicillin-clavulanate classically produces a cholestatic or mixed pattern, often with delayed onset, with symptoms arising during therapy or several weeks after completion. Mean time to jaundice is about 16 days, and late presentations after therapy ends are not rare, which is why clinicians should maintain suspicion even after the course is finished [^810828c8] [^ffa4ac48].

> Let me consider risk factors so I can counsel patients appropriately: older age increases the risk of cholestatic or mixed injury, whereas younger patients may more often show hepatocellular patterns. Male sex is overrepresented in some series, and prolonged therapy may increase risk. Genetic susceptibility has been explored, with HLA associations reported in some studies, though clinical HLA testing is not routinely recommended for prevention due to low positive predictive value [^810828c8] [^a9b9e45a] [^da775401].

> I should confirm the mechanism to align with management: amoxicillin-clavulanate DILI is idiosyncratic and immune-mediated in many cases, with drug-specific T-cell responses to amoxicillin and/or clavulanate documented, and histology often showing cholestasis with eosinophils, supporting an immunoallergic pathogenesis in a subset of patients [^74edc672] [^a53e8376].

> Next, I should review clinical implications for practice: given established risk, avoid Augmentin in patients with prior Augmentin-associated cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction. Use caution and consider baseline and symptom-triggered LFTs in those with preexisting liver disease, older adults, or prolonged courses. And if DILI is suspected, stop the drug promptly and apply causality tools such as RUCAM while excluding viral, autoimmune, alcoholic, and biliary etiologies, because early recognition and drug withdrawal improve outcomes [^f80dab7a] [^90032cab] [^da775401] [^b4a7bcd5].

> But wait, what if the injury is severe or cholestatic and not improving after withdrawal? I should double-check the role of corticosteroids: case-based evidence and expert opinion suggest that corticosteroids may benefit severe cholestatic DILI with hypersensitivity features, and case reports document recovery with prednisolone in amoxicillin-clavulanate cholestasis, though this remains off-label and should be individualized with hepatology input [^36772b5f] [^a53e8376].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the risk might be uniformly high because of frequent use, but I should correct that impression: despite being a leading cause of DILI in some registries, the absolute risk remains low, on the order of about 1 in 2300 users, and most cases resolve with drug withdrawal, though rare progression to acute liver failure or death does occur, particularly with hepatocellular jaundice or additional risk factors [^a7449b62] [^1b3d9086].

> In summary, yes, Augmentin is hepatotoxic via an idiosyncratic, immune-mediated mechanism that can produce cholestatic or mixed liver injury with variable latency, including after therapy ends. The risk is uncommon but real, higher in older adults and with prolonged therapy, and mandates avoidance in those with prior Augmentin-associated hepatic injury and a low threshold to stop and evaluate if liver test abnormalities or jaundice occur during or after treatment [^f80dab7a] [^810828c8] [^48487464].

---

Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) can cause **hepatotoxicity** [^587b863a], most often as a **cholestatic or mixed-pattern liver injury** [^810828c8] that is usually reversible but can rarely be severe or fatal [^587b863a]. Risk is higher in older adults, males, and with prolonged therapy [^587b863a]; onset may occur during or weeks after treatment [^587b863a]. Monitor liver function if symptoms or risk factors are present, and avoid use in patients with a history of Augmentin-associated cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction [^f80dab7a].

---

## Clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity

Multiple authoritative sources document **hepatotoxicity** with Augmentin:

- **FDA warnings**: Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, has been reported [^587b863a]; hepatic toxicity is usually reversible, but deaths have occurred [^587b863a].
- **Incidence**: Population data estimate ~1 in 2,300 users develop liver injury [^a7449b62].
- **Patterns**: Cholestatic or mixed injury predominates [^810828c8]; hepatocellular injury occurs less often [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors and patient populations

Certain factors increase the risk of **Augmentin-related liver injury**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults have higher risk, especially for cholestatic injury [^810828c8] [^a9b9e45a] |
| Sex | Male sex is overrepresented in case series [^a9b9e45a] |
| Duration | Prolonged therapy increases risk [^587b863a] |
| Comorbidities | Pre-existing liver disease increases susceptibility [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical presentation and latency

- **Latency**: Typically 1–3 weeks after starting therapy, but can occur during treatment or weeks after completion [^810828c8] [^587b863a].
- **Symptoms**: Jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, fatigue, and abdominal pain [^notfound].
- **Labs**: Elevated ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin; cholestatic or mixed patterns are common [^587b863a] [^810828c8].

---

## Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity

Augmentin hepatotoxicity is **idiosyncratic and immune-mediated** [^ffa4ac48], with T-cell responses to amoxicillin and clavulanate demonstrated in affected patients [^74edc672]. Genetic susceptibility, including HLA associations, has been reported but is not yet clinically actionable [^da775401] [^3129dfe0].

---

## Severity and outcomes

Most cases resolve with drug withdrawal, but **severe outcomes** can occur:

- **Severe injury**: Rare progression to acute liver failure, transplantation, or death [^1b3d9086].
- **Mortality**: Estimated < 1 death per 4 million prescriptions, often with serious comorbidities or concomitant hepatotoxins [^5a3ef84e].
- **Chronicity**: A minority develop chronic cholestasis or vanishing bile duct syndrome [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Routine LFTs are not required for all patients; monitor if symptoms, risk factors, or prolonged therapy are present [^notfound].
- **Contraindications**: Do not use in patients with prior Augmentin-associated cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction [^f80dab7a].
- **Management**: Stop the drug immediately if liver injury is suspected; supportive care is standard; corticosteroids may be considered for severe cholestatic cases [^a53e8376].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

Augmentin is among the **most commonly implicated antibiotics** for DILI in Western countries [^8000953f], with a higher risk than amoxicillin alone but lower than some agents like isoniazid or nitrofurantoin [^a7449b62].

---

Augmentin can cause **idiosyncratic, cholestatic or mixed liver injury** that is usually reversible but can be severe; use caution in older adults, with prolonged therapy, or in those with prior Augmentin-related liver injury, and stop the drug promptly if liver injury is suspected.

## References

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^d5a84c1f]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Since both the 250-mg and 500-mg tablets of
AUGMENTIN contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (125 mg, as the potassium
salt), two 250-mg tablets of AUGMENTIN are not equivalent to one 500-mg tablet
of AUGMENTIN; therefore, two 250-mg tablets of AUGMENTIN should not be
substituted for one 500-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

Dosage

The usual adult dose is one 500-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every
12 hours or one 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours. For more severe
infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one
875-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 500-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN
every 8 hours.

Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in
dose unless the impairment is severe. Severely impaired patients with a
glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min. should not receive the 875-mg
tablet. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min. should
receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the
infection. Patients with a less than 10 mL/min. glomerular filtration rate
should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the
infection.

Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours,
depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose
both during and at the end of dialysis.

Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic
function monitored at regular intervals. (See WARNINGS.)

Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed
according to the adult recommendations.

Due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios
in the 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN (250/125) versus the 250-mg chewable tablet of
AUGMENTIN (250/62.5), the 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should not be used until
the pediatric patient weighs at least 40 kg or more.

Administration

AUGMENTIN may be taken without regard to meals; however,
absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when AUGMENTIN is administered
at the start of a meal. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal
intolerance, AUGMENTIN should be taken at the start of a meal.

---

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (augmentinXR) [^9b5566c5]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

AUGMENTIN XR should be taken at the start of a meal to enhance
the absorption of amoxicillin and to minimize the potential for gastrointestinal
intolerance. Absorption of the amoxicillin component is decreased when AUGMENTIN
XR is taken on an empty stomach (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

The recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is 4,000 mg/250 mg daily according to
the following table:

Tablets of AUGMENTIN (250 mg or 500 mg) CANNOT be used to
provide the same dosages as AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets. This is
because AUGMENTIN XR contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid, while the AUGMENTIN
250-mg and 500-mg tablets each contain 125 mg of clavulanic acid. In addition,
the Extended Release Tablet provides an extended time course of plasma
amoxicillin concentrations compared to immediate-release Tablets. Thus, two
AUGMENTIN 500-mg tablets are not equivalent to one AUGMENTIN XR tablet.

Scored AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are available for greater
convenience for adult patients who have difficulty swallowing. The scored tablet
is not intended to reduce the dosage of medication taken; as stated in the table
above, the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is two tablets twice a day (every 12
hours).

Renally Impaired Patients

The pharmacokinetics of AUGMENTIN XR have not been studied in
patients with renal impairment. AUGMENTIN XR is contraindicated in patients with
a creatinine clearance of < 30 mL/min. and in hemodialysis patients (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hepatically Impaired Patients

Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and
hepatic function monitored at regular intervals (see WARNINGS).

Pediatric Use

Pediatric patients who weigh 40 kg or more and can swallow
tablets should receive the adult dose.

Geriatric Use

No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly (see
PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^7136501b]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amoxicillin / clavulanate PO (also known as Augmentin):
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including amoxicillin/clavulanate, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Enterocolitis**: use caution in all patients, especially in pediatric patients.
- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: use caution in patients with phenylketonuria, as chewable tablets and powder for oral solution contain phenylalanine.
- **Hepatic dysfunction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amoxicillin/clavulanate has been associated with an increased risk of hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Monitor liver function in patients with hepatic impairment.

5.1 Serious Allergic Reactions, including Anaphylaxis

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials, including AUGMENTIN ES-600. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with AUGMENTIN ES-600, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue AUGMENTIN ES-600 and institute appropriate therapy.

5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

AUGMENTIN ES-600 may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash, they should be monitored closely, and AUGMENTIN ES-600 discontinued if lesions progress.

5.3 Drug-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (DIES)

Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with use of amoxicillin, a component of AUGMENTIN ES-600 [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)], with most cases occurring in pediatric patients  18 years of age. DIES is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction characterized by protracted vomiting occurring 1 to 4 hours after drug ingestion in the absence of skin or respiratory symptoms. DIES may be associated with pallor, lethargy, hypotension, shock, diarrhea within 24 hours after ingesting amoxicillin, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. If DIES occurs, discontinue AUGMENTIN ES-600 and institute appropriate therapy.

5.4 Hepatic Dysfunction

Use AUGMENTIN ES-600 with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic toxicity associated with the use of AUGMENTIN ES-600 is usually reversible. Deaths have been reported (fewer than one death reported per estimated four million prescriptions worldwide). These have generally been cases associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

WARNINGS

SERIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY FATAL HYPERSENSITIVITY (ANAPHYLACTIC)
REACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS ON PENICILLIN THERAPY. THESE REACTIONS
ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN
HYPERSENSITIVITY AND/OR A HISTORY OF SENSITIVITY TO MULTIPLE ALLERGENS. THERE
HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY
WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE REACTIONS WHEN TREATED WITH CEPHALOSPORINS. BEFORE
INITIATING THERAPY WITH AUGMENTIN, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE CONCERNING
PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO PENICILLINS, CEPHALOSPORINS, OR OTHER
ALLERGENS. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION OCCURS, AUGMENTIN SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND
THE APPROPRIATE THERAPY INSTITUTED. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTIC
REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE. OXYGEN,
INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO
BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD)
has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including
AUGMENTIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading
to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which
contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile. cause increased morbidity and mortality, as
these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require
colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea
following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has
been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial
agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed
against C. difficile. may need to be discontinued.
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation,
antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical
evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

AUGMENTIN should be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic
dysfunction. Hepatic toxicity associated with the use of AUGMENTIN is usually
reversible. On rare occasions, deaths have been reported (less than 1 death
reported per estimated 4 million prescriptions worldwide). These have generally
been cases associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant
medications. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Liver.)

Contraindications

4.1 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to amoxicillin, clavulanate or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins).

4.2 Cholestatic Jaundice/Hepatic Dysfunction

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets.

---

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^be7c0cb3]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of AUGMENTIN. Dosing in the
fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin.
While AUGMENTIN can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate
potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In 1
study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when AUGMENTIN
was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high-fat breakfast. The
safety and efficacy of AUGMENTIN have been established in clinical trials where
AUGMENTIN was taken without regard to meals.

Meanaamoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in the table below:

aMean values of 14 normal volunteers (n = 15 for
clavulanate potassium in the low-dose regimens). Peak concentrations occurred
approximately 1.5 hours after the dose.

bAdministered at the start of a light meal.

Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with AUGMENTIN are similar to those
produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone.
The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN is 1.3
hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1.0 hour.

Warnings and Precautions

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.2 Hepatic Dysfunction

Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment.

5.3 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (augmentinXR) [^0e98f172]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of AUGMENTIN XR.

AUGMENTIN XR is an extended-release formulation which provides sustained
plasma concentrations of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin systemic exposure achieved
with AUGMENTIN XR is similar to that produced by the oral administration of
equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. In a study of healthy adult volunteers,
the pharmacokinetics of AUGMENTIN XR were compared when administered in a fasted
state, at the start of a standardized meal (612 kcal, 89.3 g carb, 24.9 g fat,
and 14.0 g protein), or 30 minutes after a high-fat meal. When the systemic
exposure to both amoxicillin and clavulanate is taken into consideration,
AUGMENTIN XR is optimally administered at the start of a standardized meal.
Absorption of amoxicillin is decreased in the fasted state. AUGMENTIN XR is not
recommended to be taken with a high-fat meal, because clavulanate absorption is
decreased. The pharmacokinetics of the components of AUGMENTIN XR following
administration of two AUGMENTIN XR tablets at the start of a standardized meal
are presented in Table 1.

aMedian (range).

The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN XR is
approximately 1.3 hours, and that of clavulanate is approximately 1.0 hour.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during postmarketing use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.

 Gastrointestinal: Indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black "hairy" tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Pruritus, angioedema, serum sickness–like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and cases of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

 Liver: Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin, and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been reported with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued. The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. Deaths have been reported [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during postmarketing use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.

Gastrointestinal: Indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black "hairy" tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions: Pruritus, angioedema, serum sickness–like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and cases of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Liver: Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin, and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been reported with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued. The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. Deaths have been reported [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.2 Hepatic Dysfunction

Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment.

5.3 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

 C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued.

Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.4 Skin Rash in Patients with Mononucleosis

A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.

5.5 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth

The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfection occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin) [^72d2f79c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding every 12 hour and every 8-hour dosing regimens of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium in adults and children.

Absorption: Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin. While AUGMENTIN can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In one study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when AUGMENTIN was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high‑fat breakfast.

Distribution: Neither component in AUGMENTIN is highly protein‑bound; clavulanic acid is approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound

Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid.

Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of suspension of AUGMENTIN to fasting children, average concentrations of 3 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions.

Metabolism and Excretion: The half‑life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN is 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1 hour.

Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of a single 250 mg/125 mg or 500 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

AUGMENTIN is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Mean amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium pharmacokinetic parameters in normal adults following administration of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets are shown in Table 6 and following administration of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets are shown in Table 7.

Table 6: Mean (± S.D.) Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Pharmacokinetic Parameters a, b with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets

Table 7: Mean (± S.D.) Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Pharmacokinetic Parameters a, b with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets

Oral administration of 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium or the equivalent dose of 10 mL of the 125 mg/31.25 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg*h/mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg*h/mL for clavulanic acid when 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium or equivalent dose of 10 mL of the 125 mg/31.25 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium were administered to normal adults. One 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium or two 125 mg/31.25 mg chewable tablets of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium are equivalent to 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium and provide similar serum concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

AUGMENTIN may be taken without regard to meals; however, absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when AUGMENTIN is administered at the start of a meal. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, AUGMENTIN should be taken at the start of a meal.

2.2 Adult Patients

See dosing regimens of AUGMENTIN (based on the amoxicillin component) provided in Table 1 below.

Table 1. Dosing Regimens of AUGMENTIN in Adult Patients

aAdults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the AUGMENTIN 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL suspension or the AUGMENTIN 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension may be used in place of the 875 mg/125 mg tablet.

bAdults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the AUGMENTIN 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL or AUGMENTIN 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension in place of the 500 mg/125 mg tablet.

cTwo AUGMENTIN 250 mg/125 mg tablets are NOT substitutable with one 500 mg/125 mg AUGMENTIN tablet [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published epidemiologic studies and pharmacovigilance case reports over several decades of use with amoxicillin and clavulanate during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal outcomes. A study in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) reported that prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate may be associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates (see Data). Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rodents, given up to approximately 2 times the amount of amoxicillin and 15 times the amount of clavulanate in the Maximum Human Recommended Dose (MHRD) of AUGMENTIN ES-600, revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

One randomized, controlled trial included 4,826 pregnant women with premature rupture of fetal membranes who were randomly assigned to 250 mg erythromycin (n = 1,197), 250 mg amoxicillin and 125 mg clavulanic acid (amoxicillin and clavulanate, n = 1,212), amoxicillin and clavulanate and erythromycin (n = 1,192), or placebo (n = 1,225) four times daily for 10 days or until delivery. Amoxicillin and clavulanate was associated with a significantly increased rate of proven neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: 1.9% (n = 24) in the amoxicillin and clavulanate only group versus 0.5% (n = 6) in the placebo group (p = 0.001), and 1.8% (n = 44) in the any amoxicillin and clavulanate group versus 0.7% (n = 17) in the no amoxicillin and clavulanate group (p = 0.0005).

10 OVERDOSAGE

In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms1.

Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in patients after overdosage with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.

Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium crystalluria.

Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given AUGMENTIN (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to AUGMENTIN. The amoxicillin doses in rats and mice (based on body surface area) were approximately 4 and 2 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (875 mg every 12 hours). For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 9 and 4 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (125 mg every 8 hours). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

8.2 Labor and Delivery

Oral ampicillin‑class antibacterials are poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Amoxicillin has been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets have been established in pediatric patients. Use of AUGMENTIN in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from studies of AUGMENTIN Tablets in adults with additional data from a study of AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension in pediatric patients aged 2 months to 12 years with acute otitis media [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed; clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group. Dosing of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium should be modified in pediatric patients aged less than 12 weeks (less than 3 months) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Determinants of the clinical expression of amoxicillin-clavulanate hepatotoxicity: a prospective series from Spain [^810828c8]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC) hepatotoxicity has been reported to exhibit a higher predominance of cholestatic types of damage, especially in males. However, the determinants of its clinical expression are unknown. This study prospectively evaluated the profile of AC hepatotoxicity. Data on all cases of hepatotoxicity reported to the Spanish Registry attributed to AC and assessed as definite or probable on the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) scale were collated and compared to published case series. Hepatotoxicity related to amoxicillin-clavulanate was identified in 69 patients (36 males; mean age 56 years) representing 14% of all cases of hepatotoxicity submitted to the Registry. There was an overall sex distribution and the predominant pattern of lesion was hepatocellular (36%) which occurred at a shorter duration of treatment (P < .03). Mean time lapse between therapy initiation and jaundice onset was 16 days. Late onset of symptoms following end of treatment occurred in half the cases. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified advancing age as the factor associated with the development of cholestatic/mixed type of injury (odds ratio for an age interval for 1 year: 1.045 [95% CI = 1.013–1.078; P = 0.005). An unfavorable outcome was seen in 7% of patients. In conclusion, age is the most important determinant in the biochemical expression of AC hepatotoxicity; younger age is associated with cytolytic damage and shorter treatment duration, whereas cholestatic/mixed type of damage is related to older age and prolonged AC therapy.

2.5 Directions for Mixing Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension

Prepare AUGMENTIN for oral suspension at time of dispensing as follows: Tap bottle until all powder flows freely. Measure a total (see Table 5 below for total amount of water for reconstitution) OF WATER. Add approximately 2/3 of the water to the powder. Replace cap and shake VIGOROUSLY. Add remaining water. Replace cap and shake VIGOROUSLY.

Table 5: Amount of Water for Mixing AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension

Shake oral suspension well before using. Reconstituted suspension must be stored under refrigeration and discarded after 10 days. Some color change is normal during dosing period.

2.6 Switching between Dosage Forms and between Strengths

AUGMENTIN 250 mg/125 mg Tablet is NOT Substitutable with AUGMENTIN 250 mg/62.5 mg Chewable Tablet

The 250 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN should NOT be substituted for each other and the 250 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should NOT be used in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The 250 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid. The 250 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid whereas the 250 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid.

Two AUGMENTIN 250 mg/125 mg Tablets are NOT Substitutable with One 500 mg/125 mg AUGMENTIN Tablet

Two 250 mg/125 mg tablets of AUGMENTIN should NOT be substituted for one 500 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN. Since both the 250 mg and 500 mg tablets of AUGMNTIN contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (125 mg, as the potassium salt), two 250 mg tablets of AUGMENTIN are not equivalent to one 500 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co‑administration with probenecid is not recommended. (7.1)
Concomitant use of AUGMENTIN and oral anticoagulants may increase the prolongation of prothrombin time.(7.2)
Co-administration with allopurinol increases the risk of rash. (7.3)
AUGMENTIN may reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. (7.4)

7.1 Probenecid

Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid. Concurrent use with AUGMENTIN may result in increased and prolonged blood concentrations of amoxicillin. Co-administration of probenecid is not recommended.

7.2 Oral Anticoagulants

Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently with AUGMENTIN. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.

7.3 Allopurinol

The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.

7.4 Oral Contraceptives

AUGMENTIN may affect intestinal flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.

7.5 Effects on Laboratory Tests

High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST®, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with AUGMENTIN, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used.

Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.

### Drug-induced liver injury-types and phenotypes [^633f2b82]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on drug-induced liver injury:

- **Definition**: DILI is acute/chronic liver injury characterized by abnormalities in liver function.
- **Pathophysiology**: DILI is mostly caused by antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate; 45.4%), herbal and dietary supplements (16.1%), cardiovascular agents (9.8%), CNS agents (9.1%), anti-neoplastic agents (5.5%), and analgesics (paracetamol overdose; 3.7%).
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of DILI include jaundice, rashes, acute hepatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, AIH, coagulopathies, hepatic encephalopathy. Progression may lead to chronic liver disease with fibrosis, cirrhosis, necessitating liver transplantation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality rate associated with DILI is 7.6%.

Guidance statements

13 Clinically significant DILI is typically defined as any one of the following: (1) serum AST or ALT > 5× ULN, or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions; (2) total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl along with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP level; or (3) INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP.
14 Most hepatotoxic drugs cause liver injury within the first 6 months of use but occasionally have longer latency intervals or may even present after drug discontinuation (e.g. amoxicillin‐clavulanate). Therefore, evaluation of a patient with suspected DILI should include a detailed medication and HDS history within the 180 days before presentation.
15 Idiosyncratic DILI cases should be categorized by the R value at presentation (R = (ALT/ULN)/(ALP/ULN)) into hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), mixed (2 < R < 5), and cholestatic (R ≤ 2) profiles, which can help guide the evaluation of alternative causes of liver injury.
16 Excluding alternative causes of liver injury is required in all DILI cases, including testing for viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, AIH, and pancreaticobiliary disease.
17 Certain drugs have been associated with specific laboratory and histologic phenotypes, termed signatures which may be useful in causality assessment.
18 We recommend accessing the LiverTox website for a synopsis of the published literature on liver injury due to over 1000 prescription drugs and more than 60 HDS.

Liver biopsy in suspected DILI

Although a liver biopsy is not necessary to diagnose DILI, it can be helpful in excluding other causes of liver disease and in increasing the confidence in a diagnosis of DILI in cases of clinical uncertainty. Certain medications are associated with specific histological patterns of liver injury that can be confirmed on biopsy. Biopsy can also be useful when the liver biochemistries or symptoms do not improve with drug dechallenge or the patient remains jaundiced, and can be used to help assess the severity of liver injury.–Finally, a liver biopsy may help identify other causes of underlying or concomitant diseases that can confound the clinical or biochemical presentation.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium [^112ab79b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology 12.4]

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Mean amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium pharmacokinetic parameters in normal adults following administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are shown in Table 3 and following administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and chewable tablets are shown in Table 4.

Table 4: Mean (± S.D.) Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Pharmacokinetic Parameters with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Powder for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets

aMean (± standard deviation) values of 28 normal adults. Peak concentrations occurred approximately 1 hour after the dose.

bAmoxicillin/clavulanate potassium administered at the start of a light meal.

Oral administration of 5 mL of 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or the equivalent dose of 10 mL of 125 mg/31.5 mg per 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg*h/mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg*h/mL for clavulanic acid when 5 mL of 250 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or equivalent dose of 10 mL of 125 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium were administered to normal adults. One 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or two 125 mg/31.25 mg chewable tablet of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are equivalent to 5 mL of 250 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium and provide similar serum concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^872de3ac]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Flavoring Information: For patients who wish to alter the taste of AUGMENTIN ES-600, immediately after reconstitution, 1 drop of FLAVORx® (apple, banana cream, bubble gum, cherry, or watermelon flavor) may be added for every 5 mL of AUGMENTIN ES-600. The resulting suspension is stable for 10 days under refrigeration. Stability of AUGMENTIN ES-600 when mixed with other flavors other than the 5 flavors listed above has not been evaluated.

2.6 Switching between Dosage Forms and between Strengths

AUGMENTIN ES-600 does not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt) as any of the other suspensions of AUGMENTIN. AUGMENTIN ES-600 contains 42.9 mg of clavulanic acid per 5 mL, whereas the 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL suspension of AUGMENTIN contains 28.5 mg clavulanic acid per 5 mL and the 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension of AUGMENTIN contains 57 mg clavulanic acid per 5 mL. Therefore, the 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL and 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspensions of AUGMENTIN should not be substituted for AUGMENTIN ES-600 as they are not interchangeable.

### Oral amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid: properties, indications and usage [^624df9bd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amoxicillin has been in use since the 1970s; it is the most widely used penicillin both alone and in combination with the β-lactamase clavulanic acid.

Objectives

In this narrative review, we re-examine the properties of oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and provide guidance on their use, with emphasis on the preferred use of amoxicillin alone.

Sources

Published medical literature (MEDLINE database via Pubmed).

Content

While amoxicillin and clavulanic acid have similar half-lives, clavulanic acid is more protein bound and even less heat stable than amoxicillin, with primarily hepatic metabolism. It is also more strongly associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including Clostridium difficile infection, and, thus, in oral combination formulations, limits the maximum daily dose of amoxicillin that can be given. The first ratio for an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination was set at 4:1 due to clavulanic acid's high affinity for β-lactamases; ratios of 2:1, 7:1, 14:1 and 16:1 are currently available in various regions. Comparative effectiveness data for the different ratios are scarce. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is often used as empiric therapy for many of the World Health Organization's Priority Infectious Syndromes in adults and children, leading to extensive consumption, when some of these syndromes could be handled with a delayed antibiotic prescription approach or amoxicillin alone.

Implications

Using available epidemiological and pharmacokinetic data, we provide guidance on indications for amoxicillin versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and on optimal oral administration, including choice of combination ratio. More data are needed, particularly on heat stability, pharmacodynamic effects and emergence of resistance in 'real-world' clinical settings.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium [^83b40888]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding every 12 hour and every 8 hour dosing regimens of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in adults and children.

Absorption:

Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin. While amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state.

In one study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high-fat breakfast.

Distribution:

Neither component in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is highly protein-bound; clavulanic acid is approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound.

Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid.

Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium to fasting children, average concentrations of 3 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions.

Metabolism and Excretion:

The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1 hour.

Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of a single 250 mg/125 mg or 500 mg/125 mg tablet of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.

### Prednisolone: role in amoxicillin-clavulanate-induced cholestatic liver injury [^36772b5f]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 68-year-old patient presented with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. A deterioration in the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) was noted 1 week following completion of a course of amoxicillin-clavunalate. This progressively worsened, reaching its peak by day 30. Our investigations excluded other possible causes for deranged LFTs and there was no improvement of same despite reduced dosing of potentially hepatotoxic medications. A trial of 30 mg/day prednisolone was commenced, resulting in an immediate and progressive improvement in LFTs to baseline over a period of 22 days and an improvement in constitutional symptoms such as tiredness and poor appetite. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one of the common causes of acute hepatitis and a leading cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe. Patterns of DILI can be generally divided into: (1) hepatocellular injury, (2) cholestatic injury and (3) mixed injury.

### Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid hepatotoxicity in children [^482e1e01]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of the present study were to determine the importance of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AC) hepatotoxicity in the paediatric population and to characterise the episodes identified and potential host-specific factors. This was addressed via a prospective observational study in which 8 Spanish hospitals participated.

Methods

A total of 11 cases were examined. For each patient included in the study, a structured and codified data-collection protocol was complied with, taking note of patient demographics, characteristics of the treatment assumed to provoke the reaction, concomitant medication, course and outcome of the episode, and laboratory variables during the reaction. The latter were determined every 6 months from the outset to the eventual resolution of the case.

Results

A total of 11 cases of AC hepatotoxicity were detected, affecting 9 boys and 2 girls, ages 1 to 11 years. Causality criteria were assessed using the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale.

Conclusions

We conclude that the introduction of hepatotoxicity record systems in paediatric care, together with the continuing study and development of existing systems, would contribute to improving our epidemiological knowledge about the harmful effects of drugs on the liver.

Risk determinants

An individual's risk of developing idiosyncratic DILI is determined by complex interactions among host, drug, and environmental factors.
Drug properties: Although idiosyncratic DILI typically is independent of the total dose or duration of medication administered, most implicated drugs are given at a daily dose of > 50–100 mg per day. More than 80% of DILI cases that resulted in liver transplantation in the United States were caused by medications with daily doses exceeding 50 mg. In some instances, dose escalation may also increase the risk of developing idiosyncratic DILI as seen with azathioprine, whereas dose reduction or increasing the dosing interval may improve tolerability.– Drugs with high lipophilicity and extensive metabolism in the liver (> 50%) are associated with an increased hepatotoxic potential, especially in combination with a high daily dose (> 100 mg daily). In addition, drugs that form reactive metabolites, exert mitochondrial toxicity, and inhibit bile acid transporters in in vitro test systems are associated with increased DILI risk in humans. Concomitant administration of multiple hepatotoxic drugs has also been associated with an increased risk of DILI in several studies.–
Host age, sex, and race and ethnicity: The impact of host age, sex, and race and ethnicity on DILI susceptibility is not well established because of the lack of large exposure‐based epidemiological studies to compare DILI incidence with drug‐treated controls. Although standardized DILI incidence increases with patient age, this may be explained, in part, by greater medication use with increasing age. Noticeable differences also exist between sexes, with women experiencing more frequent and severe hepatotoxicity. A French population‐based study showed that the standardized DILI incidence was more than 2 times higher in women than men older than 50 years, although no sex differences were noted under age 50. In addition, older subjects appear to be at increased risk of isoniazid and amoxicillin‐clavulanate hepatotoxicity, whereas younger individuals are more prone to develop DILI from anticonvulsants and minocycline. Finally, case series demonstrate an overrepresentation of women with diclofenac, macrolide, flucloxacillin, halothane, ibuprofen, interferon beta‐1a, and nitrofurantoin hepatotoxicity. Similarly, men appear to be overrepresented with azathioprine, anabolic steroid, and amoxicillin‐clavulanate hepatotoxicity.– The Drug‐Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has demonstrated that trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole is the most common suspect drug among African Americans, whereas amoxicillin‐clavulanate is the leading cause in White populations. In addition, African Americans were more likely to have adverse outcomes and develop chronic DILI. In contrast, Asian Americans were more likely to experience a liver‐related death or undergo liver transplant than the other racial groups. Because of the limited number of ethnic minorities included, additional studies are needed to confirm these data.
Medical comorbidities and environmental factors: Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of tamoxifen‐induced steatosis/steatohepatitis. Being overweight, having diabetes, alcohol use, and chronic viral hepatitis have also been associated with progressive fibrosis in methotrexate‐treated patients. However, the amount of alcohol consumed was not associated with clinical outcomes in consecutive patients enrolled in the DILIN Prospective registry. Furthermore, there are limited data exploring the impact of diet, tobacco use, and coffee consumption on DILI susceptibility. The mechanism by which chronic liver disease (e.g. NAFLD, viral hepatitis) impacts DILI susceptibility remains unclear. However, DILI caused by anti‐TB therapy has been associated with abnormal baseline serum aminotransferases, showing a stronger dose‐dependent association with the severity of liver enzyme elevation than older age.
Host genetic risk factors: Various host genetic factors related to drug‐metabolizing enzymes and transporters have been reported as increasing DILI susceptibility(Table 3). A missense variant (rs2476601) in PTPN22, which has been associated with other autoimmune disorders, appears to be a risk factor for all‐cause DILI across multiple racial and ethnic groups with an OR of 1.4. Several genetic studies have also identified distinct human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as risk factors for specific drugs or HDS products. In general, the identified HLA alleles have low positive predictive value, because of the low incidence of DILI in the general population, but a high negative predictive value. Therefore, pretreatment HLA testing will likely not prove useful in most circumstances to prevent DILI, but HLA testing may be helpful in DILI diagnosis and causality assessment.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^1f696796]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is a combination of amoxicillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and clavulanate potassium, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg with:

Recurrent or persistent acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae (penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL), H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) characterized by the following risk factors (1): Antibacterial exposure for acute otitis media within the preceding 3 months, and either of the following: 1) age 2 years, or younger or 2) day care attendance.

Limitations of Use

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is not indicated for the treatment of acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 4 mcg/mL. Acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve both S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL) and the beta lactamase producing organisms listed above. (1)

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1)

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. Our response to the comments included in the letter by Fletcher and colleagues have already been previously submitted to the manufacturer of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Two of the authors of this letter have been consultants for this drug company and have reviewed our data at the company's request. In summary, the reply to all concerns raised by Fletcher and colleagues is as follows: Table 4 presents stratified analyses for age, concurrent hepatotoxic drugs, and duration of treatment. The results clearly show that adjusting for these factors further increases the relative risk of acute liver injury associated with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

As stated in our article, we adapted the criteria of the consensus publication such that when the values for alanine aminotransferase were not available we used those for aspartate aminotransferase instead.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may be taken without regard to meals; however, absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is administered at the start of a meal. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be taken at the start of a meal.

2.1 Adults

The usual adult dose is one 500 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet every 12 hours or one 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet every 8 hours. For more severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one 875 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet every 12 hours or one 500 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet every 8 hours. Adults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL or 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension in place of the 500 mg/125 mg tablet. The 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL suspension or the 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension may be used in place of the 875 mg/125 mg tablet.

Two 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should not be substituted for one 500 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet. Since both the 250 mg/125 mg and 500 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (125 mg, as the potassium salt), two 250 mg/125 mg tablets are not equivalent to one 500 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet.

The 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet and the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet should not be substituted for each other, as they are not interchangeable. The 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet and the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt). The 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid, whereas the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid.

### Corticosteroid therapy in a case of severe cholestasic hepatitis Associated with amoxicillin-clavulanate [^a53e8376]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the most common drug involved in drug-induced liver injury and the single most frequently prescribed product leading to hospitalization for drug-induced liver disease in Spain. The liver damage most frequently associated with amoxicillin-clavulanate is cholestasic type. The latency period between first intake and onset of symptoms is 3–4 weeks on average. A 76-year-old man developed fever, pruritus, and jaundice 3 weeks after having completed treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Liver function tests showed cholestasic hepatitis (up to 50.75 mg/dL of total serum bilirubin level). The ultrasound-guided liver biopsy revealed severe canalicular cholestasis and portal and lobular eosinophilic infiltrates. Prednisone and ursodeoxycholic acid therapy were then prescribed. The patient became symptom-free with normal liver function tests. Amoxicillin-clavulanate can cause hepatocellular, cholestasic, or mixed liver injury. The presence of eosinophilic infiltrates in the liver biopsy and the clinical signs of hypersensitivity in some of the cholestasic cases suggest a pathophysiological immunoallergic mechanism. For this reason, corticosteroid treatment should be considered for patients with severe cholestasic liver injury.

### Oral fluoroquinolone use and the risk of acute liver injury: a nationwide cohort study [^a7449b62]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Many hepatotoxic drug reactions are predictable or dose dependent, and thus preventable to some degree. Other hepatotoxic drug reactions, however, are unpredictable and independent of dose and duration of treatment. This type of event is commonly referred to as an idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and is considered the main cause of acute liver injury (ALI). These rare but potentially life-threatening events are associated with clinical outcomes ranging from minor elevations in liver enzymes to transient liver failure, need for liver transplant, and death. Due to the innate unpredictability of idiosyncratic drug reactions as well as the difficulty in establishing causality, they are often not discovered until the drug is released to the general public and used in larger populations. In a summary of 5 large prospective and retrospective studies on DILI, anti-infectives were the most common attributable cause, accounting for proportions ranging from 27% to 65% of all cases of DILI. Population-based estimates for all DILIs have been reported in studies conducted in France (2002) and Iceland (2013) with an incidence rate of 13.9 and 19.1 per 100 000, respectively. In the latter study, it was estimated that 1 in 2300 users of amoxicillin-clavulanate and 1 in 1369 users of nitrofurantoin developed liver injuries.

Fluoroquinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics covering an array of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is one of the most widely used classes of systemic antibiotics, reaching almost 23 million unique prescriptions per year in the United States alone. The fluoroquinolones exhibit antibacterial properties by inhibiting the bacterial DNA synthesis by targeting the microbe's DNA topoisomerase and DNA gyrase. Although the drug is not generally considered to interact with host DNA, adverse effects such as tendinopathy and QT-interval prolongation are well established. There have been safety concerns with regard to hepatic toxicity in the past decades. Owing to case reports of a possible association with ALI, trovafloxacin and temafloxacin were both withdrawn in the 1990s. A few observational studies have been published reporting an up to 3-fold increase in risk of ALI associated with fluoroquinolone treatment. However, these estimates are primarily based on case-control studies with limited ability to control for underlying differences in health status, so it cannot be ruled out that the observed increased risk is not attributable to fluoroquinolone use. Furthermore, considering the potential severity of hepatotoxic drug reactions and the widespread use of fluoroquinolones, further investigation is warranted.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) infections and antibiotic prophylaxis — In hospitalized patients with severe AH, we recommend against universal administration of prophylactic antibiotics (strong recommendations, moderate level of evidence). Empiric antibiotics on admission in the absence of infection did not reduce mortality nor alter the incidence of subsequent infections, and randomized trials showed reduced infections without survival benefit: rifaximin for 90 days reduced infections (0.29 vs 0.62 infections/patient) and complications (0.43 vs 1.26 complications/patient) with a trend toward lower 90-day mortality (18% vs 42%; P = 0.09), while prednisolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate lowered infections (42 vs 95 events; HR 0.616, P = 0.015) but showed no difference in 60-day mortality (24 vs 31 in deaths; HR 0.769; 95% CI 0.451–1.31).

### Pathogenesis of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury and clinical perspectives [^1a710e73]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare disease that develops independently of drug dose, route, or duration of administration. Furthermore, idiosyncratic DILI is not a single disease entity but rather a spectrum of rare diseases with varying clinical, histological, and laboratory features. The pathogenesis of DILI is not fully understood. Standardization of the DILI nomenclature and methods to assess causality, along with the information provided by the LiverTox Web site, will harmonize and accelerate research on DILI. Studies of new serum biomarkers such as glutamate dehydrogenase, high mobility group box protein 1, and microRNA-122 could provide information for use in diagnosis and prognosis and provide important insights into the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of DILI. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HLA region have been associated with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity attributed to flucloxacillin, ximelagatran, lapatinib, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. However, genome-wide association studies of pooled cases have not associated any genetic factors with idiosyncratic DILI. Whole genome and whole exome sequencing analyses are under way to study cases of DILI attributed to a single medication. Serum proteomic, transcriptome, and metabolome as well as intestinal microbiome analyses will increase our understanding of the mechanisms of this disorder. Further improvements to in vitro and in vivo test systems should advance our understanding of the causes, risk factors, and mechanisms of idiosyncratic DILI.

Most common or well-described drug-induced liver injury (DILI) agents and the patterns of their liver injury are listed with latency and typical features, with representative rows summarized here. Amoxicillin/clavulanate has Short to moderate latency with cholestatic injury, but can be hepatocellular; drug-induced liver injury onset is frequently detected after drug cessation. Isoniazid shows Moderate to long latency with acute hepatocellular injury similar to acute viral hepatitis. Fluoroquinolones have Short latency with variable — hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed in relatively similar proportions. Nitrofurantoin may present as an Acute form (rare) with Short latency that is typically hepatocellular and often resembles idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis, or as a Chronic form with Moderate to long (months–years) latency that is hepatocellular. Minocycline has Moderate to long latency with hepatocellular injury and often resembles autoimmune hepatitis. Phenytoin has Short to moderate latency with hepatocellular, mixed, or cholestatic injury often with immune-allergic features. Interferon-alpha shows Moderate latency with a hepatocellular, autoimmune hepatitis–like pattern. Ipilimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor), nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab (PD-1 inhibitors), and atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (PDL-1 inhibitors) have latency Under 12 wk with an initially mixed pattern that evolves primarily into a hepatocellular pattern, without significant autoantibodies. Amiodarone (oral) shows Moderate to long latency with hepatocellular, mixed, or cholestatic injury and macrovesicular steatosis and steatohepatitis on biopsy.

### Signatures in drug-induced liver injury [^be8b26e8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can be induced by a myriad of drugs. Assessing whether the patient has DILI and assessing which drug is the most likely culprit are challenging. There has been too little attention paid to the concept that certain drugs appear to have unique clinical features or 'phenotypes'.

Recent Findings

Several case series of DILI because of various drugs have been published, and analysis of these case series points to the fact that individual drugs have characteristic DILI signatures. These clinical phenotypes can be characterized by latency, biochemical features (R-value), as well as clinical symptoms and signs. Several drugs, including isoniazid, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, anabolic steroids, β-interferon and others, have highly unique clinical features. Such unique properties may be able to be used to improve adjudication processes.

Summary

Individual drugs have unique clinical DILI phenotypes or signatures. Furthermore, these may be able to be used to improve adjudication.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are indicated for the
treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial
sinusitis due to confirmed, or suspected β-lactamase−producing pathogens (i.e. H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, H.
parainfluenzae, K. pneumoniae, or
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin
(i.e., penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). AUGMENTIN XR is not indicated for the
treatment of infections due to S. pneumoniae with
penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited with regard to infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL (see
CLINICAL STUDIES).

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant
pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other
common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g., alcoholism,
immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were
not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom
penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is suspected,
bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms
and their susceptibility when AUGMENTIN XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a
penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae plus a
β-lactamase−producing pathogen can be treated with another AUGMENTIN®(amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower
daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e., 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12
hours). Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the
effectiveness of AUGMENTIN XR and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN XR should
be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly
suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility
information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying
antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and
susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^f9fbf88c]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to risk factors, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- the daily dose of a medication, its lipophilicity, and the extent of hepatic metabolism influence the risk of causing DILI

- insufficient evidence to confirm subject age, gender, race, and ethnicity as reliable risk factors for DILI susceptibility

- some drugs are more likely to cause DILI in older patients (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, isoniazid), whereas others are more commonly implicated in pediatric patients (such as valproate, minocycline)

- medical comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, are associated with increased incidence and severity of DILI with specific drugs

- insufficient evidence regarding the role of alcohol, tobacco, and diet in DILI susceptibility

- patients with preexisting liver disease are at increased risk of developing liver injury with selected drugs (such as methotrexate and anti-tuberculosis therapy) and poor outcomes with a DILI episode

- PTPN22 gene polymorphism is a risk factor for DILI across multiple drugs and major ethnic groups.

Epidemiology of idiosyncratic DILI

Idiosyncratic DILI is uncommon, with an estimated annual incidence in the general population of 14 to 19 events per 100,000 inhabitants or 60,000 cases per year in the general US population. The estimated incidence of idiosyncratic DILI also varies based on the case definition as well as the methods used for case ascertainment. For example, the incidence appears to be higher in exposure‐based studies using electronic medical records (32.8 per 100,000 adult patients who received one of the top implicated drugs in the United States and 40 per 100,000 patients at a pediatric hospital). The incidence of idiosyncratic DILI is even higher in hospitalized patients, being reported as high as 1.4% among medical inpatients.–

Results of ongoing DILI registry studies demonstrate that the spectrum of suspect drugs and demographics of afflicted patients substantially differ among countries and regions.–These observations likely reflect differences in case definitions as well as differences in medication use, health care systems, and sociocultural and medical attributes in the various populations (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Etiologies and outcomes with DILI in different countries

Leading causes of idiosyncratic DILI worldwide

Although hundreds of medications can cause idiosyncratic DILI, several drug classes are more frequently implicated than others. For example, antimicrobials, central nervous system agents, immunomodulatory agents, and antineoplastic agents are more frequently implicated than antihypertensives.–Also, striking geographic differences exist among the specific implicated drugs. For instance, HDS products surpass pharmaceuticals in China, Korea, and Singapore, accounting for 27%–62% of their DILI cases. In contrast, HDS products represent only a minority of cases in Japan, the United States, and Spain but with an increasing incidence over time.–Amoxicillin‐clavulanate is the most frequently implicated individual agent in many western countries, whereas anti‐tuberculosis (TB) agents dominate in Asian countries (Table 2).

### Effect of prophylactic antibiotics on mortality in severe alcohol-related hepatitis: a randomized clinical trial [^4920439d]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefits of prophylactic antibiotics for hospitalized patients with severe alcohol-related hepatitis are unclear.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate, compared with placebo, on mortality in patients hospitalized with severe alcohol-related hepatitis and treated with prednisolone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial among patients with biopsy-proven severe alcohol-related hepatitis (Maddrey function score ≥ 32 and Model for End-stage Liver Disease [MELD] score ≥ 21) from June 13, 2015, to May 24, 2019, in 25 centers in France and Belgium. All patients were followed up for 180 days. Final follow-up occurred on November 19, 2019.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to receive prednisolone combined with amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 145) or prednisolone combined with placebo (n = 147).

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 60 days. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 90 and 180 days; incidence of infection, incidence of hepatorenal syndrome, and proportion of participants with a MELD score less than 17 at 60 days; and proportion of patients with a Lille score less than 0.45 at 7 days.

Results

Among 292 randomized patients (mean age, 52.8 [SD, 9.2] years; 80 [27.4%] women) 284 (97%) were analyzed. There was no significant difference in 60-day mortality between participants randomized to amoxicillin-clavulanate and those randomized to placebo (17.3% in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group and 21.3% in the placebo group [P = 0.33]; between-group difference, -4.7% [95% CI, -14.0% to 4.7%]; hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.45–1.31]). Infection rates at 60 days were significantly lower in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group (29.7% vs 41.5%; mean difference, -11.8% [95% CI, -23.0% to -0.7%]; subhazard ratio, 0.62; [95% CI, 0.41–0.91]; P = 0.02). There were no significant differences in any of the remaining 3 secondary outcomes. The most common serious adverse events were related to liver failure (25 in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group and 20 in the placebo group), infections (23 in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group and 46 in the placebo group), and gastrointestinal disorders (15 in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group and 21 in the placebo group).

Conclusion and Relevance

In patients hospitalized with severe alcohol-related hepatitis, amoxicillin-clavulanate combined with prednisolone did not improve 2-month survival compared with prednisolone alone. These results do not support prophylactic antibiotics to improve survival in patients hospitalized with severe alcohol-related hepatitis.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk determinants — host age, sex, and race/ethnicity: Noticeable differences exist between sexes, with women experiencing more frequent and severe hepatotoxicity, and a French population-based study showed standardized DILI incidence more than 2 times higher in women than men older than 50 years, although no sex differences were noted under age 50. Older subjects appear to be at increased risk of isoniazid and amoxicillin-clavulanate hepatotoxicity, whereas younger individuals are more prone to develop DILI from anticonvulsants and minocycline. Case series demonstrate an overrepresentation of women with diclofenac, macrolide, flucloxacillin, halothane, ibuprofen, interferon beta-1a, and nitrofurantoin hepatotoxicity, whereas men appear overrepresented with azathioprine, anabolic steroid, and amoxicillin-clavulanate hepatotoxicity. The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has demonstrated that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the most common suspect drug among African Americans, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanate is the leading cause in White populations; African Americans were more likely to have adverse outcomes and develop chronic DILI, and Asian Americans were more likely to experience a liver-related death or undergo liver transplant than other racial groups.

### Characterization of amoxicillin-and clavulanic acid-specific T cells in patients with amoxicillin-clavulanate-induced liver injury [^74edc672]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) frequently has a delayed onset with several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes affecting susceptibility, indicating a potential role for the adaptive immune system in the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether drug-responsive T lymphocytes are detectable in patients who developed DILI with the combination, antimicrobial amoxicillin-clavulanate. Lymphocytes from 6 of 7 patients were found to proliferate and/or secrete interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) when cultured with amoxicillin and/or clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin (n = 105) and clavulanic acid (n = 16) responsive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell clones expressing CCR, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 4, CCR9, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 were generated from patients with and without HLA risk alleles; no cross-reactivity was observed between the two drug antigens. Amoxicillin clones were found to secrete a heterogeneous panel of mediators, including IFN-γ, interleukin-22 and cytolytic molecules. In contrast, cytokine secretion by the clavulanic acid clones was more restricted. CD4(+) and CD8(+) clones were major histocompatability complex class II and I restricted, respectively, with the drug antigen being presented to CD4(+) clones in the context of HLA-DR molecules. Several pieces of evidence indicate that the clones were activated by a hapten mechanism: First, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were required for optimal activation; second, pulsing APCs for 4–16 hours activated the clones; and third, inhibition of processing abrogated the proliferative response and cytokine release.

Conclusion

Both amoxicillin- and clavulanic acid-specific T cells participate in the liver injury that develops in certain patients exposed to amoxicillin-clavulanate.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms1.

Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in patients after overdosage with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.

Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium crystalluria.

Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]

Risk factors

Various risk factors have been implicated in DILI. The propensity of a drug to cause DILI is highly dependent on patient age groups as emphasised by the RUCAM algorithm criteria. Younger patients seem to have a higher risk for hepatocellular DILI compared to the elderly. Indeed, aspirin use in children is associated with Reye's syndrome, characterised by increased fatty infiltration into hepatocytes and cerebral oedema. Similarly, valproic acid produces increased reactive oxygen species leading to hepatocyte damage in the young adult population. Elderly patients are more prone to cholestatic DILI, with amoxicillin/clavulanate being the classic example. Increasing age is associated with increased hepatotoxicity from anti-tuberculous drugs also, especially isoniazid. The exact pathophysiology is unclear; yet, it is plausibly due to age-related changes in renal and liver function and associated blood flow, defective immune responses to certain drug metabolites or increased presence of reactive oxygen species in hepatocytes. The role of polypharmacy in old age and its link with DILI is disputed with little evidence to support an association.

Gender has also been implicated as an important risk factor of DILI. It was long proposed that females have a higher risk for idiosyncratic DILI to drugs such as diclofenac, tetracyclines and nitrofurantoin. Yet, multiple studies show otherwise, demonstrating equal prevalence of DILI in both men and women. Nevertheless, Lucena et al. reported nearly twice as many women suffering from hepatocellular DILI as well as increased severity and poorer outcomes from DILI. The exact pathophysiology of such variations is unclear but increased genetic susceptibility and increased likelihood of autoimmune-mediated liver injury in females may potentiate this risk.

Drug Interactions

7.1 Probenecid

Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid. Concurrent use with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may result in increased and prolonged blood concentrations of amoxicillin. Coadministration of probenecid is not recommended.

7.2 Oral Anticoagulants

Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.

7.3 Allopurinol

The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.

7.4 Oral Contraceptives

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may affect intestinal flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.

7.5 Effects on Laboratory Tests

High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST®, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used.

Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.

### Comparison of two clinical scales for causality assessment in hepatotoxicity [^9927556a]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

This study was performed to compare the assessments of drug-induced liver injury obtained with 2 methods, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) scale and the recently validated Maria & Victorino (M&V) clinical scale, in cases submitted to a registry of hepatotoxicity. A total of 215 cases of hepatotoxicity reported with a structured reporting form were evaluated by 3 independent experts. Because of the use of multiple drugs, 228 ratings were generated. The probability of the diagnosis was classified as definitive, probable, possible, unlikely, or excluded, and evaluated for consistency with a weighted kappa statistical test. Absolute agreement between the 2 scales was observed in 42 cases (18%, weighted kappa 0.28) with disagreement of 1 level in 108 cases (47%), and of 2 levels in 70 cases (31%). The best correlation between the 2 scales was obtained for drug-induced liver injury involving a suggested immunoallergic mechanism: the disagreement was 1 level or less in 72% of the cases (34 of 48), compared with 60% of the cases (85 of 141) that involved a presumed idiosyncratic metabolic mechanism. The lowest agreement (6%) was observed in cases with evidence of cholestasis. No agreement was found in cases of fulminant hepatitis or death. The CIOMS scale showed better discriminative power and produced assessments closer to those of specialists. The performance of the M&V scale was poor in reactions with long latency periods (i.e., amoxycillin/clavulanic acid), evolution to chronicity after withdrawal (cholestatic pattern), or death.

### Drug-induced liver injury: a comprehensive review [^da775401]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic predisposition to DILI is poorly understood but several gene polymorphisms encompassing cytochrome enzymes, HLA and mitochondrial DNA mutations are thought to contribute to the overall risk of DILI. DILI defined by RUCAM criteria has been strongly associated with HLA loci polymorphisms. Notably, HLADRR1✱15:01 was found to be associated with amoxicillin/clavulanate DILI. The presence of HLA-B✱57:01 was also found to be associated with an 81-fold increased risk of flucloxacillin-induced hepatotoxicity. Clinical medicine has not yet incorporated regular DNA profiling to identify at-risk individuals and as such is not an easily identifiable trait. Until genomic medicine and technology become widely available and accessible, risk assessment based on genetic make-up is not regularly feasible.

There have been multiple standardised causality assessment scales that have been developed to provide more objective and reproducible criteria. The Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences endorsed the RUCAM in 1993 to aid clinicians for detection of idiosyncratic DILI. Today, the RUCAM scale remains the most widely used tool to confirm or exclude DILI. It uses objective criteria such as time of onset of hepatotoxicity, risk factors, exclusion of alternative non-drug-related causes of ALI, and ALT/ALP levels to establish a possible causal association between a drug and liver injury. A total score ranging from −9 to +15 is derived from seven distinct domains to stratify patients according to their probability of having DILI. When first validated, the RUCAM scale demonstrated a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 89%, positive predictive value of 93% and negative predictive value of 78%. RUCAM has been widely adopted worldwide due to the ease of clear criteria identification, stepwise approach and easy scoring system which can be independently reassessed by different colleagues. It also went through an international update to its criteria since its inception.

### Detective work in drug-induced liver injury: sometimes it is all about interviewing the right witness [^432de86b]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosing drug-induced liver injury (DILI) relies primarily on history taking. We report 4 cases in which DILI was missed or the drug was misidentified when physicians relied solely on patient history. We reviewed 27 cases referred with possible DILI from August 1, 2009, to February 1, 2010. Four patients seemed to be reliable historians, but their cases were greatly clarified by a call to their pharmacist. One subject, who forgot a new medication, underwent an unfruitful evaluation including surgery. Another patient had acetaminophen toxicity that was missed because she grossly underreported her pain medication use. The third and fourth patients forgot taking amoxicillin/clavulanate, so other agents mistakenly were implicated. Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method scores were 8 (probable) or 9 (highly probable) for all 4 cases. Without pharmacy input, DILI was missed in 2 cases and the wrong agent was implicated twice. Reviewing pharmacy records can be crucial for patients and DILI research. We recommend calling the pharmacist directly for increased liver enzyme levels of unclear source or suspected DILI regardless of patient history.

### Idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patient in combined treatment with tolvaptan and amoxicillin / clavulanic acid: a case report [^bb233c21]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is another case reported in literature that describes an elevation of AST, ALT and BT after a single dose of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid of 8 g between 2 and 3 months before liver injury. But in this case report, the timing of the event and the single dose do not appear to justify the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid role in causing hepatotoxicity. In fact, blinded consensus judged the adverse effect to be probably related to tolvaptan.

Furthermore in our case it is impossible to state whether the hepatotoxicity was related to tolvaptan, amoxicillin/clavulanic, or their combined use. As a matter of fact, it could just be a simple independent reaction to either tolvaptan or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, rather than their synergy.

On the other hand, we cannot exclude the causality of tolvaptan–induced hepatotoxicity, even if its readministration did not result in recurrence. Evidences show that approximately half of the subjects were able to tolerate the drug when it was reintroduced, after hepatic injury, suggesting that a form of adaptation or drug tolerance occurs. However, the other half experienced rapid ALT elevations upon re-exposure and tolvaptan treatment had to be permanently withdrawn. We decided to reintroduce tolvaptan treatment with starting dose (split dose regimens of 45 mg + 15 mg), and to not titrate to a target dose of 120 mg to avoid the risk of significant and/or irreversible liver injury. Even if no association with dose was found, the reasoning to use the lowest dosage of tolvaptan is due to the fact that additional research are necessary and has been initiated to further investigate the role of dose and exposure on the risk of hepatic injury.

In conclusion, this represents the first case reporting hepatic toxicity in an ADPKD patient during the combined therapy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and tolvaptan; therefore, more caution should be used when prescribing amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in ADPKD patients treated with tolvaptan.

### Important elements for the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury [^2cebda38]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Drug-induced liver disease is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Accurate reporting of drug-induced liver injury is essential for early detection of hepatotoxicity and for developing reliable, interpretable literature. We assessed the extent to which published case reports of drug-induced liver disease include sufficient clinical data for interpreting the cause of toxicity.

Methods

We developed a list of 42 predetermined, specific minimal elements necessary in evaluating causality of drug-induced liver injury. We then analyzed 97 published case reports or series studies of hepatotoxicity from 6 drugs (from 3 classes): amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (n = 35), troglitazone (n = 32), rosiglitazone (n = 10), pioglitazone (n = 8), zafirlukast (n = 8), and montelukast (n = 4).

Results

Patient age, sex, primary disease, and drug name were reported in most, if not all, published case reports. However, many elements were underreported; some publications did not mention initial bilirubin levels (12%), many did not provide initial alkaline phosphatase levels (58%), and others provided vague descriptions of how certain diagnoses were excluded, that is, tests for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Data on abnormal results from serial liver tests frequently were absent. Exclusions of competing viral etiologies were reported in less than 50% of the studies.

Conclusions

Reports of drug-induced liver diseases often do not provide the data needed to determine the causes of the adverse effects. Efforts to promote and include a list of essential diagnostic elements in research articles could increase the quality and clinical utility of published case reports of drug toxicity.

### Drug-induced liver injury: an analysis of 461 incidences submitted to the Spanish registry over a 10-year period [^1b3d9086]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Progress in the understanding of susceptibility factors to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and outcome predictability are hampered by the lack of systematic programs to detect bona fide cases.

Methods

A cooperative network was created in 1994 in Spain to identify all suspicions of DILI following a prospective structured report form. The liver damage was characterized according to hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed laboratory criteria and to histologic criteria when available. Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed.

Results

Since April 1994 to August 2004, 461 out of 570 submitted cases, involving 505 drugs, were deemed to be related to DILI. The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated, amoxicillin-clavulanate accounting for the 12.8% of the whole series. The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common (58%), was inversely correlated with age (P < .0001), and had the worst outcome (Cox regression, P < .034). Indeed, the incidence of liver transplantation and death in this group was 11.7% if patients had jaundice at presentation, whereas the corresponding figure was 3.8% in nonjaundiced patients (P < .04). Factors associated with the development of fulminant hepatic failure were female sex (OR = 25; 95% CI: 4.1–151; P < .0001), hepatocellular damage (OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 1.6–37; P < .009), and higher baseline plasma bilirubin value (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09–1.22; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Patients with drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice have 11.7% chance of progressing to death or transplantation. Amoxicillin-clavulanate stands out as the most common drug related to DILI.

### Amoxicillin / clavulanate for infections in infants and children: past, present and future [^c4974836]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Chemical synthesis of the penicillin nucleus in the 1950s made introduction of a broad array of new and important antimicrobials, including ampicillin and amoxicillin, possible. Ampicillin was introduced in 1962 in oral and parenteral forms as the first of the semisynthetic penicillins to provide increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Amoxicillin replaced oral ampicillin beginning in 1974 because amoxicillin resulted in higher and more prolonged serum concentrations than did equivalent doses of ampicillin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) was introduced in the United States in 1984 to enhance the activity of amoxicillin by addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid. During the past 20 years, amoxicillin/clavulanate has proven effective for a variety of pediatric infectious diseases, particularly acute otitis media (AOM). In 2001, a new pediatric formulation, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES-600) was approved for use in the United States. The high dose preparation addressed the needs of pediatricians by providing greater amounts of amoxicillin while maintaining the same daily dose of clavulanic acid as the regular strength formulation. Doubling the dose of amoxicillin for management of recurrent and persistent AOM was recommended in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of concern about the increased incidence of nonsusceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The original formulation combined amoxicillin/clavulanate in a 4:1 ratio and was followed by a 7:1 ratio formulation. The high dose formulation (600 mg of amoxicillin per 5 ml) provides a 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate. Although management of AOM will likely undergo changes in the coming years, amoxicillin is expected to remain first line therapy for AOM. For children who fail initial therapy with amoxicillin, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, an oral cephalosporin or parenteral ceftriaxone is recommended.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^32dc30b0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Amoxicillin–clavulanate in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) — evidence and recommendation indicate no benefit and potential harm without carbapenems; in adjusted analyses, patients who received amoxicillin–clavulanate were less likely to have treatment success (aOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5–0.8) and more likely to die (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3–2.1) compared with those who did not receive it, and "the addition of amoxicillin–clavulanate (without coadministration with carbapenems) to a regimen for MDR-TB does not appear to provide benefit". Conclusions state it "should not be used in MDR-TB treatment, except to provide clavulanate when using a carbapenem", and "amoxicillin–clavulanate must be given whenever carbapenems are included in an MDR-TB regimen"; the guideline further notes, "Our recommendation against the use of amoxicillin–clavulanate… is strong despite the evidence being judged to be of very low certainty".

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^2c4252c4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Clavulanate hypersensitivity — although uncommon, clavulanate has been reported as a causative agent for immediate hypersensitivity reactions; skin testing used an epicutanous concentration of 10 mg/mL and intradermal concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/mL and was found to be nonirritating in 1 small case series; given limited availability of isolated clavulanate/clavulanic acid and intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the United States, a drug challenge to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is recommended if clavulanate is suspected and the initial drug challenge to amoxicillin is negative.

### Needles in haystacks [^96549751]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver disease remains a significant problem for physicians caring for patients with this therapeutic complication and for those developing and licensing new drugs. There has been renewed interest recently in drug-induced liver injury (DILI) investigation, with respect to the assessment of causality to permit prompt and accurate diagnosis and the determination of risk factors and the mechanisms by which drugs injure the liver, both in a predictable dose-dependent manner and idiosyncratically. Current investigations focus on determining the true incidence of such adverse drug hepatotoxic reactions, both for drug development and clinical practice, as well as on elucidating the mechanisms of disease and on finding diagnostic biomarkers. The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), includes in its charge the study of four drugs (phenytoin, isoniazid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and valproic acid) that are relatively frequent causes of DILI. In the current study, the authors have attempted to search an institutional diagnostic database of the International Classification of Diseases-9th Edition-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, using three different strategies, to identify patients with DILI due to the four targeted drugs. Unfortunately, the search strategy that yielded the greatest number of specific DILI cases was too insensitive and labor-intensive to be useful for DILI research, whereas strategies that were more specific were also far less sensitive and yielded an inadequate number of cases to study. The findings in this report emphasize the inadequacy of administrative patient diagnosis databases for specific research in DILI and lend support to the DILIN concept that is funded by NIDDK as the most suitable means to further understanding in this burgeoning field.

### Idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patient in combined treatment with tolvaptan and amoxicillin / clavulanic acid: a case report [^2a435fdb]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

In patients with ADPKD, long-term treatment with tolvaptan is associated with idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity with elevations of ALT and AST and infrequent cases of concomitant elevations in BT. This injury is typically hepatocellular, occurs between 3 and 18 months after starting tolvaptan, and resolves itself within 4 months after stopping the drug 12.

Moreover, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is a relatively frequent cause of hepatic injury, which is characterized by a hepatocellular/cholestatic reaction and often by evidence of immunoallergy. But in some cases, especially in patients under 45 years old, it can occur together with hepatocellular injury. Typically, the latency of presentation is about 1 or 2 months after the start of treatment.

In our case report, the likelihood of drug-induced liver disease is supported by several pieces of evidence: the temporal association, the resolution after the withdrawal of the medications, no other possible diagnosis. Temporal association could prove drug-induced hepatotoxicity for both of the drugs (about 1 or 2 months after the start of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, between 3 and 18 months after starting tolvaptan). As a matter of fact, in this case report, liver injury classified according to laboratory parameters as acute hepatocellular injury, occurred about 3 months after the beginning of the treatment with tolvaptan and 5 weeks after the therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Moreover, the liver disease resolved itself after the withdrawal of the medications and there is no other possible diagnosis.

### Polygenic architecture informs potential vulnerability to drug-induced liver injury [^3129dfe0]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of termination in drug development programs and removal of drugs from the market; this is partially due to the inability to identify patients who are at risk 1. In this study, we developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for DILI by aggregating effects of numerous genome-wide loci identified from previous large-scale genome-wide association studies 2. The PRS predicted the susceptibility to DILI in patients treated with fasiglifam, amoxicillin-clavulanate or flucloxacillin and in primary hepatocytes and stem cell-derived organoids from multiple donors treated with over ten different drugs. Pathway analysis highlighted processes previously implicated in DILI, including unfolded protein responses and oxidative stress. In silico screening identified compounds that elicit transcriptomic signatures present in hepatocytes from individuals with elevated PRS, supporting mechanistic links and suggesting a novel screen for safety of new drug candidates. This genetic-, cellular-, organoid- and human-scale evidence underscored the polygenic architecture underlying DILI vulnerability at the level of hepatocytes, thus facilitating future mechanistic studies. Moreover, the proposed 'polygenicity-in-a-dish' strategy might potentially inform designs of safer, more efficient and robust clinical trials.

### Pharmacogenomics of drug-induced liver injury (DILI): molecular biology to clinical applications [^2d14f927]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

A 21-year old woman was admitted to hospital with a two-week history of painless jaundice, fatigue and anorexia having previously been fit and well. One month prior to presentation, the patient had taken a five-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for an infected skin cyst. Otherwise, she was only on the oral contraceptive pill and reported minimal alcohol intake. On examination, she was deeply jaundiced, but alert and oriented with no asterixis. She had no stigmata of chronic liver disease, but hepatomegaly extending 3 cm from below the right subcostal margin was evident. Investigations showed: white cell count 13.4 × 10 9 /L (normal 3.6–9.3), haemoglobin 11.8 g/dl (normal 11–15), platelet count 356 × 10 9 /L (normal 170–420), sodium 138 mmol/L (normal 134–144), potassium 3.5 mmol/L (normal 3.5–5.0), creatinine 32 µmol/L (normal 40–75), albumin 30 g/L (normal 35–48), alanine aminotransferase 707 IU/L (normal 15–54), alkaline phosphatase 151 IU/L (normal 30–130), bilirubin 384 µmol/L (normal 7–31) and prothrombin time 27.2 s (normal 11.7–14). Screening for hepatitis A, B, C, E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and autoimmune hepatitis was negative. Tests for anti-smooth muscle, antinuclear, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies were negative; immunoglobulin levels and ceruloplasmin levels were normal. Liver ultrasonography demonstrated a liver of normal contour with no biliary dilatation, a normal spleen size and patent vessels. Liver biopsy revealed severe portal interface hepatitis with lobular inflammation and scant plasma cells. Her clinical condition deteriorated in the following days with prothrombin time and bilirubin rising to 56.6 s and 470 µmol/L, respectively. At follow-up after 11 days, her alanine aminotransferase level was 1,931 IU/L. She developed grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy 14 days after presentation, and was listed for a super-urgent liver transplant. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed as a part of preparatory investigations and showed the patient carried the HLA haplotype HLA-DRB1∗15:02-DQB1∗06:01. Following orthotopic transplantation of a deceased donor graft her explant histology revealed severe ongoing hepatitis with multi-acinar necrosis (Fig. 1A and B). This case raised a number of important questions about the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury and tools available for clinicians to make the best decisions for patient care: In this Grand Rounds article, we will explore these questions, describing the pathophysiology, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and clinical management of drug-induced liver injury. We will also discuss ongoing areas of uncertainty.

### Drug-induced liver injury with commonly used antibiotics in the all of Us research program [^f57668d0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are a known cause of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the five most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the United States are azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. We quantified the frequency of acute DILI for these common antibiotics in the All of Us Research Program, one of the largest electronic health record (EHR)-linked research cohorts in the United States. Retrospective analyses were conducted applying a standardized phenotyping algorithm to de-identified clinical data available in the All of Us database for 318,598 study participants. Between February 1984 and December 2022, more than 30% of All of Us participants (n = 119,812 individuals) had been exposed to at least 1 of our 5 study drugs. Initial screening identified 591 potential case patients that met our preselected laboratory-based phenotyping criteria. Because DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, we then used phenome scanning to narrow the case counts by (i) scanning all EHRs to identify all alternative diagnostic explanations for the laboratory abnormalities, and (ii) leveraging International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD)-9 and ICD 10th revision (ICD)-10 codes as exclusion criteria to eliminate misclassification. Our final case counts were 30 DILI cases with amoxicillin-clavulanate, 24 cases with azithromycin, 24 cases with ciprofloxacin, 22 cases with amoxicillin alone, and < 20 cases with cephalexin. These findings demonstrate that data from EHR-linked research cohorts can be efficiently mined to identify DILI cases related to the use of common antibiotics.
