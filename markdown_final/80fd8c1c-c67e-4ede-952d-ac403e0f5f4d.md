## Question

Hydrocortione affect on tsh

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hydrocortisone affects TSH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory axis and mechanism by which glucocorticoids could suppress TSH. Then, I should verify dose-response thresholds and time course. Next, I will review clinical contexts where this matters, including adrenal insufficiency, critical illness, and pituitary disease. After that, I should consider special populations like neonates and pregnancy. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations and caveats for interpretation and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Hydrocortisone, as a glucocorticoid, suppresses TSH secretion at the pituitary level via negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis, reducing TRH-driven TSH release and blunting the nocturnal TSH surge, with additional effects on peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion and thyroid hormone action, which together can lower measured TSH and thyroid hormone levels during exposure [^a9cbfb71] [^a57cdb0c] [^91e00b03].

> Wait, let me verify the dose threshold. The FDA labeling for levothyroxine notes that glucocorticoids can cause a transient decrease in TSH secretion when hydrocortisone is given at doses greater than 100 mg per day or equivalent, which operationalizes a pharmacologic dose threshold for clinically meaningful suppression [^fd2a7f2c] [^e1bef58a]. I should also note that physiologic replacement doses can still suppress TSH in some contexts, particularly in central hypothyroidism or when interpreting tests in pituitary disease, so dose alone does not fully determine effect without clinical context [^08934b4b] [^0f371763].

> I will now examine the time course. In preterm infants, a single dose of glucocorticoid produced a 76% median reduction in TSH within 24 hours, with recovery toward baseline over 3–15 days, illustrating rapid onset and reversibility after short-term exposure. In adults, suppression is typically evident within days of high-dose therapy and tends to normalize after withdrawal, though recovery may lag depending on duration and HPT axis integrity [^e7b51275] [^be78cafd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in adrenal insufficiency. In primary adrenal insufficiency, untreated disease can elevate TSH, and glucocorticoid replacement alone can normalize TSH without thyroid hormone, so an elevated TSH in this setting may reflect adrenal rather than thyroid disease. Guidelines advise evaluating for adrenal insufficiency before starting levothyroxine in suspected central hypothyroidism to avoid precipitating adrenal crisis, and to treat adrenal insufficiency first if present [^5d18bb5a] [^08934b4b] [^2183e015].

> Next, I should review critical illness and nonthyroidal illness syndrome. During acute illness, endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids contribute to suppressed TSH, low T3, and variable T4 changes, and recovery of TSH lags as the patient convalesces. This means TSH can be misleading in ICU or severe illness, and thyroid testing should be interpreted cautiously or deferred unless there is strong suspicion of true thyroid disease [^51f04d96] [^8e06bb9e] [^06536a9d].

> Let me consider pituitary disease and central hypothyroidism. In central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable for dosing, and glucocorticoid therapy further suppresses TSH, so clinicians should titrate levothyroxine to keep free T4 in the mid–high normal range rather than using TSH targets. After cure of Cushing syndrome, TSH and thyroid hormone levels often recover over 6–12 months, reflecting reversal of glucocorticoid-mediated HPT suppression [^0f371763] [^be78cafd].

> I should double-check special populations. In preterm neonates, glucocorticoids acutely suppress TSH and T3 and can obscure delayed TSH elevation on screening, so programs must account for timing of steroid exposure when interpreting results. In pregnancy, physiologic increases in cortisol-binding globulin and total cortisol complicate interpretation, but exogenous glucocorticoids can still suppress TSH and should be considered when evaluating abnormal thyroid tests in pregnancy [^e3d84890] [^e7b51275] [^c91d31ab].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is about starting levothyroxine in someone already on hydrocortisone. I need to ensure we do not precipitate adrenal crisis. Guidelines recommend screening for adrenal insufficiency before initiating levothyroxine in suspected central hypothyroidism, and if adrenal insufficiency is present or strongly suspected, start glucocorticoids first or concurrently, because thyroid hormone accelerates cortisol clearance and can unmask or worsen adrenal insufficiency [^08934b4b] [^2183e015] [^b61e1ae9].

> Next, I should review practical interpretation and monitoring. If TSH is suppressed on high-dose glucocorticoids, I should confirm the dose and duration, consider the clinical context, and, if needed, reassess thyroid function after tapering or holding steroids when safe. Conversely, if TSH is unexpectedly high in untreated adrenal insufficiency, I should treat the adrenal disorder first and then re-evaluate TSH. In patients with pituitary disease, I should monitor free T4 rather than TSH to guide levothyroxine dosing [^5d18bb5a] [^0f371763].

> In summary, hydrocortisone suppresses TSH via central mechanisms, with the magnitude related to dose and duration, and the effect is typically reversible after withdrawal. Clinically, this matters most when interpreting thyroid tests in adrenal insufficiency, critical illness, pituitary disease, neonates, and during glucocorticoid therapy, and it mandates careful sequencing of hormone replacement and judicious use of free T4 to assess thyroid status when TSH is unreliable [^fd2a7f2c] [^5d18bb5a] [^0f371763].

---

Hydrocortisone suppresses TSH secretion via **glucocorticoid feedback** at the hypothalamus and pituitary, lowering TSH within 24–48 hours [^e7b51275] and reversing with dose reduction or cessation [^be78cafd]. This effect is **dose dependent** [^fd2a7f2c] (> 100 mg/day) and can mask hypothyroidism or mimic central hypothyroidism, so interpret thyroid tests cautiously during therapy. In adrenal insufficiency, TSH may be elevated and normalize with hydrocortisone, so assess adrenal status before starting levothyroxine to avoid adrenal crisis [^5d18bb5a] [^08934b4b].

## Mechanism of hydrocortisone-induced TSH suppression

Hydrocortisone suppresses TSH through **direct and indirect effects** on the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis:

- **Direct suppression**: Glucocorticoids inhibit thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) at the hypothalamus and reduce TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary [^a9cbfb71].

- **Indirect effects**: Glucocorticoids alter thyroid hormone metabolism, increasing T4 to reverse T3 conversion and reducing T3 availability, which further suppresses TSH via feedback [^a57cdb0c].

- **Circadian disruption**: Glucocorticoids blunt the nocturnal TSH surge, contributing to lower overall TSH levels [^a57cdb0c].

---

## Clinical evidence of hydrocortisone-induced TSH suppression

Multiple studies and guidelines document **TSH suppression** with hydrocortisone:

- **Preterm infants**: Single or two doses of glucocorticoids reduced TSH by 76% within 24 hours, with recovery in 3–15 days [^e7b51275].

- **Adults**: Physiologic and pharmacologic glucocorticoid doses suppress TSH, and central hypothyroidism patients on glucocorticoids may not need T4 dose adjustments [^08934b4b].

- **Cushing's syndrome**: Hypercortisolism is linked to central hypothyroidism and low TSH, which often reverses after cure [^be78cafd].

---

## Dose-dependent relationship

The degree of TSH suppression is **dose related**: pharmacologic doses (> 100 mg/day hydrocortisone or equivalent) reliably suppress TSH, whereas physiologic replacement (15–25 mg/day) may also suppress TSH, especially with prolonged use or in sensitive individuals [^fd2a7f2c] [^08934b4b].

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

Hydrocortisone-induced TSH suppression has **important clinical implications**:

- **Masking hypothyroidism**: Suppressed TSH can obscure primary hypothyroidism, delaying diagnosis or causing misclassification as central hypothyroidism [^notfound].

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Elevated TSH may reflect adrenal insufficiency; glucocorticoid therapy can normalize TSH, so assess adrenal function before starting levothyroxine to avoid adrenal crisis [^5d18bb5a] [^08934b4b].

- **Monitoring**: In patients on hydrocortisone, interpret thyroid tests cautiously; consider free T4 and clinical context, and reassess thyroid function after glucocorticoid dose changes [^0f371763].

---

## Reversibility of TSH suppression

TSH suppression from hydrocortisone is **reversible**; TSH typically recovers within days to weeks after dose reduction or cessation, though recovery may be delayed with prolonged high-dose therapy or underlying HPT axis disease [^e7b51275] [^be78cafd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **adrenal assessment** before initiating levothyroxine in suspected central hypothyroidism and recommend using free T4 rather than TSH to monitor central hypothyroidism during glucocorticoid therapy [^08934b4b] [^0f371763].

---

Hydrocortisone suppresses TSH through **glucocorticoid feedback** at the hypothalamus and pituitary, with effects that are dose dependent and reversible. Clinicians should interpret thyroid tests cautiously during hydrocortisone therapy and ensure adrenal function is assessed before starting levothyroxine to avoid adrenal crisis.

Outcome and follow-up

After treatment was started with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, the patient initially continued to deteriorate clinically, but showed a positive response after a few hours. The lack of initial improvement was probably due to the concurrent thyrotoxicosis. She was briefly admitted to the medium care unit for close observation. In the following 5 days, the patient started to respond to the therapy and her free T4 levels started to drop from 79.3 to 31.5 pmol/L (range: 12–22 pmol/L). She returned to the internal medicine ward and was discharged briefly thereafter and returned to her home country in good health.

### TSH suppression after intravenous glucocorticosteroid administration in preterm infants [^e7b51275]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Reports have described that, in adults, steroids suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and triiodothyronine (T3) and might suppress thyroxine (T4). No data have been reported for thyroid hormone changes before or after administration of glucocorticoid in preterm infants.

Aims

The aim of this study was to investigate short-term effects of thyroid hormones on preterm infants. INDEX CASES: We measured TSH, free T3 (FT3), and free T4 (FT4) before and after one or two doses of glucocorticoids administered to five infants at 29–37 weeks of corrected gestational age.

Results

Comparison of thyroid hormone levels before and 1 day after glucocorticoid administration showed that TSH significantly decreased by 76% (64%-87%), FT3 by 33% (10%-50%), and FT4 by 10% (3%-17%). The decline in TSH and FT3 was followed by an increase around the pretreatment level at 3–15 days after glucocorticoid administration. In two of the five infants, FT4 continued to decrease from 1 day after glucocorticoid administration.

Conclusions

In preterm infants, assessing thyroid hormones after glucocorticoid therapy demands caution because very short-term administration causes marked changes.

### Anastrozole tablets (anastrozole) [^dcc47a46]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The growth of many cancers of the breast is stimulated or maintained by estrogens.

In postmenopausal women, estrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione and testosterone) to estrone and estradiol. The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and in the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.

Anastrozole is a selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It significantly lowers serum estradiol concentrations and has no detectable effect on formation of adrenal corticosteroids or aldosterone.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effect on Estradiol

Mean serum concentrations of estradiol were evaluated in multiple daily dosing trials with 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg of anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Clinically significant suppression of serum estradiol was seen with all doses. Doses of 1 mg and higher resulted in suppression of mean serum concentrations of estradiol to the lower limit of detection (3.7 pmol/L). The recommended daily dose, anastrozole 1 mg, reduced estradiol by approximately 70% within 24 hours and by approximately 80% after 14 days of daily dosing. Suppression of serum estradiol was maintained for up to 6 days after cessation of daily dosing with anastrozole 1 mg.

The effect of anastrozole in premenopausal women with early or advanced breast cancer has not been studied. Because aromatization of adrenal androgens is not a significant source of estradiol in premenopausal women, anastrozole would not be expected to lower estradiol levels in premenopausal women.

Effect on Corticosteroids

In multiple daily dosing trials with 3, 5, and 10 mg, the selectivity of anastrozole was assessed by examining effects on corticosteroid synthesis. For all doses, anastrozole did not affect cortisol or aldosterone secretion at baseline or in response to ACTH. No glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is necessary with anastrozole.

Other Endocrine Effects

In multiple daily dosing trials with 5 and 10 mg, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured; there was no increase in TSH during the administration of anastrozole. Anastrozole does not possess direct progestogenic, androgenic, or estrogenic activity in animals, but does perturb the circulating levels of progesterone, androgens, and estrogens.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1e034d59]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

### Crosstalk between bone and brain in Alzheimer's disease: mechanisms, applications, and perspectives [^5d70f29f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) is a pituitary gland‐secreted hormone that not only regulates thyroid function but also plays a role in bone remodeling. Clinical studies have shown that increased levels of free T3 and free T4 are associated with decreased BMD and that increased levels of TSH are protective for bone. The anti‐osteoclastic effect of TSH reduces bone resorption, although its impact on osteoblasts varies depending on the stage of cell differentiation. Similarly, low TSH levels are associated with a high incidence of AD. A Mendelian randomization study suggested that genetically predicted elevated levels of TSH were associated with a reduced risk of AD, even when these levels were within normal ranges. However, it has also been proposed that thyroid dysfunction may be a consequence rather than a cause of AD since the decrease in TSH could be related to pituitary degeneration due to AD pathology. Similarly, hyperactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and elevated glucocorticoids can exacerbate the pathological changes in AD and contribute to bone loss., Based on previous studies, the glucocorticoid cascade is hypothesized to have a causal relationship with hippocampal injury, and overactivation of the HPA axis in AD may contribute to tau phosphorylation and enhance Aβ toxicity. In bone tissue, adrenocorticotropin is thought to stimulate osteoblast proliferation, and glucocorticoid can inhibit osteoblast differentiation, increase osteoclast production, and promote osteocyte apoptosis. The hypothalamic–pituitary–target organ axis plays an important role in neuroendocrine regulation, and it may also play a ubiquitous and important role in the brain–bone axis, which requires further investigation.

### Thyroid function spectrum in Cushing's syndrome [^ca0bb12a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a multisystem metabolic disorder caused by the excessive secretion of cortisol. Accurate functional diagnosis determines the prognosis of the disease. Excessive glucocorticoids cause systemic organ damage and inhibit the function of the pituitary-–adrenal axis, interfering with the adenohypophysis. Glucocorticoids also affect pituitary–-thyroid axis function, but the dysfunction or clinical implications of thyroid function in patients with CS have not been determined.

To understand the effect of hypercortisolism on thyroid function, Shekhar et al. performed a cohort study and reported that abnormal thyroid function, likely mediated by subnormal nocturnal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), is prevalent in patients with CS and is reversible after curative treatment. Although another report revealed that serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were decreased in patients with CS, many CS patients have high or normal TSH levels and low free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels. Elucidating thyroid function in CS patients may deepen our understanding of crosstalk between the anterior pituitary gland and CS patients.

Clinically significant suppression of serum estradiol was seen with all doses. Doses of 1 mg and higher resulted in suppression of mean serum concentrations of estradiol to the lower limit of detection (3.7 pmol/L). The recommended daily dose, ARIMIDEX 1 mg, reduced estradiol by approximately 70% within 24 hours and by approximately 80% after 14 days of daily dosing.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^08934b4b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids and thyroid — central hypothyroidism (CH) starting levothyroxine (L-T4): We suggest evaluating patients with CH for AI before starting L-T4 therapy; if this is not feasible, clinicians should prescribe empiric GC therapy in patients with CH who are starting L-T4 therapy until there is a definitive evaluation for AI. Data suggest that AI should be conclusively excluded before initiating L-T4 therapy for CH because thyroid hormone accelerates endogenous cortisol clearance and could unmask insufficient cortisol production and precipitate AC; if patients start L-T4 therapy before evaluation, clinicians should initiate empiric GC replacement therapy simultaneously until they complete a definitive evaluation for AI. Physiological and pharmacological doses of GC suppress TSH levels, and CH patients receiving GC therapy do not appear to require L-T4 dose adjustments.

### Thyroid function before, during, and after COVID-19 [^51f04d96]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The most likely explanation for the changes in thyroid function we observed is nonthyroidal illness syndrome, initially characterized by a reduction in total and FT3 and an increase in reverse T3 (rT3) in the absence of an increase in TSH; more severe or prolonged illness causes global reductions in TSH, FT4, and FT3. The suppression of TSH is most likely related to elevations in proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, which are negatively correlated with TSH. An additional factor may be cortisol, which is known to suppress TSH secretion, even at physiological levels. Chen et al were unable to exclude exogenous glucocorticoids as a factor influencing TSH. No patient in our cohort received exogenous steroids, and we excluded any patients taking steroids prior to admission. Therefore, the marked elevations in endogenous cortisol secretion during COVID-19 may be an additional factor suppressing TSH. A possible third explanation may be a direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on thyrotrophs as the receptor for virion binding, ACE2, is expressed in the pituitary. Critically, whichever of these factors are responsible for the observed drop in TSH secretion, we found that on follow-up TSH had returned to baseline, suggesting that the changes are reversible with recovery from COVID-19.

To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of such patients with COVID-19 to have had assessment of thyroid function at presentation. Additionally, we have uniquely presented longitudinal data gathered both prior to the COVID-19 admission and at follow-up. Overt thyroid dysfunction is not characteristically observed in most patients presenting acutely with COVID-19 nor at follow-up in survivors. Although we did see a statistically significant reduction in FT4 and TSH between baseline and admission with COVID-19, the magnitude of the reduction was small and not likely to justify treatment. These data are limited by the study's single-center design, the absence of FT3 and rT3 measurement, and characterization of thyroid autoantibody status. However, we believe our data are sufficient to suggest that routine measurement of thyroid function in COVID-19 may not be necessary unless there are other specific indicators of thyroid disease. Further longitudinal studies including FT3 and rT3 measurement are now necessary to determine the full impact of COVID-19 on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Levothyroxine sodium [^fd2a7f2c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and levothyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins.

The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4by deiodination in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is regulated by the hypothalamic pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) released from the hypothalamus stimulates secretion of thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary. TSH, in turn, is the physiologic stimulus for the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, T4and T3, by the thyroid gland. Circulating serum T3and T4levels exert a feedback effect on both TRH and TSH secretion. When serum T3and T4levels increase, TRH and TSH secretion decrease. When thyroid hormone levels decrease, TRH and TSH secretion increases. TSH is used for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and evaluation of levothyroxine therapy adequacy with other laboratory and clinical data. [See Dosage (2.1)] There are drugs known to affect thyroid hormones and TSH by various mechanisms and those examples are diazepam, ethioamide, lovastatin, metoclopramide, 6-mercaptopurine, nitroprusside, perphenazine, and thiazide diuretics. Some drugs may cause a transient decrease in TSH secretion without hypothyroidism and those drugs (dose) are dopamine (greater than 1 mcg per kg per min), glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone greater than 100 mg per day or equivalent) and octreotide (greater than 100 mcg per day).

Thyroid hormones regulate multiple metabolic processes and play an essential role in normal growth and development, and normal maturation of the central nervous system and bone. The metabolic actions of thyroid hormones include augmentation of cellular respiration and thermogenesis, as well as metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The protein anabolic effects of thyroid hormones are essential to normal growth and development.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^80fb55bf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Non-functioning pituitary adenomas: indications for pituitary surgery and post-surgical management [^3980d868]. Pituitary (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydrocortisone is the most commonly used glucocorticoid replacement in patients with confirmed secondary adrenal insufficiency. A typical starting dose consists of 10–12.5 mg/day, which is then titrated based on clinical features. In patients with partial adrenal insufficiency, the use of conventional replacement doses may lead to excessive GC exposure and should be avoided. Whether the optimal management of partial adrenal insufficiency is to use lower doses (hydrocortisone 5–10 mg) or only use stress doses when needed is unclear.

Munro et al. reported that approximately one in six patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency recover adrenal function, even up to 5 years after surgery. Regular re-evaluations should therefore be performed, at least during the first 6–12 months postoperatively, by using morning serum cortisol before first morning dose and provocative tests when needed to prevent unnecessary GC replacement therapy.

The frequency of central hypothyroidism in NFPA patients varies from 18 to 43% preoperatively, and 16–57% postoperatively. The diagnosis of central hypothyroidism is mainly biochemical, based on finding a low serum free thyroxine (FT4) concentration in combination with inappropriately low, normal, or only mildly elevated serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration. Neither serum triiodothyronine (FT3) level nor the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) test is considered a reliable test of central hypothyroidism. The diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that some patients with low-normal FT4 concentration may have mild central hypothyroidism. In these patients, FT4 concentrations should be followed and thyroxine replacement initiated if FT4 level decreases by 20% or if symptoms develop. In addition, it is important to keep in mind that GH-deficient patients with low normal FT4 have increased risk of developing central hypothyroidism after GH therapy has been initiated. These patients should receive thyroxine if serum FT4 level decreases below the reference range.

Thyroid Hormones

Thyroid Hormones Circadian Rhythm

The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis activity follows a circadian rhythm, mainly under the control of the central circadian pacemaker in the SCN. Moreover, the existence of an independent activity of the intrinsic thyroid clock has been supported by animal studies. Plasma concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) begins to rise in the late afternoon or early evening, with a nocturnal surge before sleep onset, and then it declines (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, from the limited data available, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) have been reported to show a morning peak and an evening or nighttime nadir, with free-T3 (fT3) levels peaking approximately 90 minutes after TSH levels. This diurnal variation is affected by glucocorticoid secretion/administration, melatonin, and thyroid hormones themselves. On top of that, a low-amplitude ultradian rhythm (a rhythm at high frequencies with a period < 24 hours) exists and is affected by sleep patterns, seasonal changes, and food intake. Indeed, studies have shown that acute nocturnal sleep deprivation causes TSH secretion to rise, causing higher morning plasma TSH levels, while partial sleep loss leads to modest but statistically significant declines in TSH and free T4 (fT4), mainly in female individuals. Furthermore, TSH secretion appears to decrease during summer and increase during winter, correlating with daily temperatures, as cold activates the catecholaminergic system, thereby causing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) release (which also explains the sudden increase in TSH in newborns that returns to its initial value within 48 hours). Chronic shift work, jet lag, and irregular sleep-wake cycles may disrupt the circadian rhythm, increasing the risk of thyroid disease. TSH rhythmicity is also often disrupted in patients with thyroid disorder: in cases of hypothyroidism, particularly when severe, the secretory regularity of TSH is markedly decreased.

### ACTH and gonadotropin deficiencies predict mortality in patients treated for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma: long-term follow-up of 519 patients in two large European centres [^94e397e8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Our observation of increased mortality in ACTH‐deficient NFPA patients mirrors data from patients with acromegaly, and in other cohorts with pituitary dysfunction. 11, 26 ACTH deficiency leads to hypocortisolism during acute illness, 27 with a significant risk of life‐threatening adrenal crisis. It is also intimately associated with the adverse metabolic effects of chronic supraphysiological glucocorticoid replacement. 18, 28 We have shown that mortality risk is increased almost fourfold in patients taking total daily hydrocortisone doses of 30 mg or higher. Zueger et al. 18 also found increased mortality with higher hydrocortisone dosages in ACTH‐deficient NFPA patients in a Swiss study; this finding was consistent for both total and weight‐adjusted hydrocortisone doses, and the same associations have been observed in acromegaly. 11 Interestingly, we found that daily replacement doses of LT4 below 100 mcg in TSH‐deficient patients were associated with a higher mortality risk. To our knowledge, this unexpected observation has not been demonstrated previously in secondary hypothyroidism. Optimal treatment of TSH deficiency is limited by the absence of a reliable biomarker of adequate replacement, as LT4 doses cannot be titrated according to TSH levels in pituitary failure. These data support the clinical suspicion that many pituitary patients with secondary hypothyroidism are chronically undertreated. 29

### Hyperthyroidism due to thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion after surgery for Cushing's syndrome: a novel cause of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone [^dc974fdc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Hyperthyroidism with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of TSH (SITSH) occurred by a decrease in hydrocortisone dose after surgery for Cushing's syndrome. This is a novel cause of SITSH.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe and discuss 2 cases of SITSH patients that were found after surgery for Cushing's syndrome. We also checked whether SITSH occurred in 7 consecutive patients with Cushing's syndrome after surgery.

Patients and Methods

A 45-year-old Japanese woman with ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome and a 37-year-old Japanese man with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome presented SITSH caused by insufficient replacement of hydrocortisone for postoperative adrenal insufficiency. When the dose of hydrocortisone was reduced to less than 20 mg/d within 18 days after surgery, SITSH occurred in both cases. We examined whether the change of the hydrocortisone dose induced the secretion of TSH. Free T₃ and TSH were normalized by the hydrocortisone dose increase of 30 mg/d, and these were elevated by the dose decrease of 10 mg/d. We also checked TSH and thyroid hormone levels of the 7 consecutive patients with Cushing's syndrome after surgery. Six (66.6%) of 9 patients showed SITSH.

Conclusions

This is the first report that insufficient replacement of hydrocortisone after surgery for Cushing's syndrome caused SITSH. Hyperthyroidism by SITSH as well as adrenal insufficiency can contribute to withdrawal symptoms of hydrocortisone replacement. We need to consider the possibility of SITSH for the pathological evaluation of withdrawal syndrome of hydrocortisone replacement.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^54e70265]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical context

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use. Other causes are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1
Causes of central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis e.g. pituitary apoplexy. In other situations a low morning cortisol level in an at risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed (see below).

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones with GH being the most common pituitary hormone affected followed by gonadotrophins and culminating in loss of ACTH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). ACTH however can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids.

Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism is important as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Testing for central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the HPA axis is performed as part of a formal screening process for hypopituitarism in patients with organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease such as those with sellar/parasellar tumours, post pituitary surgery or apoplexy, history of cranial irradiation or traumatic brain injury. In other situations the assessment may be triggered by suggestive symptoms such as fatigue, unexplained weight loss, spontaneous hypoglycaemia or hyponatraemia.

Timing of assessment

ACTH suppression from exogenous steroids

ACTH suppression and subsequent cortisol deficiency can result from chronic glucocorticoid use, can be unpredictable regardless of dose and duration of glucocorticoid and recovery can take weeks to years. Patients on long-term glucocorticoids for inflammatory conditions are frequently referred to specialist endocrine services for assessment of possible ACTH suppression. As prednisone can cross-react with the cortisol assay we suggest waiting until the patient is tapered to a dose of 5 mg at which point they are switched to an equivalent dose hydrocortisone 10 mg twice daily and a dynamic test can be carried out with the dose held the afternoon before and morning of the test.

### Thyroid function spectrum in Cushing's syndrome [^a57cdb0c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

To determine whether the clinical manifestations of CS are influenced by cortisol or thyroid hormones, we compared clinical and subclinical CS and found a significant difference only in the serum cortisol levels, which disappeared after the LDDST. In the clinical groups, levels of thyroid hormones, except for TT4, were significantly reduced, with a greater incidence of central hypothyroidism.

We further divided the CS patients into three groups according to their thyroid function status: euthyroid, low T3 and central hypothyroidism. The central hypothyroidism group exhibited significant pituitary–thyroid axis suppression, accompanied by significant elevation of serum cortisol, which was not suppressed by the LDDST.

During illness, T4 to T3 is downregulated. This is called "low T3 syndrome", an adaptive metabolic mechanism to reduce energy expenditure and prevent catabolism, recently reported very prevalent in medical inpatients outside the critically ill setting. In cohort of patients at nutritional risk, the prevalence of low T3 syndrome was 61%. Our study showed 21% complicated low T3 syndrome in the CS patients, indicating the prevention of catabolism.

The mechanisms underlying thyroid hormone changes in CS are multifaceted, involving direct and indirect effects of cortisol on thyroid hormone synthesis, metabolism, and action. Cortisol may suppress TSH secretion at the pituitary level, alter the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and modulate thyroid hormone action at the cellular level through effects on thyroid hormone receptors and transporters. Additionally, the role of glucocorticoids in modulating immune responses may have implications for thyroid autoimmunity in CS.

Moreover, CS can increase visceral fat accumulation. Adipose tissue releases cortisol, increases local glucocorticoid signalling and contributes to cortisol regeneration. To exclude nonautonomous cortisol interference, we analysed the correlations after the LDDST, and all thyroid hormones were negatively correlated with serum cortisol, with more pronounced correlations than the basal levels.

The correlation between excess glucocorticoids and suppressed TSH has been extensively studied in animal studies. The precise mechanisms involved in the depressed pituitary–thyroid axis in patients with CS have not been studied in detail. In humans, hypercortisolism can reduce TSH secretion and TSH pulses. TSH levels are lower in CS patients than in controls. The physiologic nocturnal increase in TSH also decreases due to the decrease in the nocturnal TSH surge, which was confirmed in a recent retrospective cohort study. An inverse relationship between night serum cortisol and TSH in CS patients has been reported.

### French Endocrine Society guidance on endocrine side effects of immunotherapy [^2b2e62f9]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

5.2 Treatment

In the acute phase of hypophysitis post ICPI, treatment by high-dose glucocorticoids is not systematically recommended, as neither its efficacy nor lack of harmful effects has been shown. It can be suggested in patients presenting with major headaches, visual aberrations or other auto-immune side effects that justify its use.

R5.2a: In confirmed cases of hypophysitis, we do not recommend the systematic use of high-dose synthetic glucocorticoids. This treatment may be proposed to treat symptoms such as major headaches that do not respond to normal analgesics and/or in the case of visual disturbances.

Urgent hydrocortisone intake in the case of ACTH deficiency. Since recovery of the ACTH axis occurs only in exceptional cases, educating the patient and oncologist on adjusting the dose of hydrocortisone, and injecting hydrocortisone hemisuccinate in case of emergency or intercurrent illness, is required. In the case of TSH or gonadotropin deficiency, initiation of treatment is less urgent, recovery of the TSH and gonadotropin axes usually occurs within months following hypophysitis secondary to ICPI.

R5.2b: In case of suspicion of acute ACTH insufficiency in a patient treated with ICPI, plasma cortisol assay should be urgently carried out, regardless of the time of day, and 100 mg hydrocortisone hemisuccinate should be administered via intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, then continuous perfusion of 100 mg delivered over 24 h (as for a non-ICPI-related ACTH insufficiency). This should be initiated without waiting for results of plasma cortisol assay. After improvement in clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters, treatment should be continued by oral hydrocortisone at a dose of 60 mg/24 h, in three administrations, to be reduced progressively until the replacement dose is reached.

R5.2c: In case of chronic ACTH deficiency in patients treated with ICPI, the daily dose of hydrocortisone should be 15–20 mg/day (taken in 2 or 3 administrations per day), to be adjusted depending on clinical parameters. The patient needs to be followed-up by an endocrinologist to ensure they are educated regarding their therapy, especially in terms of dose increase in stressful situations (such as infection or trauma) or the need for lifetime replacement. How to adjust the hydrocortisone dose in case of an acute medical event should also be explained to the referring oncologist.

Intensive care unit hypothyroidism considerations — dopamine and dobutamine may lower serum TSH, LT4 may need to be given intravenously due to malabsorption from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or specialized tube feedings, and if using intravenous LT4 the equivalent intravenous dose is approximately 75%; the possibility of adrenal insufficiency must also be considered since treatment of hypothyroidism might accelerate cortisol metabolism, and there are case reports of adrenal insufficiency unmasked by thyroid hormone.

### Postnatal administration of dexamethasone for weaning off the ventilator affects thyroid function [^890ecbf6]. Neonatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Very preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroxinemia because of prematurity as well as because of neonatal disease. Hypothyroxinemia is associated with impaired developmental outcome. Preterm infants who cannot be weaned from the ventilator can be treated with dexamethasone. Glucocorticoid administration has been found to alter thyroid hormone parameters. Therefore, dexamethasone treatment in these infants might additionally impair their thyroid function, which could have consequences for developmental outcome.

Objective

To assess what changes in thyroid function occur in the first hours after initiating dexamethasone treatment in ventilated preterm infants.

Methods

Preterm infants, in whom the decision was taken to start dexamethasone treatment, were included. Thyroxine (T(4)), 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), reverse T(3) (rT(3)), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cortisol were determined before and 6–9 h after administration of the first dose of a postnatal dexamethasone course. Details of clinical condition were recorded at both time points.

Results

Sixteen very preterm infants were included at a median age of 20 days. While clinical condition was stable between start of dexamethasone and 6–9 h thereafter, TSH and T(3) levels decreased significantly. rT(3) levels significantly increased, resulting in a decrease in the T(3)/rT(3) ratio. There was no statistically significant effect on the levels of T(4).

Conclusion

Postnatal dexamethasone administration negatively affects thyroid functioning the preterm infant with severe chronic lung disease.

### Thyrotropin releasing hormone [^e1982fbf]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General:

Thyroid hormones reduce the TSH response to TRH. Accordingly, patients in whom TRH is to be used diagnostically should be taken off liothyronine (T3) approximately seven days prior to testing and should be taken off thyroid medications containing levothyroxine (T4), e.g., desiccated thyroid, thyroglobulin, or liotrix, at least 14 days before testing. Hormone therapy is NOT to be discontinued when the test is used to evaluate the effectiveness of thyroid suppression with a particular dose of T4 in patients with nodular or diffuse goiter, or for adjustment of thyroid hormone dosage given to patients with primary hypothyroidism.

Chronic administration of levodopa has been reported to inhibit the TSH response to TRH.

It is not advisable to withdraw maintenance doses of adrenocortical drugs used in the therapy of known hypopituitarism. Several published reports have shown that prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids at physiologic doses has no significant effect on the TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone, but that the administration of pharmacologic doses of steroids reduces the TSH response. Therapeutic doses of acetylsalicylic acid (2 to 3.6 g/day) have been reported to inhibit the TSH response to protirelin. The ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid caused the peak level of TSH to decrease approximately 30% as compared to values obtained without acetylsalicylic acid administration. In both cases, the TSH peak occurred 30 minutes post-administration of protirelin.

### Central hypothyroidism and its replacement have a significant influence on cardiovascular risk factors in adult hypopituitary patients [^1619ba19]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid dysfunction may have detrimental effects on patient outcomes. Few studies have assessed this issue in patients with secondary hypothyroidism.

Objective

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that thyroid hormone status has an impact on cardiovascular risk factors in adult patients with hypopituitarism.

Design and Setting

This was a retrospective observational study (1993–2012) at a tertiary referral university hospital.

Patients

All GH-deficient patients starting GH replacement (1993–2009) with measured free T4 (fT4) (n = 208). Baseline fT4 defined patients as TSH-sufficient and TSH-deficient (further divided into tertiles according to baseline fT4; first tertile had lowest fT4).

Main Outcome Measures

Anthropometric (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference, total fat (fat mass) and lean body mass [LBM]) and biochemical (lipids and fasting plasma glucose) data were collected at baseline and a median 4.1 years after commencement of GH.

Results

At baseline, fT4 was negatively associated with BMI and waist circumference, but positively with high-density lipoprotein, independent of age, gender, and IGF-I (SD score). Only first-tertile TSH-deficient patients had higher BMI (P = 0.02), fat mass (P = 0.03), total cholesterol (P = 0.05), triglycerides (P < .01), and waist circumference (P = 0.01), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.03) as compared with TSH-sufficient patients. At follow-up, IGF-I, LBM, and plasma glucose had increased in all subgroups (P < .01). The change in fT4 (ΔfT4) (follow-up - baseline) was negatively correlated to ΔBMI, ΔLBM, Δtotal cholesterol, and Δlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P < .05, adjusted for ΔIGF-I and ΔGH and hydrocortisone dose). The negative correlation to Δtotal cholesterol and Δlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol persisted only in first-tertile TSH-deficient patients.

Conclusion

This single-center study over a 20-year period has strengthened the importance of improved awareness of thyroid status and optimal thyroid replacement of hypopituitary patients to reduce cardiovascular risks in hypopituitary patients.

### The contribution of serum cortisone and glucocorticoid metabolites to detrimental bone health in patients receiving hydrocortisone therapy [^c3c7788f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Study design

The study design has been previously published. Subjects were randomized to a crossover protocol (in random order) of three commonly prescribed doses of HC; dose A – 20 mg 08.00 hours, 10 mg 16.00 hours; dose B – 10 mg 08.00 hours, 10 mg 16.00 hours and dose C – 10 mg 08.00 h, 5 mg 16.00 hours. These doses are frequently used in clinical practice. At baseline and the end of each 6-week treatment schedule, patients were admitted, fasting, to the Clinical Research Facility at 07.30 h for 28 h. They underwent a physical examination that included blood pressure, weight, height, and waist circumference measurement. Following this examination, an 18 g cannula was placed in the antecubital fossa under aseptic technique. Basal samples were taken for cortisol, cortisol binding globulin (CBG), free T4, TSH, testosterone, gonadotropins, prolactin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH] D), calcium, albumin and renal function. The cannula was then flushed with 10mls of a heparinised solution (heparin sodium, 100 units diluted in 100mls of 0.9% normal saline) to maintain patency for the full 28-h period. The use of diluted heparin in this manner does not affect any of the laboratory sampling techniques used subsequently and since the first 5 mL of blood withdrawn at each time point was discarded there was little chance of contamination with such dilute levels of heparin. During this period the subjects had serum cortisol samples taken hourly through the indwelling cannula from the time of admission until midnight and were taken two-hourly from midnight until 0800 h the following morning.

Nonthyroidal illness — testing patterns, treatment stance, and special circumstances are summarized as follows: In chronically or markedly acutely ill patients, medications such as glucocorticoids, amiodarone, and dopamine may affect thyroid tests, and major illness or starvation may yield a low serum T 4 with normal or low serum T 3 and TSH levels; since evidence shows L-thyroxine or L-triiodothyronine is of no benefit in such settings, patients who are not clearly hypothyroid should not be treated until their acute medical condition has resolved, though a 2010 study showed that infants under 5 months of age undergoing cardiac surgery for complex congenital heart disease benefited from intravenous L-triiodothyronine, and patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure with low serum T 3 levels have been shown to benefit from intravenous L-triiodothyronine to restore serum T 3 levels to normal; evaluation by a clinical endocrinologist is appropriate before initiating thyroid hormone treatment.

Mild active GO treated with RAI — concurrent glucocorticoids: In the absence of any strong contraindication to GC use we suggest considering them for coverage of GD patients with mild active GO who are treated with RAI, even in the absence of risk factors for GO deterioration. The decision on whether to administer concurrent glucocorticoids in a particular patient choosing RAI therapy should be made in the light of risk–benefit considerations (i.e., their personal risk of worsening GO, balanced against their risk of developing glucocorticoid side effects). Risk factors for deterioration to be considered include active and progressive GO over the preceding 3 months and high serum pretreatment TRAb levels (normal < 1.75 IU/L, high risk for GO progression if > 8.8 IU/L). For prophylaxis, a randomized clinical trial validated prednisone 0.4–0.5 mg/kg per day, started 1–3 days after RAI administration, continued for 1 month, and then tapered over 2 months; a retrospective cohort suggested about 0.2 mg/kg per day for 6 weeks may be equally effective for prevention of GO exacerbation in patients with initially mild or absent eye disease; currently most task force members use a minimum starting dose of 30 mg prednisone daily, tapering off within 6–8 weeks.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^7665392a]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) interpretation pitfalls include acute illness; pregnancy; central hypothyroidism from nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas; effects of subcutaneous octreotide and oral bexarotene; anorexia nervosa; heterophile or interfering antibodies; and adrenal insufficiency. In acute illness, TSH may be suppressed with levels below 0.1 mIU/L and testing in hospitalized patients "should be only performed if there is a strong clinical suspicion for thyroid dysfunction." During pregnancy, TSH typically falls in the first trimester, but infrequently to below 0.1 mIU/L, and returns to normal in the second trimester. In central hypothyroidism due to nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, mildly elevated TSH is described, generally not above 6 or 7 mIU/L, due to bioinactive isoforms. Drug and condition effects are specified: subcutaneous octreotide does not cause persistent central hypothyroidism, oral bexarotene almost always does, anorexia nervosa may show low TSH with low free T4, heterophile or interfering antibodies may cause falsely elevated TSH values, and adrenal insufficiency may be associated with TSH elevations reversed with glucocorticoid replacement.

### Antenatal corticosteroids for threatened labour facilitate thyroid maturation among preterm neonates [^f061517d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of antenatal corticosteroids (ANS) on the maturation of thyroid function in the preterm infants.

Context

ANS reduce mortality and morbidities in preterm neonates. Organ maturation by the glucocorticoids is the key, at least in part. However, the effect of ANS on thyroid is controversial.

Patients

A study group of 99 very low birthweight neonates (< 34 weeks' gestational age) with the exception of those born more than 7 days after ANS administration were divided into a complete group (n = 49) whose mothers completed two doses of betamethasone and who were born more than 24 hours after the completion of ANS administration, and an incomplete group (n = 50) who were not exposed to any ANS or were born within 24 hours after the completion of ANS administration. Serum-free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation tests were performed at about 2 weeks of age.

Results

The incidence of hyperthyrotropinaemia (TSH > 15 mIU/L) in the complete group was significantly lower than in the incomplete group (6% vs 22%, P = 0.023). Exaggerated responses to TRH tests were more frequent in the incomplete group (17% vs 44%; P = 0.053). TSH 30 was significantly lower in the complete group, (P = 0.046). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the incidence of hyperthyrotropinaemia was associated with complete ANS administration (adjusted odds ratios 0.39).

Conclusions

ANS administration might facilitate thyroid maturation in preterm neonates.

### A challenging diagnosis that eventually results in a life-threatening condition: Addison's disease and adrenal crisis [^27d4cc6a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

'As I reminisce about the past, the most striking features were exhaustion and fatigue, which demanded an extraordinary amount of sleep. The faintness and dizziness disabled me, and I was eventually affected by amnesia for a longer period, from approximately 2 months before the adrenal crisis until after the third ECT session. All the earlier unspecific signs, especially the psychiatric symptoms that were so difficult to treat, made me feel like a hopeless case — but now with the correct diagnosis and treatment, I have hope for the future'.
Learning points

All acutely ill patients who present with possible signs of adrenal crisis, such as cardiovascular collapse, should immediately be treated with 100 mg hydrocortisone intravenously. The therapeutic threshold for administering the life-saving drug should be low and not delayed by diagnostic measures.
Suspect chronic adrenal insufficiency in patients with gradual onset of non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, postural dizziness, weight loss, gastrointestinal manifestations or psychiatric disorders. The condition should not be ruled out by a single cortisol measurement, instead our clinical judgement should guide us to more dedicatedly reevaluate suspected cases.
An elevated TSH may be a feature of Addison's disease, and note that thyroxine therapy can precipitate an adrenal crisis in these individuals.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^5784b6ed]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Agents and conditions having an impact on L-thyroxine therapy and interpretation of thyroid tests — conditions such as pregnancy, malabsorption, drugs, diagnostic agents, dietary substances, and supplements can affect thyroid hormone economy; for example, orally administered estrogens increase thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels and, while this does not alter thyroid status in euthyroid individuals with normal thyroid reserve, it may do so when there is marginal thyroid reserve or established hypothyroidism. Drugs may have multiple effects on thyroid hormone metabolism, with notable examples including glucocorticoids and amiodarone; mechanisms are sometimes unknown. The impact of agents or conditions may require clinicians to increase monitoring, adjust dosages, or instruct patients to change how and when they take L-thyroxine, and major determinants of impact include dosage, duration of action, proximity to when thyroid hormone is taken, duration of treatment, iodine content, whether iodine is organified or nonorganified, size of the iodine pool, autoimmune or nodular thyroid disease, thyroid hormone status, and genetic factors.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Managing toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: consensus recommendations from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) toxicity management working group [^38756b80]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Management of confirmed hypophysitis includes replacement of deficient hormones (physiologic doses of steroids and thyroid hormone). In the presence of both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism, steroids should always be started prior to thyroid hormone in order to avoid an adrenal crisis. High doses of steroids are necessary in the setting of severe headaches, vision changes or adrenal crisis. Both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism appear to represent long term sequelae of hypophysitis and lifelong hormonal replacement is needed in most cases. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed to obtain and carry a medical alert bracelet.

Thyroid dysfunction

Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) was reported in 6–20% of patients in large phase 3 clinical trials.

Hypothyroidism

Patients with unexplained fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, cold intolerance, constipation, depression and other recognized symptoms should be suspected of having hypothyroidism. Lab tests showing high TSH and low free T4 are indicative of biochemical hypothyroidism and, if present, additional testing for thyroid antibodies such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is warranted. Patients with confirmed hypothyroidism should be started on thyroid hormone, with repeat TSH and free T4 levels evaluated 6–8 weeks later. Once a maintenance dose is identified (TSH within normal range) clinical and biochemical re-evaluation should be undertaken every 12 months.

### Normal adrenal and thyroid function in patients who survive COVID-19 infection [^c9bdaf9d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms following COVID-19 are reported to affect approximately 53% to 63% of patients and indeed this is reflected in our cohort, where direct questioning revealed that 62.9% of patients experienced persistent fatigue following COVID-19.

Not only is disturbance of the adrenal axis frequently associated with fatigue, but dysfunction of the thyroid axis may frequently present with tiredness. Of those patients not already known to have thyroid disease (n = 68), thyroid function tests (TSH, fT4, and fT3) were all within the normal range. We have also previously shown that there is a small reduction, on average, of TSH and FT4 compared to the pre-COVID-19 baseline and that there appears to be a recovery to intra-individual set-points for fT4 and TSH. Moreover, there was no evidence of increase in frequency of hypo- or hyperthyroidism in those patients with fatigue, compared with those without.

This study does have some limitations. During the development of this study, details of persistent symptoms including fatigue following COVID-19 were emerging. In the absence of any validated measure for fatigue post-COVID-19, we adopted a pragmatic approach, quantifying rates of fatigue using the "yes/no" response to the direct question of experience of fatigue, consistent with both studies investigating COVID-19 and other disease paradigms. We then used an ordinal scale to quantify both the frequency of fatigue and severity of fatigue; however, such an approach, as with other measures of fatigue, is subjective. In addition, due to the single assessment of patients, we are unable to provide longitudinal data for all patients included in the study. For patients with details of their initial admission with COVID-19 illness available, we have provided data on cortisol levels taken within the first 48 hours of admission. Furthermore, given that all patients demonstrated adequate adrenal reserve and thyroid levels at over 3 months after initial illness, it is unlikely that clinically significant endocrine abnormalities would develop on more prolonged follow-up. Additionally, by excluding patients on glucocorticoid treatment, as well as other medications known to affect cortisol-binding globulin (like the combined oral contraceptive pill), it may be that some patients with adrenal and thyroid dysfunction following COVID-19 were not included in the study. However, given that administration of steroids is known to influence thyroid function tests, and interpretation of the response to Synacthen, it was necessary to exclude such patients to prevent the misclassification of patients who have survived COVID-19.

Management

The safest option is to commence hydrocortisone replacement with 15–25 mg/day in divided doses. While over replacement is always important to avoid, in areas with high risk of viral exposure, it would be preferable to err on the side of starting on the higher end of this dose range to ensure no under replacement. Given the risk of an adrenal crisis with COVID-19 (or any other illness), all patients on GC should be reminded about sick day management. This includes prompt doubling of their regular GC dose at the first sign of sickness, ensuring access to injectable GC and use of medical alert jewelry. Where medication supply may become an issue, it would be reasonable to make sure patients have 2–3 months reserves of their GC therapy and there may be a need to switch between GC preparations (for example hydrocortisone to cortisone acetate or prednisone depending on country approvals) if availability becomes limited. Adequate GC management can be assessed clinically by VV.

Once GC is started, it would be safe to commence thyroid replacement if required. A reasonable starting dose, in the absence of coexistent significant cardiac disease, would be approximately 50–75 µg levothyroxine daily, but dose is usually weight-based. Dose adjustment, and clinical reassessment, can take place via VV, aiming for a free T4 level in the mid-upper normal range. Ideally, free T4 levels would be assessed 6–8 weeks later, however deferring for 3–4 months would be reasonable.

Testosterone or estrogen replacement could also reasonably be deferred for 6 months, although if there are significant symptoms persisting after GC and thyroid replacement, commencement of transdermal preparations would be advised over injectable testosterone to again limit the need for patients to visit primary care physicians. GH replacement is usually deferred in a patient with an untreated sellar mass. In patients already established on gonadal or GH replacement, clinical assessment to avoid side effects would be adequate, although it may be appropriate to ensure adequate testosterone levels in men and maintenance of IGF-1 below the age-adjusted upper normal reference level whenever essential biochemical testing is performed.

Thyroid storm — drugs and doses: Propylthiouracil 500–1000 mg load, then 250 mg every 4 hours blocks new hormone synthesis and blocks T4-to-T3 conversion; it may be given intravenously. Methimazole 60–80 mg/d blocks new hormone synthesis. Propranolol 60–80 mg every 4 hours: consider invasive monitoring in congestive heart failure patients, blocks T4-to-T3 conversion in high doses, and alternate drug is esmolol infusion. Iodine (saturated solution of potassium iodide) 5 drops (0.25 mL or 250 mg) orally every 6 hours blocks new hormone synthesis and blocks thyroid hormone release; do not start until 1 hour after antithyroid drugs; alternative drug is Lugol's solution. Hydrocortisone 300 mg intravenous load, then 100 mg every 8 hours may block T4-to-T3 conversion and provides prophylaxis against relative adrenal insufficiency; alternative drug is dexamethasone.

### Association between generic levothyroxine switching and thyrotropin levels… [^4a1e66d7]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Is switching among generic levothyroxine sodium products made by different manufacturers associated with changes in serum thyrotropin levels. Findings In this large comparative effectiveness research study of 15 829 patients who filled a generic levothyroxine prescription, the proportion of patients with normal TSH levels was 83% among patients who continued to use the same product vs 85% among patients who switched between generic products, a nonsignificant difference. Meaning Results of this study conflict with the current expert guideline recommendation that universally warns patients and clinicians about the possible changes in TSH levels associated with switching among levothyroxine products. Importance Switching among generic levothyroxine sodium products made by different manufacturers typically occurs at the pharmacy and may affect serum thyrotropin levels.

Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, had diagnosed hypopituitarism or hyperthyroidism, or had a medical condition or used medications that could affect thyrotropin levels. They were also excluded if they filled a prescription for other forms of thyroid replacement therapy between 6 months before the index date and when the first TSH level was obtained 6 weeks to 12 months after the index date. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2019, to November 24, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportion of individuals with a normal or markedly abnormal TSH level using the first available laboratory result 6 weeks to 12 months after the index date. A propensity score model was developed to minimize confounding using logistic regression with the binary outcome of continuing the same sourced levothyroxine product vs switching generic levothyroxine.

Within this 6-month period before the index date, patients were required to have at least 3 months of constant generic levothyroxine use and at least 1 available TSH level in the normal range. 11 After the. Among all 2780 propensity score–matched pairs of patients, the mean time from the index date to the first TSH test result was 162 days for patients who did not switch and 157 days for patients who switched generic levothyroxine products.

Brain metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer — Surgical resection and stereotactic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) are the mainstays of therapy for central nervous system (CNS) metastases, and stereotactic radiosurgery or EBRT is preferred to whole-brain radiation because it induces less short- and long-term toxicity and may be effective even with multiple brain lesions; radioiodine (RAI) can be considered if the metastases concentrate RAI. If RAI is being considered, stereotactic EBRT and concomitant glucocorticoid therapy are recommended prior to RAI to minimize a potential TSH-induced increase in tumor size and RAI-induced inflammatory response (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Effects of cabozantinib on plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum cortisol levels in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a retrospective study [^96591525]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Clinical course of a patient after initiating combination therapy with NIVO and CABO for mRCC. The dotted line represents the upper limit of the reference range of plasma ACTH (63.3 pg/mL). ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; CABO, cabozantinib; HC, hydrocortisone; mRCC, metastatic renal cell carcinoma; NIVO, nivolumab; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone

Four days after discontinuing CABO, an ACTH stimulation test revealed a reduced cortisol response, with serum cortisol levels increasing only from 11.5 to 15.7 μg/dL (Table 2). CT imaging revealed no abnormalities in the adrenal glands throughout the course, and anti-adrenal cortex antibodies remained negative. The symptoms improved promptly following hydrocortisone (HC) 10 mg administration. The patient subsequently underwent right nephrectomy. Plasma ACTH levels decreased during the suspension of NIVO and CABO but increased again upon resumption of therapy. Serum TSH levels were normalized following HC administration. With continued HC administration, the patient's fatigue and appetite loss resolved, allowing continuation of NIVO and CABO combination therapy.

Table 2
ACTH stimulation test

Patient 1 corresponds to the 72-year-old case referred to our department. ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; CABO, cabozantinib

In this case, PAI was diagnosed based on a reduced cortisol response in the ACTH stimulation test and prompt symptom improvement following HC administration. Elevated plasma ACTH levels were observed after both NIVO and CABO administration, suggesting potential involvement of both drugs. Typically, ICI-related AI presents as a secondary AI, while ICI-induced PAI is extremely rare. Reported cases of ICI-induced PAI are characterized by progressive adrenal atrophy, irreversible adrenocortical dysfunction, or the presence of anti-adrenal cortex antibodies. Based on the clinical findings and treatment course, CABO was considered the most likely cause of PAI in this patient; however, its underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. To further investigate TKI-induced PAI, we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the effects of CABO on adrenocortical function.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) thyroid dysfunction — For patients with destructive thyroiditis, the initial thyrotoxic phase is usually transient and is followed by hypothyroidism; therefore, close monitoring is recommended. For symptomatic patients, β-blockers may be considered, and if thyrotoxic symptoms are severe, a short course of high doses of glucocorticoids can be utilized for the control of symptoms. All patients in whom ICIs are initiated should undergo thyroid testing at baseline and before each new cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (every 4–6 weeks), with subsequent individualization of thyroid function tests to every 3 to 6 months pending clinical symptoms; thyroid ultrasound is recommended for those with palpable thyroid nodules. For clinically stable cases, transitory thyrotoxicosis can be treated with β-blockers because there is no role of antithyroid medications or steroids in destructive thyroiditis.

2.1. Biochemical criteria used in the decision to start treatment for CH

A newborn with an abnormal neonatal screening result should be referred to an expert center (1/++0).
An abnormal screening result should be followed by confirmatory testing consisting of measurement of serum fT4 and TSH (1/++0).
If the serum fT4 concentration is below and TSH clearly above the age-specific reference interval, then levothyroxine (LT4) treatment should be started immediately (1/+++).
If the serum TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L at confirmatory testing (approximately in the second week of life), treatment should be started, even if fT4 is normal (arbitrary threshold, expert opinion) (2/+00).
If the serum TSH concentration is 6–20 mU/L beyond the age of 21 days in a healthy neonate with an fT4 concentration within the age-specific reference interval, we suggest to either start LT4 treatment immediately and retest, off-treatment, at a later stage, or to withhold treatment but retest 1 to 2 weeks later and to re-evaluate the need for treatment (lack of evidence in favor or against treatment, this is an area of further investigation) (2/++0).
In countries or regions where thyroid function tests are not readily available, LT4 treatment should be started if filter paper TSH concentration is > 40 mU/L (at the moment of neonatal screening; arbitrary threshold, expert opinion) (2/+00).
If the serum fT4 is low, and TSH is low, normal or slightly elevated, the diagnosis central CH should be considered (1/++0).
In neonates with central CH, we recommend to start LT4 treatment only after evidence of intact adrenal function; if coexistent central adrenal insufficiency cannot be ruled out, LT4 treatment must be preceded by glucocorticoid treatment to prevent possible induction of an adrenal crisis (2/+00).

2.2. Communication of abnormal screening and confirmatory results

An abnormal neonatal screening result should be communicated by an experienced professional (e.g. member of pediatric endocrine team, pediatrician, or general physician) either by telephone or face to face, and supplemented with written information for the family (2/+00).

Results and discussion

Previous method comparisons and case studies from our laboratory, and others, provide preliminary evidence that IA measurements for thyroid hormones are influenced by TBG concentrations. Specifically, our laboratory has established that direct measurements of FT4 by LC-MS/MS, which physically separate BPs by ultrafiltration, show the expected inverse log-linear relationship with TSH and no correlation to TBG or ALB concentrations. By contrast, FT4 measurements by automated IA, a sequential two-step electrochemiluminescent assay — which does not require the physical removal of TBG or ALB, or the measurement of thyroxine-binding capacity — do not result in an inverse log-linear relationship with TSH, and strongly correlate to TBG or ALB concentrations. Our results also complement a prior investigationexamining the accuracy of FT4 measurements by IA. In the aforementioned study, the concentration of FT4 was kept constant, while levels of TBG-bound T4 were increased to reflect the pathophysiological range found in patient sera. The study concluded that FT4 measurements by IA were not accurate at certain levels of TBG-bound T4. While BP interference is frequently alluded to in many critiques of IA techniques, and becoming more widely discussed, there are few investigations which evaluate the role of BP concentration on routine IA measurements of hormones, aside from FT4.

In this study, we explicitly assessed the influence of naturally occurring variations of TBG on IA measurements of the biologically active thyroid hormones (T3 and FT3) that are the most clinically relevant for evaluating thyroid disorders. It is important to mention that we cannot make predictions as to how high or low levels of BPs will interfere with IA measurements. Specific BP binding constants can differ by more than one order of magnitude when compared with IA antibodies. Since the proprietary antibody binding constants are not made available, we cannot form hypotheses as to whether certain analyte values will be under- or overestimated as a result of variable binding interactions taking place in the presence of high or low BP concentrations.

When we compared our current analysis with prior investigations of IA performance from our laboratory. we found complementary trends. In inclusive analyses, T3 values by IA and LC-MS/MS assays correlated relatively well (Table 1); however, the correlation was significantly diminished when only the low BP measurements were considered (Table 2). Correlations of FT3 were poor under all BP scenarios. These trends highlight the importance of performing critical evaluations of IA accuracy that take into consideration pathologically relevant conditions.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0f371763]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) — thyroid hormone replacement monitoring and dosing: We recommend against using serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with CH. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕) Many patients with CH have undetectable TSH levels on presentation, and almost all CH patients adequately treated with L-T4 to maintain serum fT4 levels in the mid to high-normal range will have undetectable TSH levels; therefore, clinicians should not interpret undetectable TSH levels as a sign of overtreatment in CH, even in patients with initial measurable TSH levels. A randomized controlled study of CH measured fT4 levels 2 hours after dose ingestion and reported slightly elevated mean fT4 levels with adequate doses; therefore, we recommend checking fT4 before the L-T4 dose. Alternate preparations of thyroid hormones or nutraceuticals are not recommended for treating CH.

### Thyroid function spectrum in Cushing's syndrome [^7eda31ef]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Thyroid disorders have been reported in hypercortisolism patients. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) potentially complicates its metabolic sequelae. We investigated thyroid function in CS patients to determine this relationship.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we screened CS patients from 2016 to 2019 at our hospital. Patient demographic, medical history, and laboratory data were collected. Additionally, we performed a meta-analysis to demonstrate the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with CS.

Results

Among 129 CS patients, 48.6% had triiodothyronine (TT3), 27.9% had thyroxine (TT4), 24.6% had free T3 (FT3), 27.7% had free T4 (FT4), and 6.2% had thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels below the reference values. Those with clinical CS showed more pronounced thyroid suppression than did those with subclinical CS. Cortisol levels were markedly greater in patients with pituitary hypothyroidism (P < 0.001). Serum cortisol levels throughout the day and post low-dose dexamethasone-suppression test (LDDST) results correlated with thyroid hormone levels, particularly in ACTH-independent CS. Correlations varied by thyroid status; FT3 and TSH were linked to cortisol in euthyroid individuals but not in those with low T3 or central hypothyroidism. TSH levels notably halved from the lowest to highest cortisol tertile post-LDDST. Finally, meta-analysis showed 22.7% (95% CI 12.6%-32.9%) central hypothyroidism in 528 CS patients of nine studies.

Conclusion

Thyroid hormone levels are significantly correlated with cortisol levels and are impaired in patients with CS. However, the physiological adaptation and pathological conditions need further study.

### Clinical insights of pregnancy management, adrenal insufficiency as a possible cause of elevated TSH: a pilot study of case series [^c91c31ab]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective case series, we identified two important clinical issues. First, the incidence of AI-suspected HT may be higher than expected during pregnancy. Fifteen pregnant women were suspected of having HT based on findings such as elevated TSH and four were newly diagnosed with AI (26.7%). Pregnancy affects the maternal HPA-axis, leading to an increased placental production of estrogen. This stimulates hepatic corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) production, thus stimulating cortisol production. Total plasma cortisol, 24-h urine free cortisol and CBG levels progressively rise threefold during pregnancy. Third trimester plasma cortisol varies over a wide range, from 16.3 to 55 µg/dl, and decreases promptly after delivery. Plasma ACTH levels rise through pregnancy, which parallel the rise in cortisol, reaching maximal levels during labor and delivery. The cause of this increase in ACTH is not clear, but placentally derived ACTH may be a significant contributor to hypercortisolism in pregnancy. Other causes may include pituitary desensitization to cortisol feedback, or enhanced pituitary responses to corticotropin-releasing factors such as vasopressin and CRH. Therefore, it is not easy to make conclusions about the level of cortisol, ACTH, CRH in pregnant women, especially to confirm the presence of a subclinical AI. The causes of AI have been extensively reviewed. It is important to distinguish primary AI from Sheehan syndrome with anterior pituitary hormone deficiency or other secondary causes. However, ACTH levels and the CRH stimulation test, which is useful in differentiating tertiary from secondary AI in nonpregnant individuals, has only limited utility in pregnancy. Thus, it is difficult to determine at what level and to what degree dysfunction of the HPA axis occurs in pregnant women. Recent data have reported an AI prevalence as low as 144 per 1 million people; therefore, we first suspected hypothyroidism based on findings such as elevated TSH. However, as noted above, the diagnosis of subclinical AI is difficult, and the prevalence of subclinical AI is unknown in the complex HPA axis changes during pregnancy. Therefore, we must be aware of AI and its manifestation due to various pregnancy-related stresses. In particular, labor, vaginal delivery, and cesarean section are acutely stressful situations, and CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels increase several-fold with the onset of labor and delivery. Therefore, it is important to consider subclinical AI and take appropriate action during stress. In this study, two newly diagnosed AI were successfully delivered with appropriate steroid coverage.

### French Endocrine Society guidance on endocrine side effects of immunotherapy [^678f28ec]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

4.3 Treatment and follow-up of thyroid dysfunction

Thyrotoxicosis is most often transitory and its treatment depends on the clinical severity and etiological diagnosis. Treatment must be decided on in agreement between the treating endocrinologist and oncologist or specialist. Corticosteroid therapy should be considered only in clinically severe cases of thyrotoxicosis.

Hypothyroidism most often appears as a second phase after thyrotoxicosis induced by silent inflammatory thyroiditis. The decision to treat should take into account the general state of the patient, the presence of comorbidities, especially cardiac comorbidity, as well as the clinical and biochemical severity of the hypothyroidism. The evolution of hypothyroidism after withdrawal of ICPI is not well known. Thyroid hormones are usually necessary on a long-term basis in patients with hypothyroidism following a transitory thyrotoxicosis, but follow-up is not consensual

R4.3a: The treatment strategy for thyroid abnormalities in the course of ICPI for cancer should be agreed between the treating endocrinologist and the clinician prescribing ICPI.

R4.3b: In cases of asymptomatic thyrotoxicosis, clinical and hormonal monitoring can be proposed. In the case of symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, we recommend treatment, with beta-blockers in the absence of contraindications.

R4.3c: The treatment of ICPI-induced hypothyroidism is based on levothyroxine. This is justified in the case of TSH concentrations superior to 10 miU/L and should be discussed in TSH between 5 and 10 mIU/L (found on two consecutive assays), associated with either clinical symptoms or the presence of anti-TPO antibodies. Levothyroxine can be started at a dose of 1–1.6 µg/kg/day but must be adjusted for age, comorbidities and the patients' prognosis for survival. Modalities for adjusting the dose are the same as for other cases of hypothyroidism.

R4.3d: Thyrotoxicosis is transitory and generally evolves toward hypothyroidism. In the case of hypothyroidism, recovery of normal thyroid function is possible but unpredictable. It is recommended to administer thyroid replacement during the entire duration of ICPI. During treatment with levothyroxine, monitoring is based on TSH assays which need to be performed every 3 months. Progressive withdrawal of levothyroxine is possible at the end of ICPI, with continued clinical and TSH monitoring. The presence of thyroid dysfunction secondary to a first treatment with an ICPI (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1) is not a contraindication for use of a different ICPI.

Congenital hypothyroidism — acute illness and NICU admission: Newborn infants with acute illness, particularly those requiring admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), are likely to experience a nonthyroidal illness, and most NICU patients are born preterm and/or low birth weight (LBW) and may receive glucocorticoids or dopamine, which decrease TSH secretion. The combination of acute illness, preterm birth, and these medications results in low T4 without TSH elevation detectable by primary T4-reflex TSH NBS programs, and these infants have a higher risk for delayed TSH elevation; term newborns of normal birth weight admitted to a NICU may have a risk as high as that of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Levothyroxine is contraindicated in patients with untreated subclinical (suppressed serum TSH level with normal T3and T4levels) or overt thyrotoxicosis of any etiology and in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Levothyroxine is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency since thyroid hormones may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis by increasing the metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids (see PRECAUTIONS). LEVOTHROID®is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of the inactive ingredients in LEVOTHROID®tablets (see DESCRIPTION, Inactive Ingredients .)

### Impact of COVID-19 on pituitary function: a cross-sectional study in Southern iran [^9d7570ef]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a global health crisis, prompting extensive research into its diverse physiological effects. While primarily characterized as a respiratory illness, COVID-19 exhibits systemic manifestations, including the endocrine system. Previous investigations have shown the intricate association between hormonal dysregulation and disease severity among COVID-19 patients.

A pivotal aspect of this association lies in the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a central neuroendocrine system orchestrating stress responses and immune modulation. Studies have documented aberrant cortisol levels and impaired glucocorticoid signaling in severe COVID-19 cases, indicating the role of HPA axis dysfunction in exacerbating inflammatory responses and contributing to adverse clinical outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality. In addition, thyroid dysfunction has shown as a significant feature in the context of COVID-19, with reports of thyroid hormone abnormalities, including thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, among affected individuals. Thyroid hormones play crucial roles in immune regulation and metabolic homeostasis, and their dysregulation may potentiate inflammatory cascades and predispose patients to severe COVID-19 complications.

Moreover, alterations in gonadal hormones, particularly testosterone and estrogen, have directed researches for their potential implications in COVID-19 pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. Male COVID-19 patients have shown lower testosterone levels, which might contribute to disease severity and adverse prognosis, given the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of testosterone. Conversely, estrogen, with its immunoregulatory effects, has been postulated to confer protective benefits in female COVID-19 patients, potentially mitigating disease severity and improving clinical outcomes.

Despite these advancements, there remains a paucity of research focusing on the Iranian population's hormonal responses to COVID-19. Iran has confronted a substantial burden of COVID-19 cases, characterized by diverse demographic profiles and clinical presentations, necessitating context-specific investigations to elucidate disease mechanisms and inform clinical management strategies. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of abnormal hormonal levels among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Teaching Hospitals affiliated with the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), southern Iran.

### Central hypothyroidism in a patient with pituitary autoimmunity: evidence for TSH-independent thyroid hormone synthesis [^cef5650a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Acquired central hypothyroidism is rare, especially when isolated, and is typically associated with detectable, although biologically inactive, serum TSH.

Objective

We describe a 56-yr-old woman with profound central hypothyroidism and partial central hypoadrenalism, in the absence of other endocrine abnormalities. In contrast to most cases of central hypothyroidism, serum TSH remained undetectable for 9 months before the initiation of thyroid hormone and hydrocortisone treatment. A test for pituitary autoantibody was moderately positive. Serum free T(4), serum T(3), and neck radioiodine uptake were low but detectable. The thyroid and pituitary glands appeared morphologically normal on neck ultrasound and head magnetic resonance imaging, respectively.

Settings

The study was conducted in a tertiary academic medical center.

Conclusions

This case illustrates the variable clinical presentation of pituitary autoimmunity. The persistence of low but detectable thyroid hormone levels and radioiodine neck uptake in the absence of TSH suggests that significant TSH-independent thyroid hormone synthesis may occur in the normal thyroid.

### The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in Cushing syndrome before and after curative surgery [^be78cafd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We do not fully understand how hypercortisolism causes central hypothyroidism or what factors influence recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. We evaluated thyroid function during and after cure of Cushing syndrome (CS).

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with CS seen from 2005 to 2018 (cohort 1, c1, n = 68) or 1985 to 1994 (cohort 2, c2, n = 55) at a clinical research center. Urine (UFC) and diurnal serum cortisol (F: ~8 am and ~midnight [pm]), morning 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyrotropin (TSH) (c1) or hourly TSH from 1500 to 1900 h (day) and 2400 to 04000 h (night) (c2), were measured before and after curative surgery.

Results

While hypercortisolemic, 53% of c1 had central hypothyroidism (low/low normal FT4+unelevated TSH). Of those followed long term, 31% and 44% had initially subnormal FT4 and T3, respectively, which normalized 6 to 12 months after cure. Hypogonadism was more frequent in hypothyroid (69%) compared to euthyroid (13%) patients. Duration of symptoms, morning and midnight F, adrenocorticotropin, and UFC were inversely related to TSH, FT4, and/or T3 levels (r = -0.24 to -0.52, P < .001 to 0.02). In c2, the nocturnal surge of TSH (mIU/L) was subnormal before (day 1.00 ± 0.04 vs night 1.08 ± 0.05, P = 0.3) and normal at a mean of 8 months after cure (day 1.30 ± 0.14 vs night 2.17 ± 0.27, P = 0.01). UFC greater than or equal to 1000 μg/day was an independent adverse prognostic marker of time to thyroid hormone recovery.

Conclusions

Abnormal thyroid function, likely mediated by subnormal nocturnal TSH, is prevalent in Cushing syndrome and is reversible after cure.

### Thyroid hormone suppression therapy [^ed139a29]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression therapy is designed to lower serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels using doses of thyroid hormone in excess of what would normally be required to maintain a euthyroid state. The basis of this therapy is the knowledge that TSH is a growth factor for thyroid cancer, so that lower serum TSH levels might be associated with decreased disease activity. However, clinical studies have not documented improved outcomes with TSH suppression, except in patients with the most advanced disease. Furthermore, there are a number of negative outcomes related to aggressive thyroid hormone therapy, including osteoporosis, fracture, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a graded approach to TSH suppression is recommended by the American Thyroid Association, based on initial risk and ongoing risk assessment.

### Immunotherapy-induced endocrinopathies: assessment, management and monitoring [^166ef149]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has transformed the treatment of cancer, but frequently results in immune-mediated adverse events affecting multiple organs, amongst which endocrine adverse events are frequent. The patterns of endocrine adverse events differ between inhibitors of the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, but most frequently involve the thyroid and pituitary with insulin deficient diabetes also emerging as an important adverse event. These frequently result in long-lasting hormone deficiency requiring replacement. This review explores the mechanism of action of checkpoint inhibitors and details the expected endocrine adverse events and typical presentations. The effect of high-dose glucocorticoids therapy to treat nonendocrine adverse events is also discussed.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^8e06bb9e]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) pathophysiology in critical illness — acute and chronic changes are described: during acute illness there are changes in thyroid hormone (TH) binding and uptake and decreased T4 to T3 conversion due to endogenous circulating cortisol, cytokines, free fatty acids, and drugs acting on D1; increased T3 catabolism via D3 in peripheral tissues contributes to low circulating T3, and with prolonged illness there is central suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary axis with decreases in circulating thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4; chronic NTIS involves down‑regulation of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑thyroid axis; caloric restriction reduces leptin signaling which reduces thyrotropin‑releasing hormone (TRH) and TSH production, and animal models show increased D2 expression and activity in the mediobasal hypothalamus; a study correcting central hypothyroidism via TRH infusion suggests an important central component, and further studies on illness‑related cytokine flux effects on TH binding, transport, and activation are needed.

### A longitudinal assessment of thyroid hormone concentrations in preterm infants younger than 30 weeks' gestation during the first 2 weeks of life and their relationship to outcome [^54c9b216]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This trial examined the effects of triiodothyronine (T3) and hydrocortisone on lung disease. We present here the placebo data as this provides a natural history of thyroid hormone changes in this group of very preterm infants. We also examined the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and the outcome death and ventilator dependence at 2 weeks.

Methods

Plasma-free T3 (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), total T3, total T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured prospectively in preterm infants who were < 30 weeks' gestation during the first 14 days of life. The data were obtained from the placebo arm of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of T3 and hydrocortisone, called the THORN Trial.

Results

A total of 128 infants were recruited into the placebo group. The mean FT3 level at < 5 hours of age was 4.9 pmol/L and remained below this level. FT4 levels decreased from 15 pmol/L to 9.7 pmol/L at 7 days and then increased to 11.0 pmol/L by day 14. Total T3 and total T4 levels fell after 5 hours of age and reached a minimum on day 3. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels fell markedly from 9.2 mU/L to 1.8 mU/L at 72 hours and then increased to approximately 4 mU/L. We found that all thyroid hormones but particularly FT3 and FT4 hormones were highly significantly related to outcome. The lower the hormone levels, the worse the outcome (death or ventilator dependence at 2 weeks of age).

Conclusion

1) Thyroid hormone levels in preterm infants < 30 weeks were much lower than in term infants, 2) the postnatal surge of thyroid hormones normally seen at 24 to 48 hours of age in term infants did not occur in our group of preterm infant, and 3) low FT3 and FT4 levels are associated with higher mortality and severity of lung disease.

### Pituitary and adrenal involvement in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with recovery of their function after chemotherapy [^9b617df4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Clinical course. Hormone replacement therapy for pituitary and adrenal insufficiency, and chemotherapy for DLBCL were performed. Line graphs show the transition of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and basal levels of ACTH.

The results of endocrine function tests before and after chemotherapy are shown in Figure 4. Panels A-F show the results of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and the LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) loading test. These 3 loading tests were combined and performed at the same time. Secretion of LH, FSH, TSH, and ACTH were severely suppressed at the time of diagnosis, but dramatically improved after the completion of chemotherapy (Figure 4 A, B, D, E), and the basal ACTH level improved to the upper limit of the reference range, according to the reduction of hydrocortisone.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^4bde2cf9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L. 22 TSH levels decrease in early pregnancy because of weak stimulation of TSH receptors by human chorionic gonadotropin in the first trimester, then return to normal throughout pregnancy. Once pregnancy is confirmed, patients with existing hypothyroidism should start taking an extra dose of levothyroxine two days per week for a total of nine doses per week. 26 TSH should be evaluated in pregnant patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism, a goiter, a history of thyroid disease, TPO antibody positivity, or autoimmune disease. 26 Patients with a TSH level greater than 2. 5 mIU per L who are TPO antibody–positive have a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications, including preterm birth and pregnancy loss.

PATIENTS WITH PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS Patients on high dosages of levothyroxine with persistently elevated TSH levels may be nonadherent or have absorption issues attributed to meal timing or other medications 1, 5, 20. Some patients may experience persistent symptoms despite adequate dosing of levothyroxine to a normal TSH level; therefore, other etiologies should be considered and evaluated accordingly. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. Most adults older than 30 years with elevated TSH but normal FT 4 levels do not benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and 60% normalize within five years. 37, 42 Patients who have a TSH level greater than 10 mIU per L are at higher risk of fracture, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure compared with patients who have a TSH level of 2. 0 to
2.

5 mIU per L. 16 In nonpregnant patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, levothyroxine therapy should be considered when the TSH level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the TPO antibody level is elevated. 16, 17, 34 The benefits of treating women with subclinical hypothyroidism who are pregnant or attempting to conceive are unclear. 17.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^1d6f05fd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid levels are high during pregnancy due to an increase in estrogen in the circulation, which promotes the generation of glucocorticoid-binding globulin and increases corticosteroid hormones in the plasma. Importantly, extensive low echogenicity seen on ultrasound is also an essential and sufficient indicator for glucocorticoid use. The patient in this study as well as three reported SAT cases during pregnancy were treated with glucocorticoids, which effectively alleviated the pain of patients.

While discontinuing to take her levothyroxine replacement at the 41 th week of gestation, the patient gave birth to a healthy baby boy via caesarean section, with a weight of 3600 g and an Apgar score of 9–10. Thyroid function test 2 weeks postpartum were as follows: TSH 2.26 ulU/mL; T4 84.04 ng/mL; and, T3 1.38 ng/mL (Table 1, Fig. 1).

### Systemic illness [^06536a9d]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic illnesses are associated with alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-peripheral hormone axes, which represent part of the adaptive response to stressful events and may be influenced by type and severity of illness and/or pharmacological therapy. The pituitary gland responds to an acute stressful event with two secretory patterns: adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) levels increase, while luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyrotropin (TSH) levels may either decrease or remain unchanged, associated with a decreased activity of their target organ. In protracted critical illness, there is a uniformly reduced pulsatile secretion of ACTH, TSH, LH, PRL and GH, causing a reduction in serum levels of the respective target-hormones. These adaptations are initially protective; however, if inadequate or excessive they may be dangerous and may contribute to the high morbidity and mortality risk of these patients. There is no consensus regarding the type of approach, as well as the criteria to use to define pituitary axis function in critically ill patients. We here provide a critical approach to pituitary axis evaluation during systemic illness.

### A challenging diagnosis that eventually results in a life-threatening condition: Addison's disease and adrenal crisis [^11a3734e]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Furthermore, this case report also denotes the intricate association between thyroid disease and adrenal insufficiency. On the one hand, in the presence of another autoimmune disease, for example, hypothyroidism, there is an increased risk of adrenalitis and the diagnostic boundary for primary adrenal insufficiency should be lowered. On the other hand, an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may be a mere feature of adrenal insufficiency, predating many other signs or symptoms. Note that in these cases treatment with levothyroxine may actually precipitate an adrenal crisis. Regarding our patient, he was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a decade ago, based on a slight increase in TSH (5.6 mlU/L), while T4 and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were normal. As the patient was critically ill suffering from adrenal crisis, thyroidal laboratory results unsurprisingly indicated low T3 syndrome and are thus insignificant. Time will tell whether the patient actually suffers from hypothyroidism in addition to Addison's disease, or if levothyroxine therapy, which already has been halved, can be ceased completely as thyroid hormone status may normalise by hydrocortisone treatment.

This is only one of many cases that depicts the diagnostic struggle of Addison's disease. It is frequently mistaken for psychiatric disorders, such as depression, apathy, anxiety or even psychosis, and already in the originally described cases by Addison it is obvious that these traits often precede other symptoms. Another case, strikingly similar to our own, describes a young man lacking concern for his deteriorating health, who was appreciated to suffer from both obsessional traits and depression; later a mistaken diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was made before primary adrenal insufficiency was confirmed. Other cases presenting as anorexia nervosa can be found in the literature, which is not surprising given that vomiting along with weight loss are common manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. Even then, as always, the cardinal sign of extreme fatigue prevails and the importance of suspecting and not so readily dismissing this rare diagnosis cannot be stressed enough, before the symptoms of debility and lack of concern for their own physical state make the affected 'sink and expire' and eventually encounter a life-threatening adrenal crisis at a much too young age.

Differentiated thyroid cancer with brain metastases — Recommendation 79: Resection and/or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are the mainstays of therapy for central nervous system metastases (Conditional recommendation, Low-certainty evidence). Radioactive iodine (RAI) can be considered if central nervous system metastases concentrate RAI; if RAI is planned, SBRT and concomitant glucocorticoid therapy are recommended prior to RAI therapy to minimize the effects of a potential thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) induced increase in tumor size and RAI induced inflammatory response (Good Practice Statement). For patients with few (one to three) brain metastases, SBRT is as effective as surgery and can be repeated, and brain necrosis occurs in less than 10% of cases and is usually limited and without clinical consequences.

### Exemestane [^ae238fcd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effect on Estrogens

Multiple doses of exemestane ranging from 0.5 to 600 mg/day were administered to postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Plasma estrogen (estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate) suppression was seen starting at a 5 mg daily dose of exemestane, with a maximum suppression of at least 85% to 95% achieved at a 25 mg dose. Exemestane 25 mg daily reduced whole body aromatization (as measured by injecting radiolabeled androstenedione) by 98% in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. After a single dose of exemestane 25 mg, the maximal suppression of circulating estrogens occurred 2 to 3 days after dosing and persisted for 4 to 5 days.

Effect on Corticosteroids

In multiple-dose trials of doses up to 200 mg daily, exemestane selectivity was assessed by examining its effect on adrenal steroids. Exemestane did not affect cortisol or aldosterone secretion at baseline or in response to ACTH at any dose. Thus, no glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is necessary with exemestane treatment.

Other Endocrine Effects

Exemestane does not bind significantly to steroidal receptors, except for a slight affinity for the androgen receptor (0.28% relative to dihydrotestosterone). The binding affinity of its 17-dihydrometabolite for the androgen receptor, however, is 100 times that of the parent compound. Daily doses of exemestane up to 25 mg had no significant effect on circulating levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, or 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and were associated with small decreases in circulating levels of testosterone. Increases in testosterone and androstenedione levels have been observed at daily doses of 200 mg or more. A dose-dependent decrease in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) has been observed with daily exemestane doses of 2.5 mg or higher. Slight, nondose-dependent increases in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels have been observed even at low doses as a consequence of feedback at the pituitary level. Exemestane 25 mg daily had no significant effect on thyroid function [free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)].

### Thyroid function before, during, and after COVID-19 [^12cccfcb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to affect the global community, and as understanding of its pathophysiology deepens, so too does interest in the endocrine effects of its causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are known to have direct effects on several endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland. In patients infected with SARS-CoV, a related coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2, damage to the follicular and parafollicular cells of the thyroid was demonstrated at post-mortem. Additionally, coronaviruses have been detected in the pituitary gland post mortem, and reduced staining for thyrotropin (TSH) has been observed in the anterior pituitary gland of patients infected with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 enters cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is highly expressed in the thyroid gland. Thus, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis may be susceptible to disturbance in patients with COVID-19. Currently there is contradictory evidence surrounding the effect of COVID-19 on thyroid function. Subacute thyroiditis presenting with overt thyrotoxicosis has been reported with COVID-19. On the other hand, in a study undertaken in China of 50 patients with COVID-19, Chen et al observed a generalized reduction in TSH, total thyroxine (T4), and tri-iodothyronine (T3) more consistent with a nonthyroidal illness pattern.

Although these studies provide useful information, they do have limitations. They have included incomplete data, for example, measuring thyroid hormones only when TSH is out of range, or have failed to exclude confounding factors such as intercurrent steroid treatment. There is also limited knowledge of thyroid function in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Given these conflicting results, we undertook a large cohort observational study to understand whether thyroid gland dysfunction is a frequent feature of patients with COVID-19.

### Hypothyroidism (primary) [^7cbbcafe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is six times more common in women, affecting up to 40/10,000 each year (compared with 6/10,000 men).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for clinical (overt) hypothyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hypothyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found six systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: levothyroxine, and levothyroxine plus liothyronine.

Case 2: Thyroid dysfunction with Nivo — clinical course and management: A "62-year-old man was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma," with baseline thyroid tests "TSH = 3.64 mIU/L" and "free T4 level of 1.08 ng/dL (normal range = 0.89–1.76 ng/dL)." "Within 1 month after starting Nivo, the level of TSH was mildly suppressed (0.44 mIU/L), but after 3 months, the level of TSH was fully suppressed at < 0.01 mIU/L, with a mildly elevated level of free T4 (1.84 ng/dL)." At 4 months, values were "TSH = 0.43 mIU/L; free T4 = 1.07 ng/dL," then "his TSH level rose to the 4.64 mIU/L," and by 10 months "TSH… 6.7 mIU/L" with "free T4… 0.66 ng/dL." He "was started on levothyroxine at 25 μg daily," later "increased to 125 μg daily… to normalize the level of TSH (with a peak value of 90.2 mIU/L)." Approximately 1 year after Nivo, morning cortisol was undetectable and "The level of ACTH was low at 2.2 pg/ mL," and he "was started on HC at a replacement dose of 15 mg in the morning and 5 mg at noon." Nivo "was uninterrupted, except for 3 doses at months 5 to 6 and once again at month 11," and the figure shows evolution "from mild hyperthyroidism… to hypothyroidism, followed by secondary adrenal insufficiency."

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^a0b19423]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Painless thyroiditis — clinical course and management: The thyrotoxic phase occurs in 5%–20% of patients and typically lasts 3–4 months, the hypothyroid phase may last up to 6 months, and normal thyroid function is reestablished by 12 months in most patients, though 10%–20% have persistent hypothyroidism; recurrences are about 5%–10%, with a long-term recurrence rate of 65% reported in one Japanese study. During the thyrotoxic phase, serum TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4, and the absence of TRAb antibodies helps distinguish painless thyroiditis from GD. Patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis should be treated with β-adrenergic-blocking drugs to control symptoms, ATDs have no utility, and corticosteroids have been used rarely but should be reserved for severe cases only. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^bc868df4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is associated with the severity of prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^12dfbad4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new global pandemic that first emerged in December 2019, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to its abrupt outbreak, rapid spread, and striking mortality, COVID-19 has drawn wide attention from various countries and regions, with more than 224 million confirmed cases and more than 4.6 million deaths as of September 12, 2021. One of the reasons for this catastrophic outcome is that SARS-CoV-2 attacks the body's major organs through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a main viral entry receptor that is widely distributed in the lungs, heart, liver, and kidney, and causes damage to multiple organs. However, little attention has been paid to the damage to the endocrine system caused by this virus, and the subsequent impact on prognosis.

In a previous study on endocrine dysfunction caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were candidate targets for SARS-CoV. This study observing 61 SARS survivors found that 6.7% of patients had hypothyroidism including central hypothyroidism and primary hypothyroidism. Severe airway obstruction, hypoxemia, systemic inflammation, and glucocorticoid use may easily develop into subclinical hypothyroidism, overt hypothyroidism, and non-thyroid illness syndrome. Non-thyroid illness syndrome (NTIS) was defined as the decreased concentrations of plasma tri-iodothyronine, low thyroxine, and normal range or slightly decreased concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Non-thyroid illness syndrome (NTIS) is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) regardless of whether the disease is stable or aggravated. Several systemic inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-α, which are observed at elevated levels among patients with COPD, inhibit TSH synthesis or secretion. SARS-CoV-2 could induce reversible thyroid dysfunction, and the low T3 syndrome could be associated with the severity of COVID-19. These studies have shown that the HPT axis is altered in patients with SARS or COPD. In clinical experiences, we found that some patients with COVID-19 had suppressed thyroid function, suggesting that the HPT axis may be affected by SARS-CoV-2. However, little is known about the relationship between COVID-19 and the HPT axis.

### Approach to the patient: management of pituitary hormone replacement through transition [^2b3f570a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

A discussion about transition was started at 15.75 years, with transfer to the adolescent clinic at 16.4 years and then to the adult services. His final height was significantly impaired (153.7 cm, -3.12 SDS) (Fig. 1) with obesity (body mass index [BMI] 33.1 kg/m 2 [+2.87 SDS]) (Fig. 1). Retesting at 18.03 years with combined provocation tests (insulin-tolerance test [ITT], LHRH, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH]), after discontinuation of his testosterone, GH, and hydrocortisone treatments, demonstrated a cortisol peak of 627 nmol/L, baseline morning testosterone of 14.3 nmol/L, and adequate gonadotropin peaks (LH 15.1 and FSH 5.8 U/L). Persistent prolactin (15 mU/L, normal range 44–548), GH (peak 0.2 mU/L), and TSH (baseline free T4 [FT4] < 5.1, blunted TSH response after TRH stimulation: T0 minutes, 0.79 mU/L; T20 minutes, 1.18 mU/L; T60 minutes, 1.07 mU/L) deficiencies were in keeping with the phenotype of POU1FI mutations. He therefore remains on GH and L-thyroxine replacement.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ad544cfe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Acquired adult hypopituitarism — causes and deficiency patterns: The most common cause of central adrenal insufficiency (AI) is exogenous GCs that suppress ACTH; however, this review focuses on endogenous hypopituitarism, and the usual sequential pattern for hormonal deficiencies is the loss of GH initially, followed by gonadotropins, TSH, and ACTH, though exceptions occur. Causes include neoplastic, vascular, traumatic, treatment of sellar, parasellar, and hypothalamic diseases, infiltrative/inflammatory disease, and infectious, with examples including pituitary adenoma, Sheehan's syndrome, head injury, surgery or radiotherapy, autoimmune (lymphocytic hypophysitis), and tuberculosis.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^fc551f58]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — psychological and metabolic mechanisms: Available evidence suggests that psychogenic stimuli, both external and internal, activate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, and although the blend of psychological and metabolic factors associated with FHA may vary, the final common pathway is suppression of GnRH drive; studies have also suggested that energy imbalance sensitizes the HPO axis to psychological stress, and data indicate that women who exercise or are under dietary restriction develop FHA as an adaptive response to chronic metabolic energy deficiency, with neuroendocrine adaptations in the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis that minimize energy expenditure; there are two major hypotheses to explain the mechanism by which negative energy balance causes FHA — the metabolic fuel hypothesis and the critical body fat hypothesis — and recovery from FHA associated with CBT resulted in reduced nocturnal cortisol secretion and increased leptin and TSH without weight gain.

### Thyroid function spectrum in Cushing's syndrome [^eec04142]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Thyroid dysfunction is common in CS patients, but the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in CS patients has not been investigated in depth. Our study focused on the spectrum of thyroid function in CS patients, revealing a notable incidence of thyroid hormone alterations, including decreased levels of triiodothyronine (TT3), thyroxine (TT4), free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) below the reference values in a substantial proportion of our cohort. These findings are consistent with the known effects of glucocorticoid excess on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, which can lead to various degrees of central hypothyroidism or non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), characterized by alterations in thyroid hormone levels without overt hypothyroid symptoms.

The prevalence of thyroid hormone changes in CS patients is an area of active investigation, with implications for diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Previous studies have reported varied prevalence rates of thyroid dysfunction in CS, reflecting the heterogeneity of the studied populations, the criteria used to define thyroid abnormalities, and the severity and duration of cortisol excess. Our meta-analysis, including nine studies with a total of 528 CS patients, demonstrated a central hypothyroidism prevalence of approximately 22.7%. This aligns with findings from other cohorts and underscores the importance of systematic screening for thyroid function abnormalities in CS patients.

### Adrenal steroids in female hypothyroid neonates: unraveling an association between thyroid hormones and adrenal remodeling [^a294e5c8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

The adrenal gland undergoes substantial remodeling during the neonatal period, an essential developmental process that remains incompletely understood. With respect to control over the remodeling process and, specifically, the role of thyroid hormones (THs), no human studies have been published. The effects of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism have only been evaluated in adults, focusing on the mature adrenal. Recent studies have identified expression of the TH receptor β1 in the mouse adrenal X-zone and have demonstrated that TH administration could alter the postnatal adrenal remodeling process.

Objective

To address whether THs influence adrenal steroid profiles and adrenal remodeling during the neonatal period.

Methods

We compared the adrenal steroid profile of a naturally occurring prototype, female neonates with severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) (n = 22, upon diagnosis of CH), with that of euthyroid neonates (n = 20).

Results

Significantly higher levels of adrenal steroids (17-OH-progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, Δ4-androstenedione, and testosterone) were measured in neonates with severe CH compared with euthyroid neonates and returned to within normal range after euthyroid state had been established on l-thyroxine replacement therapy, whereas cortisol levels did not differ. TSH values in the CH group were positively correlated with circulating adrenal steroids, whereas free T4 levels were negatively correlated with circulating adrenal steroids.

Conclusions

The hormonal profile of female neonates with severe CH suggests a more active adrenal fetal zone compared with control subjects. These data indirectly associate THs with the adrenal remodeling and maturation process in humans. Based on our results, we suggest that severe hypothyroidism decelerates the involution of the adrenal fetal zone that normally occurs postnatally.

### Hypothyroidism (primary) [^36ec36b2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is six times more common in women, affecting up to 40 in 10,000 each year (compared with 6/10,000 men).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for clinical (overt) hypothyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hypothyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: levothyroxine, and levothyroxine plus liothyronine.

### Hyperthyroidism [^d08bafee]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12-18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4048bbfb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — Endocrine Society guideline conclusions recommend diagnostic testing to exclude PAI in all patients with indicative symptoms or signs, and "we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients," with the statement that "This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension." For diagnosis, "We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis," and "If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels." Etiologic evaluation advises that "Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase," and "In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought." For treatment, "We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults." Pediatric dosing guidance states, "In children, hydrocortisone (~8 mg/m^2/d) is recommended." Patient safety and long-term care are emphasized: "Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration," and "Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease."

### Approach to the patient: management of pituitary hormone replacement through transition [^4fa5e382]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Summary

This patient received a late diagnosis of GH deficiency (GHD) with growth failure presenting at age 10.5 years (GH peak after glucagon 1.2 mcg/L). TSH deficiency was documented after the start of GH treatment. An MRI of the brain showed an undescended or ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP) and pituitary stalk absence (PSA) and a normal anterior pituitary (Fig. 5A). After being treated with GH for 1 year, it was then discontinued for 6 months because of the development of left avascular hip necrosis and displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis bilaterally (Fig. 5B). A femoral osteotomy was performed because of pain. GH was then restarted at a lower dose. He was prepubertal at 13.5 years, despite normal responses to GnRH and 3 days and 3 weeks of human chorionic gonadotropin. He was commenced on testosterone replacement predominantly to alleviate psychological distress. At age 16 years, he presented with fatigue and had low cortisol concentrations; hydrocortisone replacement was started. Testosterone treatment was discontinued at the age of 16.5 years because his testicular volume had increased to 20 mL bilaterally. He was retested at the age of 17.6 years: peak GH to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was 0.3 mcg/L, cortisol was 407 nmol/L, and peak LH was 20.3 IU/L. He was not keen to restart GH. He continued hydrocortisone replacement, but this was switched to prednisolone because of erratic adherence. He requested to restart testosterone replacement because of the lack of facial hair. He transferred to adult services at age 18 years and attended clinic alone and is fully independent. His final height is 176.6 cm (+0.29 SDS) with a BMI of 24.15 kg/m 2 (-0.1 SDS) (Fig. 6). At this time, he started to question his treatments because he found it difficult to take medication regularly. This resulted in family tension with parental anxieties pertaining to adrenal insufficiency. He underwent further endocrine assessment with an ITT, which confirmed normal cortisol secretion (basal 208 nmol/L, peak 543 nmol/L) and a GH peak of 3.9 mcg/L. After a transient borderline increase in his TSH, his thyroid function also normalized off thyroxine replacement. Testosterone replacement was discontinued to assess gonadal function. Morning investigations showed testosterone 19 ng/dL, LH 4.4 IU/L, and FSH 8.8 IU/L. A first semen analysis showed no sperm; however, 6 months after the cessation of testosterone treatment, a second semen analysis showed a normal sperm count. He discontinued all hormone replacement by the age of 25 years. His BMD z score (lumbar spine) was -2.2. Weight-bearing exercise, dietary calcium, and vitamin D supplementation were encouraged. He has had his first child without the need for fertility treatment. He continues to have ongoing surveillance, given the presence of a structurally abnormal pituitary MRI.

### Effect of obesity and starvation on thyroid hormone, growth hormone, and cortisol secretion [^8abc296b]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Obesity and starvation have opposing affects on normal physiology and are associated with adaptive changes in hormone secretion. The effects of obesity and starvation on thyroid hormone, GH, and cortisol secretion are summarized in Table 1. Although hypothyroidism is associated with some weight gain, surveys of obese individuals show that less than 10% are hypothyroid. Discrepancies have been reported in some studies, but in untreated obesity, total and free T4, total and free T3, TSH levels, and the TSH response to TRH are normal. Some reports suggest an increase in total T3 and decrease in rT3 induced by overfeeding. Treatment of obesity with hypocaloric diets causes changes in thyroid function that resemble sick euthyroid syndrome. Changes consist of a decrease in total T4 and total and free T3 with a corresponding increase in rT3. untreated obesity is also associated with low GH levels; however, levels of IGF-1 are normal. GH-binding protein levels are increased and the GH response to GHRH is decreased. These changes are reversed by drastic weight reduction. Cortisol levels are abnormal in people with abdominal obesity who exhibit an increase in urinary free cortisol but exhibit normal or decreased serum cortisol and normal ACTH levels. These changes are explained by an increase in cortisol clearance. There is also an increased response to CRH. Treatment of obesity with very low calorie diets causes a decrease in serum cortisol explained by a decrease in cortisol-binding proteins. The increase in cortisol secretion seen in patients with abdominal obesity may contribute to the metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension). States of chronic starvation such as seen in anorexia nervosa are also associated with changes in thyroid hormone, GH, and cortisol secretion. There is a decrease in total and free T4 and T3, and an increase in rT3 similar to findings in sick euthyroid syndrome. The TSH response to TRH is diminished and, in severe cases, thyroid-binding protein levels are decreased. In regards to GH, there is an increase in GH secretion with a decrease in IGF-1 levels. GH responses to GHRH are increased. The [table: see text] changes in cortisol secretion in patients with anorexia nervosa resemble depression. They present with increased urinary free cortisol and serum cortisol levels but without changes in ACTH levels. In contrast to the findings observed in obesity, the ACTH response to CRH is suppressed, suggesting an increased secretion of CRH. The endocrine changes observed in obesity and starvation may complicate the diagnosis of primary endocrine diseases. The increase in cortisol secretion in obesity needs to be distinguished from Cushing's syndrome, the decrease in thyroid hormone levels in anorexia nervosa needs to be distinguished from secondary hypothyroidism, and the increase in cortisol secretion observed in anorexia nervosa requires a differential diagnosis with primary depressive disorder.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^967640df]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) frequency and causes — SH has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population; in older persons TMNG is probably the most common cause, with other etiologies including GD, solitary autonomously functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis. Other causes of a suppressed TSH with normal estimated free T4 and T3 include corticosteroid therapy, central hypothyroidism, and nonthyroidal illness. Once SH has been detected, it is important to document persistence by repeating the serum TSH at 3 or 6 months, and scintigraphic studies suggesting autonomous thyroid function would favor SH.

### Persisting neuroendocrine abnormalities and their association with physical impairment 5 years after critical illness [^baf4002a]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Critical illness is hallmarked by pronounced neuroendocrine alterations, with those within the thyroid axis, the somatotropic axis and the adrenal axis most extensively studied. The typical responses follow a biphasic pattern, distinguishing between the acute and prolonged phase of critical illness. In the acute phase (first hours to days), the anterior pituitary is actively secreting hormones, with a transient rise in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and an increase in growth hormone. An acute rise in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has been described in patients with sepsis or multiple-trauma, but such rise was not observed in heterogeneous general ICU patients. The active pituitary hormone secretion occurs in the face of altered peripheral hormone metabolism, altered target organ sensitivity, and altered hormone binding proteins. These alterations reduce the availability of most anabolic effector hormones, including triiodothyronine (T 3) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), while the availability of the catabolic stress hormone cortisol increases. When illness is prolonged beyond the first few days, the neuroendocrine axes are uniformly suppressed, with low target organ hormone levels or, in case of cortisol, insufficiently elevated or normal levels. This suppression during the prolonged phase of illness is of central/hypothalamic origin.

Whereas the neuroendocrine responses in ICU have been well documented, data after ICU discharge are scarce and mostly limited to patients who suffered from brain damage either due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) or brain surgery. Although TBI-associated neuroendocrine disturbances often resolve, persistent hypopituitarism remains present in many patients up to years after the insult, associated with poor recovery and worse long-term outcome (e.g. cognitive impairment, decreased exercise capacity, poor quality-of-life). Likewise, survivors of brain tumors show a high risk of hypopituitarism and need for hormone replacement therapy many years later. Heterogeneous prolonged critically ill adult patients showed a uniform rise in ACTH and cortisol to supra-normal levels from ICU discharge to one week later. In children, salivary cortisol levels were normal months to years after ICU admission. In the absence of other data, it remained unclear whether the neuroendocrine abnormalities that are present in general adult ICU patients recover in the long-term.

In this study of patients who were followed-up 5 years after ICU admission for heterogeneous diagnoses, we compared hormonal parameters within the thyroid axis, the somatotropic axis and the adrenal axis with those of demographically matched controls, and investigated whether any long-term neuroendocrine abnormalities in former ICU patients associate with long-term physical functional impairments.

Non-pituitary surgery — On the day of surgery, we recommend adjusting glucocorticoid (GC) doses according to the severity of illness and magnitude of the stressor. In cases of minor to moderate surgical stress, we suggest 25–75 mg hydrocortisone (HC) per 24 hours (usually for 1–2 days). In cases of major surgical stress, we suggest a 100-mg HC per iv injection followed by a continuous infusion of 200 mg HC per 24 hours (alternatively 50 mg every 6 hours iv or im).

### Withholding perioperative hydrocortisone for patients with pituitary… [^a8747f99]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Hydrocortisone supplementation protocol or no-hydrocortisone protocol. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the incidence of new-onset adrenal insufficiency during the perioperative period. The secondary outcome was the incidence of adrenal insufficiency in postoperative month 3. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. In the hydrocortisone group, compared with the mean baseline serum cortisol level, mean serum cortisol levels increased on the day of the operation ACTH levels was statistically significant in the hydrocortisone group compared with the no-hydrocortisone group, hypokalemia in the hydrocortisone group and 22 patients in the no-hydrocortisone group, and all sodium levels were restored at the 3-month follow-up. Although glucocorticoid supplementation might unmask diabetes insipidus, 38, 39 its incidences were not different between the 2 groups, concordant with other studies. 11, 17 Hydrocortisone can influence the levels of blood glucose and several electrolytes. 40 Our result confirmed that the no-hydrocortisone protocol was better to decrease the risks of postoperative hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and diabetes mellitus. However, patients should be intensively monitored for postoperative hyponatremia when the new no-hydrocortisone protocol is used.
