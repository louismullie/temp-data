## Question

Signs of valley fever

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs of valley fever. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the disease entity and incubation. Then, I should categorize the clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to severe disease. Next, I will detail the most common signs and symptoms, followed by the less common but important extrapulmonary manifestations. After that, I should consider special populations and risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list of signs and integrate diagnostic implications and caveats about misdiagnosis and testing delays.

> Let me first confirm the disease and incubation so I don't anchor incorrectly. Valley fever is coccidioidomycosis, a pulmonary fungal infection caused by inhaling Coccidioides spores, with an incubation of about 1 to 3 weeks, and it is not contagious person-to-person, which frames the exposure-risk context I need to keep in mind [^d47e9c37] [^e1bc97d8].

> I need to categorize the clinical spectrum before listing signs. Approximately 60% of infections are asymptomatic or subclinical, about 40% develop a self-limited influenza-like illness, 5% to 10% progress to chronic pulmonary disease or complications, and roughly 1% disseminate to extrapulmonary sites, with risk of dissemination higher in certain groups, so I should keep severity tiers in view as I interpret symptoms [^d47e9c37] [^466890fb] [^4cf362f1].

> Now, let me think about the most common signs in symptomatic primary pulmonary disease. Patients typically present with fatigue, cough, fever, headache, dyspnea, night sweats, myalgias, and arthralgias, and a rash on the upper body or legs occurs in a meaningful minority; importantly, these features overlap with bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, which explains frequent misdiagnosis and delays in testing and treatment [^d47e9c37] [^e1bc97d8] [^22cdced0].

> Wait, let me verify the respiratory specifics because clinicians often ask about chest findings. Cough is common and can be productive, dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain occur, and chest radiography frequently shows pulmonary infiltrates or hilar adenopathy in those imaged; however, I should note that early in disease, radiographs can be normal, so a normal chest film does not exclude valley fever when pretest probability is high [^353899fa] [^d47e9c37].

> Hold on, I should verify the rash morphology and timing. The classic erythematous maculopapular or morbilliform rash, often on the trunk and proximal extremities, typically appears a few days after systemic symptoms; it is an immune-mediated eruption rather than a primary cutaneous infection, which helps distinguish it from inoculation lesions and supports the diagnosis in the right epidemiologic context [^d47e9c37] [^e1bc97d8].

> Next, I should review extrapulmonary manifestations because missing them changes management. Dissemination can involve the skin with papules, nodules, or ulcers, the bones and joints with osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, and the meninges with chronic basilar meningitis that risks permanent neurologic sequelae; ocular disease and soft tissue abscesses also occur, and in severe disease, patients may develop sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, so I need to maintain a low threshold to evaluate for dissemination in high-risk hosts [^d47e9c37] [^66e32b79] [^fe2df82c].

> I should double-check special populations and modifiers of risk and severity. Older adults, people with immunocompromise including HIV, those with diabetes or cardiopulmonary disease, pregnant individuals especially in the second or third trimester, and persons of African or Filipino ancestry are at increased risk of severe or disseminated disease; children can be asymptomatic or have pneumonia and osteomyelitis, and occupational exposures such as construction, agriculture, and archeology elevate risk, which should shape both suspicion and counseling [^ec6cc7e9] [^4cf362f1] [^9a0f5930].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list of signs while keeping the spectrum in mind. Common signs include fatigue, cough, fever, headache, dyspnea, night sweats, myalgias, and arthralgias, with a truncal rash in a subset; less common but important clues include pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss, erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme, and persistent symptoms beyond 6 weeks suggesting chronic pulmonary disease; red flags for dissemination include persistent fever, night sweats, weight loss, focal bone pain, neurologic symptoms, or cutaneous lesions, which should prompt imaging and targeted testing [^d47e9c37] [^22cdced0] [^e1bc97d8].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the patient is outside the classic endemic zone. I need to ensure I integrate travel and occupational history because coccidioidomycosis can mimic bacterial CAP and is frequently misdiagnosed; testing is often delayed, and in some endemic regions, coccidioidomycosis accounts for a substantial fraction of CAP, so early serologic testing with enzyme immunoassay and confirmation with immunodiffusion or complement fixation, with repeat testing if early and suspicion remains high, is prudent [^22cdced0] [^80a3f5a6] [^cceb2405].

> Hold on, I should verify one more point about chronicity and follow-up. Chronic or complicated disease may persist for months to years, and in disseminated cases, particularly meningitis, prolonged or lifelong antifungal therapy is indicated; complement fixation titers can help gauge severity and treatment response, so I need to plan longitudinal monitoring when disease is moderate to severe or extrapulmonary [^d47e9c37] [^22cdced0].

Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) typically presents 1–3 weeks after exposure with **flu-like symptoms** — fever, cough, fatigue, night sweats, myalgias, and arthralgias [^d47e9c37] [^e1bc97d8]. A **maculopapular or erythematous rash** on the trunk or limbs is common, and erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme may occur [^e1bc97d8]. Respiratory symptoms include cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain; severe cases can progress to pneumonia, chronic lung disease, or dissemination to skin, bone, joints, or meninges, especially in immunocompromised or high-risk patients [^d47e9c37] [^22cdced0]. Diagnosis relies on **serology** (IgM/IgG) [^d47e9c37] and clinical correlation, as symptoms are nonspecific and often mimic bacterial or viral pneumonia [^80a3f5a6].

---

## Common signs and symptoms

Approximately 40% of infected individuals develop **symptomatic disease**, typically presenting with the following:

- **Fever**: Common, often accompanied by chills and sweats [^d47e9c37].
- **Cough**: Usually dry, but can be productive; may be accompanied by chest pain or dyspnea [^d47e9c37].
- **Fatigue and malaise**: Persistent and debilitating, often lasting weeks to months [^d47e9c37].
- **Night sweats**: Profuse sweating during sleep is a hallmark symptom [^d47e9c37].
- **Myalgias and arthralgias**: Muscle and joint pain are common, sometimes severe [^d47e9c37].
- **Rash**: Maculopapular or erythematous rash on the trunk or limbs; erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme may occur [^e1bc97d8].

---

## Respiratory manifestations

Valley fever primarily affects the lungs, and respiratory symptoms are prominent:

- **Cough**: Dry or productive, often persistent [^d47e9c37].
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath, especially with exertion [^d47e9c37].
- **Pleuritic chest pain**: Sharp pain worsened by breathing or coughing [^d47e9c37].
- **Pneumonia**: Can present as community-acquired pneumonia, often indistinguishable from bacterial pneumonia [^80a3f5a6].

---

## Extrapulmonary manifestations

In approximately 1% of cases, the infection **disseminates beyond the lungs**, causing severe disease:

- **Skin**: Papules, nodules, ulcers, or abscesses; may mimic acne or other dermatologic conditions [^fe2df82c].
- **Bone and joints**: Osteomyelitis, arthritis, or soft tissue infections [^d47e9c37].
- **Central nervous system**: Meningitis or encephalitis, which can be life-threatening [^d47e9c37].
- **Other organs**: Liver, spleen, and genitourinary involvement are less common but reported [^notfound].

---

## Severe or chronic manifestations

Certain patients are at **increased risk** for severe or chronic disease, including those who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or of African or Filipino descent [^ec6cc7e9]. Chronic pulmonary disease may present as persistent cough, dyspnea, and pulmonary nodules or cavities [^d47e9c37]. Disseminated disease can cause chronic, relapsing illness with multi-organ involvement and high morbidity [^d47e9c37].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Valley fever is often misdiagnosed due to its nonspecific symptoms. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion, exposure history, and laboratory testing, including **serologic assays** (IgM and IgG) [^d47e9c37] and, when indicated, imaging studies such as chest radiography or CT [^22cdced0].

---

Valley fever presents with **flu-like symptoms** and respiratory manifestations, with potential for severe extrapulmonary disease. Recognizing these signs and symptoms, especially in endemic areas, is crucial for timely diagnosis and management.

### Clinical overview of valley fever… [^d47e9c37]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- About 40% of cases of Valley fever develop lung infection symptoms.
- Infections are usually self-limiting but 5–10% develop complications. Disseminated disease is rare.
- Serologic tests to detect IgM and IgG antibodies are the most common diagnostics.
- Infections are usually treated with fluconazole or amphotericin B. Etiology Two species of Coccidioides cause infection: Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. Clinical differences between the two species have not been observed. Coccidioide lives in the soil in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Valley fever is considered highly endemic in southern Arizona and California's southern San Joaquin Valley. Clinical features Symptomatic persons usually present 1 to 3 weeks after exposure.

Typical symptoms include fatigue, cough, dyspnea, headache, night sweats, myalgias, and rash. Primary pulmonary disease is often self-limiting. However, approximately 5 to 10% of patients fail to recover and develop complications or chronic pulmonary disease. Disseminated disease occurs in an estimated 1% of cases. Higher rates of dissemination are observed in certain risk groups, with bones/joints, soft tissues, and meninges most commonly affected. In persons who develop progressive, chronic, or disseminated disease, symptoms may persist for months or even longer. Meningitis can lead to permanent neurologic damage. Mortality is high in HIV-infected persons with diffuse lung disease. Diagnosis Serologic tests to detect IgM and IgG antibodies are most often used to diagnose coccidioidomycosis. Immunodiffusion ID detects IgM antibodies; positive early in the course of infection.

Complement Fixation CF etects IgG antibodies and allows for assessment of disease severity. Lateral Flow Assay The Sona Coccidioides Antibody LFA is a rapid test. It detects the presence of total antibodies against Coccidioides spp.

### Severe rift valley fever may present with a characteristic clinical syndrome [^31624152]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is an emerging pathogen that is transmitted in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Egypt, and the Arabian peninsula. Outbreaks of RVF, like other diseases caused by hemorrhagic fever viruses, typically present in locations with very limited health resources, where initial diagnosis must be based only on history and physical examination. Although general signs and symptoms of human RVF have been documented, a specific clinical syndrome has not been described. In 2007, a Kenyan outbreak of RVF provided opportunity to assess acutely ill RVF patients and better delineate its presentation and clinical course. Our data reveal an identifiable clinical syndrome suggestive of severe RVF, characterized by fever, large-joint arthralgia, and gastrointestinal complaints and later followed by jaundice, right upper-quadrant pain, and delirium, often coinciding with hemorrhagic manifestations. Further characterization of a distinct RVF clinical syndrome will aid earlier detection of RVF outbreaks and should allow more rapid implementation of control.

### Coccidioidomycosis as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia [^80a3f5a6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The early manifestations of coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) are similar to those of other causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Without specific etiologic testing, the true frequency of valley fever may be underestimated by public health statistics. Therefore, we conducted a prospective observational study of adults with recent onset of a lower respiratory tract syndrome. Valley fever was serologically confirmed in 16 (29%) of 55 persons (95% confidence interval 16%–44%). Antimicrobial medications were used in 81% of persons with valley fever. Symptomatic differences at the time of enrollment had insufficient predictive value for valley fever to guide clinicians without specific laboratory tests. Thus, valley fever is a common cause of CAP after exposure in a disease-endemic region. If CAP develops in persons who travel or reside in Coccidioides -endemic regions, diagnostic evaluation should routinely include laboratory evaluation for this organism.

Introduction

Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is a fungal infection caused by the inhalation of Coccidioides species spores from soils of arid and semiarid regions in the western US, particularly Arizona and California. Although coccidioidomycosis is often asymptomatic or presents with self-limiting symptoms, nearly three-quarters of persons with coccidioidomycosis experience symptoms (eg, fatigue, pain, weakness) that limit daily activities. A small proportion (5%-10%) of people experience chronic illness, and approximately 1% develop disseminated disease. The annual economic burden resulting from direct medical costs and productivity losses is estimated to exceed $385 million in the US.

Each year, approximately 10 000 to 20 000 cases are reported through US national surveillance, doubling from 8232 cases in 2014 to 20 003 cases in 2019. However, coccidioidomycosis is only reportable in 28 states and Washington, DC, and these totals likely represent only a fraction of the true national burden of coccidioidomycosis.

Detection of coccidioidomycosis is complicated by several factors, including barriers to health care access, people who do not seek care, underdiagnosis, underreporting, and residence outside the known endemic region. People who experience mild symptoms may never seek care, making it impossible to identify them. For those who do seek care, the diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Coccidioidomycosis symptoms are nonspecific and may be indistinguishable from bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Clinician knowledge and awareness are often limited, and testing may be infrequent, especially outside the known endemic areas. The landscape of diagnostic testing can be difficult to navigate due to numerous test types (eg, antibody, antigen, culture, histopathology), logistical challenges (eg, biosafety precautions, lack of standardized serologic methods), and nuanced interpretations because test performance may vary based on factors related to the host, disease course, or specimen quality. Even when a patient is diagnosed accurately, cases are not always reported to public health authorities or may be misdiagnosed as prior disease and not active infection.

The field currently lacks the necessary data to measure the burden of coccidioidomycosis. Previously, an estimate of 150 000 total annual US asymptomatic and symptomatic Coccidioides infections was proposed; however, a robust calculation was not conducted. We endeavored to generate a systematic and rigorous estimate of national incident symptomatic coccidioidomycosis cases by developing a model to account for cases that are missed through national surveillance.

Key points
- Valley fever is a lung infection caused by breathing in spores from the fungus, Coccidioides. Coccidioideslives in soil in some areas in the southwestern U. S. and south-central Washington state.
- Usually, people who get sick with Valley fever get better on their own, but some people will need antifungal medication.
- Valley fever is often misdiagnosed, delaying treatment when needed. More Information Overview Valley fever is a lung infection caused by Coccidioides, a fungus that lives in the soil. The fungus is found in the Pacific Northwest and southwestern United States, and parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. People can get Valley fever by breathing in the spores from. Coccidioides. Some people breathe in the spores and never get sick. Valley fever causes typical lung infection symptoms like cough and fever. Certain groups of people are at increased risk for more severe illness.

While it is very rare, the infection can spread to other parts of the body. Early treatment with antifungal medications can save lives. Because Valley fever has the same symptoms as pneumonias caused by bacteria or viruses, it is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. This can lead to ineffective treatments or delays in appropriate antifungal treatment for people who need it. Pets can also become infected. Valley fever does not spread from person to person or between people and animals. Resources. Symptoms Some people who are exposed to the fungus never have symptoms. Other people may have symptoms that include:

- Fatigue
- Cough
- Fever and headache
- Shortness of breath
- Night sweats
- Muscle aches or joint pain
- Rash on upper body or legs. Severe infections Approximately 5 to 10% of people who get Valley fever will develop serious or long-term problems in their lungs.

In an even smaller percent of people, the infection spreads from the lungs to other parts of the body. This includes skin, bones, joints, or brain. Treatment Many people get better on their own within weeks or months without any treatment. However, some people need treatment to reduce symptoms or stop them from getting worse. Severe infections or infections that spread to other parts of the body require antifungal medication and may require hospitalization.

### Coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) in primary care [^22cdced0]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is caused by inhaling airborne spores of the fungus Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii. Residing in or traveling to areas endemic for Coccidioides is required for the diagnosis; no person-to-person or zoonotic contagion occurs. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis is increasing in endemic areas, and it has been identified as the cause of as many as 17% to 29% of all cases of community-acquired pneumonia in some regions. Obtaining a travel history is recommended when evaluating patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Diagnosis usually relies on enzyme immunoassay with immunodiffusion confirmation, but these tests may not be positive for one to three weeks after disease onset. Antifungal agents are not recommended for treatment unless the patient is at risk of or shows signs of complicated or disseminated infection. When antifungals are used, fluconazole and itraconazole are most commonly recommended, except during pregnancy. Treatment may continue for as long as three to 12 months, although lifetime treatment is indicated for patients with coccidioidal meningitis. Monitoring of complement fixation titers and chest radiography is recommended until patients stabilize and symptoms resolve. In patients who are treated with antifungals, complement fixation titers should be followed for at least two years.

### Unique outbreak of rift valley fever in Sudan, 2019 [^20eb1289]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We report a unique outbreak of Rift Valley fever in the Eldamar area, Sudan, May-July 2019, that resulted in 1,129 case-patients and 19 (1.7%) deaths. Patients exhibited clinical signs including fever (100%), headache (79%), and bleeding (4%). Most (98%) patients also reported death and abortions among their livestock.

### Coccidioidomycosis as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia [^00073ae4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A high proportion (81%) of persons with valley fever were prescribed an initial course of antimicrobial drugs. Of these, 12 patients, 3 of whom were diagnosed with valley fever, received 2 courses of these drugs. Although diagnosis of valley fever by serologic methods is frequently delayed by 3–5 days, use of antimicrobial drugs could still be avoided or stopped earlier in patients whose illness is determined to be caused by Coccidioides species.

The inclusion criteria used in this study were designed both to be broadly inclusive and to select patients with more severe illness. As such, they differ in some respects from commonly used entry criteria for clinical trials of new antimicrobial drugs as treatment for CAP. For example, we chose pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea at rest and fever as an entry requirement. By using these entry criteria, we found that 3 of the 12 patients with valley fever who underwent radiographic examination had normal radiographs, which is consistent with results of a previous study, but did not adhere to Infectious Diseases Society of America or American Lung Association definitions of pneumonia. When comparing our findings to those of other studies, the way in which patients were selected should be taken into account.

Several limitations of our methods deserve emphasis. Because our inclusion criteria were not standard, comparison of our results to those of other studies of CAP is difficult. Also, we did not have a diagnosis for patients without valley fever. Since this is a relatively small study, additional expanded studies may be useful, especially to extend observations to other groups such as children, the elderly, those requiring hospitalization, and residents elsewhere within disease-endemic regions. Future studies are also needed to determine best practices for management of primary coccidioidal infection and possible therapy with specific antifungal treatment. Such a high proportion of CAP caused by Coccidioides species should provide further impetus to conduct those studies.

### FDA public workshop summary-coccidioidomycosis (valley fever): considerations for development of antifungal drugs [^009a3fbd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal disease endemic to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. Prevalence rates are increasing steadily, and new endemic areas of Coccidioides are emerging. Standard treatment is often administered for months to decades, and intolerance to medications and treatment failures are common. No new treatments for coccidioidomycosis have been approved in the United States in nearly 40 years. On 5 August 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration convened experts in coccidioidomycosis from academia, industry, patient groups, and other government agencies to discuss the disease landscape and strategies to facilitate product development for treatment of coccidioidomycosis. This article summarizes the key topics concerning drug development for coccidioidomycosis presented by speakers and panelists during the workshop, such as unmet need, trial designs, endpoints, incentives, research and development support, and collaborations to facilitate antifungal drug development.

### Valley fever is an occupational illness: let's get the data to prevent It [^9a0f5930]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The location and nature of an individual's work directly influence their socioeconomic status and their risk of toxic exposures, making occupation a critical social and environmental determinant of health. Workers generally have higher exposures to chemical and physical hazards than the general population, and workplace exposures are not evenly distributed across workplaces. Work‐related disease rates also vary differ by race, ethnicity, income, and nativity, due in part to occupational segregation leading to higher exposures among marginalized groups. This is the case for Valley fever, a disease caused by inhalation of spores of the fungus Coccidioides, with symptoms including fatigue, cough, fever, headache, muscle ache and joint pain, shortness of breath, night sweats, or rash on upper body and legs. Coccidioides grows in the soil of states in the American Southwest, including California and Arizona. Spores become airborne when soil is disrupted, making outdoor workers, such as agricultural or construction workers, at higher risk of exposure and disease.

Incidence of Valley fever has been increasing in the last decade: surveillance data indicate record numbers of Valley fever cases reported statewide in California (> 12,500) and Arizona (> 15,000) in 2024, almost tripling in California and doubling in Arizona since 2015. There have been numerous documented outbreaks of Valley fever among construction crews, archeologists working at field sites, prison employees, wildland firefighters, and military personnel, and elevated incidence among agricultural workers. These outbreaks have primarily been detected through reporting by local health jurisdictions; review of doctors' first reports; and outreach from concerned patients, unions, clinicians, or other organizations, as opposed to generating reports through passive disease surveillance. Valley fever is recognized as a work‐related disease in California, where employers are required to report workers with suspected Valley fever symptoms and physicians must submit reports under Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations. However, it is not recognized as work‐related in Arizona, which reports roughly two‐thirds of all Valley fever cases in the US.

### Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) awareness-California, 2016–2017 [^3fd173c4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) is endemic in the southwestern United States and caused by inhalation of Coccidioides spp. fungal spores from soil or dust; 97% of U.S. Valley fever cases are reported from Arizona and California. In California, Valley fever incidence increased 213% from 2014 to 2018. In 2016, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) added three questions to the adult California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey to better understand whether Californians had heard of Valley fever, knew the environmental risk where they live, and knew who is at risk for severe disease. A total of 2,893 BRFSS respondents aged ≥ 18 years answered at least one Valley fever question. Using the weighted California population, 42.4% of respondents reported general awareness of Valley fever; awareness was lowest among adults aged 18–44 years (32.9%) and Hispanic persons (26.4%). In addition, despite higher percentages reporting awareness of Valley fever, only 25.0% of persons living in a high-incidence region and 3.0% of persons living in a moderate-incidence region were aware that they lived in areas where Coccidioides spp. exist. Among persons with one or more risk factors for severe disease, 50.8% reported having heard about Valley fever, but only 3.5% knew they were at increased risk for severe disease. The findings from this survey helped to inform a statewide Valley fever awareness campaign implemented during 2019–2020 and to guide outreach to persons living in high- and moderate-incidence regions in California and potentially other southwestern states or who are at risk for severe disease.

### Bone scan, PET-CT, and MRI in disseminated coccidioidomycosis [^66e32b79]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is a systemic fungal infection resulting from inhalation of the Coccidioides immitis or posadasii spores. In many cases, infection causes a self-limited community-acquired pneumonia; however, in patients with risk factors, such as immunosuppression or African or Pacific Island ancestry, significant morbidity and mortality from disseminated disease may occur. Presented here are comparative images using Tc-MDP bone scan, F-FDG PET/CT, and MRI. Each demonstrates particular strengths, which aid in assessing the extent of systemic involvement of a biopsy-proven case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis.

Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) is endemic in the southwestern United States and caused by inhalation of Coccidioides spp. fungal spores from soil or dust; 97% of U.S. Valley fever cases are reported from Arizona and California (1). In California, Valley fever incidence increased 213% from 2014 to 2018 (2). In 2016, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) added three questions to the adult California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey to better understand whether Californians had heard of Valley fever, knew the environmental risk where they live, and knew who is at risk for severe disease.

### Potential effects of rift valley fever in the United States [^405aff82]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Workshop Summary

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been the cause of disease outbreaks throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and the infection often results in heavy economic costs through loss of livestock. If RVFV, which is common to select agent lists of the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, entered the United States, either by accidental or purposeful means, the effects could be substantial. A group of subject matter experts met in December 2009 to discuss potential implications of an introduction of RVF to the United States and review current modeling capabilities. This workshop followed a similar meeting held in April 2007. This report summarizes the 2 workshop proceedings. Discussions primarily highlighted gaps in current economic and epidemiologic RVF models as well as gaps in the overall epidemiology of the virus.

### Valley fever is an occupational illness: let's get the data to prevent It [^cbbec46a]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Valley fever is a fungal disease acquired through inhalation of spores of the fungus Coccidioides. Spores become airborne when soil is disturbed, making outdoor workers, such as agricultural or construction workers, at higher risk of exposure and disease. Valley fever is endemic and increasing in the American Southwest, with numerous documented outbreaks among construction crews, archeologists, prison employees, wildland firefighters, and military personnel. Valley fever is recognized as a work-related disease in California, but not Arizona or other states with endemic disease. Epidemiologists require surveillance data with patient industry and occupation to make the case to clinicians, legislators, and employers that Valley fever is an occupational disease that can be prevented through tailored interventions. Valley fever is a reportable disease in 28 states, including California and Arizona, and Washington, D.C.; however, most case reports are sent through automated lab reports or manual case reporting, which seldom include information about industry or occupation. Electronic case reporting (eCR), in which automated disease reports are sent to public health agencies from health care facilities via electronic medical records, provides a new pathway to streamline case reporting and is more conducive to inclusion of industry and occupation data in case reports. Occupational reporting through eCR would help build the epidemiological base to identify worker populations with excess cases of Valley fever, to identify occupational clusters, facilitate early outbreak detection, provide evidence for worker compensation claims of work-related infections, and support the development of more protective legislation to train and educate workers on prevention methods.

### Unique outbreak of rift valley fever in Sudan, 2019 [^96c539a0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

Rift Valley fever cases initially appeared on May 23, 2019, in Eldamar, the capital city of River Nile state (Figure 1). This region, characterized as a desert environment, is in general rural and peri-urban; most of the population relies on farming, animal breeding, and more recently, traditional gold mining. By July 18, a total of 1,129 cases had been identified on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. The outbreak peaked in June 2019 with »96 cases reported daily (Figure 2).

Most RVF cases, 1,120 (99.2%), were from Eldamar, with only 7 cases reported in Barbar and 2 in Atbara (Table). The male:female ratio was 1.2:1. Adults 25–44 years of age were most affected (34.6%), but other age groups were similarly represented; however, only 6.1% of cases involved children < 5 years old (Table). Many of the patients (34%) worked in farming and animal product production.

INTRODUCTION

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) caused by infection with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a negative-sense enveloped RNA virus in genus Phlebovirus and the recently reclassified family Phenuiviridae. Rift Valley fever virus was first described in the early 1900s in the Rift Valley region of Kenya when it caused outbreaks in livestock. The virus has caused outbreaks both in animals and humans mainly in East Africa, but it has also been reported in Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. In 2016, Uganda reported the first outbreak of RVF since 1963, when RVFV was confirmed in samples from three humans and one goat from the southwestern district of Kabale. Rift Valley fever is a disease of public health and economic importance, affecting humans and livestock as well as international trade. It affects livestock production by reducing milk yield and causing abortions; however, most animals do not have obvious clinical symptoms. Also, most human infections do not exhibit severe clinical signs or symptoms. Documented clinical symptoms in humans include fever, headache, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and bleeding from body orifices, characteristic of severe forms of VHFs.

Table
Characteristics of case-patients during Rift Valley fever outbreak in Sudan, 2019

Among the 1,129 patients, 100% had fever, 79% (892/1,129) had headache, and only 4% (45/1,129) had clinically manifested bleeding. Almost all (98%; 1,104/1,129) patients (or their guardians, in the case of children) reported death or abortion among their domestic livestock. Of the 19 reported human deaths, 6 (32%) were children < 15 years of age and 9 (47.4%) were farmers (Table).

We retrospectively analyzed data collected by active surveillance during this epidemic to confirm that RVFV was the exclusive causative agent of this outbreak, because it is normally associated with the rainy season in Sudan. Surveillance was established by the River Nile State Ministry of Health. In our analysis, we included variables such as patient age and sex; signs and symptoms, such as fever, hemorrhagic manifestations, and headaches; where the patient lived; and if the patient had noted any death or abortion among livestock. We randomly collected 50 blood samples and tested them by reverse transcription PCR using the RealStar Rift Valley Fever Virus RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics GmbH,) in the Sudanese National Public Health Laboratory, Khartoum, Sudan. PCR testing confirmed RVFV infection in 88% (44/50) of samples.

### Coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits, Texas, USA, 2016–2021 [^553ff832]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is a fungal disease caused by soil-dwelling Coccidioides spp. which include C. immitis and C. posadasii. Coccidioidomycosis is considered a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, but only 26 US states have mandatory reporting requirements at the state level, which has led to incomplete surveillance data across the country. Since Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting began in 1998, the number of Valley fever cases has mostly increased. The steepest increase in the number of cases occurred during 2009–2011, followed by a decrease during 2012–2014; prevalence has continued to increase again since 2015. Valley fever incidence in Texas, a state where coccidioidomycosis is not reportable, is unknown, but historical and contemporary scientific evidence defines West Texas as a coccidioidomycosis-endemic area. In addition, recent climate models suggest that the coccidioidomycosis-endemic region is expanding as temperatures increase and precipitation patterns shift, which might have an indirect effect on the dynamics of this disease in the United States. Approximately 40% of Coccidioides infections are symptomatic, yet not all patients seek medical treatment. Symptoms of coccidioidomycosis include cough, fever, and shortness of breath, which might resemble other respiratory illnesses and might be clinically indistinguishable from community-acquired pneumonia. Coccidioidomycosis can result in life-threatening severe pulmonary or disseminated disease, particularly in groups at high risk, and can also result in chronic illness. Surveillance data from Arizona and California, as well as previous research, suggests that demographic factors, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and occupation, play a role in a person's risk for infection and disease complications. Testing practices vary substantially across states, but overall testing is underused, leading to delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment.

Although Texas is estimated to be within the geographic range of C. posadasii, surveillance data are limited. We assessed differences in hospital use by patients who had a coccidioidomycosis diagnosis according to demographic and geographic factors. We used data on inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient surgical and radiological procedures from Texas hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.

In addition, human behavior in response to public health agency guidance may not be easy to manage. During the West Nile virus invasion of the United States, for example, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that persons stay indoors, some took the recommendation to the extreme, while others ignored it. In general, participants advised that no control modality is likely to work well enough by itself and that combination strategies deserve analysis. The group also expressed the consensus view that vaccination can buy vital time to implement other strategies as well as protect first responders.

### Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) awareness-California, 2016–2017 [^1389e824]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The 2016–2017 California BRFSS survey indicated that fewer than half of Californians had general Valley fever awareness, and awareness was lowest among persons living in moderate-incidence regions, adults aged < 45 years, and non-White residents. In the high-incidence region, general Valley fever awareness (66.3%) was much higher than that in the moderate- and low-incidence region; suggesting that local Valley fever awareness efforts in the high-incidence region (e.g. by providers, public health, media, and support groups in Kern and neighboring counties), have produced increased awareness. Despite that, only 25% persons living in the high-incidence region, and even fewer Hispanics (11.3%) and adults aged 18–44 years (10.5%) in this region, knew that Coccidioides spp. existed in this area. In the moderate-incidence region, which included southern California, accounting for > 50% of the state's population, environmental risk awareness was even lower (< 5%) among all groups.

Among persons at increased risk for severe disease, approximately half had general Valley fever awareness but only 3.5% knew of their increased risk for severe disease. Raising Valley fever awareness in these populations at risk for severe disease is critical to increasing knowledge that could help reduce exposure to dust in areas where Coccidioides spp. exists; in addition, if persons become infected, recognizing their illness as Valley fever and seeking earlier clinical care might lead to improved outcomes.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the number of respondents was relatively small; therefore, results might not be generalizable to the entire state population. Second, analyses were based on the respondent's county of residence, which might differ from where Coccidioides spp. exposures might occur. Third, certain risk factors for severe disease could not be included because they were not available or prevalent in BRFSS, notably pregnancy and immunosuppression (e.g. treatment for cancer or human immunodeficiency virus infection). Finally, BRFSS weighting factors are based on the total California population and might not represent smaller geographic areas.

California's population is projected to increase, particularly in areas where Valley fever incidence is high or increasing. Findings in this report indicated a need to raise Valley fever awareness statewide and helped guide the California Valley fever awareness campaign with outreach to persons living in high- and moderate-incidence regions and to persons at risk for severe disease.

### Rift valley fever outbreak, Southern Mauritania, 2012 [^b502d610]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Table 1
Attack rates and lethality of human Rift Valley fever cases, by region, sex, and age, southern Mauritania, November 2012

Persons 15–44 years of age were most affected during this RVF outbreak, representing 70.7% (29/41) of confirmed cases and 68.2% (15/22) of probable cases (Table 1). Housewives and shepherds had significantly higher attack rates than did persons in other occupational categories (36.6%; p = 0.09), probably because of exposure to potentially infected mosquitoes during agricultural work or direct contact with viremic livestock, infected tissues, and aborted animals.

Analysis of signs and symptoms among patients with confirmed RFV showed that 73.2% (30/41) had mild signs and symptoms (fever, headache, arthralgia, and myalgia), whereas 26.8% (11/41) developed hemorrhagic symptoms, mainly epistaxis (6/11 [54.5%]) and hematemesis (2/11 [18.2%]). Patients with probable cases showed more severe signs of the disease, including gingival bleeding (43%), epistaxis (36%), gastrointestinal bleeding (21%), neurologic signs (14%), and petechiae (14%). Differential diagnosis also enabled the identification of 1 case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Moudjeria; 12 additional persons showed signs of past infection.

A total of 292 arthropods, including 152 mosquitoes belonging to 13 species, were collected during November at 12 sites (1 trap-night/site) (Table 2). Aedes vexans, Culex poicilipes, Culex antennatus, and Mansonia uniformis comprised 52.6% of the mosquitoes collected; these 4 species are known to be RVFV vectors in the subregion. No RVFV strains were isolated from mosquitoes, but the investigations were carried out after most breeding sites had dried up and after the start of a vector control campaign by the Mauritanian authorities, which limited the number of specimens collected.

### Regional analysis of coccidioidomycosis incidence-California, 2000–2018 [^cfa97a1a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) is an infection caused by the soil-dwelling fungus Coccidioides spp., which usually manifests as a mild self-limited respiratory illness or pneumonia but can result in severe disseminated disease and, rarely, death (1,2). In California, coccidioidomycosis incidence increased nearly 800% from 2000 (2.4 cases per 100,000 population) to 2018 (18.8) (2–4). The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reports statewide and county-level coccidioidomycosis incidence annually; however, a comprehensive regional analysis has not been conducted. Using California coccidioidomycosis surveillance data during 2000–2018, age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated, and coccidioidomycosis epidemiology was described in six regions. During 2000–2018, a total of 65,438 coccidioidomycosis cases were reported in California; median statewide annual incidence was 7.9 per 100,000 population and varied by region from 1.1 in Northern and Eastern California to 90.6 in the Southern San Joaquin Valley, with the largest increase (15-fold) occurring in the Northern San Joaquin Valley. When analyzing demographic data, which was available for > 99% of cases for sex and age and 59% of cases for race/ethnicity, median annual incidence was high among males (10.2) and Black persons (9.0) consistently across all regions; however, incidence varied among Hispanics and adults aged 40–59 years by region. Tracking these surveillance data at the regional level reinforced understanding of where and among what demographic groups coccidioidomycosis rates have been highest and revealed where rates are increasing most dramatically. The results of this analysis influenced the planning of a statewide coccidioidomycosis awareness campaign so that the messaging, including social media and TV and radio segments, focused not only on the general population in the areas with the highest rates, but also in areas where coccidioidomycosis is increasing at the fastest rates and with messaging targeted to groups at highest risk in those areas.

### Valley fever is an occupational illness: let's get the data to prevent It [^c5ae81f1]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To make the case to clinicians, legislators, and employers that Valley fever is an occupational disease that can be prevented through tailored interventions, epidemiologists need surveillance data to include patients' current or most recent job. These industry and occupation data would allow researchers to assess variations in incidence rates across occupations and to identify occupations with higher rates of infection. Valley fever is a reportable disease in 28 states, including California and Arizona, and Washington, D.C. meaning that all diagnosed cases should be reported to the local and state public health agency. However, the vast majority of case reports are sent through automated lab reports, which do not include information about industry or occupation. Some case reports are received through manual case reporting. While reportable infectious disease case forms include sections for occupational history and other exposure information, most cases reported to the state lack usable information on current or most recent job and work‐related exposures (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Process from exposure to Coccidioides spp. to case reporting for public health surveillance with or without industry and occupation data. Dashed arrow and yellow star indicate potential method of reporting cases to surveillance through automated initial case reports via electronic case reporting (eCR). Blue boxes show three reporting mechanisms for cases. Red oval indicates cases in surveillance record without occupational data, yellow oval indicates missed cases in the surveillance record, and green oval indicates reported cases with occupational data. I/O, industry and occupation data; EHR, electronic health record.

New pathways for infectious disease case reporting may be more conducive to incorporating industry and occupation data. For example, electronic case reporting (eCR), in which automated disease reports are sent to public health agencies from health care facilities via electronic medical records, has been implemented in the U.S. to facilitate initial case reports of COVID‐19 and mpox. Initial case reports are generated via eCR when certain trigger criteria, such as diagnosis codes or laboratory results, are entered into patient medical records by healthcare providers.

### Notes from the field: rift valley fever outbreak-mbarara district, Western Uganda, January-March 2023 [^20416f73]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). RVF is endemic throughout most of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and causes considerable morbidity and mortality among domestic livestock. Human infection occurs through contact with infected animals or their products or through bites from infected mosquitoes, mainly Aedes and Culex spp. Human infections are typically asymptomatic or mild, usually manifesting as acute influenza-like illnesses. Severe disease, including hemorrhagic signs, occurs in approximately 10% of cases, nearly 10%–20% of which are fatal. Because of its socioeconomic impact and epidemic potential, RVF is a priority zoonotic disease in Uganda.

On February 4, 2023, the Uganda National Public Health Emergency Operations Center was notified of a suspected viral hemorrhagic fever case in a male abattoir worker and meat roaster aged 42 years from Mbarara City, the second largest city in Uganda. The patient was evaluated at a private health facility on January 30, at which time he reported a 2-day history of influenza-like illness. He received antimalarial medication and was discharged. On February 1, because of worsening signs and symptoms (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, difficulty breathing, and abdominal, chest, muscle, and joint pain), the patient sought treatment at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH). On February 3, he experienced nosebleed, gingival hemorrhage, hematuria, and bloody stools, and voluntarily left MRRH to seek care at a second, private facility. Suspecting a viral hemorrhagic fever, clinicians isolated him, provided supportive care, and referred him back to MRRH, where he died on February 4. A postmortem blood sample tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute for any ebolavirus, marburgvirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and RVFV, was positive on February 5 for RVFV by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

### Coccidioides immitis identified in soil outside of its known range-Washington, 2013 [^dd3dee77]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis ("valley fever") is caused by inhaling spores of the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii. Most infections are subclinical. When clinical manifestations do occur (typically 1–4 weeks after exposure), they are similar to those associated with influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. Disseminated disease is rare. Residual pulmonary nodules can lead to chronic lung disease. Fluconazole or other triazoles often are used for treatment, but mild cases often resolve without specific therapy. A total of 17,802 cases were reported in the United States in 2012.

### Notes from the field: increase in coccidioidomycosis-California, 2016 [^d9c3203c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is an infectious disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides spp. spores. This soil-dwelling fungus is endemic in the southwestern United States, with most (97%) U.S. cases reported from Arizona and California. Following an incubation period of 1–3 weeks, symptomatic patients most often experience self-limited, influenza-like symptoms, but coccidioidomycosis also can lead to severe pulmonary disease and to rare cases of disseminated disease, including meningitis. Those at increased risk for severe disease include persons of African or Filipino descent, pregnant women, adults in older age groups, and persons with weakened immune systems. In 2016, a large increase in coccidioidomycosis incidence was observed in California compared with previous years. Using data reported by health care providers and laboratories via local health departments to the California Department of Public Health as of May 9, 2017, incidence rates were calculated by estimated year of illness onset as the number of confirmed coccidioidomycosis cases per 100,000 population. Estimated year of illness onset was extracted from the closest date to the time when symptoms first appeared for each patient. From 1995, when coccidioidomycosis became an individually reportable disease in California, to 2009, annual incidence rates ranged from 1.9 to 8.4 per 100,000, followed by a substantial increase to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2010 and a peak of 13.8 per 100,000 in 2011 (Figure). Annual rates decreased during 2012–2014, but increased in 2016 to 13.7 per 100,000, with 5,372 reported cases, the highest annual number of cases in California recorded to date.

 Low-incidence region = < 2 cases per 100,000 population (all other California counties).

Among 2,841 respondents to the severe Valley fever risk question, 1,272 (44.7%) had one or more risk factors for severe Valley fever based on BRFSS data (Table 3). Of those with one or more risk factors for severe Valley fever, 50.8% reported general Valley fever awareness, but only 3.5% responded that they were at increased risk for severe Valley Fever. When stratified by risk factors, which were not mutually exclusive, Black persons had both the lowest general Valley fever awareness (37.1%) and the lowest awareness of being at increased risk for severe disease (1.3%). Filipino persons and adults aged ≥ 65 years had higher general awareness of Valley fever (61.6% and 61.1%, respectively) but not for being at increased risk for severe disease (5.9% and 3.4%, respectively).

### Executive summary: 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^faca2851]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. Coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, is a systemic infection endemic to parts of the southwestern United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. Residence in and recent travel to these areas are critical elements for the accurate recognition of patients who develop this infection. In this practice guideline, we have organized our recommendations to address actionable questions concerning the entire spectrum of clinical syndromes. These can range from initial pulmonary infection, which eventually resolves whether or not antifungal therapy is administered, to a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Additional recommendations address management of coccidioidomycosis occurring for special at-risk populations. Finally, preemptive management strategies are outlined in certain at-risk populations and after unintentional laboratory exposure.

### Risk for coccidioidomycosis among hispanic farm workers, California, USA, 2018 [^4cf362f1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever or San Joaquin Valley fever) is a pulmonary and systemic infection that results from respiratory exposure to aerosolized arthroconidia spores of soil-dwelling species of Coccidioides fungi. Coccidioides fungi and coccidioidomycosis are strongly associated with the semiarid climate of the Lower Sonoran life zone of the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Most US cases occur in Arizona and California. However, the fungus and locally acquired cases have recently been reported as far north as Washington state, potentially related to changes in climate and land use patterns. In California, the species most often implicated in human infection is C. immitis, whereas in Arizona it is C. posadasii.

After an incubation period of ≈1–3 weeks, most infected persons experience few or mild symptoms, and the condition usually resolves within weeks or months, often unrecognized. Approximately 40% of infected persons experience an influenza-like illness with cough, fever, and fatigue that typically resolves without treatment. Approximately 1% of cases involve dissemination to skin, bone, meninges, and other tissues; patients with disseminated disease require long-term antifungal therapy and may die. Risk factors for disseminated disease include male sex, age > 60 years, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and African and Filipino ancestry.

Case identification is based on clinically compatible illness with confirmatory laboratory evidence or skin-test conversion. Local health departments may find it impractical to obtain clinical information and thus may identify cases solely on the basis of laboratory results. Because most cases are subclinical, public health surveillance substantially underestimates infection risk. McCotter et al. estimated that the true number of cases is ≈4–6-fold greater than that captured by public health surveillance.

### Coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits, Texas, USA, 2016–2021 [^daa04785]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Although only 96 counties make up the estimated Valley fever–endemic region within Texas, this area might continue to expand because of shifts in climate-related factors, such as increased temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns throughout the state that create a more suitable climate for Coccidioides. As the Valley fever–endemic region expands in Texas, increased surveillance by public health authorities and increased disease awareness by physicians and healthcare professionals will be critical for monitoring disease spread to susceptible populations and for addressing the health needs of the Texas population.

Although coccidioidomycosis is not a reportable disease in Texas, a substantial disease burden is likely affecting the population, as seen by the number of hospital visits for the disease across the state. In addition, we found that certain groups have higher prevalence, which creates health differences within the Texas population and might lead to worse health outcomes for those groups. Coccidioidomycosis is a serious public health concern; the disease can be difficult to prevent, diagnose, and treat. Disease awareness among local public health officials, physicians, healthcare professionals, and the public is critical to ensure persons seek care when infected and healthcare providers can correctly identify and manage the condition. We assessed exposure according to the patient's county of residence, but this method might not be a true reflection of where patients were exposed or where they might seek medical care. Therefore, healthcare providers across Texas need to be aware of coccidioidomycosis and the geographic range of Coccidioides fungi and inquire about work and travel to determine potential exposures to Coccidioides during patient intake.

Mosquitoes captured by the Agence Régionale de Santé Océan Indien were predominantly of the genus Culex. These mosquitoes were not tested for RVFV. In 100 herds of cattle and 26 herds of small ruminants, PCR detected 165 animals (141 cattle, 17 goats, and 7 sheep) positive for RVFV.

Information about clinical signs and symptoms was available for only 97 human case-patients (Table). Two case-patients had meningitis, and 1 was positive for RVFV by RT-PCR of cerebrospinal fluid. This patient had a stiff neck a week after the onset of signs and exhibited the neurologic sign of initial loss of consciousness. Twelve case-patients, including a pregnant woman in the sixth month of gestation, required hospitalization for at least 48 hours.

Doctors reported 2 severe cases. The first, with a complication of meningoencephalitis, occurred 3 weeks after the first confirmed case. This case-patient was hospitalized for gait disorder, dizziness, confusion, and rapid onset of hemiplegia; the date of symptom onset was March 18. RT-PCR performed on cerebrospinal fluid was negative. The second case-patient experienced an ocular disease 3 weeks after symptom onset. No hemorrhagic fever or deaths related to RVF have been reported since the outbreak onset.

Among livestock, the first confirmed case was reported on December 4, 2018. Clinical signs were reported by the veterinarian at the time of blood sampling. Among the 165 cases confirmed, 121 (100 cattle and 21 small ruminants) had aborted and 44 showed signs such as hyperthermia, nasal discharge, or digestive disorders.

### Notes from the field: increase in coccidioidomycosis-California, 2016 [^5eb28787]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is an infectious disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides spp. spores (1). This soil-dwelling fungus is endemic in the southwestern United States, with most (97%) U.S. cases reported from Arizona and California (1,2). Following an incubation period of 1–3 weeks, symptomatic patients most often experience self-limited, influenza-like symptoms, but coccidioidomycosis also can lead to severe pulmonary disease and to rare cases of disseminated disease, including meningitis (1). Those at increased risk for severe disease include persons of African or Filipino descent, pregnant women, adults in older age groups, and persons with weakened immune systems (1). In 2016, a large increase in coccidioidomycosis incidence was observed in California compared with previous years (3). Using data reported by health care providers and laboratories via local health departments to the California Department of Public Health as of May 9, 2017, incidence rates were calculated by estimated year of illness onset as the number of confirmed coccidioidomycosis cases per 100,000 population (3). Estimated year of illness onset was extracted from the closest date to the time when symptoms first appeared for each patient. From 1995, when coccidioidomycosis became an individually reportable disease in California, to 2009, annual incidence rates ranged from 1.9 to 8.4 per 100,000, followed by a substantial increase to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2010 and a peak of 13.8 per 100,000 in 2011 (Figure). Annual rates decreased during 2012–2014, but increased in 2016 to 13.7 per 100,000, with 5,372 reported cases, the highest annual number of cases in California recorded to date.

Of 41 patients, 36 (88%) reported having received safety training regarding Valley fever; however their descriptions of the training provided ranged widely, from comprehensive safety training that addressed how to minimize dust exposure to more limited notification (required by San Luis Obispo County, condition of the permit) about the risk for Valley fever, symptom recognition, and diagnosis. Although not specifically asked during the interview, 8 patients volunteered that when seeking care for symptoms, they had asked their health care provider to test for coccidioidomycosis.

### Coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations, California, USA, 2000–2011 [^607378d1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is a reemerging infectious disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungi spores, which reside in the soil of regions where coccidioidomycosis is endemic, including the southwestern United States. California and Arizona have the highest rates of reported coccidioidomycosis cases in the United States. In California, the pathogen is most common in the San Joaquin Valley, and compared with other Californians, residents of this region are at increased risk for infection. Although most coccidioidomycosis cases are asymptomatic, symptomatic disease will develop in ≈40% of patients and can range from self-limited influenza-like illness to disseminated disease and chronic meningitis. Symptomatic disease can require expensive and aggressive treatments, prolonged absence from work or school, multiple hospitalizations, and years of monitoring. Populations at particular risk for severe disease include African Americans, immunocompromised persons, and persons > 65 years of age.

Over the past decade, increases in the number of reported cases of coccidioidomycosis have been documented from Arizona and California (,–). In California, the rates of reported cases increased > 6-fold from 2000 to 2011 (2.4 to 14.4 cases/100,000 population, respectively). Cases among prisoners in California also increased during this time, making prisoners a population of concern. To determine the epidemiology, extent, and effect of the disease in California, we reviewed coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations in the state for 2000–2011.

### Testing for coccidioidomycosis among patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^38670a48]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is a disease caused by Coccidioides spp. dimorphic fungi that thrive in the alkaline soil of warm, arid climates. Infection may occur when conidia in disrupted soil are inhaled. Coccidioidomycosis-endemic areas include the southwestern United States, parts of Mexico, and Central and South America. In the United States, these areas include parts of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah.

The clinical manifestations of coccidioidomycosis have been well established; 1–3 weeks after a person inhales the spores, most persons with symptomatic infection will have a clinical syndrome consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Serologic testing is the most frequently used method for diagnosis of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. For most patients, serologic reactivity ends after a few months unless infection is active.

Although 95% of symptomatic pulmonary infections are self-limiting and resolve after several weeks or months without antifungal therapy, ≈5% progress to asymptomatic residua, such as pulmonary nodules or cavities. Among all recognized infections, extrapulmonary disease involving the meninges, bones and joints, skin, and soft tissues occurs in < 5%. Risk factors for severe or disseminated infection include immunosuppression, diabetes, preexisting cardiopulmonary disease, second- or third-trimester pregnancy, and African or Filipino descent.

Previous studies suggest that the true prevalence of coccicioidomycosis is substantially underestimated. One study, which used rates of skin-test conversion, estimated that clinical illness would develop in ≈30,000 persons per year in southern Arizona. Another study found that coccidioidomycosis was serologically confirmed for 29% of CAP patients in primary care clinics in Tucson, Arizona. To understand more about the unmeasured prevalence of disease, we evaluated Coccidioides spp.testing practices for ambulatory clinic patients with CAP in Maricopa County, which encompasses most of metropolitan Phoenix in Arizona, a state where coccidioidomycosis is reportable. Our objectives were to estimate the proportion of patients with CAP who were tested for coccidioidomycosis, to determine predictors of testing, and to determine the proportion of CAP patients who had coccidioidomycosis. To accomplish our objectives, we performed 3 related studies: a data analysis, a retrospective cohort study, and a case–control study.

Comparison of Clinical Characteristics between Groups

Demographic results for persons with and without valley fever are shown in Table 1. Length of exposure in the disease-endemic area was significantly shorter for patients with valley fever than for those who were seronegative (p = 0.043). The odds ratio for developing coccidioidomycosis in persons with exposure of < 10 years to a disease-endemic area compared to those with a longer exposure time was 4.11 (95% CI 1.01–16.8). No other significant demographic differences were identified between the 2 groups. Twenty, 24, and 11 participants had age ranges of < 40 years, 40–64 years, and > 65 years, respectively. The percentage of participants in each of these age groups with valley fever was 30%, 29%, and 27%, respectively.

Respiratory, systemic, and musculoskeletal symptoms are shown in Table 3. Only myalgia showed a significant difference between the 2 groups. The SF-36 survey and respiratory infection severity scale did not identify additional differences. However, the Iowa Fatigue Scale survey median productivity domain score (maximum score = 10 indicates greatest reduction) was 7 for persons with valley fever compared with 4.5 for all other persons (p = 0.008).

Table 3
Symptoms of the study sample at enrollment

The proportion of patients in whom a chest radiograph was obtained was similar between seropositive and seronegative patients (75% vs. 72%). However, for those from whom chest radiographs were obtained (n = 40), abnormalities were significantly more frequent in participants with valley fever (75% vs. 25%, p = 0.005). Radiographic abnormalities associated with coccidioidal infection included pulmonary infiltrates in 88% and hilar adenopathy in 1 participant.

Use of Antimicrobial Drugs

Of the 55 persons who were seen in the primary care setting, 46 (84%) were prescribed antimicrobial medications; 13 received 2 consecutive courses of treatment, and 1 received 3 consecutive courses of treatment. No differences were seen between the seropositive and seronegative groups in either the proportion treated with antimicrobial drugs (81% vs. 85%) or the proportion treated with multiple courses of drugs (31% vs. 26%).

### Sociocultural and economic dimensions of rift valley fever [^1778a77f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Health researchers have advocated for a cross-disciplinary approach to the study and prevention of infectious zoonotic diseases, such as Rift Valley Fever. It is believed that this approach can help bring out the social determinants and effects of the zoonotic diseases for the design of appropriate interventions and public health policy. A comprehensive literature review using a systematic search strategy was undertaken to explore the sociocultural and economic factors that influence the transmission and spread of Rift Valley Fever. Although the findings reveal a paucity of social research on Rift Valley Fever, they suggest that livestock sacrificial rituals, food preparation and consumption practices, gender roles, and inadequate resource base for public institutions are the key factors that influence the transmission. It is concluded that there is need for cross-disciplinary studies to increase the understanding of Rift Valley Fever and facilitate appropriate and timely response and mitigation measures.

### Coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits, Texas, USA, 2016–2021 [^eb29559c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits were highest in the estimated Valley fever region of Texas, but ≈33% of visits were in counties located in the non–Valley fever–endemic region, highlighting the need for increased awareness of the disease across the state. Monitoring trends in inpatient and outpatient hospital visits for coccidioidomycosis in medical discharge data and other available data streams will be critical to identify potential new areas of disease endemicity. Monitoring additional data sources for coccidioidomycosis cases in Texas can help close the surveillance gap in the state and increase understanding of disease dynamics. As the Valley fever–endemic region expands, increased surveillance and healthcare provider education and outreach concerning the disease will be needed to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Among participants, 72.6% (997) were female and 27.4% (377) were male; no sex was recorded for 21 participants. The average age among participants was 35.3 (SD 17.0, range 5–96) years, and median was 33 (interquartile range 22–46) years.

Of 1,395 volunteers tested, 39 tested RVFV positive by inhibition ELISA, of which 11 were positive for RVFV IgM and 9 for RVFV IgG (Table 1). The overall seropositivity adjusted for facility clustering was 2.8% (95% CI 1.45%–5.34%), and seropositivity differed significantly between facilities (p = 0.03) (Table 1). RVFV seropositivity was higher among groups > 10 years of age compared with those 5–9 years old (p = 0.001) but was not significantly associated with sex (p = 0.481), spending time outdoors (p = 0.263), or working in agriculture (p = 0.161). None of the 11 IgM seropositive persons tested positive by RVFV rRT-PCR; 6 had fever at clinical examination at the healthcare facility. The most frequently observed symptoms were headache, myalgia, and arthralgia, and 3 participants had conjunctivitis (Table 2). Among IgM-positive participants, 3 were tested for malaria infection, and 2 tested positive.

### Coccidioidomycosis as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia [^55093aec]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A corollary to the high frequency of coccidioidomycosis seen in this study is that persons anywhere with CAP and a history of recent travel to south-central Arizona or other regions where coccidioidomycosis is highly endemic would be expected to have a similarly high risk. For this reason, obtaining a travel history for any patient with CAP is essential for early and accurate diagnosis of this disease, as well as for other regional problems such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hantavirus pneumonia, and avian influenza. Although the Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guidelines for CAP currently recommend obtaining a complete travel history only in patients with refractory pneumonia, we recommend that the guidelines be revised to recommend obtaining a travel history at the first evaluation.

Analysis of multiple symptoms at baseline showed several characteristics associated with coccidioidal infections. Both a shorter length of exposure in a disease-endemic region and a greater frequency of radiographic abnormalities were seen in persons with valley fever compared with those without valley fever. These associations were also evident in a previous report from a university health center. Symptoms of myalgia and reduced productivity were also evident with coccidioidal infection. However, none of these associations, alone or in combination, were of a sufficient magnitude to assist clinicians in the initial diagnosis. Therefore, our findings, as in the previous study, emphasize that laboratory testing at the initial physician visit is essential to identify patients with symptoms of CAP that are caused by valley fever.

### Notes from the field: multistate coccidioidomycosis outbreak in U.S. residents returning from community service trips to baja California, Mexico-July-August 2018 [^bf700dce]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

FIGURE
Cases of coccidioidomycosis among U.S. residents returning from community service trips to Baja California, Mexico (N = 8), by date of travel and date of illness onset — Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, and New York, July–August, 2018

Valley fever is primarily acquired through inhalation of airborne dust or soil containing the spores. Approximately 40% of persons develop influenza-like symptoms 1–3 weeks after exposure. Approximately 5%‒10% of persons develop serious pulmonary problems, and an even smaller percent (1%) of persons develop disseminated disease. The disease is endemic in the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. In recent years, incidence has increased in California, which borders Baja California. Valley fever is not a mandatorily reportable disease in Mexico, and standard serological diagnostic testing is generally unavailable, limiting understanding of its epidemiology. Valley fever has been considered endemic in Tijuana but to a lesser extent than in other areas of Mexico. However, valley fever outbreaks have been reported previously among travelers involved in construction projects, including service trips to the Mexican cities of Tecate and Hermosillo.

The severity of illness and delays in accurate diagnosis observed in this outbreak underscore the importance of obtaining a travel history and considering coccidioidomycosis in persons with respiratory symptoms, with or without rash, who have returned from northern Mexico or areas of the United States where the disease is endemic. † Organizers of service or mission trips involving soil-disturbing activities in these areas should educate participants about the risk for valley fever. Potential mitigation efforts could include soil wetting, employing professionals with appropriate occupational safety training for excavation, staying upwind of digging when possible, and using at minimum CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health–approved or Food and Drug Administration–cleared N-95 respirators when performing dust-generating activities. Finally, improved early diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance capacities for valley fever could reduce misdiagnosis, improve patient outcomes, and allow for more targeted public education.

### Notes from the field: increase in coccidioidomycosis-Arizona, October 2017-March 2018 [^4aa6c257]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Beginning in October 2017, the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) noted an increase in the number of reported cases of coccidioidomycosis (Figure). According to provisional data (not finalized), the incidence in December 2017 (17.2 per 100,000 population) represented the highest monthly rate in the last 5 years, surpassing the previous peak of 14.2 cases per 100,000 population in September 2015. In total, 4,827 cases of coccidioidomycosis were reported to ADHS during October 2017–March 2018. Whereas case counts typically increase during these months, this particular period represented a 58.3% increase over the 3,050 cases reported during the same months the previous year and a 50.3% increase over the 6-month average of 3,211 cases reported during October–March for the years 2013–2017.

FIGURE
Monthly incidence of coccidioidomycosis — Arizona, April 2013–March 2018

Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) is an infectious disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides spores; approximately 40% of infected persons experience signs and symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rash. Coccidioides is endemic in soil in the southwestern United States. The majority of reported U.S. coccidioidomycosis cases occur in Arizona, and incidence is seasonal: the highest number of reported cases in Arizona typically occurs during the fall and winter months. * Because of the high number of cases in Arizona and the high predictive value of a positive laboratory result, Arizona's coccidioidomycosis case definition requires only laboratory evidence to confirm a case. Laboratory evidence can include detection of anticoccidioidal immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies; culture, histopathologic, or molecular evidence of Coccidioides spp.; or coccidioidal skin test conversion after illness onset.

### Delays in coccidioidomycosis diagnosis and relationship to healthcare utilization, Phoenix, Arizona, USA [^cceb2405]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis (also known as Valley fever) is an endemic fungal infection. In Arizona, USA, it is responsible for one quarter of all community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Although accurate diagnosis requires specific laboratory tests, such testing was only ordered in < 13% of patients with CAP in Phoenix, Arizona, raising the possibility that delays in accurate diagnosis might be extensive. We report a retrospective analysis from the coccidioidomycosis-endemic region of Phoenix to estimate diagnostic delays and healthcare utilization before and after a coccidioidal diagnosis was confirmed.

### Unexpected rift valley fever outbreak, Northern Mauritania [^c48860d2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Two weeks after the index case, additional cases in camels, abortion storms in small ruminants, and human deaths (hemorrhagic fever, icterus, and nervous symptoms) were reported on a massive scale. At the end of December 2010, a total of 63 cases among humans, including 13 deaths, had been officially reported, but the true number is probably much higher due to the remoteness of the affected area. Of 14 initial blood samples from camels, 7 had positive test results by real-time reverse transcription PCR; the virus was isolated from 4 of those positive samples in the Laboratoire National d'Elevage et de Recherches Vétérinaires, Dakar, Senegal. The first serologic results obtained by the central veterinary laboratory using a competitive ELISA (ID Screen Rift Valley Fever Competition Multispecies ELISA, ID-Vet, Montpellier, France) indicated an immunoglobulin (Ig) M/IgG prevalence of 33% in camels and 44% in small ruminants, respectively. IgM titers were as high as 45% in Adrar and even reached 54% in the eastern Inchiri area 2 weeks after the index case in the camel was observed (Table).

*Ig, immunoglobulin.
†IgM-positive samples within the IgM/IgG-positive population.
‡Includes 5 cattle samples; all had negative test results.

Serologic evidence of RVF in camels is frequently reported, yet the description of clinical signs is rare. Some authors mention subclinical or mild forms or even the capacity to carry the virus without clinical signs. In contrast, in the past, widespread abortion waves in camels were observed during RVF outbreaks in Kenya and Egypt and were associated with positive serologic test results. Furthermore, camels are suspected of playing a major role in the spread of RVF from northern Sudan to southern Egypt in 1977. It should be noted that RVF virus was previously isolated from blood samples from healthy, naturally infected camels in Egypt and Sudan and that experimental infections with RVF virus have induced no clinical signs in nonpregnant dromedaries.

### Coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits, Texas, USA, 2016–2021 [^fe5fda48]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The lack of surveillance in Texas has led to incomplete knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of coccidioidomycosis. Without surveillance, the burden of disease can only be estimated through indirect metrics. Although the number of coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits have increased over time, prevalence of visits varied year to year. Those differences might be from fluctuations in the population's health-seeking behaviors throughout Texas, such as the decline in all-cause inpatient and outpatient hospital visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in disease reporting practices and might not be reflective of a change in disease dynamics. However, the observed numbers of hospital visits are likely an underestimate of the true number of coccidioidomycosis cases in Texas because misdiagnosis by physicians, underreporting of cases, and low awareness of coccidioidomycosis might be influenced by geographic location and other patient sociodemographic factors. In addition, only 40% of infections are symptomatic and most symptoms might be indistinguishable from common respiratory illnesses; subsequently, many patients with mild cases or symptoms might not seek medical care. The prevalence of coccidioidomycosis in counties outside of the Valley fever region in Texas have been increasing each year, which highlights the need for increased clinician awareness of the disease throughout the state.

### Association of rift valley fever virus infection with miscarriage in Sudanese women: a cross-sectional study [^064416ab]. The Lancet: Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Rift Valley fever virus is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that causes infections in animals and human beings in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever lead to mass abortions in livestock, but such abortions have not been identified in human beings. Our aim was to investigate the cause of miscarriages in febrile pregnant women in an area endemic for Rift Valley fever.

Methods

Pregnant women with fever of unknown origin who attended the governmental hospital of Port Sudan, Sudan, between June 30, 2011, and Nov 17, 2012, were sampled at admission and included in this cross-sectional study. Medical records were retrieved and haematological tests were done on patient samples. Presence of viral RNA as well as antibodies against a variety of viruses were analysed. Any association of viral infections, symptoms, and laboratory parameters to pregnancy outcome was investigated using Pearson's χ² test.

Findings

Of 130 pregnant women with febrile disease, 28 were infected with Rift Valley fever virus and 31 with chikungunya virus, with typical clinical and laboratory findings for the infection in question. 15 (54%) of 28 women with an acute Rift Valley fever virus infection had miscarriages compared with 12 (12%) of 102 women negative for Rift Valley fever virus (p < 0·0001). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, haemorrhagic disease, and chikungunya virus infection, an acute Rift Valley fever virus infection was an independent predictor of having a miscarriage (odds ratio 7·4, 95% CI 2·7–20·1; p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

This study is the first to show an association between infection with Rift Valley fever virus and miscarriage in pregnant women. Further studies are warranted to investigate the possible mechanisms. Our findings have implications for implementation of preventive measures, and evidence-based information to the public in endemic countries should be strongly recommended during Rift Valley fever outbreaks.

### Wheezes and desert breezes: when asthma and valley fever collide [^f4b2159b]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate interactive effects of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis and asthma.

Methods

We identified three groups of 33 age- and sex-matched patients: Group 1 (both asthma and coccidioidomycosis), Group 2 (asthma only), and Group 3 (pulmonary coccidioidomycosis only). Predetermined end points included: rate of disseminated coccidioidomycosis, duration of symptoms and antifungal therapy, hospitalization, death, and escalation of asthma therapies.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar across groups. Group 1 patients had worsening asthma outcomes (except forced expiratory volume in 1 s) with coccidioidomycosis. They required more asthma medications (median, 2.0 vs 0.0; p < 0.001), more corticosteroids (mean [SD], 0.9 [4.2] vs 0.3 [0.6]; p < 0.001), and more healthcare visits (mean [SD], 0.2 [0.4] vs 0.1 [0.3]; p = 0.03). Groups 1 and 3 had no differences in coccidioidal end points, including rates of dissemination (1 vs 0; p > 0.99), symptom duration (mean, 15.2 vs 23.6 weeks; p = 0.24), antifungal treatment (n = 21 [63.6%] vs n = 24 [72.7%]; p = 0.60), and treatment duration (median, 26.5 vs 11 weeks; p = 0.09). Ten patients in Group 1 versus none in Group 3 required systemic corticosteroids for coccidioidomycosis (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Active pulmonary coccidioidomycosis significantly worsens asthma outcomes. Asthma (or its treatment) does not worsen coccidioidal outcomes, despite increasing the likelihood of treatment with systemic corticosteroids.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^99b59e5c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms — Acute Q fever in children is less likely to cause symptoms than in adults and may be milder, with symptomatic illness typically febrile and accompanied by headache, weakness, cough, and other nonspecific systemic symptoms; illness is frequently self-limited, though a relapsing febrile illness lasting for several months has been documented. Gastrointestinal symptoms are reported in 50%–80% of pediatric cases, and skin rash is more common than in adults with a prevalence as high as 50% among diagnosed children. Q fever pneumonia is usually moderate with mild cough; severe manifestations are rare but can include hepatitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalitis, meningitis, hemophagocytosis, lymphadenitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

### Clinical manifestations of punta toro virus species complex infections, Panama, 2009 [^89898dac]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acute febrile illness in the New World tropics has a broad differential diagnosis largely dependent on locale and seasonal outbreaks. In Central America, most febrile illnesses have historically been attributed to dengue or malaria. However, recent evidence from Panama suggests varied differential diagnoses, including hantavirus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus infection. In 2009, a dengue outbreak was reported in Panama City, Panama. The Gorgas Memorial Institute in Panama City tested dengue-negative samples from this outbreak for alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and phleboviruses and detected Punta Toro virus species complex (PTVs) in some samples. PTV (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae), a member of the sand fly fever group, was initially described in humans in 1966 after being isolated from a soldier in Panama who had fever, headache, myalgia, and leukopenia. The phylogenetics of PTV have been thoroughly characterized, but our search of the literature did not reveal reports of other PTV cases in humans.

The symptoms of sand fly–associated phlebovirus infection vary, but most infections cause a mild febrile illness characterized by retroorbital headache, weakness, back pain, and leukopenia. However, infection with 2 other phleboviruses, mosquitoborne Rift Valley fever virus and tick-associated severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, causes severe disease. Little is known regarding the signs, symptoms, and clinical course of PTV infection in humans.

During the 2009 investigation, the Gorgas Memorial Institute analyzed 4,852 samples from persons in Panama with suspected acute dengue; 1,667 (34.4%) of the samples were dengue-negative. We further analyzed 201 of these samples for phlebovirus (Technical Appendix Table 1). In brief, we extracted viral RNA from the samples and evaluated it by using Phlebovirus genus–specific reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) based on the highly conserved L (large) gene that detects Toscana, Naples, Sicilian, Aguacate, Punta Toro, and Rift Valley fever viruses. We also screened samples using panflavivirus and panalphavirus RT-PCRs.

### Coccidioidomycosis as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia [^8d0d27fa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Of the patients enrolled in our prospective study from select ambulatory care settings within the disease-endemic region, 29% were diagnosed serologically as having coccidioidomycosis. Even if one takes into account the wide 95% CI (16%–44%), this number demonstrates a high proportion of CAP caused by this infection. Furthermore, although the serologic tests used for diagnosis are highly specific for coccidioidal infection (, –), another study emphasized that in the first weeks of primary illness these tests frequently show negative results. In the current study, 1 of 13 participants not initially serologically positive had coccidioidal antibodies in a second serum sample. Twenty-seven persons serologically negative at enrollment did not return for retesting; thus, additional coccidioidal infections may have been identified in this group. Our results will likely provide an underestimate of the incidence in this group of patients, further strengthening the conclusion that valley fever is a common cause of CAP in persons exposed to Coccidiodes in a disease-endemic area.

The high frequency of valley fever as a cause of CAP found in this study is consistent with previous estimates of coccidioidomycosis as a dominant cause of CAP with exposure in disease-endemic areas. A similar estimate of 25% to 30% has been obtained retrospectively at the Southern Arizona Veterans Administration Health Care System in Tucson, Arizona. Conversely, a diagnosis of valley fever requires laboratory testing. That this practice may not be uniform among clinicians was shown in a retrospective analysis of physician-specific diagnoses at primary care clinics in Tucson, Arizona, in which the rate of diagnosing coccidioidomycosis varied between 0% and 25% among physicians within the same group practice. Similar differences might also account for the increasing case rate associated with patient age that was reported in a recent analysis of 2001 Arizona state statistics. Case rates for persons > 44 years of age were nearly twice those for persons 21–44 years of age. In our study in which all persons were uniformly evaluated for valley fever, all age groups had similar rates (27.3%–30.0%). Furthermore, although not detailed in our results, severity of illness in terms of respiratory symptoms was less in elderly subjects. We interpret the differences between the state statistics and those of our study as indicating that older persons who develop an illness are more likely to have an exact diagnosis determined, underscoring underreporting of illness in some patient groups such as young adults.

### Novel orthobunyavirus in cattle, Europe, 2011 [^a068619e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

In summer and autumn 2011, farmers and veterinarians in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and in the Netherlands reported to the animal health services, local diagnostic laboratories, and national research institutes an unidentified disease in dairy cattle with a short period of clear clinical signs, including fever, decreased milk production, and diarrhea. All classical endemic and emerging viruses, such as pestiviruses, bovine herpesvirus type 1, foot-and-mouth disease virus, bluetongue virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and bovine ephemeral fever virus, could be excluded as the causative agent. To identify the cause of the disease, we analyzed blood samples from affected cattle.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^ec6cc7e9]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of coccidioidomycosis in children and immunocompromised hosts include a spectrum from mild, flu-like illness to severe focal or disseminated disease such as pneumonia, bone and joint infection, and meningitis, and Sixty percent of infected children are asymptomatic. Immunocompromised individuals and previously healthy Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Filipino people, as well as pregnant women infected during the second or third trimester or the immediate postpartum period, are at increased risk of dissemination. In adults with HIV, the severity of disease is proportional to the degree of immunosuppression, and severe forms such as diffuse pulmonary infection and extrathoracic dissemination have been associated with low CD4 counts, increased HIV viral load, and a lower likelihood of having received ART. Additional features include focal pneumonitis in mild to moderately immunocompromised patients; pleural inflammation resulting in effusion, empyema, and/or pneumothorax; bone and joint involvement that are rare in people with HIV; and diffuse reticulonodular disease in an immunocompromised child that may radiographically resemble Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Coinfections may occur (e.g., blastomycosis, toxoplasmosis, and COVID-19), and Valley Fever can mimic pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis with coinfection possible in endemic areas. In a retrospective, observational study of 33 children with coccidioidomycosis at a children's hospital in central California, 28 (85%) had pneumonia and 5 (15%) had osteomyelitis, with median age, 6 years.

### Disseminated cutaneous coccidioidomycosis masquerading as acne keloidalis nuchae [^fe2df82c]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever or desert rheumatism, is a fungal infection endemic to the dry, arid environments of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. Infection is most often the result of inhalation of airborne arthroconidia from the environment. In healthy individuals who become infected with coccidioidomycosis, 60% of cases are asymptomatic. Approximately 40% of cases will experience a mild to moderate but self-resolving flu-like infection. Of those with symptomatic infection, extrapulmonary dissemination is rare, and most often occurs in the setting of immunosuppression, pregnancy, and in certain racial/ethnic groups. In a retrospective analysis by Adam et al, the skin was the most common site of dissemination. Cutaneous manifestations of Coccidioides infection occur through the following 3 mechanisms: reactive eruptions, primary inoculation, and hematogenous dissemination. Extrathoracic reactive skin eruptions are noninfectious immune-mediated reactions to the primary pulmonary infection. Primary cutaneous infection is exceedingly rare and results from direct inoculation of organisms from cutaneous trauma. The diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous coccidioidomycosis can be challenging given the morphologic heterogeneity. Cutaneous lesions are nonspecific and have been described to masquerade as several distinct infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic skin conditions. Here, we present an unusual case of disseminated cutaneous coccidioidomycosis mimicking acne keloidalis nuchae.

### Notes from the field: multistate coccidioidomycosis outbreak in U.S. residents returning from community service trips to baja California, Mexico-July-August 2018 [^0e7bfc93]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

On August 8, 2018, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene notified CDC about two high school students hospitalized for pneumonia of unknown etiology who had recently returned from community service trips constructing houses near Tijuana in Baja California, Mexico. Patients had developed fever 9 and 11 days after travel, followed by rash and lower respiratory symptoms. Symptoms did not improve with multiple courses of antibacterial medications, and the patients subsequently received diagnoses of coccidioidomycosis, a fungal disease commonly known as valley fever.

Given the occurrence of severe illness in two young and previously healthy persons, additional case finding was conducted through outreach to the school group and an organization that coordinates service trips, as well as through Epi-X* notices. By October 15, 2018, eight cases of clinically diagnosed valley fever had been reported in four states (Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, and New York) in persons who traveled on multiple service trips during June–July 2018 (Figure). Four patients were hospitalized, including one who required intensive care, one who required chest tube placement for pleural effusion, and one who was hospitalized for > 10 days. All patients were male, five were high school students, and three were adults. Patients were part of seven separate trips organized by churches, high schools, or community groups. These trips were coordinated by two separate organizations and involved an estimated 225 travelers from six states (including, in addition to the four states with identified cases, Missouri and Washington). Seven patients had performed excavation or construction on a single house south of Tijuana, suggesting this site was the likely source of exposure for most patients. State and local health departments notified all travelers about their risk for valley fever. In addition, through binational communication mechanisms, local, state, and federal authorities in Mexico were also alerted to the outbreak. No additional cases associated with this outbreak were detected in Mexico.

### Coccidioidomycosis among persons attending the world championship of model airplane flying – kern county, California, October 2001 [^998d9411]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2001). Low credibility.

On December 4, 2001, CDC was notified by the United Kingdom (UK) Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) of a UK resident aged 72 years who had culture-confirmed coccidioidomycosis (i.e. Valley fever) diagnosed in early December. During October 8–12, the patient had attended the world championship of model airplane flying in Lost Hills, California, located in Kern County in the Central Valley of California, an area where coccidioidomycosis is highly endemic (Figure 1). The patient had influenza-like symptoms on approximately October 25, 1 week after returning from Lost Hills. CDC, in collaboration with UK PHLS and the California Department of Health Services, is conducting an investigation.

### Lassa fever: epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management and prevention [^4b70e897]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Lassa fever outbreaks West Africa have caused up to 10,000 deaths annually. Primary infection occurs from contact with Lassa virus-infected rodents and exposure to their excreta, blood, or meat. Incubation takes 2 to 21 days. Symptoms are difficult to distinguish from malaria, typhoid, dengue, yellow fever, and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic, to mild, to severe fulminant disease. Ribavirin can improve outcomes. Overall mortality is between 1% and 15%. Lassa fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis with travel to West Africa. There is an urgent need for rapid field-friendly diagnostics and preventive vaccine.

### Non-malarial febrile illness: a systematic review of published aetiological studies and case reports from Africa, 1980–2015 [^a6b342d9]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The availability of reliable point-of-care tests for malaria has heralded a paradigm shift in the management of febrile illnesses away from presumptive antimalarial therapy. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, health care providers are more likely to prescribe empirical antimicrobials to those who test negative for malaria. To improve management and guide further test development, better understanding is needed of the true causative agents and their geographic variability.

Methods

A systematic review of published literature was undertaken to characterise the spectrum of pathogens causing non-malaria febrile illness in Africa (1980–2015). Literature searches were conducted in English and French languages in six databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health (CABI), WHO Global Health Library, PASCAL, and Bulletin de la Société Française de Parasitologie (BDSP). Selection criteria included reporting on an infection or infections with a confirmed diagnosis, defined as pathogens detected in or cultured from samples from normally sterile sites, or serological evidence of current or past infection. A number of published articles (rather than incidence or prevalence) reporting a given pathogen were presented.

Results

A total of 16,523 records from 48 African countries were screened, of which 1065 (6.4%) met selection criteria. Bacterial infections were reported in 564 (53.0%) records, viral infections in 374 (35.1%), parasitic infections in 47 (4.4%), fungal infections in nine (0.8%), and 71 (6.7%) publications reported more than one pathogen group. Age range of the study population was not specified in 233 (21.9%) publications. Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), non-typhoidal Salmonella (17.3%), and Escherichia coli (15.4%) were the commonly reported bacterial infections whereas Rift Valley fever virus (7.4%), yellow fever virus (7.0%), and Ebola virus (6.7%) were the most commonly reported viral infections. Dengue virus infection, previously not thought to be widespread in Africa, was reported in 54 (5.1%) of articles.

Conclusions

This review summarises the published reports of non-malaria pathogens that may cause febrile illness in Africa. As the threat of antimicrobial resistance looms, knowledge of the distribution of infectious agents causing fever should facilitate priority setting in the development of new diagnostic tools and improved antimicrobial stewardship.

### Development of mobile laboratory for viral hemorrhagic fever detection in Africa [^f59033d9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Rift Valley Fever Outbreak 2010, Mauritania

As part of a collaboration between the National Hospital of Nouakchott and the IPD, sera from camels and human cases developing hemorrhagic signs were received between November and December 2010. Rift Valley fever virus was detected in 6 of 7 human and 3 of 5 camel samples by qRT-PCR. After a request from health authorities, a mission was conducted in Mauritania by the IPD from December 8 to 18, 2010 using ML1. A total of 80 samples were collected by the surveillance and investigation teams in Atar, Aoujeft, Akjoujt, Chingetti, Kobeni, and Tintane Moughatas, and qRT-PCR scored 22 of 80 (27.5%) sera and 4 of 85 (4.7%) mosquito pools (2736 mosquitoes) RVFV positive.

At the IPD, 13 sera (59.1%) were positive in IgM-ELISA, and virus was isolated from 6 sera (27.2%) by mouse brain inoculation and mosquito cell culture. Virus was isolated from all 4 RVFV-positive mosquito batches. Phylogenetic analysis of partial L-, S-, and M-segment sequences showed that the strains responsible for the outbreak of RVF re-emerged from a local RVFV focus, showing the need for continuous surveillance.

### Tickborne relapsing fever, bitterroot valley, Montana, USA [^e14c8d3a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study reports an autochthonous human case of tickborne relapsing fever caused by B. hermsii in the Bitterroot Valley of western Montana. The patient had many of the typical clinical signs and symptoms of this infection, with the notable exception of a unilateral uveitis that resulted in permanent damage to the right eye for which a corrective lens was required. Various forms of uveitis have been described with other spirochetal diseases, including Lyme disease, syphilis, and leptospirosis. Ocular complications, including uveitis, have been reported for cases of relapsing fever caused by other species of spirochetes, such as in troops in Libya during World War II. Iritis (anterior uveitis) has been associated with a few cases of relapsing fever in the southwestern United States, which were probably caused by B. turicatae. However, specific ocular involvement resulting from an infection with B. hermsii is rare.

Horton and Blaser described endophthalmitis in a 3-month-old infant who contracted relapsing fever in a mountain cabin in Colorado. Although no spirochetes were isolated or identified, the ecologic and geographic setting suggests that the patient was infected with B. hermsii. The only case of uveitis purported to be caused by B. hermsii was in a 12-year-old boy exposed in eastern Oregon. Although no spirochetes were observed or identified in this patient, the clinical course and cross-reactive serologic test result for B. burgdorferi, a cause of Lyme disease, led the authors to conclude that the patient had been infected with B. hermsii. From the patient with uveitis in our study, we isolated the spirochete and confirmed its identity as B. hermsii by performing extensive molecular characterization. We are unaware that this etiologic confirmation was made for any case of relapsing fever with uveitis, regardless of the species of spirochete involved.

### Coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits, Texas, USA, 2016–2021 [^653b2df6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Hospital encounters where the principal recorded diagnosis was coccidioidomycosis-related differed substantially between inpatient and outpatient visits, which might have been partly because of different diagnostic practices or medical coding differences for inpatient versus outpatient facilities. However, patients seeking inpatient care tended to have principal diagnosis codes for conditions related to severe coccidioidomycosis, whereas patients seeking outpatient care had principal diagnostic codes related to mild coccidioidal syndromic symptoms. Therefore, principal diagnostic codes for inpatient and outpatient settings might have reflected differences in disease severity between the 2 patient populations.

National surveillance data for coccidioidomycosis include only the 26 mandatory reporting states, and most cases are from Arizona and California, where coccidioidomycosis has increased since 2000. National data from CDC only include data during 1998–2019 and show that case counts have fluctuated through the years. Additional data from California indicate that case counts decreased from 9,000 in 2019 to 7,000–8,000 during 2020–2022. In Arizona, new cases increased from 10,358 cases in 2019 to > 11,400 cases each in both 2020 and 2021 but then declined to 9,515 cases in 2022. Compared with national trends in new cases, Texas displays similar oscillating patterns in hospital visits related to coccidioidomycosis. We found a significant association between coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits and patient sex or race/ethnicity (p < 0.01). Consistent with national surveillance data and previous research, most coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits in Texas were by male patients who had a higher coccidioidomycosis prevalence than female patients. In Texas, coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visit counts were highest among Hispanic persons, which might reflect the proportion of Hispanic persons residing in the Valley fever–endemic region. According to data from the Texas Demographic Center's population projections, the percentage of Hispanic persons within the Valley fever–endemic region is ≈68% versus 30% within the nonendemic region. The increased percentage of Hispanic persons in the Valley fever–endemic region likely contributes to the higher coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visit counts in this group overall. Those findings differ from national surveillance data and previous research that show the number of cases is highest in non-Hispanic White persons but varies between states. Prevalence of coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits was highest in non-Hispanic Black persons compared with other race/ethnicity groups, which aligns with previous research that suggests non-Hispanic Black persons are at increased risk for infection and severe disease.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^be894e80]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever — surveillance and reporting expectations for clinicians and public health: Q fever is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, and health-care providers should report suspected or confirmed cases through local or state reporting mechanisms in place for notifiable disease conditions. The most recent human case definition, revised in 2009, provides separate reporting categories for acute and chronic Q fever, and the CDC case definition is used for national reporting as a public health surveillance tool and is not intended for clinical diagnosis. When health-care providers identify a potential case of acute or chronic Q fever, they should notify the local or state health department, which can assist with obtaining appropriate diagnostic testing. When reporting cases, clinical signs and symptoms should be included, as well as laboratory results, and CDC compiles reports including diagnosis, date of onset, and basic demographic and geographic data. Although Q fever is a zoonotic disease, infection in animals is not considered reportable to national agricultural authorities; many states consider it reportable when diagnosed in animals, and veterinary health authorities should follow state-specific reporting guidelines.

### Macroarray assay for differential diagnosis of meningoencephalitis in Southern Africa [^19838641]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Many cases of acute febrile illness with nervous manifestations go undiagnosed, partly because the potential pathogens are not investigated routinely.

Objective

To develop a multiplex PCR-based macroarray for detection of 29 pathogens associated with febrile disease, aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis in southern Africa, including common viruses, bacteria, parasites and selected arboviruses.

Study Design

Pathogens were identified by hybridization of PCR amplicons to probes on a macroarray chip, followed by colorimetric detection.

Results

Positive control specimens for all 29 targets were detected with high sensitivity. Twenty-seven clinical samples previously found positive for various etiologies of febrile disease and meningoencephalitis, including less common infections such as Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, West Nile and rabies were all identified. Testing of a blinded panel of 16 specimens in triplicate demonstrated high repeatability. Screening of 138 specimens from patients with febrile and/or neurological signs that could not be solved in routine investigations yielded 5 additional diagnoses.

Conclusion

A highly sensitive, specific and easily interpreted test was developed to detect 29 pathogens associated with febrile and nervous disease.

### Host genetic variation in susceptibility to punta toro virus [^ef075920]. Virus Research (2011). Low credibility.

Infection of small laboratory animals by Punta Toro virus (PTV), family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, is a model for the study of the human pathogen Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). We have identified inbred mouse strains with significant differences in host response to the Adames strain of PTV. Nine inbred strains of mice representing major branches in the Mus musculus phylogeny were inoculated subcutaneously with a high dose of PTV in survival experiments. Two inbred strains of mice, NZW/LacJ and 129S1/SvImJ, died ~4 days after PTV infection, whereas 7 other strains survived the challenge and showed no clinical signs of disease. Histologically, 129S1/SvImJ mice showed massive hepatocellular necrosis and had additional lesions in lung, brain, and spleen, whereas NZW/LacJ mice had mild piecemeal hepatocellular necrosis. PTV viral loads in the livers of infected mice were determined by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. Inbred mice from strains that showed clinical signs and succumbed to PTV infection had higher liver viral loads than did mice of resistant strains. Hybrid F₁ mice were generated by crossing susceptible 129S1 and resistant FVB/N mice and tested for susceptibility. The hybrid F₁ mice showed significantly higher viral loads in the liver than the resistant parental FVB/N mice, suggesting that susceptibility is dominant. These findings will enable an unbiased genetic approach to identify host genes mediating susceptibility to PTV.

### Coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits, Texas, USA, 2016–2021 [^e521ca2d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 3,276 hospital visits representing all inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient surgical and radiologic procedures, and ambulatory surgery center visits for coccidioidomycosis among Texas residents, the percentages of visits were highest among patients who were 46–64 years of age (40.8%), male (56.3%), and Hispanic (47.5%) (Table 2). In 2021, a total of 709 coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits occurred in Texas (Table 2). Although the 96-county Valley fever region in Texas only accounts for ≈24.0% of the state's population, those counties had 63.4% of coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits (Table 2). Inpatient hospital encounters constituted the largest (56.7%) percentage of coccidioidomycosis-related visits (Table 3). The percentage of hospital visits where coccidioidomycosis was the principal diagnosis was only 33.5% (Table 3). When stratified by visit type, only 19.8% of hospital visits that coded as inpatient resulted in a principal coccidioidomycosis diagnosis compared with 51.6% of hospital visits coded as outpatient (Table 3). For inpatient hospital visits where coccidioidomycosis was not the principal diagnosis, many of the diagnosis codes were related to symptoms of severe coccidioidomycosis infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. When assessing the principal diagnosis codes for outpatient hospital visits where coccidioidomycosis was not the primary diagnosis, most were related to abnormal diagnostic findings in the lungs or to mild symptoms, such as cough, throat pain, headaches, and abnormal breathing.

### Development of a rapid lateral flow assay for detection of anti-coccidioidal antibodies [^47d3891a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Coccidioides spp. are dimorphic fungi that are capable of infecting human and non-human mammals and can cause diverse manifestations of coccidioidomycosis or Valley fever (VF). In combination with clinical symptoms and radiographic findings, antibody-based diagnostic tests are often used to diagnose and monitor patients with VF. Chitinase 1 (CTS1) has previously been identified as the seroreactive antigen used in these diagnostic assays to detect anticoccidial IgG. Here, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect IgG to CTS1 demonstrated 165 of 178 (92.7%) patients with a positive result by immunodiffusion (ID) and/or complement fixation (CF) had antibodies to the single antigen CTS1. We then developed a rapid antibody lateral flow assay (LFA) to detect anti-CTS1 antibodies. Out of 143 samples tested, the LFA showed 92.9% positive percent agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 84.3%-96.9%] and 97.7% negative percent agreement (95% CI, 87.9%-99.6%) with ID and CF assays. Serum or plasma from canines, macaques, and dolphins was also tested by the CTS1 LFA. Test line densities of the CTS1 LFA correlated in a linear manner with the reported CF and ID titers for human and non-human samples, respectively. This 10-min point-of-care test for the rapid detection of anti-coccidioidal antibodies could help to inform healthcare providers in real-time, potentially improving the efficiency of healthcare delivery.

The employer responded promptly to the initial identification of one illness among cast and crew by sending the original letter to employees, encouraging anyone with symptoms to seek medical evaluation. After interviewing the employer's environmental health and safety manager and discussing future prevention practices, CDPH provided a "Preventing Work-Related Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever)" fact sheet to the employer for integration into their Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP). The site owner informed LACDPH and CDPH that they had already halted digging and excavation at the site. After consultation with CDPH, he stated they would no longer allow soil-disruptive work at the site and would advise future film crews of the potential risk for Coccidioides exposure onsite. CDPH also advised the site owner to consult the local air pollution control district for assistance in mitigating offsite dust.

### Coccidioidomycosis cases at a regional referral center, west Texas, USA, 2013–2019 [^a206e9f3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii are soil-dwelling fungi that cause the disease coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever. Since coccidiomycosis was first recorded in 1892, the disease has become a public health concern in the United States, and several thousand cases are reported annually. Severe cases may involve complicated pneumonia, musculoskeletal disease, and meningitis. Coccidioides arthroconidia, which reside in the soil in dry, arid climates, are endemic in the western United States, as well as in Central and South America. In West Texas, a 30-county region in western Texas, the arid climate and prevalence of at-risk occupations in oil, construction, and agricultural enterprises provide conditions for contracting the infection. However, epidemiologic and serologic studies about coccidioidomycosis in Texas are limited, and few provide data on patient risk factors, such as occupation and contributing conditions, in part because coccidioidomycosis is not a reportable disease in the state. We retrospectively examined demographics and risk factors related to coccidioidomycosis case-patients seeking treatment at a regional referral center in West Texas.

Rickettsial diseases — clinical presentation and treatment urgency emphasize that symptoms of rickettsial infections are non-specific and can be difficult to diagnose; although a "rickettsial triad" of fever, headache, and rash is classically described, this triad is not a reliable means of diagnosis. Symptoms common to many rickettsial diseases include fever, headache, malaise, rash, nausea, or vomiting, which typically occur within 1 week of infection, and many rickettsioses are accompanied by a maculopapular, vesicular, or petechial rash or sometimes a dark necrotic lesion known as an eschar at the site of the tick or mite bite. Although most rickettsial diseases are mild to moderate, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scrub typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever, murine typhus, and epidemic typhus can be life-threatening, particularly if administration of appropriate antibiotics is delayed; prompt treatment with tetracycline-class antibiotics (most commonly doxycycline) is essential, and early treatment saves lives and prevents long-term sequelae. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most severe spotted fever rickettsiosis, with initial symptoms including fever, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain that can rapidly progress to septic shock and even death; a maculopapular or petechial rash is commonly reported but may not occur until late in the illness course, eschars are rarely seen, and case fatality rates of 20%–40% are seen among patients for whom antibiotic treatment is delayed.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to include polyarthralgia as a major manifestation only in moderate- or high-incidence populations and only after careful consideration and exclusion of other causes of arthralgia, such as autoimmune, viral, or reactive arthropathies.

Undifferentiated fever after travel — Undifferentiated fever is a term usually referring to fever without localizing symptoms or signs, or with symptoms and signs which are non-specific or relatively mild, and the classic fever patterns associated with specific infections often do not present until later in the illness and therefore cannot be used to guide management of the acutely febrile patient. The alternate-day fever seen in vivax or ovale malaria typically do not occur before the second week, and relative bradycardia is often not seen in the acute phase of enteric fever. The differential includes common cosmopolitan etiologies such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis, while malaria, dengue, and enteric fever comprise nearly three-quarters of identified etiologies in several case series; the prevalence of the most common causes of fever in returning travelers varies with the regions of exposure, and current knowledge of ongoing outbreaks in destination countries is essential.

### Chikungunya fever in traveler from Angola to Japan, 2016 [^070abd81]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Simultaneous circulation of multiple arboviruses has been observed several times in many parts of the world. In 1970, Angola reported an outbreak of a dengue-like syndrome, which turned out to be a concurrent outbreak of yellow fever and chikungunya fever. On April 13, 2016, the World Health Organization declared a yellow fever outbreak in Angola. In response to the outbreak, a nationwide yellow fever vaccination campaign was initiated. As of July 29, 2016, a total of 3,818 confirmed and suspected cases were reported. In addition, on July 23, 2016, the World Health Organization was notified of a Rift Valley fever case in a man from China working in Luanda, the capital city of Angola, and started an investigation in Angola. We describe a case of chikungunya fever in a traveler from Angola to Japan.

In May 2016, a 21-year-old woman traveled to Tokyo, Japan, from her home in Luanda. She began to exhibit a high fever on the first day of her visit. On the second day, she sought care at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (Tokyo). She had been previously healthy and had not traveled out of Luanda in the past 6 months. She claimed to have been vaccinated according to the national immunization plan, which included vaccination against yellow fever. At the first visit, she had high-grade fever (40.7°C) without other signs. Her vital signs were otherwise stable, and physical examination revealed no abnormality. Complete blood count and biochemistry tests revealed only a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level (1.55 mg/dL). Results of rapid diagnostic testing for malaria and dengue, 3 consecutive thin blood smears, HIV screening, and blood culture for bacteria were all negative.

### Diagnostic criteria of familial mediterranean fever [^42310c30]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most prevalent monogenic autoinflammatory disease, mainly affecting ethnic groups living at Mediterranean basin. FMF is characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of fever and serositis. The diagnosis is difficult in the presence of atypical signs, which may result in significant delay in initiating treatment. As autoinflammatory diseases may have overlapping symptoms, strict diagnostic criteria are essential. Since the discovery that mutations in the gene MEFV underlie FMF, molecular genetic testing has been used as a diagnostic adjunct, especially in atypical cases. However, despite progress in the understanding of FMF disease mechanisms during the past 15 years; the diagnosis is still based on clinical criteria. Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed and used. Existing diagnostic criteria should be modified to include genetic data, and need to be more widely validated.

### Domestic ducks and H5N1 influenza epidemic, Thailand [^826c267f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Backyard Ducks

Of the backyard poultry, chickens were the most frequently infected; 56% of the chicken flocks tested were positive for H5N1 influenza. Ducks were the second most frequently infected; 27% of backyard duck flocks were positive for H5N1. During the second wave of H5N1 infection of poultry and humans in Thailand (August–November 2004), 47% of backyard duck flocks were H5N1 positive. During this time, scientists realized that most ducks infected with H5N1 were asymptomatic.

Pathologic Features

As previously mentioned, our laboratory received 450 sick, moribund, or dead ducks, which were studied for pathologic features of H5N1 infection. These birds had been raised in the open house system or were from backyard flocks. They exhibited signs of disease such as high fever, dyspnea, depression, and diarrhea, and nervous signs such as ataxia, incoordination, and convulsions (Figure 3A). Most had ocular and nasal discharge accompanied by conjunctivitis; 20%–100% of the birds in each flock from which these ducks originated were dead. All cloacal and tracheal swabs and tissue samples were positive for H5N1 by HI and RT-PCR (results not shown).
