## Question

What are my options for doing an oral drug challenge to Ceftin to rule out an allergy if I don't have any access to Ceftin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about options for performing an oral drug challenge to rule out cefuroxime (Ceftin) allergy when cefuroxime is not available. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratifying the index reaction to decide whether a direct oral challenge is appropriate. Then, I should verify the role of R1 side-chain similarity in cross-reactivity and select a surrogate cephalosporin with a dissimilar side chain. Next, I will review the safety and efficacy of direct oral challenge strategies and outline a practical protocol. Finally, I should consider alternatives if a challenge is contraindicated and summarize documentation and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the risk category of the reported cefuroxime reaction, because this determines whether a direct oral challenge is safe and appropriate. Low-risk histories include isolated urticaria or angioedema more than 5 years ago, a self-limited cutaneous rash without organ involvement, gastrointestinal symptoms only, a remote childhood reaction with limited recall, family history only, avoidance from fear, or documented tolerance of a cephalosporin since the index event, whereas high-risk features include anaphylaxis within 5 years, diffuse hives with airway or circulatory symptoms, or severe delayed reactions such as SJS/TEN, DRESS, AGEP, or organ injury, which would preclude direct challenge and require specialist evaluation or desensitization if the drug is essential [^b7492b39] [^d8b8e759].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic basis for choosing a surrogate cephalosporin when cefuroxime is unavailable. Most immediate hypersensitivity to cephalosporins targets the R1 side chain rather than the β-lactam core, so selecting a surrogate with a dissimilar R1 side chain reduces cross-reactivity risk and supports safe direct oral challenge in low-risk patients. Cephalosporins with methoxyimino groups, like cefuroxime, have distinct side chains that differ from aminocephalosporins such as cephalexin, making cephalexin a reasonable surrogate in many cases, and this approach is supported by practice parameters and observational data showing high tolerance to dissimilar agents [^52736305] [^5b687e73] [^47e6cee6].

> I should confirm which surrogate to pick and why. Cephalexin is commonly used for direct oral challenge because it is widely available, has a dissimilar R1 side chain to cefuroxime, and has supportive safety data in low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels. In a prospective cohort of 71 adults with low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels, 68 were challenged with cephalexin and 98.6% passed, with only one mild pruritic reaction to cefuroxime itself in a separate subgroup, and no anaphylaxis occurred, supporting the safety of this strategy when cefuroxime is unavailable [^8e814981] [^e0265957].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to ensure the challenge protocol is appropriate. For low-risk histories, a single-dose observed oral challenge is acceptable. Typical doses used are cephalexin 250 mg or cefdinir 300 mg, with 90 minutes of observation and emergency equipment available, and this approach aligns with contemporary practice parameters that allow direct challenge to dissimilar cephalosporins in nonanaphylactic histories, with the caveat that patients with anaphylaxis histories should generally undergo skin testing and specialist-guided management rather than direct challenge [^5b687e73] [^bb517a27] [^8e814981].

> Let me consider alternatives if a direct oral challenge is not suitable. If the history is high risk or the patient prefers, skin testing to a panel of cephalosporins can be performed using nonirritating concentrations, recognizing that a negative skin test does not exclude allergy and must be followed by a cautious graded challenge. If the drug is essential and there is confirmed or strongly suspected IgE-mediated allergy, a standardized 12-step desensitization protocol is recommended, and for severe T-cell–mediated reactions such as SJS/TEN or DRESS, both challenge and desensitization are contraindicated and alternative non–cross-reactive agents should be selected [^0be2d716] [^c11272c8] [^d8b8e759].

> I should double-check documentation and follow-up. After a successful challenge, the allergy label should be removed in the medical record, and patients should be counseled that they tolerated a surrogate cephalosporin with a dissimilar side chain, which supports safe future use of cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 groups. If a reaction occurs, it should be characterized, managed, and recorded with details of timing, phenotype, and severity to guide future antibiotic choices and testing strategies [^8e814981] [^52736305].

> In summary, when cefuroxime is unavailable, the most evidence-based option for a low-risk cephalosporin allergy label is a direct oral challenge with a surrogate cephalosporin that has a dissimilar R1 side chain, most commonly cephalexin 250 mg as a single observed dose, which achieves high rates of successful delabeling with a strong safety profile. If the index reaction was high risk or the patient prefers, proceed with cephalosporin skin testing followed by a graded challenge, and reserve desensitization for cases with confirmed IgE-mediated allergy when no reasonable alternatives exist [^8e814981] [^5b687e73] [^0be2d716].

---

If cefuroxime (Ceftin) is unavailable, **use a structurally dissimilar oral cephalosporin** (e.g. cephalexin, cefdinir, cefpodoxime) for a direct oral challenge to assess tolerance, as cross-reactivity is primarily driven by R1 side chains and is low with dissimilar agents [^52736305] [^5b687e73]. This approach is **safe and guideline-supported** for low-risk histories (non-anaphylactic, remote, or mild cutaneous reactions) and should be performed with observation in a monitored setting [^bb517a27] [^5b687e73]. If the history is high-risk (anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous adverse reaction, or organ involvement), avoid direct challenge and refer for specialist evaluation or desensitization [^c11272c8].

---

## Alternative oral cephalosporins for drug challenge

When cefuroxime is unavailable, **select an alternative oral cephalosporin with a dissimilar R1 side chain** to minimize cross-reactivity risk [^52736305] [^5b687e73]. Commonly used alternatives include:

| **Cephalosporin** | **Generation** | **R1 side chain** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | First | Amino group | - Well tolerated<br/> - Widely available<br/> - Dissimilar to cefuroxime |
| Cefdinir | Third | - Vinyl group<br/> - Dissimilar to cefuroxime | - Well tolerated<br/> - Suitable for patients with mild beta-lactam allergy histories |
| Cefpodoxime | Third | - Methoxyimino group<br/> - Dissimilar to cefuroxime | - Well tolerated<br/> - Suitable for patients with mild beta-lactam allergy histories |

---

These agents have **low cross-reactivity with cefuroxime** and are appropriate for direct oral challenge in patients with low-risk allergy histories [^52736305] [^5b687e73].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines support **direct oral challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin** for patients with low-risk cephalosporin allergy histories [^5b687e73]. The 2022 AAAAI practice parameter update recommends direct challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin for patients with non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy histories, emphasizing the role of R1 side chain dissimilarity in minimizing cross-reactivity risk [^5b687e73] [^52736305].

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

While direct oral challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin is generally safe, **ensure the following precautions**:

- **Risk stratification**: Confirm the patient's allergy history is low-risk (non-anaphylactic, remote, or mild cutaneous reactions) [^b7492b39].
- **Monitoring**: Perform the challenge in a monitored clinical setting with emergency support readily available [^bb517a27].
- **Observation**: Observe the patient for at least 90 minutes after administration for immediate hypersensitivity reactions [^b7492b39].
- **Documentation**: Record the outcome clearly in the patient's medical record, noting tolerance or any adverse reactions [^8e814981].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

When cefuroxime is unavailable, **use a structurally dissimilar oral cephalosporin** (e.g. cephalexin, cefdinir, cefpodoxime) for a direct oral challenge in patients with low-risk allergy histories. This approach is supported by current guidelines and minimizes cross-reactivity risk. For high-risk histories, avoid direct challenge and refer for specialist evaluation or desensitization.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

NOTE: CEFUROXIME AXETIL TABLETS AND CEFUROXIME AXETIL FOR ORAL SUSPENSION ARE NOT BIOEQUIVALENT AND ARE NOT SUBSTITUTABLE ON A MILLIGRAM-PER-MILLIGRAM BASIS (SEE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. The safety and effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension in the treatment of infections other than those specifically listed below have not been established either by adequate and well-controlled trials or by pharmacokinetic data with which to determine an effective and safe dosing regimen.

Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. NOTE: The usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever, is penicillin given by the intramuscular route. Cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension is generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, substantial data establishing the efficacy of cefuroxime in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available. Please also note that in all clinical trials, all isolates had to be sensitive to both penicillin and cefuroxime. There are no data from adequate and well-controlled trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of cefuroxime in the treatment of penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes.
Acute Bacterial Otitis Media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or Streptococcus pyogenes.
Impetigo caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) or Streptococcus pyogenes.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

A point-of-care DOC to an oral cephalosporin with structural similarity to the index drug is a safe and effective delabeling strategy in those with low-risk CALs. Delabeling low-risk CALs without the need for skin testing is cost-effective and less time-consuming.Furthermore, because common CALs are associated with cephalosporins with R1 side chains that are not available in a parenteral form for skin testing (eg, cephalexin) this approach makes mechanistic sense. Additionally, cephalosporin antibiotics are widely used in clinical practice, and delabeling unnecessary CALs avoids the need for treatment with alternative agents. Although there is a possibility of selection bias in low-risk patients who were not opposed to going straight to DOC when offered, it was reassuring to us that the safety profile of both testing approaches, DOC versus skin testing followed by OC, was essentially the same. Future studies should consider a randomized controlled trial design.

### Anaphylactic shock associated with cefuroxime axetil: structure-activity relationships [^f9dec085]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a predictive model of allergenicity based on a structure-activity relationship analysis of beta-lactam antibiotics using appropriate skin testing procedures.

Case Summary

A 39-year-old woman was diagnosed with anaphylactic shock a few minutes after taking a 500 mg tablet cefuroxime of axetil and was admitted to the emergency department with dizziness, facial angioedema, generalized skin rash, and inferior cardiac ischemia. Skin testing confirmed the involvement of cefuroxime as the cause of the anaphylactic reaction, and the reaction was defined as probable according to the Naranjo probability scale. We then performed skin testing to study cross-reactivity between different beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition to this initial assessment, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis was done. It showed that the patient was sensitized to beta-lactam antibiotics presenting a methoxyimino group, but not to similar compounds lacking this chemical group (eg, amoxicillin or penicillin G or V). Challenge with amoxicillin under intensive medical monitoring was tolerated up to a cumulated dose of 1 g, administered intravenously over 2 hours.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that SAR analysis could be useful to predict potential adverse reactions to related antibiotics and to select alternative strategies when antibiotic administration is essential.

Conclusions

An SAR-based approach could help physicians and pharmacists provide allergic patients with relevant advice and propose viable alternatives regarding drug therapy.

WARNINGS

CEFUROXIME AXETIL TABLETS AND CEFUROXIME AXETIL FOR ORAL SUSPENSION ARE NOT BIOEQUIVALENT AND ARE THEREFORE NOT SUBSTITUTABLE ON A MILLIGRAM-PER-MILLIGRAM BASIS (SEE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFUROXIME AXETIL PRODUCTS IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFUROXIME AXETIL PRODUCTS, OTHER CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFUROXIME AXETIL PRODUCTS OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG AND INSTITUTE APPROPRIATE THERAPY. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cefuroxime axetil is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

After oral administration, cefuroxime axetil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases in the intestinal mucosa and blood to cefuroxime. Serum pharmacokinetic parameters for cefuroxime following administration of cefuroxime axetil tablets to adults are shown in Table 8.

Effect of Food: Absorption of the tablet is greater when taken after food (absolute bioavailability increases from 37% to 52%). Despite this difference in absorption, the clinical and bacteriologic responses of subjects were independent of food intake at the time of tablet administration in 2 trials where this was assessed.

 Lack of Bioequivalence: Oral suspension was not bioequivalent to tablets when tested in healthy adults. The tablet and oral suspension formulations are NOT substitutable on a milligram-per-milligram basis. The area under the curve for the suspension averaged 91% of that for the tablet, and the peak plasma concentration for the suspension averaged 71% of the peak plasma concentration of the tablets. Therefore, the safety and effectiveness of both the tablet and oral suspension formulations were established in separate clinical trials.

 Distribution 

Cefuroxime is distributed throughout the extracellular fluids. Approximately 50% of serum cefuroxime is bound to protein.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Allergic Reactions 

Inform patients that cefuroxime axetil is a cephalosporin that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea 

Inform patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials, and it usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, advise patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.

 Crushing Tablets 

Instruct patients to swallow the tablet whole, without crushing the tablet. Patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole should receive the oral suspension.

Drug Resistance 

Inform patients that antibacterial drugs, including cefuroxime axetil, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefuroxime axetil is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, inform patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefuroxime axetil or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Absorption and Metabolism: After oral administration, cefuroxime axetil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases in the intestinal mucosa and blood to cefuroxime. Cefuroxime is subsequently distributed throughout the extracellular fluids. The axetil moiety is metabolized to acetaldehyde and acetic acid.

Pharmacokinetics: Approximately 50% of serum cefuroxime is bound to protein. Serum pharmacokinetic parameters for cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension are shown in Table 1.

*Mean age = 23 months.

†Drug administered with milk or milk products

Comparative Pharmacokinetic Properties: A 250 mg/5 mL dose of cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension is bioequivalent to 2 times 125 mg/5 mL dose of cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension when administered with food (see Table 2). Cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension was not bioequivalent to cefuroxime axetil tablets when tested in healthy adults. The tablet and powder for oral suspension formulations are NOT substitutable on a milligram-per-milligram basis. The area under the curve for the suspension averaged 91% of that for the tablet, and the peak plasma concentration for the suspension averaged 71% of the peak plasma concentration of the tablets. Therefore, the safety and effectiveness of both the tablet and oral suspension formulations had to be established in separate clinical trials.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In clinical trials using multiple doses of cefuroxime axetil powder for oral suspension, pediatric patients (96.7% of whom were younger than 12 years of age) were treated with the recommended dosages of cefuroxime axetil (20 to 30 mg/kg/day divided twice a day up to a maximum dose of 500 or 1,000 mg/day, respectively). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities in any of the patients in these studies. Eleven U.S. patients (1.2%) discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. The discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances, usually diarrhea or vomiting. During clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to the taste and/or problems with administering this drug occurred in 13 (1.4%) pediatric patients enrolled at centers in the United States.

The following adverse events were thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension in multiple-dose clinical trials (n = 931 cefuroxime axetil-treated U.S. patients).

POSTMARKETING EXPERIENCE WITH CEFUROXIME AXETIL PRODUCTS

In addition to adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following events have been identified during clinical practice in patients treated with cefuroxime tablets or with cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension and were reported spontaneously. Data are generally insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation.

General: The following hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: anaphylaxis, angioedema, pruritis, rash, serum sickness-like reaction, and urticaria.

Gastrointestinal: Pseudomembranous colitis (see WARNINGS).

Hematologic: Hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased prothrombin time.

Hepatic: Hepatic impairment including hepatitis and cholestasis, jaundice.

Neurologic: Seizure.

### Comparative study of cefuroxime axetil versus amoxicillin in children with early Lyme disease [^c46bd927]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Cefuroxime axetil has been shown to have efficacy comparable to doxycycline in adults with early Lyme disease (LD). Because of toxicity, doxycycline is usually avoided in children. For children who are unable to tolerate amoxicillin, there is currently no proven alternative oral therapy for LD. This randomized, unblinded study compared 2 dosage regimens of cefuroxime axetil (20 mg/kg/d and 30 mg/kg/d) with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d), each given for 20 days. Children were enrolled if they were 6 months to 12 years of age, had erythema migrans, and met other eligibility requirements. Serologic testing occurred at entry and after 6 months. Follow-up evaluations for safety, tolerability, and efficacy occurred at 10 and 20 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Forty-three children were randomized (13 in the amoxicillin group, 15 in each cefuroxime axetil group); 39 completed 12 months of follow-up. At the completion of treatment, there was total resolution of erythema migrans in 67% of the amoxicillin group, 92% of the low-dose cefuroxime group, and 87% of the high-dose cefuroxime group, and resolution of constitutional symptoms occurred in 100%, 69%, and 87%, respectively. All patients had a good outcome, with no long-term problems associated with LD. One patient, who was well at the first 2 follow-up visits, was treated with doxycycline because of new constitutional symptoms. Mild diarrhea occurred in a small number of participants in each group (1 patient was diagnosed and treated for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which occurred after completing the full course of study medication). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred. The number of patients in this trial was not sufficient to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups; however, both amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil seem to be safe, efficacious treatments for children with early LD.

### Intradiscal pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics to treat chronic lower back pain [^537c4439]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps, the debate should focus on the selection of the antibiotic and dosage regimen. The publications using oral amoxicillin to treat CLBP by Braten et al. and the AIM study group and their subsequent analyses should be considered with caution,,,. The differences between Albert et al. and Braten et al. oral amoxicillin RCTs may be at least partially explained by both studies being in a steep part of the amoxicillin dose-response at the intervertebral disc. Some patients respond to oral antibiotics; however, their use must be optimized,. Oral cefuroxime axetil may be an alternative to amoxicillin, as it is more potent against C. acnes and the modelling presented here suggests that it may provide a better chance of adequate intradiscal exposure at a lower dose.

A planned Cochrane review on the use of oral amoxicillin to treat CLBP with Modic changes, based on the RCT studies summarized here, may be premature and may have a greater impact when diverse antibiotics and regimens have been evaluated and optimized and further RCTs conducted.

This review identified gaps of knowledge to set priorities for further research. Additional high-quality studies with well-validated analytical methodology such as Liang et al.investigating the intradiscal pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics in subjects with Modic type 1 and Modic type 2 changes are required to inform the optimisation of dosing, and future studies should at least incorporate an assessment of serum/plasma antibiotic concentrations at timepoints during the 100 days of administration. It is recommended that expertise in antibacterial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics should be integrated into the design and execution of future studies.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cefuroxime axetil PO (also known as Ceftin, Zinacef): 
- Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test: maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefuroxime axetil has been reported to cause false-negative results for bloode glucose tests using ferricyanide.
- Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test: maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefuroxime axetil has been reported to cause false-positive results for urine glucose tests using copper reduction.
- Antimicrobial resistance: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of cefuroxime axetil in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including cefuroxime axetil, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- Superinfection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens may occur during treatment.

§Satisfactory clinical outcome includes cure + improvement (Part I) and success + improvement (Part II).

Cefuroxime axetil and doxycycline were effective in prevention of the development of sequelae of late Lyme disease.

Safety: Drug-related adverse events affecting the skin were reported significantly more frequently by patients treated with doxycycline than by patients treated with cefuroxime axetil (12% versus 3%, respectively; P = .002), primarily reflecting the statistically significantly higher incidence of drug-related photosensitivity reactions in the doxycycline arm versus the cefuroxime axetil arm (9% versus 0%, respectively; P < .001). While the incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events was similar in the 2 treatment groups (cefuroxime axetil - 13%; doxycycline - 11%), the incidence of drug-related diarrhea was statistically significantly higher in the cefuroxime axetil arm versus the doxycycline arm (11% versus 3%, respectively; P = .005).

Secondary Bacterial Infections of Acute Bronchitis: Four randomized, controlled clinical studies were performed comparing 5 days versus 10 days of cefuroxime axetil for the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis. These studies enrolled a total of 1,253 patients (CAE-516 n = 360; CAE-517 n = 177; CAEA4001 n = 362; CAEA4002 n = 354). The protocols for CAE-516 and CAE-517 were identical and compared cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily for 5 days, cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily for 10 days, and AUGMENTIN®500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days. These 2 studies were conducted simultaneously. CAEA4001 and CAEA4002 compared cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily for 5 days, cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily for 10 days, and CECLOR®250 mg 3 times daily for 10 days. They were otherwise identical to CAE-516 and CAE-517 and were conducted over the following 2 years. Patients were required to have polymorphonuclear cells present on the Gram stain of their screening sputum specimen, but isolation of a bacterial pathogen from the sputum culture was not required for inclusion. The following table demonstrates the results of the clinical outcome analysis of the pooled studies CAE-516/CAE-517 and CAEA4001/CAEA4002, respectively:

### Direct oral challenges safely reduce the burden of low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels [^28ea1c05]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 1% to 2% of the population reports a cephalosporin allergy label (CAL).However, many of these labels are misclassified as allergies, and only approximately 8% of CALs correlate with positive skin testing.Furthermore, individuals with true prior IgE-mediated reactions, estimated to be 10%/year or higher, may have loss of hypersensitivity over time and are not truly allergic when tested and rechallenged.Carrying a label of cephalosporin allergy is consequential and often leads to treatment with alternative agents with inferior outcomes, infections owing to multidrug-resistant organisms, and higher health care–related costs. Current literature supports risk stratification of penicillin allergy labels and has described successful delabeling of low-risk labels via direct oral challenge (DOC).Koo et aldescribed that a validated history-based risk stratification approach to penicillin allergy labels is applicable to CALs, with the exception that cephalosporins administered intravenously are considered of higher risk owing to higher pretest probability for positive testing for IgE-mediated allergy. Although evidence has supported the safety of delabeling children through DOCs to cephalosporins, evidence to support generalizability to adults is lacking. In a group of adult outpatients with low-risk CALs, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of removing CAL using DOCs.

Information for Patients/Caregivers (Pediatric)

Phenylketonurics: Cefuroxime axetil for Oral Suspension 125 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 mL contain phenylalanine 4.5 mg per 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) constituted suspension.

1. During clinical trials, the tablet was tolerated by pediatric patients old enough to swallow the cefuroxime axetil tablet whole. The crushed tablet has a strong, persistent, bitter taste and should not be administered to pediatric patients in this manner. Pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole should receive the oral suspension.

2. Discontinuation of therapy due to taste and/or problems of administering this drug occurred in 1.4% of pediatric patients given the oral suspension. Complaints about taste (which may impair compliance) occurred in 5% of pediatric patients.

3. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (Benedict's or Fehling's solution or with CLINITEST®tablets), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria (e.g., CLINISTIX®). As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^1c7d2548]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS)—antibiotic selection and duration: The antibiotics currently approved by the FDA for ABRS are azithromycin, clarithromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefprozil, cefuroxime axetil, loracarbef, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and moxifloxacin. It should be noted that, owing to concerns over bacterial resistance, the Infectious Diseases Society of America no longer recommends the use of macrolides for empiric treatment of ABRS, and that organization recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as first-line therapy and doxycycline, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin in adult patients allergic to penicillin. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 5 to 7 days of treatment with antibiotics for uncomplicated ABRS in adults and 10 to 14 days in children. Intravenous antibiotics may be considered in children who cannot tolerate oral medications for ABRS or in those with orbital, subperiosteal, or epidural abscesses. Summary Statement 21: To avoid resistance and potential adverse effects from antibiotics, the workgroup recommends evaluation of β-lactam allergy by penicillin skin testing and/or graded oral challenge if β-lactam is the most appropriate antibiotic (Rec, B).

Among those stratified as low risk, 71 of 152 (46.7%) agreed to DOC whereas 81 of 152 (53.3%) had skin testing before considering OC (Figure 1). Of the 81 patients who underwent skin testing, 62 (76.5%) proceeded with OC whereas 19 (23.5%) did not undergo OC owing to a loss to follow-up (Figure 1). From the cohort of 71 patients who underwent DOC, 56 (78.9%) were female, 59 (83.1%) self-reported as White, and median age was 57 years (Table I). The most common drug allergy labels were cephalexin (39 of 71 [54.9%]), cefaclor (12 of 71 [16.9%]), and an unknown cephalosporin (11 of 71 [15.5%]) (Table I). The most common reported adverse drug reactions were childhood reaction (21 of 71 [29.5%]), unspecified rash (17 of 71 [23.9%]), and urticaria (13 of 71 [18.3%]) (Table I). Moreover, of the 71 patients, 68 (95.8%) were challenged with cephalexin, two (2.8%) with cefdinir, and one (1.4%) with cefuroxime (Table I). Of the 71 patients who underwent DOC, 70 (98.6%) passed and were successfully delabeled. Subsequently, 15 of 71 (21.1%) patients tolerated a known cephalosporin treatment after CAL removal (see Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at) and 67 of 71 (94.4%) maintained CAL removal from the medical record (Table I) with a median follow-up of 15.9 months (interquartile range, 11.8–19.7). In terms of adverse events, one of the 71 patients (1.4%) developed pruritus of the neck and eyes approximately 40 minutes after ingestion of cefuroxime, which resolved with antihistamines. This reaction was similar to the index reaction and the patient was not delabeled. Compared with low-risk patients who preferred skin testing before OC, we observed no positive skin tests, and all 62 patients (100%) tolerated OC (Table I). In terms of safety, no cases of cephalosporin anaphylaxis or other adverse drug reactions related to cephalosporins were observed in low-risk patients with CAL during challenge or subsequent treatments.

### IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cephalosporins: cross-reactivity and tolerability of alternative cephalosporins [^47e6cee6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Studies regarding the cross-reactivity and tolerability of alternative cephalosporins in large samples of subjects with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cephalosporins are lacking.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the possibility of using alternative cephalosporins in subjects with cephalosporin allergy who especially require them.

Methods

One hundred two subjects with immediate reactions to cephalosporins and positive skin test results to the responsible drugs underwent serum specific IgE assays with cefaclor and skin tests with different cephalosporins. Subjects were classified in 4 groups: group A, positive responses to 1 or more of ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefepime, cefodizime, and ceftazidime; group B, positive responses to aminocephalosporins; group C, positive responses to cephalosporins other than those belonging to the aforementioned groups; and group D, positive responses to cephalosporins belonging to 2 different groups. Group A subjects underwent challenges with cefaclor, cefazolin, and ceftibuten; group B participants underwent challenges with cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, and ceftibuten; and group C and D subjects underwent challenges with some of the aforementioned cephalosporins selected on the basis of their patterns of positivity.

Results

There were 73 subjects in group A, 13 in group B, 7 in group C, and 9 in group D. Challenges with alternative cephalosporins (ceftibuten in 101, cefazolin in 96, cefaclor in 82, and cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone in 22 subjects) were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Cephalosporin hypersensitivity does not seem to be a class hypersensitivity. Subjects with cephalosporin allergy who especially require alternative cephalosporins might be treated with compounds that have side-chain determinants different from those of the responsible cephalosporins and have negative pretreatment skin test responses.

Exploratory outcomes

Antibiotic utilisation

Use of any antibiotic was identified in 33 (82%) of the intervention arm patients and 37 (92%) of the control arm prior to randomisation and in 25 (62%) patients in each arm after randomisation. Pre-randomisation, 4/40 (10%) of the intervention arm and 3/40 (7.5%) of the control arm had received an alternate penicillin antibiotic (not implicated in their penicillin allergy label).

In-hospital use of any penicillin after randomisation was noted in 13 (32%) of the intervention arm and 4 (10%) of the control arm, (odds ratio (OR) 4.33, 95% CI [1.27, 14.78] p = 0.019). Post-randomisation use of a narrow-spectrum penicillin was noted in 3 (8%) of the intervention arm vs. 1 (2%) of the control arm (OR 3.16, 95% CI [0.31, 31.78] p = 0.328).

Post-randomisation use of restricted antimicrobials (3rd-/4th-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides) was noted in 15 (38%) of the intervention arm and 18 (45%) of the control arm (OR 0.73, 95% CI [0.30, 1.79] p = 0.496).

### Toxic anterior segment syndrome and intracameral injection of cefuroxime axetil [^88dea88e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Dear editor

We read with concern the findings of toxic anterior segment syndrome in patients receiving intracameral injection of cefuroxime axetil, as described in the report by Çakir et alin the March 2015 issue of Clinical Ophthalmology. Notably, the authors state that the form of cefuroxime used to extemporaneously compound cefuroxime for intracameral injection was cefuroxime axetil and that 17 cases of toxic anterior segment syndrome ensued. With over one million doses of intracameral cefuroxime administered to date, and with extensive clinical experience,the unfortunate scenario described by the authors has not been realized elsewhere.

Based on information offered in the report, the root of the problem may lie in the inadvertent, or inappropriate, use of the axetil form of the antibiotic. Use of cefuroxime axetil does not conform with the guidelines published by the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery,and does not reflect the form of cefuroxime used in Aprokam ®, the approved injectable form of cefuroxime that has recently become commercially available in Europe and in Turkey.

The axetil form of cefuroxime could be obtained from various sources, but is a form of cefuroxime not intended for injection. The axetil form of cefuroxime is used in, for example, tablets or oral suspensions where the drug particles do not remain in solution, but in a solid form or suspension. Cefuroxime axetil is an ethyl ester of cefuroxime that requires hydrolysis by esterases in the body to yield free cefuroxime. The axetil moiety of cefuroxime axetil is then metabolized to acetic acid and acetaldehyde.

Aside from the improper use of the axetil form of cefuroxime, and any effects from metabolic byproducts in the eye, concerns also surround the extemporaneous compounding procedure itself. One assumes the axetil form would have had to be placed into a liquid vehicle, and sterilization attempted prior to injecting into the anterior chamber of the eye. This procedure poses challenges in terms of accurate dose determination from a suspension and also sterilization of the suspension, both of which would likely interfere with accurate assessment of any dose actually delivered.

### Nervous system Lyme disease [^4ecba2db]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Medium credibility.

Nervous system Lyme disease—antimicrobial regimens and dosing are summarized as follows: Oral doxycycline (preferred) is listed with an adult dose of 100(-200) mg BID and pediatric dosing for those ≥8 y at 4–8 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses with a maximum 200 mg/dose (classification B). When doxycycline is contraindicated, amoxicillin is dosed at 500 mg TID for adults and 50 mg/kg/d in 3 divided doses with a maximum 500 mg/dose (classification C), and cefuroxime axetil is dosed at 500 mg BID for adults and 30 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses with a maximum 500 mg/dose (classification B). Parenteral options include ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for adults and 50–75 mg/kg/d in 1 dose, max 2 g (classification B), cefotaxime 2 g IV Q8H for adults and 150–200 mg/kg/d in 3–4 divided doses with a max 6 g/day (classification B), and penicillin G 18–24 MU/d in divided doses Q4H for adults and 200–400,000 U/kg/d divided Q4H with a max 18–24 MU/day (classification B). For all regimens, recommended duration is 14 days, although courses ranging from 10 to 28 days have been used without significantly different outcomes; tetracyclines are relatively contraindicated in children <8 years of age or in pregnant or lactating women; two oral alternatives (amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil) are effective in non–nervous system Lyme borreliosis with no efficacy data in neuroborreliosis and may be an oral alternative in individuals who cannot take doxycycline; and antibiotic dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function.

Cross-Reactivity with Cephalosporins Penicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ß-lactam ring. This structural similarity has led to considerable confusion regarding cross-reactivity of these drugs and the risks for allergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillin-allergic patients. In most clinical settings, patients with reported penicillin allergy are precluded from treatment with such cephalosporin antibiotics as ceftriaxone. Third-generation cephalosporins have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins.

Moreover, anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons who report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate of one per 52, 000 persons. If the reaction occurred in the distant past, the likelihood is reduced even further (.

### Direct oral challenges safely reduce the burden of low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels [^b7492b39]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

From July 2022 to April 2024, 239 sequential adult patients with a CAL were referred for outpatient drug allergy assessment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. They underwent history-based risk assessment to exclude moderate to severe allergic reactions and were categorized as low-risk or non–low risk (high or highest risk). Patients were potentially eligible for a DOC if the CAL was low-risk.The following criteria defined a low-risk history either alone or in combination: (1) isolated urticaria and/or angioedema more than 5 years ago, (2) self-limited cutaneous rash at any point in the past without organ involvement or signs of a delayed rash, (3) only gastrointestinal symptoms, (4) remote childhood reaction with limited details (little information could be recalled about the index reaction), (5) a family history only of cephalosporin allergy, (6) avoidance only from fear of allergy, (7) known tolerance of a cephalosporin since the original reaction occurred, or (8) other non-allergy symptoms.In terms of risk assessment, if a patient met multiple low-risk criteria, this was still considered low-risk and was counted that way, as listed in Table I. Patients were classified as high risk based on a cephalosporin reaction history including any of the following: anaphylaxis within the past 5 years; delayed urticarial eruptions (>1 hour after drug administration) within the past 5 years; within 1 hour of cephalosporin administration, development of diffuse hives, angioedema, shortness of breath, wheezing and/or coughing, hypotension, loss of consciousness, and diarrhea and/or vomiting. Patients were classified as highest risk and excluded from consideration of DOC based on a cephalosporin reaction history including any of the following: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, immune-mediated kidney injury, immune-mediated liver injury, and development of delayed skin/mucosal sloughing or mucosal ulcerations. Patients with allergy labels to intravenous cephalosporins were excluded from low-risk classification and classified as ineligible for direct challenge owing to a higher pretest probability for true allergy observed in validation studies.Patients with low-risk CALs were presented with one of two approaches: skin testing,followed by oral challenge (OC); or DOC. Skin testing concentrations and challenge doses used were selected according to previously published testing strategies for cephalosporin evaluation cited in the Practice Parameters.All low-risk patients were offered DOC, and the decision to precede OC with skin testing was personalized based on patient preference. Oral challenges (either direct or after negative skin testing) were performed with single-dose oral cephalosporin (cephalexin 250 mg, cefdinir 300 mg, or cefuroxime 250 mg), selected based on structural R1-side chain similarity to the index drug, followed by 90 minutes of observation. After risk stratification and shared patient decision-making, we assessed the proportion of patients accepting and tolerating DOC. This study was done under institutional review board–approved protocols from Vanderbilt University (Nos. 161455, 181180, and 231087).

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^c52b97f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a survey on current allergy clinic practices in relation to evaluation of cephalosporin allergy through the special-interest ARDBL Committee. At the time of our research, the committee included 136 members, who met both virtually and in person on average 4 times per year (including in person at the annual AAAAI meeting) to discuss and plan priorities in research, education, and clinical practice in drug allergy.

An 18-question descriptive survey in REDCap was sent to ARDBL Committee members, with 3 survey attempts made between February and April 2023. The survey included questions on demographics (country of practice, years in practice, types of drugs and reaction seen, availability of testing, etc) as well as current practices regarding cephalosporin allergy tests. In order to evaluate the latter, we used real case examples after each case presentation (high or low history of receipt of penicillin or cephalosporin), the survey participants were asked to answer the following question: “How do you evaluate this patient for cephalosporin allergy?” Multiple test options were offered, and more than one option could be chosen.

Five case scenarios of patients with previous reactions to β-lactams were presented to survey participants for their opinions on how they would evaluate and manage each case. The cases were as follows:
A. Low-risk history with penicillin.
B. Low-risk history with cephalosporin (cephalexin).
C. High-risk penicillin history.
D. High-risk history with cephalosporin (ceftriaxone).
E. High-risk history with cephalosporin (cefazolin).

Participants were asked to choose the preferred test for each case, specifically focused on answering the questions of future cephalosporin receipt and testing. Several answer choices for tests were offered—for example, penicillin skin test, penicillin oral challenge, cephalosporin skin test, or oral challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin. Of note, we deliberately chose the term “oral challenge” in order to allow the choice of this test option both with or without a preceding skin test. The term “direct oral challenge” (DOC) was only used in retrospect, when the chosen evaluation options did not include skin test before oral challenge.

Supporting evidence includes a randomized controlled trial reporting resolution of arthritis within 1–3 months in approximately 90% of participants treated with a 30-day course of either oral doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily) or amoxicillin plus probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours). Oral antibiotics are described as easier to administer than intravenous (IV) antibiotics, associated with fewer serious complications, and less expensive, and studies evaluating a shorter course of antibiotic therapy appear warranted for treatment of Lyme arthritis in the United States.

### Efficacy of an allergy clinical decision rule to enable direct oral penicillin challenge (...) [^f1599fed]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In this randomized clinical trial, direct oral penicillin challenge in patients with a low-risk penicillin allergy was noninferior compared with standard-of-care skin testing followed by oral challenge. In patients with a low-risk history, direct oral penicillin challenge is a safe procedure to facilitate the removal of a penicillin allergy label. This is reflected in updated clinical practice guidelines where direct oral challenge only has conditional recommendations supported by low-quality evidence. 10 A prospective, single-center randomized clinical trial in the US evaluated the safety of drug challenges in a low-risk penicillin allergy patient group, including children and adults. 11 The investigators identified 3 of 79. Patients with histories of non–IgE-mediated severe reactions such as severe delayed organ or skin reactions were also excluded.

Patients with self-reported penicillin allergy were also not eligible if their reaction was inconsistent with an allergy and compatible with adverse effects such as nausea or headache. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the protocol15 and the eMethods in Supplement 1. Due to the randomization, intervention, and the primary outcome being collected within the same visit, loss to follow-up was expected to be minimal. In the 5 days following the oral penicillin challenge, 22 cumulative adverse events were recorded in the intervention group and 24 events in the control group, with an RD of −0. 36 pp and a risk ratio of 0.
97. Drug Allergy Practice Parameter Update of 2022 recommends proactive penicillin allergy delabeling.

10 Although recently published drug allergy practice parameters endorse consideration for a direct oral challenge to penicillin in adults with low-risk penicillin allergy histories, this only carries a conditional recommendation due to low-quality evidence. 10 To our knowledge, the present randomized clinical trial provides for the first time a high level of evidence to support the safety and efficacy of direct oral penicillin challenge that will enable globally the implementation and simplification of penicillin delabeling practices in settings that do not require specialized testing. In this randomized clinical trial, in patients with low-risk penicillin allergy and a PEN-FAST score of less than 3, with most patients having a PEN-FAST score of 0 or 1, a direct oral challenge with penicillin was a safe and effective alternative to the current standard, which includes 2-stage skin testing followed by an oral challenge.

### Direct oral challenges safely reduce the burden of low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels [^c4f38411]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of our study included that data collection for subsequent cephalosporin treatments was obtained from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center electronic health record from July 6, 2022 to December 5, 2024. Therefore, we cannot comment on additional cephalosporin treatments received outside our health care system. This study included small sample sizes, and there is the possibility that large sample sizes might detect subtle differences between the described groups. Approximately one fourth of the low-risk patients who had negative skin testing were lost to follow-up and did not undergo cephalosporin OCs. Therefore, there may have been a possible selection bias in those who underwent OCs. There is also the possibility of selection bias in patients who chose to undergo DOC versus skin testing followed by OC, because the choice was patient preference. We used a history-based risk stratification approach to categorize low-risk CALs, and therefore there may be limited external validity if a different approach is used. Our study was performed in an outpatient drug allergy clinic and did not investigate challenging low-risk CALs in the inpatient setting. Additionally, our study was performed in North America, which has different use patterns of oral versus parenteral aminopenicillins and thus may have different cephalosporin sensitization patterns compared with Europe or Australia.Direct oral challenges are a safe and efficacious strategy for delabeling low-risk CALs in the outpatient setting and were acceptable for around half of patients when it was offered in this small cohort. Our study supports the possibility of future prospective and randomized studies investigating delabeling low-risk CALs in other practice settings to optimize personal and public health outcomes.

Results

Descriptive analysis

We identified 13 antibiotics that met the inclusion criteria (Figs. 1 and 2). Cefuroxime axetil was included despite generic availability of cefuroxime sodium, which comes only as an intravenous (IV) drug, whereas cefuroxime axetil is an oral treatment available for outpatient care. Azithromycin had the highest number of prescriptions—approximately three times greater than any other antibiotic—at the time of generic entry, followed by ciprofloxacin, cefdinir, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, and cefuroxime axetil. For all but two antibiotics (aztreonam and piperacillin/tazobactam), prescriptions almost completely consisted of generic products after generic entry. Aztreonam and piperacillin/tazobactam were, together with cefpodoxime, demeclocyline, and meropenem, the antibiotics with only one or two manufacturers of generic products one year after generic entry (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease erythema migrans—oral antibiotic selection and special populations: Based on clinical trial and susceptibility data, the 3 widely used oral antibiotics in North America, doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil, appear to have similar efficacy for erythema migrans, and azithromycin has been found to be effective clinically and of comparable efficacy in all trials except for 1, whose worse outcomes compared with amoxicillin in the United States are noted as unclear and may reflect that 14% of enrolled subjects had southern tick-associated rash illness rather than Lyme disease. For suspected early Lyme disease presenting as an acute febrile illness without an erythema migrans skin lesion, the same antibiotic regimen as used for erythema migrans should be effective, but there is a lack of systematic studies. In children, although the AAP recommends doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for erythema migrans in children of any age, some clinicians would reserve doxycycline for young children who cannot tolerate beta-lactam antibiotics, and the decision to use doxycycline in young children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women without beta-lactam contraindication should be individualized and made with careful deliberation; further study is needed to establish the safety profile of doxycycline in children and in pregnant and lactating women.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^9ca0b69a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporin allergy evaluation—skin testing and challenge: Most patients with immediate allergic reactions to cephalosporins react to the R1 side chain rather than the β-lactam ring, and a positive cephalosporin skin test (using a nonirritating concentration) implies the presence of drug specific IgE antibodies, whereas a negative test does not rule out their presence; because the negative predictive value is unknown, a cautious graded challenge is advised after a negative test (eg, 1/100 of the therapeutic dose, increasing tenfold every 30 to 60 minutes up to the full therapeutic dose), with steps and pace determined by history, while patients with histories consistent with severe IgE-mediated reactions may instead undergo rapid desensitization, and evaluation of other β-lactams is analogous due to lack of standardized reagents.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^74a50f04]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, 48% of experts chose a cephalosporin-only skin test in the case of anaphylaxis to ceftriaxone (an antibiotic that shares side chains with several other cephalosporins, such as cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, and cefepime) versus 57% who chose a cephalosporin-only skin test in cases of immediate reactions to cefazolin. However, when specifically asked what the preferred step is after a positive skin test result to cefazolin, most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, versus 9 experts (20.9%) who recommended avoiding cefazolin only, without a challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin.

The main limitations of this study are the small sample size, low response rate of 33.8% among all ARDBL members, and lack of independent evaluation of cephalosporin allergy in children. However, large surveys typically show response rates of <20%, even with multiple callouts.A Canadian study that looked at response rates to web-based surveys among physician specialists demonstrated an average response rate of 35%,which is similar to our response rate. The other limitation is the relatively short period of time between the publication of the 2022 practice parameter (online publication in September 2022) and performance of the survey (February-April 2023). Administering the survey later, after the practice parameter’s official publication, might have shown different results, with more experts implementing the guidelines.

Another potential limitation is that the majority of responders were from academic medical centers, with only a small representation of drug allergy experts from the community. However, the selection of ARDBL members for the survey was intentional: they represent the top experts in drug allergy and are the first practitioners to be updated on the new guidelines. We selected them for our survey to see if there was general agreement among this group of experts on the subject of cephalosporin allergy evaluation, especially after the 2022 publication of the DAPP.

The variations among drug allergy experts regarding high-risk reactions with cephalosporins in particular suggest that there is currently low consensus even among experts, meaning that community members will not be expected to have better agreement. However, as a result of the limited access to reagents for drug allergy testing, in the community, high-risk cephalosporin allergy is usually not evaluated, with such patients referred to an academic medical center.

We suggest against penicillin skin testing in patients with a history of nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy prior to administration of a penicillin therapy. We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions. We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, aztreonam may be administered without prior testing unless there is a history of ceftazidime allergy.

### Oral challenges are needed in the diagnosis of β-lactam hypersensitivity [^a3a18f7d]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

beta-lactams continue to remain the most commonly involved drug family in allergic drug reactions. They are often essential and there is a cost-effective and favourable risk-benefit ratio for the exploration of all suspicions of beta-lactam allergy. A firm diagnosis is always based on skin tests and sometimes on provocation tests. Recommendations have been published by allergy societies and distinguished scientists but they are not always concordant and can lead to some confusion for the practicing allergologist. The situation has even worsened since the world wide withdrawal of these penicillin determinants and since the predominance of amoxicillin and cephalosporin prescriptions in most countries. OBJECTIVE - METHOD: In a recent article, it was stated that patients with a penicillin allergy history and negative skin tests to major and minor penicillin determinants are at a low risk of relapse (0-5%) when receiving a beta-lactam. In this paper, our Drug Allergy and Hypersensitivity Database, a cohort database, was used to demonstrate that this statement is false. Standardized European Network for Drug Allergy questionnaires, skin test and challenge procedures were followed.

Results

One-thousand two-hundred and eighteen subjects, 69.8% of female, 51.7% of atopics, were included. 21.1% had a true beta-lactam allergy confirmed by skin tests (178, 69.3%) or by drug provocation (79, 30.7%). 17.4% of the patients with negative skin tests to major and minor penicillin determinants were positive for a beta-lactam.

Conclusion

In the diagnosis of beta-lactams allergy, if all skin tests are negative, skin tests with other determinants and provocation tests under strict surveillance are mandatory.

Lyme carditis antibiotic regimens—In outpatients with Lyme carditis, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In the hospitalized patient with Lyme carditis, we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement, then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For the treatment of Lyme carditis, we suggest 14–21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Evidence includes a randomized controlled trial comparing oral doxycycline to IV ceftriaxone in acute disseminated infection without meningitis in which 6.5% presented with carditis, showing similar efficacy but significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events with IV ceftriaxone and more dermatologic adverse events with doxycycline; patients initially treated with IV antibiotics should be converted to oral therapy to complete their treatment course once they begin to improve, and there are no comparative data evaluating whether other oral antibiotics have similar efficacy in the treatment of Lyme carditis.

### The effect of generic market entry on antibiotic prescriptions in the United States [^6958c887]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

It is possible that the antibiotics included in this reseach impacted each other by competing for the same market shares. This would be relevant primarily for antibiotics with similar indications, formulation, and generic entry at close proximity in time. The three fluoroquinolones included in the study all showed an increase in use, so regardless of whether or not they had an impact on each other it should not have affected the outcome. However, a number of the oral antibiotics, where generic entry had a mixed effect, have respiratory tract infections as indications—azithromycin, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, cefuroxime axetil, clarithromycin, as well as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and ofloxacin (Supplementary Table 5). It is possible that the generic entry of azithromycin, preceeding the generic entry of cefdinir and cefprozil, could have contributed to the lack of increase in cefprozil and the decrease of cefdinir. Then again, as azithromycin use far exceeds the use of any of the other antibiotics, one would expect a similar effect on some of the other antibiotics, or that there would be no significant increases at all for any of the antibiotics with lower levels of use. Given the number of indications for each antibiotic, it is difficult to know exactly which antibiotic would substitute another in practice and we acknowledge that there is likely some level of impact between the different antibiotics. However, we were not able to detect any patterns that would support the idea that our findings were the result of generic entry of the other antibiotics.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^52736305]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Cephalosporin immediate hypersensitivity skin testing—interpretation and follow-up: Most hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins are directed at the R-group side chain rather than the core β-lactam ring molecule. Although skin testing to native cephalosporins is not standardized, a positive skin test result with a nonirritating concentration suggests the presence of drug-specific IgE antibody, and a negative skin test result does not rule out an allergy and must be followed by an observed graded challenge; patients with IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins may lose sensitivity over time.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^d0e05808]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the publication of the 2022 Drug Allergy Practice Parameters (DAPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI), it is unclear the extent to which the simplified and risk-stratified evaluation of cephalosporin allergy has been incorporated into allergy practice.

Objective

We aimed to assess current cephalosporin allergy testing practices using real case examples.

Methods

An 18-question REDCap survey was sent to the 136 members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023.

Results

Forty-six (33.8%) ARDBL members completed the survey after 3 email attempts. Most practiced in the United States (32, 69.6%), 6 (13.0%) in Canada, and the rest in Europe and Asia. Almost half (47.7%) reported that the 2022 DAPP had increased their use of direct oral challenge, and 91% would prescribe cephalosporins in the setting of low-risk penicillin allergy history without testing. For low-risk cephalosporin reactions, 68% would perform a direct oral challenge with the culprit drug. In severe immediate penicillin reactions, 23% would evaluate with penicillin skin test before assessing cephalosporin allergy. For cephalosporin-related anaphylaxis, 48% would perform cephalosporin-based tests. For perioperative anaphylaxis with cefazolin, 57% would perform cephalosporin-based tests. For positive skin test result to cefazolin, 79% chose to avoid the culprit drug with follow-up oral challenge to a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin.

Conclusion

Increased uptake of direct oral challenge represents the initial impact of the 2022 DAPP. However, there is significant variation in testing practices of cephalosporin allergy even among drug allergy experts, reflecting a need for a firmer evidence base to guide consensus around testing for higher-risk reactions.

Regarding medical management for drug allergy, more specifically with respect to choice of an alternative agent, penicillins-cephalosporins, AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering penicillins without testing or additional precautions in patients with a history of an unverified non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy.

### Which cephalosporin for gonorrhoea? [^a4038940]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

The recommended treatment for gonorrhoea in the United Kingdom has, until recently, included the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, which consequently was used by most genitourinary medicine clinics. In 2002 national surveillance data showed that resistance to ciprofloxacin had risen to a prevalence of 9.8% (9% in 2003), indicating that the target of >95% efficacy in first line therapy was no longer achievable. The third generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone (intramuscular) or cefixime (oral), are the recommended alternatives, but recent audit data reveal other cephalosporins are currently being used to treat gonorrhoea, notably including cefuroxime (intramuscular or, often, oral). A pharmacodynamic analysis was undertaken to determine whether all these regimens were equally potent. Ceftriaxone, 250 (or 500) mg intramuscularly, or cefixime, 400 mg orally, were calculated to give free drug concentrations above the MIC90 for 22-50 hours post dose whereas the cefuroxime regimens being used were pharmacodynamically borderline, achieving this target for only 6.8-11.2 hours and raising the spectre that continued use may select for stepwise increases in resistance, as occurred with penicillin. We therefore underscore that ceftriaxone or cefixime should be the agents of choice to replace ciprofloxacin, as recommended in the new treatment guidelines, and that cefuroxime is a poor substitute.

Drug allergy assessment with ST and/or oral provocation testing

The nurse conducted the procedures, and 2-hour posttest observations. Skin prick testing (SPT) and intradermal testing for beta-lactam allergy included penicillin G, amoxicillin, ampicillin, major and minor determinant of penicillin (Diater kit; Diater Laboratorios, Madrid, Spain), and the culprit antibiotic including cephalosporins and carbapenems.Histamine testing (by SPT only) served as a positive control for histamine responsiveness in all cases and normal saline as a negative control for SPT and intradermal testing. A positive response to SPT was a wheal reaction 3 mm greater compared with that with the negative saline control. A positive response to intradermal testing was a wheal increase by 3 mm, in addition to a flare reaction. Patients were assessed and triaged into low-risk and high-risk antibiotic allergy histories. A low-risk history of a benign rash (transient morbilliform or maculopapular rash that may be mildly pruritic) without other systemic manifestations and occurring more than 1 year ago led to a 2-dose challenge with the culprit beta-lactam antibiotic (Fig 1). Amoxicillin was used where the description of the penicillin AAL was imprecise. Intravenous challenge to the culprit was not performed. Any other history was classified high-risk and ST was performed. For the assessment of non–beta-lactams, no ST was performed; being less validated for these antibiotics, 2-stage oral challenges were performed instead. The OPC was in 2 stages, 1/10 dose followed 30 minutes later by 9/10 of a single dose. Patients were contacted 48 to 72 hours following testing to query delayed adverse drug reaction. Challenge outcomes were recorded in the medical record, discharge summary, and a letter to the patient and their general practitioner. In the event of verified allergy, the patient was to be provided with a list of safe alternatives.

Management—high-risk patients with demonstrated sensitivity to penicillin should avoid the responsible drug and potentially cross-reactive agents; it is reasonable to repeat skin testing if many years have passed, and if there are no reasonable alternatives, both oral and intravenous desensitization protocols have been well established; for low-risk patients (eg, itching without urticaria or mild maculopapular rash of less than 1-week duration), a drug challenge test may be considered without the use of skin testing.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^b28bcc08]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial intracutaneous testing—interpretation and use: For non–β-lactam antibiotics, skin testing with nonirritating concentrations may provide useful information, and such concentrations for 15 commonly used antibiotics have been published. If the skin test is positive, drug specific IgE is likely and the patient should receive an alternative non–cross-reacting antibiotic or undergo rapid desensitization. A negative skin test does not exclude drug specific IgE; if the antibiotic is required, the intradermal test dose can be used as the initial dose for rapid desensitization, and in skin test–negative patients with mild histories, a graded challenge may be considered. Readministration of drugs that caused severe non–IgE-mediated reactions is absolutely contraindicated by either desensitization or graded challenge.

Discussion

The results of our survey suggest that even among experienced, interested experts in drug allergy, significant variability in practice and incorporation of recent drug allergy practice parameters are present when evaluating cephalosporin allergy. Most agree that DOC is a reasonable approach to evaluate both low-risk penicillin and cephalosporin allergy labels. An abundance of retrospective and prospective studies support DOCs to evaluation for low-risk penicillin allergy;, recent evidence of a similar approach is emerging for cephalosporin allergy, which has led to updated practice parameters regarding cephalosporin evaluation.

A study by Sillcox et al,performed a DOC in 136 pediatric patients with a history of nonvesicular skin-limited symptoms while being treated with cephalosporins, concluded that this approach is a safe and effective method for delabeling cephalosporin allergy in children. Koo et alvalidated a history-based risk stratification of cephalosporin allergy and suggested it to be a feasible adaptation of an existing validated criteria for penicillin allergy. Although higher-level evidence is needed, particularly in adults, there already appears to be a fair level of comfort among drug allergy experts in using DOC to evaluate low-risk cephalosporin reactions.This is important because there is no good skin test strategy for reactions to aminocephalosporins, which are only available as oral preparations. Although the drug allergy practice parameters currently recommend skin test before oral challenge for low-risk cephalosporin reactions, the surveyed experts showed a possible tendency toward being liberal and offering a DOC, similar to current guidance for low-risk penicillin allergy labels.

Carbapenem cross-reactivity and testing—studies have demonstrated an absence or very low (1%) rate of cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems; for patients with a history of an immediate reaction and negative penicillin skin testing, carbapenem should prove safe; if penicillin skin testing is not available or cannot be performed, a carbapenem drug challenge test is recommended; for a positive penicillin skin test, carbapenem can be administered as a 2-step graded challenge, whereas if skin testing is negative, it is reasonable to administer a single full-dose challenge.

### The use of direct oral challenge to confirm allergies to penicillin class antibiotics in Danish children [^30ea5e0d]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective medical record review with no prospective interventional component. According to The Central Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics, no formal ethics approval was required for this study. The study subjects were children followed in outpatient clinics at three Danish hospitals in Central Denmark Region, with a history of alleged allergy to a penicillin class antibiotic within the period from December 2007 to October 2011. In total, 141 children (69 boys and 72 girls) with an average age of 4.2 years (range, 0.33–15.3) were included. The local guideline was a graded two-step direct oral challenge/drug challenge (DC), with two total hours of observation to confirm antibiotic allergy or current tolerance, along with completion of a standardized ENDA drug allergy questionnaire. There was variable use of skin prick testing (SPT) (only in a subgroup (n = 52)), in vitro anti-penicillin and anti-cephalosporin specific IgE testing (n = 141), and measurements of total IgE level (104 individuals). The setup with SPT, DC and in vitro measurements of anti-penicillin and anti-cephalosporin specific IgE was in accordance with the European Network for Drug Allergy (ENDA) guidelines. Specific IgE testing was done for penicillin G and V, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefamandole, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and penicillin minor determinant in all patients using ImmunoCAP Specific IgE 0–100 (Phadia APS, Allerød, Denmark) and a value > 0.35 kUA/L was considered positive. Total IgE was measured at the same time in 104 of the patients (74%) using ImmunoCAP Total IgE (Phadia APS, Allerød, Denmark). A standardized questionnaire (ENDA) for drug allergy was completed at the beginning of the investigation.

### Oral gemifloxacin once daily for 5 days compared with sequential therapy with I.V. ceftriaxone / oral cefuroxime (maximum of 10 days) in the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis [^84ba9902]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre study, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral gemifloxacin (320 mg once daily, 5 days) was compared with sequential intravenous (i.v.) ceftriaxone (1 g once daily, maximum 3 days) followed by oral cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice daily, maximum 7 days) in adult hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) (n = 274). The clinical success rates at follow-up (21-28 days post-therapy) in the clinical per-protocol population (the primary endpoint) were 86.8% (105/121) for gemifloxacin vs. 81.3% (91/112) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime (treatment difference = 5.5,95% CI -3.9,14.9). The corresponding clinical results in the clinical intention-to-treat (ITT) population were 82.6% (114/138) vs. 72.1% (98/136), respectively (treatment difference = 10.5,95% CI 0.7, 20.4).Thus, gemifloxacin had significantly higher clinical success rates than ceftriaxone/cefuroxime. The median time to discharge was 9 days in the gemifloxacin group vs. 11 days in the ceftriaxone/cefuroxime group (P = 0.04, Wilcoxon test). At follow-up, 120/138 (87.0%) gemifloxacin-treated patients had been discharged from hospital, compared with 111/136 (81.6%) ceftriaxone/cefuroxime-treated patients in the clinical ITT population. Both treatments were generally well tolerated and there was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the incidence or type of adverse events reported. A 5-day course of oral gemifloxacin was shown by this study to be at least equivalent to sequential i.v. ceftriaxone/cefuroxime axetil (for up to 10 days) in patients with AECB who require hospital treatment.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^c11272c8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Cephalosporin allergy management—caution, testing, and desensitization are outlined. Increased caution, warranting skin testing–guided treatment, choosing alternative agents, or performing a desensitization, may be indicated for administration with similar side chains, or for patients with severe reaction histories, or clinically unstable patients, and in cases of serum sickness–like reaction to cefaclor or cefprozil it is appropriate to use another cephalosporin with dissimilar R1 side chains. A standard 2-step test dose protocol is described as as safe as longer protocols but less likely to induce tolerance. The most common cephalosporin desensitization protocol comprises 12 steps for IgE-mediated reactions; contraindications include severe T‑cell–mediated reactions such as DRESS, TEN, or SJS, and while initiating treatment with a standard protocol is recommended, its duration may be modified to account for patient history, comorbidities, and acuity.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^e9dd7c42]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

For scenario C, the practice parameters recommend normal administration of a dissimilar cephalosporin, as well as a skin test–based approach for a structurally similar cephalosporin, for patients with an anaphylactic history to a penicillin. Our survey results showed that 23% elected to perform a penicillin-based skin test and focus only on proving or disproving the penicillin allergy, which aligns with practice parameters’ recommendations.

For scenario D, for a patient with a high-risk cephalosporin history, the practice parameters suggest cephalosporin skin test as the evaluation approach. Forty-eight percent of the experts in our survey chose answers that aligned with this approach.

For scenario E, for patients with another high-risk history of a cephalosporin, specifically cefazolin, a higher number of participants, 57%, chose cephalosporin skin test as their evaluation.

Following scenario E, we specifically asked a question about the recommended steps in cephalosporin use when the skin test results are positive to cefazolin. For this scenario, most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, versus 9 experts (20.9%) who recommended avoiding cefazolin alone, without the need to continue to oral challenge.

We attempted to perform a post hoc analysis to look for a correlation between the experts’ time in practice and their adherence to the guidelines, but we found no such correlation in any of the case scenarios.

The survey’s last section asked about the impact of the 2022 practice parameter on the survey respondents’ individual practices.

Twenty-one participants (47.7%) agreed that the 2022 practice parameters had changed their approach specifically for cephalosporin allergy testing. Among the 21 who answered “yes” to having changed their practice after the updated drug allergy practice parameters were reported qualitative changes in their practice of doing more DOCs (7 experts), more single-dose challenges (2 reports), and fewer skin tests (6 reports), as well as being less concerned about penicillin and cephalosporin cross-reactivity.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^5ae587dd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

However, for the same reason of limited resources, if further prospective studies provide an evidence base for low-risk cephalosporin allergy evaluation through DOCs, drug allergy providers in the community may actually perform DOCs with cephalosporins.

In support of the idea that drug allergy practice in the United States is rapidly evolving, with experts receptive to the evolving evidence and ready to change their practice guidelines, most reported that they performed more DOCs, more single-dose challenges, and fewer skin tests, and they also affirmed that the updated DAPP had already influenced their practice.

Conclusions

Drug challenge remains the reference standard to remove a drug allergy label, and in low-risk cases, performing skin tests before drug challenge may not be that helpful. Increased uptake of DOC, as shown in our survey, may represent an impact of the 2022 DAPP and associated guideline recommendation changes from the 2010 version. However, we observed significant variation in test practices of cephalosporin allergy among drug allergy experts when evaluating high-risk reactions, with variations among the experts as well as variations from the recommended DAPP pathways. This likely reflects a need for a better evidence base to guide the consensus on testing higher-risk reactions in clinical practice.

Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cefuroxime for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

When the colitis is not relieved by drug discontinuation or when it is severe, oral vancomycin is the treatment of choice for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by Clostridioides difficile . Other causes of colitis should also be considered.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^80d2a2ab]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Thirty-six physicians (78.3%) reported having a capacity to test for both delayed and immediate reaction to cephalosporins, and 10 (21.7%) reported that they only test immediate reactions.

The second section of the survey was only available to participants who stated that they assess patients with cephalosporin allergy in their practice or if they planned to do so in the next year (44, 95.7%). The most common immediate cephalosporin reaction that participants reported evaluating was cefazolin (24, 53.3%), followed by cephalexin (18, 40.0%) and then ceftriaxone (3, 6.7%).

Survey results

Participant responses to how they would evaluate and test each of the 5 case scenarios (scenarios A-E) with a focus on cephalosporin use are shown in Fig 1, with answers aligning with current recommendations for testing in the practice parameters marked with an orange bracket. 

Fig 1 
Survey results for expert choice on tests for each case.

For scenario A, the practice parameters suggest that a patient reporting a low-risk penicillin allergy can receive a cephalosporin normally, without a preceding cephalosporin test. Some form of this response was selected by 91% of survey respondents, who focused on prescribing the cephalosporin, delabeling the low-risk penicillin allergy, or both.

For scenario B, the practice parameters suggest that a patient with a low-risk allergy to a cephalosporin should be evaluated by skin test before prescribing a structurally similar cephalosporin. In the survey, 12% chose to perform skin test before challenge, and 68% recommended direct challenge with the culprit drug.

Direct Treatment Approach for Ceftriaxone

Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low. If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g. gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash) (Box 2). In addition, a family history of penicillin or ß-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with ß-lactam antibiotics. This practice is increasingly being used in ambulatory settings and for preoperative prophylaxis (,,,–).

BOX 2 
Low-risk history in patients who report penicillin allergy

Gastrointestinal symptoms

Headache

Pruritis without rash

Localized rash

Delayed onset rash (>24 hours)

Symptoms unknown

Family history of penicillin or another drug allergy

Patient denies allergy but it is on the medical record

Patients at Low Risk for Oral Challenge

If the patient gives only a low-risk history of IgE-mediated penicillin allergy that includes symptoms such gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonspecific pruritus, or gives a family history only, an oral challenge can be administered to document the absence of allergy (Box 2). If the reaction occurred in the distant past (>10 years), the likelihood is reduced even further. The risk for severe amoxicillin-mediated anaphylaxis has decreased over time and is rare. In the United Kingdom during 1972–2007, one fatal case of amoxicillin-medicated anaphylaxis was reported.

Skin Testing for Penicillin Allergy

Skin testing for penicillin allergy should be performed if any indication exists that the symptoms were secondary to an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Testing is also indicated as a potential diagnostic procedure to definitively rule out penicillin allergy and document a negative allergy status in the medical record (i.e. delabeling). Because penicillin allergy testing does not test for multiple minor determinants, a person with a negative skin test should follow up with an oral challenge to confirm the negative status.

Persons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by an amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin therapy safely if needed.
