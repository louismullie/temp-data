## Question

Which protective factors apply to individuals who use substances?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which protective factors apply to individuals who use substances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about scope and the multilevel framework to anchor protective factors. Then, I should map individual, family/social, school/community, clinical/treatment, and structural/policy protective factors. Next, I need to integrate high-credibility harm reduction guidance for current users. After that, I should review population-specific nuances and correct any misstatements. Finally, I will synthesize practical, prioritized recommendations while noting evidence strength and limitations [^114WsPyF] [^112BfP9Y].

> Let me first confirm the scope and framework. We are addressing both prevention of initiation/escalation and harm reduction for current users, and protective factors operate across the ecological spectrum from person-level skills to structural determinants; I need to ensure the framework supports family, school, and community levers as well as clinical and policy strategies, and that it acknowledges developmental timing and comorbid mental health as contextual drivers of risk and resilience [^114WsPyF] [^112BfP9Y].

> Now, I will examine individual-level protective factors. Wait, let me verify whether the evidence consistently supports self-efficacy, coping skills, and meaning/purpose as protective against relapse and escalation; despite heterogeneity, reviews of alcohol use disorder link higher self-efficacy, supportive cognitions, and purpose in life with lower relapse risk, and broader anxiety prevention literature identifies coping skills and physical activity as modifiable protective factors, though the latter evidence base for SUD prevention is less robust and should be applied cautiously; enculturation and strong cultural identity appear protective in some Asian American and NH/PI groups, suggesting culturally grounded strengths can buffer risk, although these findings are under-studied and should be contextualized [^113T4G7F] [^1178Txom] [^112kgzQs].

> Next, I should review family and social protective factors. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; across adolescent prevention science, family engagement, parental monitoring with clear rules, and explicit parent or guardian disapproval of substance use consistently reduce onset and progression risk, and broader social support networks are protective for both mental health and substance outcomes; I should confirm that these levers remain relevant beyond adolescence, where adult social support and prosocial connections also correlate with better SUD trajectories, though most high-quality causal evidence concentrates on youth [^114WsPyF] [^112BfP9Y] [^112PNKHn] [^117Gce1C].

> I will now examine school and community connectedness. Let me think about the strongest levers; school connectedness and positive, supervised opportunities for engagement in community settings reduce adolescent substance involvement and overdose risk, and community environments that foster skills and reinforce prosocial behavior appear to function as upstream protective forces, which means clinicians should coordinate with schools and community organizations to augment these buffers where feasible [^112BfP9Y] [^114WsPyF] [^114CZZ7F].

> Turning to harm reduction for current users, I should double-check the guidance on overdose prevention. Initially, I was going to say naloxone distribution is only indicated for people with opioid exposure, but wait, I need to correct that; the 2024 AAAP/ASAM guidelines recommend prescribing or distributing naloxone, or referring to sources for naloxone, for people using stimulants from nonmedical sources or who interact with others who do, given polysubstance exposure and fentanyl contamination risks; in addition, they advise tailored safer-use education specific to the substance, route, and context, providing or referring for safe injection supplies and syringe services, and delivering brief interventions that address unique motivators such as chemsex, weight loss, or performance, while suggesting safer alternatives [^112B5zWB] [^1163fRhR] [^111MjaE1] [^114HRUBB].

> On clinical and treatment-level protective strategies, I need to ensure recommendations are integrated and trauma-informed. The VA/DoD guideline encourages interdisciplinary integrated care for chronic pain patients with SUD risk, underscoring that coordinated behavioral health and pain management can mitigate harms; for PTSD with comorbid SUD, the APA recommends trauma-focused CBT or prolonged exposure in addition to usual SUD treatment, which can enhance recovery trajectories; for patients with serious medical comorbidity such as stroke or TIA, referral to specialized dependency services is protective and recommended to reduce recurrent events and improve outcomes; let me also note that integrated care models for mental and addictive disorders are promising, though effectiveness data continue to mature [^115J86mA] [^116ufcmb] [^116RArZR] [^112qgeiQ].

> I should confirm structural and policy-level protective factors. Preventing adverse childhood experiences and addressing social determinants such as poverty, family dysfunction, inequities, and lack of community supports are upstream protective strategies that reduce the developmental cascade into substance involvement; promoting family engagement and school connectedness is part of that upstream work, and these priorities are flagged in both prevention science and public health surveillance as critical for lowering overdose and SUD risk over the life course [^114WsPyF] [^112BfP9Y].

> Synthesize population-specific considerations. Adoles — hmm, wait a minute, that is incomplete; let me correct to adolescents first, where family-based and school-connectedness strategies are particularly protective, and then note additional groups: for individuals involved in the criminal or legal system, initiating SUD treatment within correctional settings is recommended and protective; for pregnant and postpartum patients, I should verify that screening and management include attention to fetal and infant risk, with tailored education and close monitoring of pregnancy-related complications from stimulant use; for racially and ethnically diverse populations, enculturation and culturally grounded programming can function as protective factors, though more rigorous studies are needed [^111VeeEH] [^1145rnA7] [^112kgzQs] [^112BfP9Y].

> Hold on, I should verify how to translate this into practice. A practical, protective approach includes systematic screening for SUD and mental health comorbidities, engaging families or supportive others when appropriate, reinforcing school and community connectedness for youth, delivering substance- and route-specific harm reduction including naloxone where indicated, integrating care across behavioral health and medical comorbidities, addressing trauma with evidence-based therapies when present, and advocating for upstream ACE prevention and SDOH mitigation; I need to ensure we also tailor brief interventions to the person's motivators and context while strengthening skills and supports that confer resilience [^1163fRhR] [^112B5zWB] [^115J86mA] [^116ufcmb] [^114WsPyF].

Protective factors for substance users include **strong social support** (family, peers, community) [^113T4G7F], **stable housing and employment** [^113ecBt4], and **access to integrated mental health care** [^112qgeiQ]. Additional protections come from **harm reduction services** (naloxone, syringe programs) [^112B5zWB] [^111MjaE1], **trauma-informed care** [^116ufcmb], and **culturally tailored interventions** [^112kgzQs]. These factors reduce relapse and overdose by addressing social determinants, comorbidities, and structural barriers [^114WsPyF] [^112qgeiQ] [^112BfP9Y].

---

## Individual-level protective factors

- **Resilience and coping skills**: Higher resilience and adaptive coping reduce relapse and support recovery [^113T4G7F] [^113ANG41].

- **Self-efficacy and motivation**: Confidence in abstinence and strong motivation protect against relapse [^113T4G7F] [^113ecBt4].

- **Mental health stability**: Treating co-occurring disorders lowers relapse and improves outcomes [^112qgeiQ] [^113VA5zb].

---

## Social and environmental protective factors

- **Social support networks**: Family, peers, and community support reduce relapse and promote recovery [^113T4G7F] [^112BfP9Y].

- **Stable housing and employment**: Housing and employment stability reduce relapse and improve functioning [^112qgeiQ] [^111SS2DE].

- **Community engagement**: Participation in prosocial activities and supportive communities protects against relapse [^114WsPyF].

---

## Clinical and therapeutic protective factors

- **Integrated treatment approaches**: Coordinated care for SUD and comorbidities improves outcomes [^112qgeiQ] [^115J86mA].

- **Harm reduction strategies**: Naloxone distribution [^112B5zWB], syringe programs, and safer use education reduce overdose and harm [^114HRUBB].

- **Trauma-informed care**: Addressing trauma and ACEs reduces relapse and supports recovery [^116ufcmb] [^114CwUCJ].

---

## Policy and structural protective factors

Policy and structural protective factors include **accessible, affordable healthcare services** that improve engagement and outcomes [^116RArZR] [^113ecBt4]. Supportive **legal and policy frameworks** reduce stigma, expand access to care, and promote recovery [^111VeeEH] [^114WsPyF]. Culturally tailored **interventions** enhance engagement and outcomes [^112kgzQs] [^115e8e1V].

---

Protective factors for substance users span individual, social, clinical, and policy domains; **multilevel interventions** that address these areas are most effective for reducing relapse and supporting recovery [^117SZJ7L] [^114WsPyF].

### Mental and addictive disorders and medical comorbidities [^112qgeiQ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Mental and addictive disorders commonly co-occur with medical comorbidities, resulting in poor health, reduced functioning, and premature mortality. This review provides an overview of the intertwined causal pathways and shared risk factors that lead to comorbidity. Additionally, it examines strategies to prevent the onset and effectively manage chronic medical conditions among people with mental and addictive disorders.

- **Recent findings**: Recent research provides further evidence for the shared genetic, biological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors associated with comorbidity. There is also evidence of effective approaches for screening, self-management, and treatment of medical conditions among people with mental disorders. Promising health system models of integrated care have been identified, though additional research is required to fully establish their effectiveness. A combination of public health and clinical approaches is needed to better understand and address comorbidity between mental and addictive disorders and chronic medical conditions.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly with respect to injection drug users, the 2024 AAAP/ASAM guidelines recommend providing or referring patients injecting stimulants for harm reduction education on safer injection practices. This should include information specific to the patient's stimulant and preparation of choice, such as safer acid pairings for crack cocaine injection. Additionally, patients should be provided with or referred for safe injection supplies and harm reduction services.

### Alcohol use disorder relapse factors: A systematic review [^113T4G7F]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Low credibility.

A relapsing-remitting course is very common in patients with an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Understanding the determinants associated with alcohol resumption remains a formidable task. This paper examines relapse determinants based on a systematic review of recent alcohol literature (2000–2019). Relevant databases were consulted for articles that contained information about specific relapse determinants and reported statistical significance of each relapse determinant in predicting relapse. Relapse was broadly defined based on the characterization in the included articles. From the initial identified 4613 papers, a total of 321 articles were included.

Results encompass multiple relapse determinants, which were ordered according to biopsychosocial and spiritual categories and presented using a descriptive methodology. Psychiatric co-morbidity, AUD severity, craving, use of other substances, and health and social factors were consistently significantly associated with AUD relapse. Conversely, supportive social network factors, self-efficacy, and factors related to purpose and meaning in life were protective against AUD relapse.

Despite heterogeneity in different methods, measures, and sample characteristics, these findings may contribute to a better therapeutic understanding of which specific factors are associated with relapse and those that prevent relapse. Such factors may have a role in a personalized medicine framework to improve patient outcomes.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with adolescent substance use in Africa, 2000 to 2020 [^116eLyoP]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

All included articles for this systematic review were reviewed for possible meta-analysis. Studies were deemed appropriate for meta-analysis if three or more articles were found with the same outcome and exposure/predictor, as just two studies can be better summarized in the narrative synthesis. Articles were screened by all authors to record outcome and predictor/exposure, with final oversight by co-author C.N.

- **Selection of studies for meta-analysis**: This was a two-stage process. First, outcomes from included articles for multiple substances (e.g. ever smoked cannabis? yes/no), alcohol (e.g. ever drank alcohol? yes/no), and smoking (e.g. smoker? yes/no) were recorded. Second, each outcome recorded in more than three articles was taken forward to explore the number of exposures/predictors in those subsets of articles to determine if the three-article criteria of both same exposure/predictor and outcome were met for meta-analysis.

Estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Pooled effect sizes (e.g. proportions, ORs) of identified factors associated with substance use with 95% CI from included quantitative studies were calculated using a random-effects model, based on expected heterogeneity of the included diverse populations. Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using the I² statistic, which describes the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. An I² value greater than 50% was considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity. All analysis was carried out in R language with the package.

### Psychological factors associated with substance use initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116M7Uc1]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

The 2019 outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact. Given the ongoing nature of the outbreak, the deleterious toll on mental health, including substance use, is unknown. Negative reinforcement models of substance use posit that elevations in stress from the COVID-19 pandemic will elicit a corresponding motivation to downregulate COVID-19-related stress reactivity via substance use for a subset of the population.

The study sought to evaluate:

- **COVID-19-related worry and fear**: If these were associated with substance use coping motives.
- **Levels of COVID-19-related worry and fear**: How they differ between pre-COVID-19 substance users, COVID-19 substance initiators, and abstainers.

Participants were 160 adults recruited nationally between April-May 2020 for an online study. Results indicated that COVID-19-related worry was associated with substance use coping motives. Additionally, compared to abstainers, pre-COVID-19 substance users and COVID-19 substance initiators demonstrated the highest levels of worry and fear.

Examination of differences suggested that the COVID-19 substance initiators had the highest COVID-19-related worry and fear for all substances except for opioids, with effect size estimates ranging from small to medium. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19-specific psychological factors appear to be involved in substance use behavior.

### Modifiable risk and protective factors for anxiety disorders among adults: A systematic review [^1178Txom]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in the general population and are associated with high rates of impairment and disability. This burden highlights the need to identify risk factors that individuals can modify without professional intervention. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that examined modifiable risk and protective factors for anxiety disorders among adults in the general population. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE using medical subject headings and text words related to risk factors, protective factors, and each anxiety disorder. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by three study authors.

Modifiable risk and protective factors from 19 studies across seven countries were identified.

- **Risk factors**: Included cigarette smoking, alcohol use, cannabis use, negative appraisals of life events, avoidance, and occupational factors.
- **Protective factors**: Included social support, coping, and physical activity.

Cigarette smoking was the most studied risk factor. Support was found for cigarette smoking as a risk factor for agoraphobia and panic disorder, but mixed results were found for generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Across disorders, smoking frequency was associated with greater risk. Results indicate an important gap in the literature in that few studies have examined modifiable risk factors for anxiety disorders.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the use of opioids in the management of chronic pain [^115J86mA]. VA/DoD (2022). High credibility.

For the specific use of opioids in managing pain, particularly in patients with substance use disorder, the DoD/VA 2022 guidelines recommend considering interdisciplinary care. This includes addressing pain and behavioral health problems, including substance use disorders, especially in patients exhibiting high-risk or aberrant behavior.

### Mental disorders as risk factors: Assessing the evidence for the Global Burden of Disease Study [^1172LBdE]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our aim in this paper was not to present the results of a series of systematic reviews of the strength of evidence for health outcomes. To review the evidence comprehensively, each potential outcome for mental disorders deserves in-depth discussion beyond the scope of this paper. Rather, this paper describes the process by which health outcomes were selected for inclusion in the GBD 2010 Study. We identify the most common reasons that potential outcomes were not included and provide suggestions for future research. The GBD CRA component for illicit drug use and alcohol use is outside the scope of this paper and will be reported separately by the groups undertaking that work.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with adolescent substance use in Africa, 2000 to 2020 [^114MYqgd]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

On a broader level, there was an imbalance in the number of included studies per region, with Southern Africa having significantly more studies, whereas North Africa had the least. On a country level, most included studies were conducted in South Africa. There was an equal number of studies between the West and East African regions. This imbalance may reflect the different research infrastructure across regions on the continent. These differences in infrastructure lead to issues such as access to research funding, the availability of academic researchers, and research dissemination, including publication bias. Indeed, most of the included studies for this review did not have or declare research funding, with many relying on readily existing data to conduct secondary analyses.

It is well known that researchers based outside European and American regions do not work in enabling environments where funding and support required to thrive are easily accessible. There is also a general lack of investment in data storage infrastructure in most African countries. A needs assessment of research institutions across seven countries in Africa reported underinvestment in both physical and digital research infrastructure, a low number of researchers, and incomplete, under-resourced national institutional frameworks. Such critical gaps typically result in differences in research production, which can limit research dissemination, international visibility, and national influence on domestic economic, social, or environmental issues.

### Dynamic protective factors relevant to sexual offending [^114jMyys]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Our motivation is to allow assessment to be complementary to strengths-based treatment approaches. To achieve this, dynamic protective factors need to be conceptualized in a way that makes them something that a person participating in treatment can aspire to manifest, either by deploying a pre-existing strength or by building up a strength that was absent or only weakly developed.

We consider something as a protective factor if its presence is theoretically or empirically associated with a decrease in the rate at which a negative outcome occurs in a population for whom that outcome is a concern. Thus, a protective factor relevant to sexual offending would imply decreased sexual recidivism among those with a history of sexual offending. In contrast, a corresponding risk factor would be associated with increased sexual recidivism. This conceptualization is similar to that of de Vogel et al. and essentially identical to that of Willis et al…

- **Protective vs. risk factors**: Most protective factors are at one end of a dimension that has a risk factor at the other end. Importantly, for something to be a protective factor, it must involve the positive presence of something that serves a protective function. A simple absence of risk factors is not sufficient. We do not make a distinction between strengths and protective factors, as relevant strengths would meet our definition of protective factors.

Despite the conceptual distinction between protective factors and risk factors, both need to be considered in the comprehensive assessment of individuals to better tailor treatment approaches.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1163fRhR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to harm reduction strategies, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend the following for patients engaging in risky stimulant use:

- **Basic harm reduction education**: Offer education about safer stimulant use.

- **Tailored harm reduction education**: Match the education to the patient's patterns of substance use, including the context of use, route of administration, and type of preparation.

- **Referral to local services**: Refer patients to relevant local harm reduction services based on their clinical assessment.

- **Overdose prevention and reversal**: Offer education on overdose prevention and reversal.

- **Safer sexual practices**: Provide education on safer sexual practices.

### Examining the shared and unique relationships among substance use and mental disorders [^113VA5zb]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Co-morbidity among the use of different substances can be explained by a shared underlying dimensional factor. What remains unknown is whether the relationship between substance use and various co-morbid mental disorders can be explained solely by the general factor or whether there remain unique contributions of specific substances.

- **Method**: Data were from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHWB). A unidimensional latent factor represented general substance use. The shared and specific relationships between lifetime substance use indicators and internalizing disorders, suicidality, and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) were examined using Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models in the total sample. Additional analyses then examined the shared and specific relationships associated with substance dependence diagnoses as indicators of the latent trait, focusing on a subsample of substance users.

- **Results**: General levels of latent substance use were significantly and positively related to internalizing disorders, suicidality, and psychotic-like experiences. Similar results were found when examining general levels of latent substance dependence in a sample of substance users. There were several direct effects between specific substance use/dependence indicators and the mental health correlates that significantly improved the overall model fit, but they were small in magnitude and had relatively little impact on the general relationship.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of pairwise co-morbid relationships between s

### Familial risk and protective factors in alcohol intoxicated adolescents: Psychometric evaluation of the family domain of the Communities That Care Youth Survey (CTC) and a new short version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) [^117Gce1C]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Studies show that adolescents with substance abuse issues have less parental support and monitoring than their peers and are more likely to grow up in families with parental addiction. They are also frequently victims of sexual or physical abuse, which plays a central role in the development and persistence of many severe disorders and illnesses, such as violent behavior, delinquency, depression, and other mental disorders. There is evidence that the buffering effect of protective factors increases with the number of risk factors to which adolescents are exposed.

Models of risk and protective factors aim to predict the onset and progression of disorders as a foundation for planning effective preventive interventions. The Social Development Model (SDM) provides a framework for explaining the healthy or problematic development of adolescents. Within this model, the family environment emerges as one of the main factors influencing adolescent development. According to the SDM, protective familial factors include:

- **Opportunities for positive involvement**: These are crucial for youth engagement within the family.
- **Promotion of skills**: Encouraging skill development in adolescents.
- **Perceived rewards for prosocial behavior**: Recognizing and rewarding positive behavior.

Routine tasks and responsibilities within the family are important protective factors, especially for male adolescents. Familial recognition for prosocial involvement has been identified as a protective factor against problem gambling in young adults. Furthermore, an effect observed across different cultures is that continuous parental engagement…

### Factors associated with marijuana use among treatment-seeking adult cigarette smokers in the criminal justice population [^116imvNi]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Due to the elevated rates of cigarette and marijuana use within the criminal justice system, it is critical to develop a stronger understanding of tobacco and marijuana co-use among this population to inform future interventions.

- **Methods**: This study is a secondary analysis of baseline data from a smoking cessation randomized clinical trial of adults (n = 500) in a community correction program. Participants were classified as using cigarettes only or both cigarettes and marijuana through either self-report or positive urine drug screening. Demographics and measures regarding legal, drug use, smoking, mental health, and interpersonal histories were assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with co-use.

- **Results**: Among adults who smoked cigarettes, 25% reported marijuana use. Individuals who used both cigarettes and marijuana were more likely than those who only used cigarettes to be African American (80%), male (73.6%), and younger (M = 32.4 [SD = 11.0]). Increasing difficulties with the last quit attempt was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of co-use (odds ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.94, P < 0.05), while benzodiazepine (OR 9.09, 95% CI 1.25–65.94, P < 0.05) and opioid use (OR 8.17, 95% CI 2.03–32.93, P < 0.01) were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of co-use.

- **Conclusions**: This study identified several factors that are associated with an increased risk of cigarette and marijuana co-use among a community correction population. These findings will be valuable for informing future interventions.

### Are parenting practices associated with the same child outcomes in sub-Saharan African countries as in high-income countries? A review and synthesis [^112PNKHn]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

Parenting and substance (alcohol/tobacco) use

There were three studies identified on associations between parenting and substance use in adolescents. The higher quality study by Oladeji et al. reported on data from the Nigerian Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing, which investigated childhood adversities and lifetime (DSM-IV) disorders, including substance use disorders. This study reported an association between parental neglect or abuse and increased risk for substance use disorders (alcohol/drug dependency).

Poms et al. conducted secondary analysis of data from the Global School-Based Health Survey (of 27 countries) that included nine SSA countries. This study reported the association of parental role modelling of tobacco use and children's tobacco use. Similarly, Hoque and Ghuman reported an association between parental role modelling of alcohol use and adolescent alcohol use. Finally, parental monitoring, including clear house rules about alcohol use, was a protective factor for tobacco or alcohol use among students.

### Substance use disorders and co-morbidities among Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders [^112kgzQs]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Adolescence and young adulthood are the most reliable correlates of recent substance use, whereas other demographics are inconsistent correlates. Additionally, behavioral health problems such as the use of other substances, delinquency, and depression are closely associated with substance use among Asian Americans (AAs) and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs). This emphasizes the need for prevention programs to start early and target all racial/ethnic groups. AAs and NHs/PIs are vastly under-represented in substance use prevention research. There is a need for research to evaluate the effects of universal and secondary prevention programs, such as school- and family-based programs, for AAs and NHs/PIs.

Cultural factors that may be unique and functioning as risk or protective factors for substance use deserve research. Acculturation, which involves changes in an individual's original cultural patterns as a result of continuous or direct contact with individuals of a different culture, is associated with increased odds of substance use disorders (SUD) and mental disorders. In contrast, factors related to enculturation, such as the degree to which an individual endorses values indigenous to their native culture or ethnic identity measures, are associated with decreased odds of having a mental disorder. It is important to study how the preservation and promotion of one's own cultural values, such as participating in racial/ethnic activities and behaviors and developing a sense of cultural pride, belonging, and attachment to one's racial/ethnic group and identity, can protect against substance use and psychological disorders.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^116RArZR]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for acute ischemic stroke, especially in relation to substance use cessation, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend offering specialized services to help manage dependency in patients with stroke or TIA who have a substance use disorder (drugs or alcohol).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with adolescent substance use in Africa, 2000 to 2020 [^116f8aBe]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

We used stringent systematic methodology throughout the review process as outlined in our protocol using PRISMA guidance for reporting of systematic review to facilitate transparent reporting of why this review was done, how it was conducted, and key findings. Several factors were assessed with a bottom‐up approach to our coding and thematic analysis, not limited to one aspect or level. In addition, the search strategy was not restricted to a specific study design. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were included to ensure a broad scope of data was captured for the review. We did not restrict our search strategy in terms of language, which meant we came across studies written in English, French, and German during the initial screening process. Having multilingual team members facilitated this process.

Nonetheless, this review has several limitations:

- **Databases used**: Our results should only be considered in the context of the databases we used to search the literature, which might not be comprehensive.

- **Language of articles**: Although we chose not to exclude based on language, most of the literature we came across was in English, with a few others in French and German.

- **Publication bias**: Documents not published online as well as reports not found in peer-reviewed journals were not considered.

- **Cohort definitions**: Our choice to exclude a few articles with cohorts that had some age groups outside the chosen definition of adolescence (e.g. cohorts age 16 to 24 years) may underestimate some statistical outcomes.

### Evidence for a genetic component for substance dependence in Native Americans [^113V1uyr]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Although tribes differ with regard to the use of alcohol and drugs, substance dependence is one of the primary sources of health problems facing Native Americans. General population studies have demonstrated that substance dependence has a substantially heritable component (approximately 50% of the risk resulting from genetic influences); however, fewer studies have investigated the role of genetics in the risk for substance dependence in Native Americans.

The authors present a literature review of the evidence for a genetic component in the etiology of substance dependence in Native Americans, including studies of heritability, linkage analyses, and candidate genes.

Evidence for the heritability of alcohol and drug dependence was found. Linkage analyses revealed that genes influencing risk for substance dependence and related phenotypes, such as body mass index (BMI), drug tolerance, EEG patterns, and externalizing traits, reside on several chromosome regions identified in other population samples. Overlap in the gene locations for substance dependence and BMI suggests that a common genetic substrate may exist for disorders of consumption. Studies of the genes that code for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes have not revealed any risk variants specific to Native American populations, although most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations. Other candidate genes associated with substance dependence phenotypes in Native Americans include OPRM1, CRN1, COMT, GABRA2, MAOA, and HTR3-B.

### A national strategy for preventing substance and opioid use disorders through evidence-based prevention programming that fosters healthy outcomes in our youth [^114WsPyF]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023). High credibility.

Scientists have been working to identify the personal and environmental conditions that are conducive to substance use, and to understand the nature of "resistance" factors that protect individuals from initiation or later escalation of use. Two NIH institutes — the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism — have extensively supported studies of the etiology of substance use, as well as abuse and dependence. The research funded by these two agencies alone has produced abundant knowledge on the problem and its precipitants, which have led to significant advances in its prevention and treatment.

The development of substance/opioid use disorders (SUD/OUD) is commonly preceded by a variety of psychological and behavioral problems, including academic failure, conduct problems, sensation-seeking, impulsivity, anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2018). These problems often arise due to detrimental social determinants of health (e.g. poverty, family dysfunction, inequities, structural racism, lack of community supports) that create environments unable to foster effective cognitive, coping, and prosocial skills in young people. These environments tend to be rife with opportunities and influences to engage in problematic behaviors; for example, there may be a lack of supervision, deviant peer groups, and marketing of abusive substances.

### The impact of substance use at psychosis onset on first episode psychosis course: results from a 1 year follow-up study in Bologna [^112GcXND]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Substance abuse is a well-established risk factor for first-episode psychosis (FEP), but its influence on the FEP course is less clear. Starting from our baseline observation that substance users were younger than non-users at psychosis onset, we hypothesized that substance use at baseline could be an independent risk factor for a worse clinical course.

An incidence cohort of patients with FEP collected over an 8-year period (2002–2009) at the Bologna West Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) was assessed at baseline and at a 12-month follow-up. Drop-out rates, hospitalizations, and service utilization were used as clinical outcomes.

Most patients were still in contact with CMHC at the 12-month follow-up. Substance users had a significantly higher rate of hospitalizations during the follow-up after adjusting for age, gender, and other potential confounders (OR 5.84, 95% CI 2.44–13.97, p ≤ 0.001).

This study adds to previous evidence showing the independent effect of substance use on the FEP course. The identification of a "potentially modifiable" environmental predictor of the course of the illness, such as substance use at psychosis onset, allows us to envisage the possibility of ameliorating the course of the illness by managing this factor.

### Psychiatric, behavioural and social risk factors for HIV infection among female drug users [^1128XtKb]. AIDS and Behavior (2011). Low credibility.

Female drug users report greater psychopathology and risk behaviors than male drug users, putting them at greater risk for HIV. This mixed-methods study determined psychiatric, behavioural, and social risk factors for HIV among 118 female drug users (27% (32/118) were HIV seropositive) in Barcelona. DSM-IV disorders were assessed using the Spanish Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders. Thirty participants were interviewed in-depth.

In stepwise multiple backward logistic regression, ever injected with a used syringe, antisocial personality disorder, had an HIV seropositive sexual partner, and substance-induced major depressive disorder were associated with HIV seropositivity. Qualitative findings illustrate the complex ways in which psychiatric disorders and male drug-using partners interact with these risk factors. Interventions should address all aspects of female drug users' lives to reduce HIV risk.

### Association of cohort and individual substance use with risk of transitioning to drug use, drug use disorder, and remission from disorder: Findings from the world mental health surveys [^111EqukC]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Limited empirical research has examined the extent to which cohort-level prevalence of substance use is associated with the onset of drug use and transitioning into greater involvement with drug use.

To use cross-national data to examine time-space variation in cohort-level drug use to assess its associations with onset and transitions across stages of drug use, abuse, dependence, and remission, the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys carried out cross-sectional general population surveys in 25 countries using a consistent research protocol and assessment instrument. Adults from representative household samples were interviewed face-to-face in the community in relation to drug use disorders. The surveys were conducted between 2001 and 2015, with data analysis performed from July 2017 to July 2018.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Data on the timing of onset of lifetime drug use, DSM-IV drug use disorders, and remission from these disorders was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Associations of cohort-level alcohol prevalence and drug use prevalence were examined as factors associated with these transitions.

Among the 90,027 respondents (48.1% [SE, 0.2%] men; mean [SE] age, 42.1 [0.1] years), 1 in 4 (24.8% [SE, 0.2%]) reported either illicit drug use or extramedical use of prescription drugs at some point in their lifetime, but with substantial time-space variation in this prevalence. Among users, 9.1% (SE, 0.2%) met lifetime criteria for abuse, and 5.0% (SE, 0.2%) met the criteria for dependence.

### E-cigarette use and relations to tobacco and alcohol use among adolescents [^1139g5zR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Is EC use likely to increase the risk of alcohol consumption and other drug use among minors?

For several decades, one of the most influential theories of primary prevention has been the "gateway hypothesis". The central claim of the gateway hypothesis is that substance use and abuse can be lined up in a consequential trajectory of potential harm. It further states that early initiation of conventional cigarette (CC) use is likely to increase the risk of alcohol use, particularly among minors, and may then lead to increased risks of cannabis experimentation and use, which can lead to stronger substances. This hypothetical sequence of substance use risk is especially important in minors because for every year initiation of use is delayed, the risk of consistent use and associated social developmental problems is substantially decreased. This is the central assertion of primary substance use prevention.

With regards to ECs, the critical question becomes what role, if any, EC use is likely to play in this hypothetical sequence, potentially increasing the risk of overall alcohol use and other substance use among minors? Some findings by Hughes et al. do indeed point in this direction. For example, over 9% of non-drinkers had accessed ECs, and despite statistically controlling for smoking behaviors, regular alcohol users and binge drinkers were significantly more likely to have accessed ECs. Findings from other studies show similar results. A US-based study among young adolescents showed that EC users were significantly more likely than non-users to use other substances.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with adolescent substance use in Africa, 2000 to 2020 [^114JiNs9]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Four authors (J.N. S.J. T.M., and U.K.) extracted data and methods from the included studies using a custom-made data extraction form, later embedded onto a REDCap database. Data abstraction included study samples (e.g. sample type, size, and groupings), study setting, research focus, study design, sample size, participants' age mean/range, substance type (e.g. alcohol, tobacco), determinants (reported factors associated with substance use), and a summary of results (direction, strength, and significance of a factor associated with adolescent substance use). S.J. reviewed and cross-checked data from all articles extracted by the other reviewers to gauge consistency and minimize issues of missing data.

Characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1. We conducted a narrative synthesis of results from the included studies, using a textual approach to analyze relationships within and between the included studies to provide an overall assessment of the evidence focusing on reported associations between each factor and adolescent substance use.

Our systematic review question included any type of adolescent substance use across Africa. Therefore, a narrative synthesis was an ideal approach to facilitate textual analysis of rich heterogeneous data of studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis. This methodological approach provided flexibility to systematically synthesize key findings from studies with diverse aims, designs, and methodologies. We took an inductive approach to our narrative analysis.

### Impact of adverse childhood experiences on risk for internalizing psychiatric disorders in youth at clinical high-risk for psychosis [^114CwUCJ]. Psychiatry Research (2024). High credibility.

Research has established that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) confer risk for psychiatric diagnoses, and that protective factors moderate this association. Investigation into the effect of protective factors in the relationship between ACEs and internalizing disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety) is limited in high-risk groups. The present study investigated the relationship between ACEs and risk for internalizing disorders in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) and tests the hypothesis that protective factors moderate this relationship.

Methods: 688 participants aged 12–30 (M = 18; SD = 4.05) meeting criteria for CHR-P were administered measures of child adversity, protective factors (SAVRY), and diagnostic assessment (SCID-5). Logistic regression tested whether ACEs predicted internalizing disorders. Moderation regression analyses determined whether these associations were weaker in the presence of protective factors.

Results & Conclusions: Higher levels of ACEs predicted history of depressive disorder (β = 0.26(1.30), p < .001), self-harm/suicide attempts (β = 0.34(1.40), p < .001), and substance use (β = 0.14(1.15), p = .04). Childhood sexual abuse (β = 0.77(2.15), p = .001), emotional neglect (β = 0.38(1.46), p = .05), and psychological abuse (β = 0.42(1.52), p = .04) predicted self-harm/suicide attempts. Sexual abuse (β = 1.00 (2.72), p = .001) and emotional neglect (β = 0.53(1.71), p = .011) were also linked to depressive disorder. There was no association between ACEs and anxiety disorder, and no moderation effect of protective factors.

### Characterizing the intersection of co-occurring risk factors for illicit drug abuse and dependence in a U.S. nationally representative sample [^11648G7U]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Few studies have attempted to characterize how co-occurring risk factors for substance use disorders intersect. A recent study examined this question regarding cigarette smoking and demonstrated that co-occurring risk factors generally act independently. The present study examines whether that same pattern of independent intersection of risk factors extends to illicit drug abuse/dependence using a U.S. nationally representative sample (National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2011–2013).

Logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) modeling were used to examine the risk of past-year drug abuse/dependence associated with a well-established set of risk factors for substance use (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, poverty, smoking status, alcohol abuse/dependence, mental illness). Each of these risk factors was associated with significant increases in the odds of drug abuse/dependence in univariate logistic regressions, and each remained significant in a multivariate model examining all eight risk factors simultaneously.

CART modeling of these eight risk factors identified subpopulation risk profiles wherein drug abuse/dependence prevalence varied from 80%, corresponding to differing combinations of risk factors present. Alcohol abuse/dependence and cigarette smoking had the strongest associations with drug abuse/dependence risk. These results demonstrate that co-occurring risk factors for illicit drug abuse/dependence generally intersect in the same independent manner as risk factors for cigarette smoking, underscoring further fundamental commonalities.

### Trauma and resilience in adolescents and young adults with opioid use and eating disorders [^113ANG41]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Substance use disorders and feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) often manifest in early adolescence, are difficult to treat, and tend to co-occur. Despite their co-occurrence, little is known about their shared risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted to compare standardized measures of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and protective factors among 90 adolescents and young adults seeking outpatient treatment for either opioid use disorder (OUD) or an FED. These were assessed using the Modified Adverse Childhood Experience Survey and Southern Kennebec Healthy Start Resilience Survey.

Reported ACEs were high in both groups compared with the national average, and those with OUD were more likely to endorse ≥ 4 resilience factors. Meanwhile, the prevalence of emotional neglect, household mental illness, and peer victimization/isolation/rejection was similar between groups. Opioid use disorder patients were also less likely to endorse ≥ 9 resilience factors. Health providers should be mindful to assess for trauma and resiliency in both these populations.

### The role of conduct disorder in the relationship between alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use disorders [^112ipZpG]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Genetic influences contribute significantly to co-morbidity between conduct disorder and substance use disorders. Estimating the extent of overlap can assist in the development of phenotypes for genomic analyses.

- **Method**: Multivariate quantitative genetic analyses were conducted using data from 9577 individuals, including 3982 complete twin pairs and 1613 individuals whose co-twin was not interviewed (aged 24–37 years) from two Australian twin samples. Analyses examined the genetic correlation between alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence, and cannabis abuse/dependence, and the extent to which the correlations were attributable to genetic influences shared with conduct disorder.

- **Results**: Additive genetic (a² = 0.48–0.65) and non-shared environmental factors explained variance in substance use disorders. Familial effects on conduct disorder were due to additive genetic (a² = 0.39) and shared environmental (c² = 0.15) factors. All substance use disorders were influenced by shared genetic factors (rg = 0.38–0.56), with all genetic overlap between substances attributable to genetic influences shared with conduct disorder. Genes influencing individual substance use disorders were also significant, explaining 40–73% of the genetic variance per substance.

- **Conclusions**: Among substance users in this sample, the well-documented clinical co-morbidity between conduct disorder and substance use disorders is primarily attributable to shared genetic liability. Interventions targeted at generally reducing deviant behaviors may address the risk posed by this shared genetic influence.

### Social dimensions of adolescent substance use [^112m6Ap4]. Addiction (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to explore in detail the relationship between various social aspects of young people's lives and substance use, and the differences in the degree of influence exerted by different social factors as a function of age.

The study was a survey of pupils aged 11–16 in a stratified sample of five English schools. Data from 4,516 participants were obtained in relation to their cigarette, alcohol and illicit drug use; their contact with the police; perceived academic achievements and future expectations; religious beliefs; family structure; the importance of family versus peer opinions; and suspension from school.

- **Measures**: Cumulative, age-specific preferences of substance misuse were compared. Logistic regression was used to rank the various risk factors.

- **Results**: Substantial differences were found between substance users and non-users and the various risk factors being examined. For example, of those who had only been in trouble with the police, 18.8% used illegal drugs compared with 1.6% of those who had not had police contact and who had no other risk factors. Many of these relationships were age-sensitive. For instance, the negative relationship between belief in God and illicit drug use became stronger as age increased (non-believers: y = 8.1886x - 9.16, R² = 0.9484; believers: y = 5.1514x - 8.08, R² = 0.9247). These results suggest that, within this sample of English adolescents, there was a strong relationship between substance use and the social factors examined.

### Mental health among Hispanics and Caucasians: Risk and protective factors contributing to prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders [^116rdmCm]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The study examined the one-year prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Hispanics and Caucasians in a large population sample (N = 4559) and explored factors contributing to group differences. Hispanic participants, predominantly Mexican Americans, were more likely than Caucasian participants to meet the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis in the past year. They had higher one-year prevalence rates of several anxiety disorders, faced greater challenges in meeting basic needs, and exhibited better interpersonal functioning. The problems faced by Hispanic participants in meeting basic needs partially mediated their higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders compared to Caucasian participants. Notably, better interpersonal functioning protected Hispanic participants against depression, panic, and substance use disorders. These findings underscore the importance of psychosocial variables in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders.

### A systematic review of risk factors and consequences of nyaope usage: The illicit street drug containing HIV antiretrovirals [^112HDTUL]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). Low credibility.

In the majority of studies, nyaope users were most frequently between 18 and 29 years of age, though a number of studies also demonstrated that there are nyaope users in their 30s and 40s. While those under 18 years were not eligible for inclusion in many of the studies, some indicated that nyaope usage is occurring in adolescents as young as 13 years of age.

One of the most frequent risk factors for nyaope usage was unemployment. In one study, 100% of nyaope users were unemployed. Other studies reported high unemployment rates among nyaope users at 96%, 86%, and 74%.

Prior substance use and co-substance use were notable risk factors for nyaope usage. The most commonly associated substance was cannabis, with other commonly used substances being tobacco and alcohol. One study found that 52% of nyaope users previously used cannabis, 13% used cigarettes, and 14% used other drugs. Another study indicated that 92.9% of nyaope users were concurrently using alcohol and nicotine regularly, and 92.9% were using cannabis. The same study found that 100% of participants were using opioids.

Limited education, particularly a lack of secondary education completion, was a common risk factor for nyaope use. Other discussed risk factors included peer pressure, being HIV-positive, limited familial support, and having a Black racial background.

### Risk factors for methamphetamine use in youth: A systematic review [^117Xuojr]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

This systematic review presents the best-available evidence regarding risk factors for methamphetamine (MA) use among youth. An exhaustive search of over 40 electronic databases, grey literature, and hand searching identified 12 unique studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies (9 out of 12) were cross-sectional in design, and therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the risk factors precede or follow MA use.

Because we believe that factors associated with MA use may differ among socially integrated (i.e. low-risk) and marginalized (i.e. high-risk) youth, we chose to analyze these studies separately. Compared to low-risk youth, there were some clear patterns of risk factors associated with MA use. A history of engaging in a variety of risky behaviors, such as sexual activity (planned, unplanned, or under the influence of alcohol), alcohol consumption, and opiate use, was significantly associated with MA use among low-risk youth. Engaging in high-risk behavior may be a gateway for MA use, or vice versa. Homosexual or bisexual lifestyle is also a risk factor. This is not surprising, as MA is believed to heighten sexual pleasure, and gay and bisexual men cite this as a reason for using MA. A history of a psychiatric disorder, particularly adjustment disorder, conduct disorder, or ADHD, is a risk factor for MA use. This is consistent with previous research that indicates psychiatric conditions are risk factors for drug use in general.

Several risk factors were associated with MA use among high-risk youth, i.e. those that used other illicit drugs.

### Hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorders [^113ecBt4]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2022). Low credibility.

Alcohol is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive drugs globally. Hazardous drinking, defined by quantity and frequency of consumption, is associated with acute and chronic morbidity. Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are psychiatric syndromes characterized by impaired control over drinking and other symptoms. Contemporary etiological perspectives on AUDs apply a biopsychosocial framework that emphasizes the interplay of genetics, neurobiology, psychology, and an individual's social and societal context.

There is strong evidence that AUDs are genetically influenced, but with a complex polygenic architecture. Likewise, there is robust evidence for environmental influences, such as adverse childhood exposures and maladaptive developmental trajectories. Well-established biological and psychological determinants of AUDs include neuroadaptive changes following persistent use, differences in brain structure and function, and motivational determinants including overvaluation of alcohol reinforcement, acute effects of environmental triggers and stress, elevations in multiple facets of impulsivity, and lack of alternative reinforcers.

- **Social factors**: Include bidirectional roles of social networks and sociocultural influences, such as public health control strategies and social determinants of health.

An array of evidence-based approaches for reducing alcohol harms is available, including screening, pharmacotherapies, psychological interventions, and policy strategies, but these methods are substantially underused. Priorities for the field include translating advances in basic biobehavioral research.

### Clinical vulnerability for severity and mortality by COVID-19 among users of alcohol and other substances [^111SS2DE]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency. Individuals with substance use disorder have a higher risk of infection and may suffer from more severe forms of the disease. Our goal is to investigate the prevalence of risk factors for COVID-19 severity in individuals with different substance use and explore whether specific types of substances are potentially associated with more clinical risk factors, which could increase morbimortality in this population. The sample included 821 men hospitalized at an inpatient addiction unit (305 alcohol users, 233 cocaine/crack users, and 283 multiusers). Data were collected using the Addiction Severity Index version 6.

The most prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 severity observed in our sample were smoking (82.5%), arterial hypertension (26.6%), respiratory problems (23.4%), and a history of homelessness (25.1%). Arterial hypertension and cirrhosis occurred more frequently among alcohol users. Multiusers lived on the streets longer and had a higher prevalence of HIV than alcohol users. Overall, 28% of the sample had three or more risk factors. The frequency of risk factors was high, and this scenario suggests that these individuals could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 prognosis. Therefore, prevention strategies directed at specific characteristics of substance users merit attention during the pandemic.

### Sex differences in first-admission psychiatric inpatients with and without a comorbid substance use disorder [^114spcNC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We assessed sex differences in a sample of first-admission psychiatric inpatients with and without comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) to identify possible risk factors and targets for sex-tailored treatment interventions.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study of first admissions to the University Psychiatry Ward, "Maggiore della Carità" Hospital, Novara, Italy, between 2003 and 2012 was accomplished. The clinical charts of patients with (N = 362) and without comorbid SUD (N = 1111) were reviewed.

- **Results**: Differences in employment, educational, and marital statuses were found between male and female psychiatric patients with and without comorbid SUD. Having a degree was a protective factor for males, whereas it was a risk factor for females. Being divorced and having family problems were both risk factors for comorbidity in females. Regarding the diagnosis, results overlapped in males and females, and both affective and other disorders were risk factors for a comorbid SUD.

- **Conclusions**: A significant difference between male and female psychiatric patients with a comorbid SUD was the males' overall poorer psychosocial functioning. Marital status and family problems were risk factors for comorbid SUD in females. Both males and females showed various pathways of access to and choices of substances and, eventually, experienced different impacts on their lives. Hospitalization might help to set up a targeted intervention for patients with comorbidity, while accounting for sex differences. With respect to males, a treatment approach focused on the substance alone might be effective.

### Prevention and risk of adolescent substance abuse. The role of adolescents, families, and communities [^114CZZ7F]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Adolescents as young as 12 to 14 years of age are engaging in substance use [16]. Those who use substances are at risk for immediate and future consequences that affect morbidity and mortality. Theoretical models of substance use in adolescents provide a framework for understanding risk and protective factors, which are pertinent to all contexts, including individual traits, interpersonal relationships, and greater society.

Knowledge of these factors should assist clinicians in assessing individual adolescents and providing appropriate interventions. In primary prevention, clinicians can advocate for families and communities to teach children how to be more goal-oriented, insightful, and in tune with their cultures and beliefs. Parents can be encouraged to set clear limits, monitor their adolescents' behaviors, be good role models, and provide a loving and supportive environment.

Advocacy to address societal factors that are less easily changed, such as media portrayal of drug use, availability of substances, and poverty, also has its place. Addressing these issues would have a broad impact on the problem of adolescent substance use and help improve the health status of many adolescents in the United States.

### Specificity in genetic and environmental risk for prescription opioid misuse and heroin use [^113KFk9T]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Multivariate twin studies have demonstrated that liability for drug use can be accounted for by both a general propensity for any drug use and some amount of drug-specific influence, though most, if not all, such studies have utilized an aggregated opioid use phenotype. Genetic and common environmental influences on opioid use appear to be attributable to liability shared with cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogen, sedative, and stimulant use. However, the magnitude of genetic and common environmental influence on opioid use, identified in these studies, varies (3–37% and 17–40%, respectively). There also appears to be opioid-specific unique environmental influence (13–29% of the phenotypic variance). Conversely, a DSM-III opioid abuse phenotype was found to have substantial drug-specific genetic influence (38% of the phenotypic variance) as well as drug-specific unique environmental influence (12% of the phenotypic variance). It remains unclear whether these patterns of findings would hold for prescription opioid misuse (POM) and heroin use individually.

Multivariate twin studies have also identified two distinct sets of genetic risk factors for substance use, with one predisposing to licit use (alcohol, caffeine, nicotine) and the other to illicit use (cannabis, cocaine), with some degree of shared genetic risk across these two factors. It is not immediately obvious whether prescription misuse behaviors are more aptly operationalized as 'licit' or 'illicit' use, given that prescription drugs are conditionally legal to obtain.

### What causes the onset of psychosis in individuals at clinical high risk? A meta-analysis of risk and protective factors [^116ATzXw]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). High credibility.

This meta-analysis systematically examines the risk and protective factors associated with the onset of psychosis in individuals identified as being at clinical high risk.

- **Study subjects**: The study reviewed and synthesized data from multiple studies involving individuals considered to be at a heightened risk for developing psychosis.
- **Factors assessed**: Various environmental, genetic, and personal factors were analyzed to understand their role in either exacerbating or mitigating the risk of psychosis.
- **Findings and implications**: The findings provide critical insights into potential intervention strategies that may be implemented to reduce the risk of psychosis in vulnerable populations.

By identifying key factors, this research contributes to the development of targeted preventative measures in mental health settings.

### Associations of child and adolescent anxiety with later alcohol use and disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^116fKq6h]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

There is considerable clinical and research interest in determining the nature of associations between anxiety and alcohol disorders, including their strength and direction, given the substantial health, social, and economic costs associated with both conditions. However, despite a wealth of observational evidence, the relationship between anxiety and alcohol use remains unclear.

Different theories exist regarding the temporal sequence and directionality of the relationship, and evidence is inconsistent. First, the self-medication hypothesis suggests that anxious individuals consume alcohol to alleviate their physiological and emotional reactivity. Secondly, anxiety may be protective due to social withdrawal, fear of negative consequences associated with drinking, and concerns about cognitive or behavioral impairment. Thirdly, chronic alcohol use may cause anxiety, via biological or psychosocial mechanisms. Finally, there may be no causal relationship between anxiety and alcohol use; any associations found may be a product of shared risk factors or confounding.

There are several possible explanations as to why the literature is conflicting. First, anxiety is heterogeneous; different anxiety disorders or symptoms may be associated with unique patterns of drinking. For example, Fröjd and colleagues found general anxiety was associated with a higher incidence of frequent alcohol use; however, social phobia was associated with a lower incidence. Furthermore, Nichter & Chassin found that adolescent physiological anxiety increased the.

### Exploring the relationship between genetic and environmental influences on initiation and progression of substance use [^117Qey9N]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

It appears that there is an underlying aetiology of alcohol problem use that overlaps partially with the initiation of alcohol use. Given the high prevalence of the initiation of alcohol use, it may be more resource-effective to target interventions at the development of more serious alcohol use rather than trying to prevent alcohol use completely within this age group. However, the results from analyses of both marijuana use and cigarette use suggest that it may be more important to intervene to stop the initiation of use, as the risk factors influencing initiation will also influence progression to more serious use.

### Risk and protective factors for self-harm in adolescents and young adults: An umbrella review of systematic reviews [^1122BV91]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). High credibility.

We conducted an umbrella review to synthesize the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses that examined the risk and protective factors for self-harm in young people. We searched six different databases and used the AMSTAR-2 checklist for quality assessment. The importance of each risk and protective factor was determined based on (1) the number of times it was identified by general reviews examining any risk or protective factor, and (2) the effect sizes from meta-analyses. There were 61 systematic reviews included in this review.

The most frequently identified risk factors for self-harm in young people included childhood abuse, depression/anxiety, bullying, trauma, psychiatric illnesses, substance use/abuse, parental divorce, poor family relationships, lack of friends, and exposure to self-harm behavior in others. The risk factors with the strongest evidence for an association with self-harm were behavioral disorders, personality disorders, and depression or anxiety.

There was a dearth of systematic reviews examining protective factors, but good family/friend relationships were most frequently identified. There was also evidence to show that non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm shared many of the same risk factors.

Clinicians and other professionals who work with young people should be particularly cognizant of the psychiatric and adverse life event risk factors as well as the substance use, education-related, and individual-level (e.g. being LGB) risk factors for self-harm. Knowledge of risk factors for self-harm can potentially be used to inform the design and implementation of prevention and intervention strategies.

### Specificity of genetic and environmental risk factors for use and abuse/dependence of cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants, and opiates in male twins [^112yXB8y]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Data on the use and misuse of six classes of illicit substances by male twin pairs were used to examine whether genetic and shared environmental risk factors for substance use disorders are substance-specific or nonspecific in their effect.

- **Method**: Lifetime history of use and abuse/dependence of cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants, and opiates was assessed through personal interviews in both members of 1,196 male-male twin pairs ascertained by the Virginia Twin Registry. Multivariate twin modeling of substance-nonspecific (common) and substance-specific genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental risk factors was performed using the program Mx.

- **Results**: High levels of comorbidity involving the different substance categories were observed for both use and abuse/dependence. One common genetic factor was found to have a strong influence on risk for illicit use and abuse/dependence for all six substance classes. A modest influence of substance-specific genetic factors was seen for use but not for abuse/dependence. Shared environmental factors were more important for use than for abuse/dependence and were mediated entirely through a single common factor.

- **Conclusions**: In an adult population-based sample of male twins, both the genetic and the shared environmental effects on risk for the use and misuse of six classes of illicit substances were largely or entirely nonspecific in their effect. Environmental experiences unique to the person largely determine whether predisposed individuals will use or misuse one class of psychoactive substances.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with adolescent substance use in Africa, 2000 to 2020 [^116BsVAh]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Three themes were identified that described a link between adolescent substance use and social, economic, and environmental risk factors: (1) SES, (2) exposure to violence, and (3) advertisements of substances.

- **Socio-environmental determinants**: Few articles explored SES as a factor associated with adolescent substance use. In Ramsoomar et al, SES was significantly associated with adolescent alcohol use, with low SES related to higher alcohol use. Kapito‐Tembo et al. and Harrabi et al. found contrasting results with tobacco smoking. In their studies, adolescents who received pocket money were more likely to be smokers than those who did not receive pocket money. The higher the monthly pocket money, the higher the likelihood of the adolescent being a smoker. Itanyi et al. also found that in schools set in rural areas, high SES increased the odds of smoking (OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.03–1.96), but this was not the case in urban schools. Students of high SES in urban schools had lower odds of being smokers.

- **Exposure to violence**: Exposure to violence, physical abuse, and a history of abuse or neglect was associated with substance use among adolescents in a few articles. In Kabiru et al, twice as many respondents reporting physical abuse in childhood (12%) reported being drunk compared to those reporting no physical abuse (6%). In Magidson et al, exposure to violence was associated with alcohol use for both male and female adolescents. The high rates of violence were associated with substance use in this population.

### Suicidal risk and protective factors in major affective disorders: A prospective cohort study of 4307 participants [^116ge8Ea]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Suicidal behavior is strongly associated with major affective disorders, but there is a need to quantify and compare specific risk and protective factors in bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD).

- **Methods**: In 4,307 extensively evaluated major affective disorder participants with BD (n = 1,425) or MDD (n = 2,882) diagnosed by international criteria, we compared characteristics among those with versus without suicidal acts from illness onset through 8.24 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: Suicidal acts were identified in 11.4% of participants; 25.9% were violent and 6.92% (0.79% of all participants) were fatal. Associated risk factors included diagnosis (BD > MDD), manic/psychotic features in first episodes, family history of suicide or BD, separation/divorce, early abuse, young age at illness onset, female sex with BD, substance abuse, higher irritable, cyclothymic or dysthymic temperament ratings, greater long-term morbidity, and lower intake functional ratings. Protective factors included marriage, co-occurring anxiety disorder, higher ratings of hyperthymic temperament, and depressive first episodes. Based on multivariable logistic regression, five factors remained significantly and independently associated with suicidal acts: BD diagnosis, more time depressed during prospective follow-up, younger age at onset, lower functional status at intake, and women > men with BD.

- **Limitations**: Reported findings may or may not apply consistently in other cultures and locations.

- **Conclusions**: Suicidal acts, including violent acts and suicides, were more prevalent.

### BAP updated guidelines: Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance abuse, harmful use, addiction and comorbidity: Recommendations from BAP [^116nT1dR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with opioid use disorder, BAP 2012 guidelines recommend insufficient evidence to favor either methadone maintenance therapy or buprenorphine maintenance therapy for patients using both opioids and cocaine.

### Restoril [^1154kFKJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Warning: Risks from concomitant use with opioids; abuse, misuse, and addiction; and dependence and withdrawal reactions**: The use of Restoril in conjunction with opioids increases the risk of severe side effects, including profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. There is a significant potential for the abuse, misuse, and addiction of Restoril, which can lead to overdose or death. Patients using this medication may develop a physical dependence, and sudden cessation or rapid dose reduction can result in withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring and proper instructions should be given to minimize these risks.

### Drug overdose deaths among persons aged 10–19 years - United States, July 2019-December 2021 [^112BfP9Y]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately 41% of decedents had evidence of mental health conditions or treatment; mental health conditions are known risk factors for substance use. Adolescent mental health was declared a national emergency in 2021 by multiple professional organizations, and approximately one-third of adolescents reported poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coinciding with the pandemic's onset, overdose deaths among adolescents continued to increase during January–June 2020, possibly related to declining mental health. Known mental health conditions represent important opportunities for parents, guardians, clinicians, teachers, or other care providers to prevent initiation or recognize signs of substance use.

- **Substance use prevention**: Protective factors for substance use in adolescents include family engagement, parent and guardian disapproval of substance use, and school connectedness; promoting these might help prevent overdoses. In addition, implementing programs to prevent adverse childhood experiences that predispose adolescents to risk for substance use should be considered.

Among decedents, substance use disorder treatment was rare. Effective substance use disorder treatments for adolescents include psychosocial treatments, such as family-based and cognitive behavioral therapy, and medications for opioid use disorder. Given the potential for co-occurring mental health conditions and substance use disorders, integrated treatment approaches might reduce overdose risk.

### Nativity and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders among Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and non-Latino whites in the United States: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions [^115e8e1V]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

This study examined the risk of lifetime substance use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders between Island-born Puerto Ricans, foreign-born Cuban Americans, and foreign-born non-Latino whites and their U.S.-born counterparts. Data from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; N = 43,093) were used to derive lifetime prevalence rates of specific DSM-IV psychiatric disorders by subethnicity and nativity group. Logistic regression models were constructed to detect variation in the odds of each psychiatric disorder across groups.

A protective effect of foreign-born nativity in risk for psychiatric disorders was present for all groups but varied according to the assessed disorder. For non-Latino whites, the effect was observed for most specific psychiatric disorders, whereas, for Puerto Ricans and Cuban Americans, the effect was only evident for specific substance use disorders.

The protective effect of nativity against psychiatric morbidity found in other studies among Mexican Americans and non-Latino whites does not entirely generalize to Puerto Ricans and Cuban Americans and may not generalize to individuals of other origins. The results of this study are discussed in terms of potential mechanisms involved in variations in the risk of specific psychiatric disorders among groups defined by nativity and race-ethnicity and the importance of identifying specific cultural components that may serve as risk and protective factors of psychiatric morbidity.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1145rnA7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly in relation to pregnant and postpartum patients, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend paying particular attention to factors impacting pregnancy and fetal development. This is essential when screening for acute issues, complications, and sequelae associated with stimulant use in pregnant patients.

### Factors associated with sexual risks and risk of STIs, HIV and other blood-borne viruses among women using heroin and other drugs: A systematic literature review [^115bmBw4]. AIDS and Behavior (2019). Low credibility.

There was a significant amount of missing and heterogeneous data within the included papers. The sample characteristics presented are based on the available data only. The review included 11,305 women based on all papers but one, in which the number of female participants was not specified. The mean age was 31 years (SD = 5.11). The ethnic distribution was 25.5% African American, 22.5% Latin/Hispanic, 18.6% Indigenous Australian, 15.4% White/Caucasian, 11.6% Asian, 4.9% Indigenous (North American), and 1.5% from non-specified ethnicities.

Heroin was used by 44.6% of women, followed by methadone (22.3%), cocaine and/or crack cocaine (21.7%), methamphetamine (16.8%), alcohol (7.6%), speedball (3.2%), cannabis (2.3%), tobacco (1%), liquefied opium/opium (0.2%), inhalants (0.2%), and heroin together with other narcotics (0.2%).

Data on sexual orientation from seven papers indicated that 78.3% of women were heterosexual, and 21.7% were lesbian or bisexual. Additional data revealed that 47.8% of women were married, in common-law, or cohabiting; 25% were single; 24% were separated, divorced, or widowed; and 3.2% had a non-specified marital status.

Over a third of women (34.9%) had been homeless at some point in the last year, and 41.5% had been homeless at some point in their lives. More than half (58.2%) had been in prison. Most women engaged in transactional sex at the time they participated in the studies (89.6%), 6.1% at some point in the previous year, and 4.3% had exchanged sex for money and/or drugs.

### Addiction as a systems failure: Focus on adolescence and smoking [^117SZJ7L]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Scientific advances in the field of addiction have permanently debunked the notion that addiction reflects a character flaw under voluntary control, demonstrating instead that it is a bona fide disease of the brain. The aim of this review is to go beyond this consensus understanding and explore the vast evidence regarding the numerous genetic, developmental, and environmental factors whose complex interactions modulate addiction risk and trajectory.

- **Method**: Focusing on childhood and adolescent smoking as a paradigm, we review the important risk factors for the development of addictions, starting at the level of genetics and concluding with a focus on sociocultural and policy factors.

- **Results**: A critical review of the pertinent literature provides a detailed view of the cumulative power of risk and protection factors across different phenomenological levels to modulate the risk of undesirable outcomes, particularly for young people. This represents a compelling argument for the need to engage in comprehensive, multilevel approaches to promoting health.

- **Conclusions**: Today, the field of medicine understands more about disease than about health; however, it need not be that way. Viewing drug addiction as a systems failure should help refocus our general approach to developing dynamic models and early comprehensive interventions that optimize the ways in which we prevent and treat a complex developmental disorder such as drug addiction.

### Clinical risk factors in SUDEP: A nationwide population-based case-control study [^111pYAyL]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Other risk factors could be hidden, and sleeping alone may serve as a marker for fewer social connections or networks. Our study identified substance abuse as a risk factor that can be linked to a reduced social network. Further research is needed in this area.

Early case-control studies identified polytherapy with AEDs as a risk factor for SUDEP. However, when data from four case-control studies were pooled, polytherapy was no longer a risk factor after adjusting for GTCS frequency. We did observe an excess risk in individuals with polytherapy; nevertheless, once we adjusted for GTCS, both monotherapy and polytherapy were associated with a reduced risk of SUDEP. These findings align with a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized add-on trials in refractory epilepsy, which demonstrated a substantially lower SUDEP risk among those randomized to adjunctive active treatment compared to placebo. A major limitation of this meta-analysis was the inability to adjust for GTCS frequency. Our results indicate that AEDs may offer protective effects beyond seizure-controlling properties. These potential mechanisms warrant further exploration.

Several studies have noted a reduced SUDEP risk following successful epilepsy surgery. We could not confirm these findings due to small sample sizes in our analyses. Additionally, treatment with VNS was associated with a reduced risk of SUDEP. While a possible protective effect of VNS has been previously discussed, our data should be interpreted with caution given the limited numbers.

Comorbid mental health disorders have previously been associated with an excess risk of SUDEP.

### Prevention of substance abuse: A brief overview [^111aUZby]. World Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Recent advances in psychosocial research and neurosciences have provided new avenues for the prevention of substance abuse at both the individual and community levels. A series of risk and protective factors affecting the likelihood of using and abusing substances have been identified. The scope of prevention has been broadened, allowing for the prescription of different interventions for individuals according to their varying degrees of vulnerability to substance experimentation, continuous use, and dependence. An increased awareness of comorbidity between mental and substance use disorders provides an arena for prevention within psychiatry and related disciplines. Emphasis on program evaluation has helped identify cost-effective programs and policies. The integration of prevention within healthy lifestyle policies and programs, including interventions at the school, family, and community levels, is more likely to produce the desired outcomes.

### Risk factors for clinically recognized opioid abuse and dependence among veterans using opioids for chronic non-cancer pain [^115Vq77v]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

A central question in prescribing opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is how to best balance the risk of opioid abuse and dependence with the benefits of pain relief. To achieve this balance, clinicians need an understanding of the risk factors for opioid abuse, an issue that is only partially understood. We conducted a secondary data analysis of regional VA longitudinal administrative data (years 2000–2005) for chronic users of opioids for CNCP (n = 15,160) to investigate risk factors for the development of clinically recognized (i.e. diagnosed) opioid abuse or dependence among these individuals.

- **Risk factors investigated**: We analyzed four broad groups of possible risk factors:
	1. Non-opioid substance abuse disorders
	2. Painful physical health disorders
	3. Mental health disorders
	4. Socio-demographic factors

In adjusted models, a diagnosis of non-opioid substance abuse was the strongest predictor of opioid abuse/dependence (OR = 2.34, p < 0.001). Mental health disorders were moderately strong predictors (OR = 1.46, p = 0.005) of opioid abuse/dependence. However, the prevalence of mental health disorders was much higher than the prevalence of non-opioid substance abuse disorders (45.3% vs. 7.6%) among users of opioids for CNCP, suggesting that mental health disorders account for more of the population attributable risk for opioid abuse than does non-opioid substance abuse.

- **Demographical insights**: Males, younger adults, and individuals with greater days supply of prescription opioids dispensed in 2002 were more likely to develop opioid abuse/dependence. Clinicians need to carefully screen for substance abuse and other related risk factors to mitigate these issues effectively.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^116ufcmb]. APA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for posttraumatic stress disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with substance use disorder, APA 2025 guidelines recommend offering the following trauma-focused treatments along with the usual treatment for substance use disorder in patients with PTSD and comorbid substance use disorder:

- **Trauma-focused CBT**: Treatment of PTSD and substance use disorders.
- **Prolonged exposure**: Prolonged exposure plus usual treatment for substance use disorder, trauma-focused CBT, plus usual treatment for substance use disorder.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114HRUBB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for stimulant use disorder, particularly with respect to brief interventions, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend recognizing the unique motivators of stimulant use. It is essential to prepare to discuss and suggest safer alternatives as part of these brief interventions. Examples include addressing use related to chemsex, weight loss, academic or work performance, and staying awake.
