laryngitis symptoms

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about laryngitis symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about triage and red flags that mandate urgent ENT or ED evaluation. Then, I should structure a focused history and physical exam to define acuity, risk factors, and likely etiologies. Next, I need to lay out initial conservative therapy and specify when to escalate to laryngoscopy. After that, I must address what not to do (avoid empiric antibiotics, PPIs, and steroids) and the reflux controversy. Then, I will organize targeted management by etiology, special populations, and diagnostic testing strategy. Finally, I will plan follow-up, documentation, and surgical indications, weaving in any needed self-corrections and double-checks with high-quality guidelines throughout [^114c5WSv] [^112Y5bq4] [^111PEBKz] [^115gKHPb].

> Let me first confirm red flags and triage because airway threats cannot wait; urgent ENT evaluation (within 24 hours) or ED care is indicated for respiratory distress, stridor, drooling with severe odynophagia suggesting epiglottitis, a concomitant neck mass, recent head/neck/chest surgery or intubation, hemoptysis, immunocompromise, rapidly progressive symptoms, or persistent symptoms in a tobacco user, and these require expedited laryngeal visualization and airway assessment, so I need to ensure these are screened upfront [^114c5WSv] [^112kFgVy] [^117J51CR].

> Wait, let me verify how I should classify duration to guide urgency; acute is less than 3 weeks, subacute around 3 to 4 weeks, and chronic beyond 4 weeks, with chronic dysphonia triggering laryngoscopy, while the history must include voice use patterns, recent URI, reflux symptoms, allergic rhinitis, medication triggers (ACE inhibitors, antipsychotics, inhaled steroids), smoking/alcohol use, occupational exposures, and any recent intubation or surgery because these contextual factors guide both etiology and the threshold for expedited evaluation [^112Y5bq4] [^114c5WSv] [^117S4WTZ] [^114G3fQb].

> I need to check the exam priorities next; I will assess for respiratory distress and stridor, palpate for neck masses or lymphadenopathy, examine nasal/oropharyngeal mucosa, and note laryngeal tenderness or systemic clues because the physical exam helps identify patients needing urgent laryngoscopy and informs whether to defer imaging until after visualization given guideline recommendations against pre-laryngoscopy imaging in primary voice complaints [^114c5WSv] [^111PEBKz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I solidify first-line conservative care; for non–red-flag acute cases I will recommend relative voice rest (avoid whispering), hydration, avoidance of irritants like smoke and alcohol, analgesia as needed, and vocal hygiene, and I should remember that humidification is reasonable for comfort in acute laryngitis, but for pediatric croup specifically, humidified air is not recommended to improve symptoms, so I need to separate those scenarios clearly when counselling [^112Y5bq4] [^114c5WSv] [^111hXgFF] [^111Bvy4k].

> Hmm, wait a minute, is the timing for laryngoscopy 2 weeks or 4 weeks; let me verify and reconcile this because it affects triage for persistent hoarseness, and I recall that the AAO-HNSF update recommends laryngoscopy if dysphonia fails to resolve or improve within 4 weeks or earlier if a serious cause is suspected, whereas AAFP suggests considering laryngoscopy beyond 2 weeks if no benign cause is apparent, so I will harmonize this as: visualize at 4 weeks for all non-improving dysphonia and earlier (often by 2 weeks) for high-risk patients such as smokers, professional voice users, or those with red flags [^117J51CR] [^112WKxTg] [^114c5WSv] [^112kFgVy].

> I should double-check what to avoid empirically; antibiotics should not be used for routine empirical treatment of laryngitis or hoarseness in the absence of a specific bacterial indication, corticosteroids should be avoided empirically without a defined indication, and PPIs should not be started empirically for isolated dysphonia without laryngeal visualization or objective reflux evidence because most acute laryngitis is viral and the reflux-laryngitis link is often over-attributed with weak predictive testing [^112Y5bq4] [^11195uXW] [^1117rjdw] [^115P8MeE].

> Let me consider the reflux controversy carefully because misattribution is common; there is poor correlation between symptoms, laryngeal signs, and pharyngeal reflux events, and randomized data show no significant advantage of PPIs over placebo for laryngeal symptom relief in many patients, so for extraesophageal symptoms without typical GERD features I should obtain reflux testing before empiric PPI, while in the presence of typical GERD symptoms I can consider a time-limited BID PPI trial for 8 to 12 weeks, followed by endoscopy off PPI and reflux monitoring if no response, keeping in mind that salivary pepsin testing is not recommended [^114cxmWb] [^116J2J7m] [^114V3oNW] [^115r3u6h] [^113gHnmk] [^115gKHPb] [^116HKgmi].

> Next, I should review targeted management by likely etiology; for presumed viral laryngitis I will continue conservative measures and limit testing to situations where results change management, for reflux-suspected cases I will apply the reflux testing/limited PPI trial algorithm plus lifestyle measures, for voice overuse I will prioritize vocal hygiene and refer for voice therapy after visualization, for allergic rhinitis I will use intranasal steroids and antihistamines, for occupational etiologies I will address exposure reduction and protection, and for ILO/EILO I will confirm with laryngoscopy when feasible and direct to speech-language therapy within an MDT because empiric SLT without visualization risks over- and under-treatment [^114c5WSv] [^116M4mV3] [^117S4WTZ] [^113jxU9A] [^115rcZKF] [^111q9pFz].

> But wait, what about special populations; in pediatrics I should diagnose croup clinically and avoid routine diagnostic testing or humidified air for moderate croup, while considering HSV in prolonged or atypical croup requiring laryngoscopy, and in immunocompromised patients I will lower the threshold for laryngoscopy and consider atypical infections like HSV and cryptococcus given their propensity to cause persistent hoarseness, and for professional voice users I will expedite visualization and early voice therapy because occupational impact warrants earlier escalation [^112UE74N] [^111Bvy4k] [^112jLifi] [^112fWHcM] [^114c5WSv].

> I will now examine the diagnostic testing sequence to avoid unnecessary imaging; laryngoscopy is the cornerstone for persistent or complicated cases, reflux testing is reserved for extraesophageal symptoms without classic GERD or after failure of an appropriate PPI trial when GERD is suspected, influenza testing is considered in-season or for high-risk or hospitalized patients when results change management, and I must avoid CT/MRI before visualizing the larynx in primary voice complaints unless airway compromise dictates otherwise, because pre-visualization imaging often misleads and delays definitive assessment [^117J51CR] [^115gKHPb] [^112cnK2n] [^114rdPUx] [^11591Brc] [^111PEBKz].

> Hold on, I should verify appropriate follow-up and documentation cadence; for acute cases I will reassess in 2 to 4 weeks, continue conservative measures if improving, and proceed to laryngoscopy if not improving or at 4 weeks total, documenting symptom trajectory, impact on quality of life, and communication with SLP if voice therapy is initiated because outcomes tracking is a guideline expectation and supports timely diagnostic revision when initial impressions prove incorrect [^114c5WSv] [^111kp2bW] [^115ARzVs].

> Let me reconsider surgical indications to ensure I am not missing structural disease; I will refer for surgery when malignancy is suspected, when symptomatic benign vocal fold lesions fail conservative/voice therapy, for glottic insufficiency, or when structural abnormalities cause airway compromise, and although I initially wrote "AAAO-HNSF", I should correct myself to "AAO-HNSF" for the guideline source while noting that active inflammatory states may influence surgical timing but should not supersede the primary indications [^115rXR6m] [^114c5WSv] [^115XookA].

> Finally, I need to ensure diagnostic humility given high rates of revised diagnoses after visualization; I will avoid anchoring on LPR or "no abnormality" before seeing the larynx because nearly half of incoming diagnoses can change on re-evaluation, reinforcing the central role of timely laryngoscopy and multidisciplinary coordination to optimize accuracy and outcomes [^115ARzVs] [^114c5WSv].

Laryngitis symptoms include **hoarseness or voice loss** [^115Kouqr], sore throat, dry cough, throat clearing, and a globus sensation [^114c5WSv] [^112Y5bq4]. Additional features can include dysphagia, odynophagia, stridor, and respiratory distress, especially in **severe or chronic cases** [^111hXgFF] [^114c5WSv]. Symptoms typically resolve within 1–2 weeks; persistent hoarseness beyond 2–4 weeks [^117J51CR] or red flags (stridor, respiratory distress, hemoptysis, weight loss, or risk factors such as smoking) [^112kFgVy] warrant laryngoscopic evaluation [^112WKxTg].

---

## Common symptoms of laryngitis

The **most frequently reported symptoms** of laryngitis include:

- **Hoarseness or dysphonia**: Altered voice quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort, often impairing communication and quality of life [^115Kouqr] [^114c5WSv].

- **Aphonia**: Complete loss of voice, particularly in severe cases [^112Y5bq4].

- **Sore throat or throat pain**: Commonly associated with inflammation of the larynx [^1123zutV] [^114c5WSv].

- **Dry cough**: Often persistent and irritating [^111hXgFF].

- **Throat clearing**: Frequent need to clear the throat due to irritation or mucus accumulation [^116J2J7m].

- **Globus sensation**: Feeling of a lump or foreign body in the throat [^11678bsB].

- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing, particularly in chronic or severe cases [^114c5WSv].

- **Odynophagia**: Painful swallowing, less common but possible [^114c5WSv].

- **Stridor**: High-pitched, wheezing sound during breathing, indicating airway obstruction, more common in pediatric cases or severe inflammation [^114c5WSv] [^112UE74N] [^112qhcMW].

- **Respiratory distress**: Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, particularly in severe cases or when airway obstruction occurs [^114c5WSv] [^112kFgVy].

---

## Acute vs. chronic laryngitis symptoms

Laryngitis can be classified as **acute or chronic** [^114c5WSv] [^111hXgFF], with differing symptom profiles:

| **Symptom** | **Acute laryngitis** | **Chronic laryngitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Hoarseness | Common, sudden onset | Persistent, lasting > 3 weeks |
| Aphonia | Possible, sudden onset | Rare, gradual onset |
| Sore throat | Common, sudden onset | Persistent, mild |
| Dry cough | Common, sudden onset | Persistent, chronic |
| Throat clearing | Common, sudden onset | Persistent, chronic |
| Globus sensation | Rare | Common, persistent |
| Dysphagia | Rare | Common, persistent |
| Odynophagia | Possible, sudden onset | Rare |
| Stridor | Possible, sudden onset | Rare |
| Respiratory distress | Possible, sudden onset | Rare |

---

## Symptoms associated with specific causes of laryngitis

Laryngitis can result from **various causes**, each associated with specific symptom profiles:

- **Viral laryngitis**: Hoarseness, sore throat, dry cough, mild fever, nasal congestion, and fatigue [^111hXgFF] [^1123zutV].

- **Bacterial laryngitis**: Hoarseness, sore throat, fever, productive cough, and systemic symptoms.

- **Allergic laryngitis**: Hoarseness, throat clearing, globus sensation, nasal congestion, and sneezing [^114c5WSv].

- **Reflux laryngitis (LPR)**: Hoarseness, throat clearing, globus sensation, chronic cough, heartburn, and regurgitation [^114c5WSv] [^115gKHPb].

- **Occupational laryngitis**: Hoarseness, throat irritation, cough, and voice fatigue, often related to workplace exposures [^114G3fQb] [^117S4WTZ].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Certain symptoms associated with laryngitis indicate potentially serious underlying conditions and **require immediate medical evaluation**:

- **Persistent hoarseness**: Lasting longer than two weeks without an apparent benign cause [^112Y5bq4].

- **Stridor or respiratory distress**: Indicating potential airway obstruction [^114c5WSv] [^112UE74N].

- **Hemoptysis**: Coughing up blood.

- **Severe dysphagia or odynophagia**: Difficulty or pain swallowing, particularly if progressive.

- **Unintentional weight loss**: Suggesting possible malignancy or systemic illness.

- **History of tobacco or alcohol use**: Increasing risk of malignancy [^112kFgVy].

- **Recent head, neck, or chest surgery or intubation**: Indicating potential structural injury or complication [^112kFgVy].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of laryngitis symptoms

The diagnostic evaluation of laryngitis symptoms typically begins with a clinical history and physical examination to identify underlying causes and factors that may modify management [^112kFgVy]. Laryngoscopy is recommended if **dysphonia persists beyond four weeks** or if a serious underlying cause is suspected [^117J51CR]. Viral testing for influenza is recommended during influenza season or in high-risk patients [^11591Brc] [^112cnK2n]. Reflux testing may be considered in patients with suspected reflux laryngitis, particularly if symptoms persist despite empirical treatment [^115gKHPb] [^113gHnmk].

---

## Management of laryngitis symptoms

Management of laryngitis symptoms depends on the underlying cause and severity; **voice rest and vocal hygiene** are essential for reducing inflammation and promoting healing [^112WKxTg]. Empiric antibiotics are not recommended without evidence of bacterial infection [^112Y5bq4] [^113SwLrq]; corticosteroids are not recommended without evidence of underlying inflammatory conditions [^11195uXW]; and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are not recommended for empiric treatment without evidence of reflux [^115P8MeE] [^111R4Tsm]. Voice therapy is recommended for patients with dysphonia amenable to this approach [^111gqx5G], and surgical intervention is considered for surgically amenable conditions, such as malignancy or benign vocal fold lesions that do not respond to conservative management [^115rXR6m].

---

Laryngitis symptoms include hoarseness, sore throat, dry cough, throat clearing, globus sensation, dysphagia, odynophagia, stridor, and respiratory distress [^114c5WSv]. Persistent hoarseness, stridor, hemoptysis, severe dysphagia, weight loss, or risk factors like smoking **require immediate medical evaluation**.

### Correlation of pH probe-measured laryngopharyngeal reflux with symptoms and signs of reflux laryngitis [^116J2J7m]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Laryngitis secondary to gastric acid reflux is a prevalent yet incompletely understood otolaryngological disorder. Further characterization of the relationship between symptoms and signs and reflux severity is needed.

- **Study design**: Prospective clinical trial.
- **Methods**: Forty-two consecutive, nonsmoking patients with one or more reflux laryngitis symptoms were recruited to complete a symptom questionnaire, videostrobolaryngoscopy, and 24-hour, dual-sensor pH probe testing. Twenty-nine patients had more than four episodes of laryngopharyngeal reflux, and the remaining 13 served as control subjects. Symptom scores were produced by multiplying the severity by the frequency for the following: hoarseness, throat pain, "lump-in-throat" sensation, throat clearing, cough, excessive phlegm, dysphagia, odynophagia, and heartburn. Endoscopic laryngeal signs included erythema and edema of the vocal folds and arytenoids, and interarytenoid irregularity.
- **Results**: Symptom scores varied significantly, with throat clearing being greater than the rest. None of the symptoms, except heartburn, correlated with reflux (laryngopharyngeal and esophageal) severity. Patients with worse laryngopharyngeal reflux were found to have worse esophageal reflux. Endoscopic laryngeal signs were rated as mild, on average, and did not correlate with laryngopharyngeal reflux severity. The number of laryngopharyngeal reflux episodes (per 24 hours) ranged from 0 to 40, with a mean number of 10.6 episodes.

In conclusion, throat clearing was the most intense symptom in the present group of patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux.

### Immediate hypersensitivity type of occupational laryngitis in a welder exposed to welding fumes of stainless steel [^117S4WTZ]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although upper respiratory symptoms have been reported to occur in welders, occupational laryngitis of immediate hypersensitivity type due to welding fumes of stainless steel has not been previously reported.

- **Methods**: Occupational laryngitis was diagnosed based on the specific challenge test combined with the patient's history of occupational exposure and laryngeal symptoms.

- **Results**: During the past few years, a 50-year-old man had started to experience laryngeal symptoms while welding stainless steel. The welding challenge test with stainless steel caused significant changes in the laryngeal status 30 minutes after the challenge: increased erythema, edema, and hoarseness of the voice. The referent inhalation challenge test by welding mild steel was negative.

- **Conclusion**: The welding of stainless steel should be included in the etiological factors of occupational laryngitis of immediate hypersensitivity type.

### Acute odynophagia: A new symptom of COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant wave in Sweden [^113SwLrq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In the described cohort, once the suspicion of epiglottitis was ruled out, patients were assigned diagnoses such as acute viral laryngitis or acute viral pharyngitis based on the picture of the larynx and hypopharynx in laryngoscopy. In a few patients with signs of secondary bacterial superinfection, oral antibiotics were administered. The traditional treatment of acute laryngitis includes voice rest, analgesic therapy, and humidification. According to the findings of a Cochrane Review investigating the benefits of antibiotic use for acute laryngitis in adults, antibiotics appear to have no benefit in treating this entity.

### Hoarseness evaluation: A transatlantic survey of laryngeal experts [^1145ABYs]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Hoarseness is a symptom of laryngeal dysfunction, with no current consensus on its proper evaluation. A survey of laryngeal specialists was conducted to gather expert opinions on the methodology for evaluating hoarseness and to identify differing opinions regarding appropriate management.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional survey.

- **Methods**: A 13-item questionnaire was electronically distributed to members of the American Laryngological Association, the American Broncho-Esophagological Association, and the European Laryngological Society. Responses were collected anonymously and analyzed using cross-tabulated data.

- **Results**: A total of 195 responses were reviewed. The majority of respondents (54.9%) were laryngologists/phoniatricians. Two-thirds (64.1%) of the providers dedicated more than 25% of their practice to voice management, and 48.8% managed more than 10 dysphonic patients weekly. Most respondents described hoarseness and dysphonia as symptoms, not diseases. The panel recommended scheduling laryngoscopy within 1 week to 1 month from symptom onset for most acutely dysphonic patients, irrespective of malignancy risk factors, and advised against deferring laryngoscopy beyond 2 months of symptom persistence. A significant majority (96.2%) believed an otolaryngologist should perform the initial laryngoscopy for a newly hoarse patient.

This survey shows a consensus to expedite specialized laryngeal visualization for hoarseness cases.

### Laryngeal dysfunction: Assessment and management for the clinician [^116hfuxB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The larynx is one of the most highly innervated organs in humans and serves a number of vitally important, complex, and highly evolved biological functions. On a day-to-day basis, the larynx functions autonomously, addressing several roles including airway protection, swallowing, and phonation. In some situations, the larynx appears to adopt a functional state that could be considered maladaptive or "dysfunctional". This laryngeal dysfunction can underpin and account for a number of respiratory symptoms that otherwise appear incongruous with a clinical disease state and/or contribute to the development of symptoms that appear "refractory" to treatment. These include conditions associated with a heightened tendency for inappropriate laryngeal closure (e.g. inducible laryngeal obstruction), voice disturbance, and chronic cough. Recognition of laryngeal dysfunction is important to deliver targeted treatment, and failure to recognize the condition can lead to repeated use of inappropriate treatment. Diagnosis is not straightforward, however, and many patients appear to present with symptoms attributable to laryngeal dysfunction, but in whom the diagnosis has been overlooked in clinical work-up for some time. This review provides an overview of the state of knowledge in the field of laryngeal dysfunction, with a focus on pragmatic clinical assessment and management.

### Self-care and clinical management of persons with laryngectomy during COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review [^112eB1xv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

The inability to speak is the greatest concern for the majority of patients with laryngectomy. Voice restoration in these individuals is accomplished by the commonly used alaryngeal speech modes: esophageal speech, tracheoesophageal speech, and artificial larynx. Of these three, tracheoesophageal speech is superior in terms of acceptability and intelligibility. However, the use of a voice prosthesis with this mode can lead to problems and issues of concern. Periodic changing of the device due to wear and tear, as well as complications like leakage and granulations, need to be considered by the rehabilitation team. Although experienced tracheoesophageal (TE) speakers might be able to handle some minor issues, periodic hospital visits and consultations are unavoidable.

The COVID-19 crisis presents several challenges for individuals with laryngectomy. Foremost, they are at high risk for droplet transmission diseases such as COVID-19. After laryngectomy, the contribution of the nose to respiration is limited, compromising its physiological functions of humidifying, heating, and moistening. The presence of a structurally intact nasal cavity and nasopharynx, along with a stoma, makes the laryngectomee more vulnerable to disease. The nasal cavity and nasopharynx can house the virus, with the stoma providing an additional route for the virus's entrance.

Furthermore, due to structural alterations and the increased chances of aerosolization of tracheal secretions, individuals with a tracheostoma, such as those with laryngectomy, could pose a risk to their caregivers and the community at large. This calls for further precautions and awareness.

### Features of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal lesions in bullous pemphigoid [^116ozD2H]. Ear, nose, & throat journal (2016). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by skin lesions, with or without oral lesions. The occurrence of pharyngolaryngeal lesions is very rare in affected patients. We conducted a study to investigate the characteristics of oral and pharyngolaryngeal lesions in bullous pemphigoid. Our study population consisted of six consecutively presenting outpatients — two men and four women, aged 40 to 83 years (mean: 68.2) — who had been referred to our department over an 11-year period.

Presenting symptoms included sore throat in all six patients and oral pain in three patients. The sites of mucosal lesions included the soft palate, epiglottis, gingiva, hypopharynx, tongue, nasal cavity, and buccal mucosa. These lesions appeared as erosions, erosions with white coating, erythematous patches, and/or blisters.

Mucosal lesions preceded skin lesions in two patients, appeared after skin lesions in one patient, and appeared simultaneously with skin lesions in three patients. We conclude that bullous pemphigoid sometimes involves the mucosa, such as that of the laryngopharynx and the oral cavity, and it can manifest as skin lesions. In the differential diagnosis of refractory pharyngolaryngeal lesions, bullous pemphigoid should be considered.

### Laryngeal manifestations and pediatric laryngopharyngeal reflux [^112FUc2E]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric laryngopharyngeal reflux (PLPR) refers to the atypical, otorhinolaryngological, and respiratory manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children. PLPR is believed to be an important inflammatory cofactor in disorders such as subglottic stenosis, asthma, recurrent croup, chronic rhinosinusitis, and middle ear infections. We review the literature, present clinical manifestations, and focus on diagnostic controversies and therapeutic challenges of PLPR in relation to laryngeal manifestations. Evidence linking reflux to many laryngeal problems is mainly based on animal studies or uncontrolled human studies. Future efforts should concentrate on developing well-designed controlled studies to provide more information on diagnosis and treatment.

### Hoarseness in adults [^116Bpmxp]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous conditions can cause hoarseness, ranging from simple inflammatory processes to more serious systemic, neurologic, or cancerous conditions involving the larynx. Evaluation of a patient with hoarseness includes a careful history, physical examination, and, in many cases, laryngoscopy. Any patient with hoarseness lasting longer than two weeks in the absence of an apparent benign cause requires a thorough evaluation of the larynx by direct or indirect laryngoscopy.

The management of hoarseness includes identification and treatment of any underlying conditions, vocal hygiene, voice therapy, and specific treatment of vocal cord lesions. Vocal hygiene education is an integral aspect of the treatment of hoarseness in most cases. Referral to a speech-language pathologist for voice therapy may be particularly helpful for patients whose occupation depends on singing or talking loudly or for prolonged periods.

Voice therapy is an effective method for improving voice quality and vocal performance in patients with nonorganic dysphonia and for treating many benign pathologic vocal cord lesions. Referral for surgical or other targeted interventions is indicated when conservative management of vocal cord pathology is unsuccessful, when dysplasia or carcinoma is suspected, or when significant airway obstruction is present.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^113oXhBQ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

**Uncertainties for future research**: Key research questions to inform decision-makers and future guidelines include: Are there any severe adverse effects of using one-dose of steroids for treating sore throat? What are the effects of corticosteroids, in addition to standard care, in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat?

### Predictors of outcome in an open label, therapeutic trial of high-dose omeprazole in laryngitis [^111DFy8W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux is implicated in some cases of laryngitis. There are no established predictors of response to acid suppression therapy in suspected reflux laryngitis.

- **Aim**: In a population with laryngitis, the aim is to determine whether (a) omeprazole 20 mg tds (3 months) improves symptoms and laryngitis, and (b) the outcome in response to potent acid suppression can be predicted by esophageal and/or pharyngeal parameters during ambulatory pH monitoring or by other pretreatment variables.

- **Methods**: From the 70 consecutive patients with laryngitis screened, 20 patients met the inclusion criteria (dysphonia > 3 months; laryngoscopically demonstrated laryngitis), and 50 patients were excluded because of one or more criteria indicating alternative causes for laryngeal injury. The primary outcome measure was improvement of at least one level in a 4-point laryngitis grading at 3 months. Twenty-four-hour dual, pharyngo-esophageal pH monitoring was performed at baseline. Secondary outcomes (symptom questionnaire; computerized voice analysis) were measured at baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks.

- **Results**: Response rates at 6 and 12 weeks were 47% and 63%, respectively. GERD symptoms (heartburn [p = 0.03] and regurgitation [p = 0.0001]) improved. However, neither baseline GERD symptoms nor endoscopic findings predicted laryngoscopic or symptomatic response. Neither baseline laryngitis grade (p = 0.46) nor esophageal acid exposure on pH testing (p = 0.3) predicted outcome. Four of 20 patients demonstrated pharyngeal regurgitation on pH testing, all four of whom responded to potent acid suppression therapy.

### Acute nasopharyngitis in adults: An independent clinical entity [^116dyBY5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2000). Low credibility.

Acute adult nasopharyngitis may exist as an independent clinical entity without preceding or following symptoms and signs of the common upper respiratory tract infections. Three representative cases with color photographs are presented to support this conclusion. Routine endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy allows a better understanding of this uncommon nasopharyngeal disorder and other related conditions.

### Acute epiglottitis in a COVID-19 positive patient [^113VPKBE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There have been more than 178 million global cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide [1]. COVID-19 can present with a wide variety of symptoms, and one rare manifestation that has been reported in the literature is acute epiglottitis [2, 3]. At the time of writing, there have been two reported cases of acute epiglottitis in COVID-19 positive patients. We present a case of a 49-year-old male presenting to a community emergency department with the chief complaint of dysphagia and sore throat, confirmed as acute epiglottitis, in the presence of a positive rapid COVID-19 PCR test.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^113jxU9A]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Speech and language therapy is the gold-standard treatment for inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO). In some centres, specialist physiotherapists deliver treatment based on SLT techniques. Laryngoscopy provides diagnostic confirmation of ILO, informs selection of the most appropriate SLT therapy techniques for symptom resolution, and acts as a patient bio-visual feedback tool. In the absence of endoscopic evaluation, SLT delivery is therefore an empirical treatment choice, unguided by objective assessment.

Empirical SLT intervention, including symptom differentiation, laryngeal airway control techniques, reducing upper airway irritants, and psychoeducational counselling, may not be appropriate for all patients. We recognize that approximately one-quarter of patients with a high clinical suspicion of ILO do not have confirmed laryngoscopic appearances (data on file, based on over 300 referrals). Coupled with a reported non-response rate of SLT intervention in endoscopically confirmed ILO patients of approximately 30%, it suggests a non-response rate to empirical treatment is likely to be high (approximately half of patients).

Considered review of treatment response is essential to minimize the risk of missing alternative pathologies and avoid perpetuating an incorrect presumptive diagnosis of ILO. Objective sessional outcomes, such as clinician- and patient-reported outcomes like the Vocal Cord Dysfunction Questionnaire (VCDQ) and the Newcastle Laryngeal Hypersensitivity Questionnaire, should be recorded to monitor progress.

### Review: Diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^117BaL6H]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

- **Knowledge gaps in diagnostics**: Bacteria and viruses are the most common etiologic agents of pharyngitis. Clinical history and observed physical signs/symptoms cannot accurately determine the infectious agent, even when employed by experienced healthcare providers (HCPs). If this dichotomy was not sufficiently problematic, additional factors such as coinfections, asymptomatic colonization, and subclinical infection further impede the ability of the HCP to accurately diagnose and treat the patient.

Using a combinatorial approach, HCPs integrate clinical scoring systems with laboratory data, including rapid antigen, culture, biomarkers, and/or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to facilitate the correct diagnosis. These biomarkers and NAATs have advanced the diagnostic process by rapidly identifying specific pathogens with high analytical specificity and sensitivity. In addition, multiplex NAATs are being developed; these simultaneously detect both common and less frequently encountered pathogens. However, rapid antigen, culture, and NAATs all share similar disadvantages, including the inability to distinguish between asymptomatic colonization, subclinical infection, coinfections, and, when excluding culture, viable versus nonviable organisms. New paradigms are needed to facilitate rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment when needed.

### Ulcerative lesions as a rare cause of laryngotracheitis in the pediatric population [^112jLifi]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

The goal of this study is to describe a unique finding of ulcerative lesions of the larynx in two pediatric patients presenting with prolonged acute laryngotracheitis. This study compares these findings to previously described reports to determine the typical clinical picture, need for intervention, and management model.

Two cases of ulcerative lesions of the larynx in immunocompetent children are presented. One child, with PCR positive HSV, exhibited severe croup requiring intensive care unit admission. A literature review was completed to assess knowledge of this entity. Our cases are discussed in the context of previously reported cases of HSV laryngotracheitis. Descriptive analysis focused on presentation, physical exam findings, treatment, length of therapy, and outcomes.

The literature review uncovered six case reports including 10 individual cases of prolonged croup with findings of HSV laryngitis and one retrospective review describing 15 cases of prolonged croup caused by ulcerative laryngitis. All patients underwent direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for evaluation. Analysis revealed significant findings, including a high intubation rate of 77%, ulcerative stomatitis in 63% of cases, and treatment with antiviral medication aimed at HSV in 85% of cases, which resulted in symptom improvement.

It is important to consider HSV as a possible pathogen in cases of prolonged or atypical croup. Laryngoscopy should be used for diagnostic intervention and identification of ulcerative lesions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for laryngitis, particularly concerning viral testing for influenza during the low season, the IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend considering influenza testing in outpatients with acute respiratory symptoms (with or without fever). This is especially important for immunocompromised and high-risk patients during periods of low influenza activity.

### Case report: An unusual case of 'black' larynx [^114dX3Ui]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Ulcerative necrotic supraglottitis is a rare entity of laryngeal infection leading rapidly to laryngeal necrosis, systemic complications, and potentially fatal outcomes. We present a case of a 50-year-old gentleman with ulcerative necrotizing supraglottitis and no comorbidities who presented to the Ear, Nose, and Throat Service in the Accident and Emergency Department due to dysphagia and weakness. He was treated with an emergency tracheostomy, neck exploration, and washout, and he received an appropriate supporting antibiotic regimen. He improved and was eventually decannulated, able to breathe, phonate, and swallow appropriately. After a thorough review of the literature regarding necrotizing infections of the laryngeal cavity, only seven cases have been reported, all in immunocompromised patients with severe complications. Our case report is the first of ulcerative necrotic supraglottitis in a healthy individual who was treated early and aggressively with impressive results.

### Doctor, I have a sore throat [^111Wskzp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Lemierre's syndrome is a rare yet potentially fatal cause of sore throat. Recently published literature suggests an increase in the incidence of this 'forgotten disease', highlighting Lemierre's syndrome as a clinically important differential diagnosis of sore throat. We present a case report of an 85-year-old man who developed a sore throat, illustrating the re-emergence of Lemierre's syndrome. Reducing the morbidity and mortality from this disease requires a high index of clinical suspicion to ensure prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate multidisciplinary management.

### "Active larynx": Preliminary evaluation of the reliability of visual assessments of laryngeal inflammation [^115XookA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

While there was poor agreement on whether to delay surgery due to laryngeal inflammation, significant differences were observed in the overall rating of activeness and the sum of the characteristics measured between larynges for which surgeons would delay surgery and those for which they would not. A formal analysis of predictive capacity, including exploratory factor analysis and evaluations of internal consistency, is not feasible with such a small study population. The decision to proceed with surgery is multifactorial, with activeness potentially playing a minor role. Thus, an activeness scale is unlikely to be predictive of surgical planning. However, this initial evaluation of convergent and discriminant validity appears promising and warrants further investigation.

Although the term "active larynx" is frequently discussed anecdotally among airway surgeons, it is rarely documented in the literature. A recent consensus statement on outcomes to report for LTR nearly reached consensus on including "active/reactive larynx". Other guidance documents reference evaluating inflammation as either "active" or mature. Numerous reports discuss prophylactic treatments with reflux medications, azithromycin, and topical or systemic steroids, or other anti-inflammatory treatments. This is not surprising, given the role of inflammation in the formation and progression of stenosis in the context of airway reconstruction. Despite these numerous causes of airway inflammation, it is unclear if these causes have different appearances.

### Vocal cord dysfunction and asthma [^111Ra5vt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Vocal cord dysfunction can occur independently or can co-exist with asthma. It often mimics asthma in presentation and can be challenging to diagnose, particularly in those with known asthma. Vocal cord dysfunction remains under-recognized, which may result in unnecessary adjustments to asthma medicines and increased patient morbidity. There is a need to review literature to explore theories regarding disease presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Recent findings indicate that the underlying cause of vocal cord dysfunction is likely multifactorial, but there has been increased interest in the hyper-responsiveness of the larynx. Many intrinsic and extrinsic triggers have been identified, which in part may explain asthma-like symptomatology. A variety of techniques have been reported to provoke vocal cord dysfunction during testing, which may improve diagnosis. There is a significant gap in the literature regarding specific laryngeal control techniques, duration of therapy, and the effectiveness of laryngeal control as a treatment modality.

Those with vocal cord dysfunction and asthma report more symptoms on standardized asthma control questionnaires, which can result in increasing amounts of medication if vocal cord dysfunction is not identified and managed appropriately. Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion to identify these patients. Videolaryngostroboscopy remains the diagnostic method of choice. Evidence-based guidelines are needed for the most effective diagnostic techniques. Laryngeal control taught by speech pathologists is essential in managing these patients effectively.

### Reflux and laryngitis: A systematic review [^114cxmWb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

To investigate and compare the prevalence of pharyngeal reflux (PR) events in normal controls and patients with clinically diagnosed reflux laryngitis, a systematic review of the literature was performed. The review specifically focused on identifying all prospective studies examining the results of 24-hour double-probe (pharyngeal and esophageal) pH monitoring in both normal controls and patients presenting with symptoms and/or signs of reflux laryngitis.

Eleven relevant studies involving 192 normal controls and 13 studies on 512 patients with reflux laryngitis were identified. PR events were detected in 51 normal controls (22.9%; 95% CI, 13.9% to 33.3%) and in 154 of 422 patients (38.3%; 95% CI, 25.4% to 52.1%). The analysis revealed no significant difference in the prevalence of PR events between normal controls and patients with reflux laryngitis (P = 0.079). Furthermore, the prevalence of PR events in patients with reflux laryngitis was considerably lower than what has been reported in previous reviews on this topic.

In conclusion, this systematic review determined that only a minority of patients with clinically diagnosed reflux laryngitis exhibit PR events. Additionally, there is no significant difference in the prevalence of PR events between patients with reflux laryngitis and healthy controls. Currently, there is no reliable method to confirm the reflux of gastric juice in patients with suspected reflux laryngitis. This diagnostic gap is critical and raises important questions about the concept of gastric juice reflux as a common cause of laryngopharyngeal inflammation.

### Review: Diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^112qihkp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most frequently encountered etiologic agents, while yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations, such as immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals. This manuscript (part 3 of 3) summarizes the state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis.

Biomarkers, in conjunction with rapid antigen and/or nucleic acid amplification testing, will likely become the standard of care to accurately diagnose the etiologic agents of pharyngitis. This novel testing paradigm has the potential to guide appropriate patient management and antibiotic stewardship by accurately determining if the cause of pharyngitis is due to a viral or bacterial etiology.

### Clinical manifestations of laryngopharyngeal reflux [^11678bsB]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is ubiquitous and associated with many head and neck symptoms and diagnoses. In some cases, the symptom is the diagnosis; for example, LPR can cause sore throat, chronic cough, globus pharyngeus, and laryngospasm. Alternatively, LPR can be associated with specific histopathologic lesions, such as vocal process granulomas. LPR can be the sole cause or an etiologic cofactor in the development of many disorders of the aerodigestive tract.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for laryngitis, particularly in clinical assessment, the AAO-HNSF 2018 guidelines recommend eliciting a medical history and performing a physical examination to assess underlying causes of dysphonia and factors modifying management. Furthermore, it is essential to identify factors requiring expedited laryngeal evaluation, including but not limited to:

- **Recent surgical procedures**: Involving the head, neck, or chest
- **Recent endotracheal intubation**
- **Presence of concomitant neck mass**
- **Respiratory distress or stridor**
- **History of tobacco abuse**
- **Professional voice use**

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^1128LaDF]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Recognizing the dynamic and unpredictable landscape that we are working in, the implementation of these recommendations should be audited for both efficacy and acceptability, as well as feasibility for patients and healthcare professionals. Two key risks, in particular, should be recognized and monitored. The first relates to over-treatment in the absence of the gold standard; the second relates to under-treatment for patients at risk of extreme distress and high healthcare utilization.

Acceptability and feasibility should be monitored at a local level, recognizing variations in local resources, capacity, and patient demographics. Service providers should acknowledge that patients often have different capabilities or preferences for the place and type of treatment. Some may be hesitant about attending hospitals during the pandemic or lack confidence with telemedicine. We welcome the development of resources, such as videos, that can aid patient understanding of diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.

In the absence of routine laryngoscopy, the risk of misdiagnosis must not be overlooked; thus, it is imperative to maintain strong connections between respiratory and otolaryngology services. A research opportunity exists to investigate the diagnostic value of non-invasive objective laryngeal assessments, such as dynamic CT, although this will clearly be limited by the difficulty of comparing to the gold-standard laryngoscopy. Efforts should also be made to produce and refine validated outcome measures to better monitor therapeutic outcomes.

For laryngitis, particularly in cases of reflux laryngitis, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend performing an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This should ideally be conducted off proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for 2–4 weeks if patients with extraesophageal symptoms have not responded to a trial of twice-daily PPIs. If the endoscopy results are normal, consider obtaining reflux monitoring.

### An update on inflammatory disorders of the pediatric airway: Epiglottitis, croup, and tracheitis [^111sKL4o]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute infections of the respiratory tract are common in pediatric patients. Respiratory disease is the leading cause of hospitalization in children less than 4 years of age and is responsible for many physicians' office and emergency department visits. The severity of upper respiratory tract infection ranges from mild, self-limited disease to potentially life-threatening airway obstruction. A prepared clinician can often make a diagnosis based solely on the history and physical examination, using radiographs and laboratory examinations to aid in diagnosis when the clinical picture is unclear. At times, airway collapse is imminent, and the clinician must proceed directly to endoscopy for definitive diagnosis and airway protection. This article discusses the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of epiglottitis, croup, and bacterial tracheitis in the pediatric population.

### Distinct clinical physiologic phenotypes of patients with laryngeal symptoms referred for reflux evaluation [^115YSeMF]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Heterogeneous presentations and disease mechanisms among patients with laryngeal symptoms contribute to the misdiagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), variations in testing, and suboptimal outcomes. This study aimed to derive phenotypes of patients with laryngeal symptoms based on clinical and physiologic data, and to compare characteristics across phenotypes.

A total of 302 adult patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms were prospectively enrolled at three centers between January 2018 and October 2020 (mean age 57.2 ± 15.2 years; 30% male; BMI 27.2 ± 6.0 kg/m²). Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was applied to 12 clinical and 11 physiologic variables collected in stable condition to derive phenotypic groups.

DAPC identified five groups with significant differences across symptoms, hiatal hernia size, and number of reflux events (P < .01). Group A had the largest hiatal hernia size (3.1 ± 1.0 cm; P < .001) and most reflux events (37.5 ± 51; P < .001), with frequent cough, laryngeal symptoms, heartburn, and regurgitation. Group B had the highest BMI (28.2 ± 4.6 kg/m²; P < .001) and salivary pepsin levels (150 ± 157 ng/mL; p = 0.03), with frequent cough, laryngeal symptoms, globus sensation, heartburn, and regurgitation. Group C frequently reported laryngeal symptoms (93%; P < .001) and had the fewest esophageal symptoms (9.6%; P < .001) and reflux events (10.7 ± 11.0; P < .001). Group D commonly reported cough (88%; P < .001) and heartburn. Group E (18%) was the oldest group (mean age 62.9 ± 14.3 years; P < .001) and was distinguished by the highest integrated re…

### Medical therapy of reflux laryngitis [^1118cQMg]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngeal signs and symptoms are frequently associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Establishing the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), however, is enigmatic as there are no tests that specifically define GERD-related laryngitis. In contrast to typical GERD, the treatment data for LPR using acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors has not shown a statistically significant advantage over placebo. This review highlights the challenges for establishing the diagnosis of GERD-related LPR and focuses on the limitations of medical therapy directed toward gastric acid suppression.

### Upper airway symptoms among workers with work-related respiratory complaints [^114G3fQb]. Occupational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Work-related rhinitis and asthma symptoms frequently co-exist. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and nature of nasal, pharyngeal, laryngeal, and sinus symptoms among individuals with work-related respiratory symptoms.

- **Methods**: Individuals referred to a tertiary occupational asthma clinic for investigations with specific inhalation challenges were evaluated using the RHINASTHMA quality of life questionnaire and a questionnaire that assessed the nature and frequency of upper airway symptoms, their relationship to the workplace, and their temporal relationship with the onset of asthma symptoms.

- **Results**: The study included 83 participants, all of whom reported at least one upper airway symptom: nasal (92%), pharyngeal (82%), laryngeal (65%), and sinus (53%). No significant differences in the frequencies of these symptoms were observed when comparing occupational asthma (OA), work-exacerbated asthma (WEA), and work-related respiratory symptoms (WRS), except for nasal bleeding, which was most frequent among those with WRS. The presence of laryngeal symptoms was significantly associated with rhinitis-specific quality of life impairment. Participants with workplace exposures to high molecular weight agents experienced greater quality of life impairment than those exposed to low molecular weight agents (RHINASTHMA Upper Airway sub-scores: 24.0 ± 10.4 vs. 19.8 ± 6.8; P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Individuals who were referred for work-related respiratory symptoms experienced high rates of work-related upper airway issues.

### Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO) in athletes: A narrative review by a subgroup of the IOC consensus on 'acute respiratory illness in the athlete' [^111q9pFz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Plausible modes of inheritance have been suggested, but no definite proof of a hereditary component exists.

Many publications have emphasized a psychological component of EILO; at the time of writing, an over-representation of psychiatric disease or personality disorders has not been documented in patients with isolated EILO. The only possible psychological component that may be associated with EILO is a 'high achiever' type of personality. However, this personality type is not uncommon in athletes in general, and this association might represent confounding interactions. The risk factors and causal mechanisms that are implicated in the development of EILO represent an area for future research.

- **Diagnosis of EILO**: The typical patient with EILO does not report symptoms at rest. Some may find it difficult to attribute their exertional respiratory symptoms to a specific phase of the respiratory cycle. Typically, symptoms are reported to occur during the inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle; however, complaints of dyspnea on expiration have also been reported. Patients generally present with complaints of various combinations of other symptoms, including throat tightness, choking sensations, upper chest tightness, and sometimes chest pain, noisy breathing, stridor, hoarseness, changes of the voice, cough, and panic reactions. Symptoms typical of EILO may not be specific to EILO and can also be associated with other diseases such as asthma, structural airway abnormalities, cardiac diseases, vascular anomalies, tumors/cancer, and primary hyperventilation/breathing patterns.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with single-dose pantoprazole for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^114V3oNW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The results of randomized treatment trials for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) are mixed, and the cause and effect between gastroesophageal reflux and laryngeal symptoms remain elusive. This study aims to determine the efficacy of single-dose pantoprazole in newly diagnosed LPR and to correlate hypopharyngeal reflux with symptom improvement.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. The study included a 2-week run-in, a 12-week treatment period (pantoprazole 40 mg q.a.m. or placebo), and a 4-week follow-up. Study criteria required laryngeal complaints more than three days per week and a positive triple-sensor pH test. Laryngeal examinations were graded using a reflux finding score before and after treatment. A repeat pH test was performed on the study drug at week 12. Participants kept weekly diaries on symptom severity and global assessment. The total laryngeal symptom score was defined as the sum of six laryngeal symptoms. Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, and Pearson tests were utilized for analysis.

Thirty-nine subjects (13 males, 26 females, median age 39 years) were randomized; 35 completed the study. During the treatment period, total laryngeal symptom scores significantly improved compared to pretreatment scores in both study groups, but there were no significant differences between them. At week 12, 40% of the pantoprazole group reported adequate relief, compared to 42% of the placebo group (p = 0.89). No significant improvement in hypopharyngeal reflux was observed in either study group, and no significant correlations were found between laryngeal reflux finding scores and hypopharyngeal reflux episodes with symptom improvement.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^115rcZKF]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methodology**: The MDT consensus group, consisting of 13 members from six UK specialist centers, each having established MDT provision for patients with ILO and airways disease, applied an adaptation of the nominal group technique for their consensus method. The process was as follows:

i) The lead author sent key questions for consideration prior to the initial virtual meeting.
ii) A round-robin of individual reflections took place during the virtual meeting.
iii) Group themes were generated for inclusion during the virtual meeting.
iv) Clarification of content and structure occurred in the virtual meeting.

To manage any potential dissent during the production of the statement, a pre-determined level of what would constitute consensus agreement was discussed at the outset. However, no such dissent occurred, and this statement represents the collective opinion of all group experts.

### Patterns in the evaluation of hoarseness: Time to presentation, laryngeal visualization, and diagnostic accuracy [^115ARzVs]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Controversial recommendations regarding the evaluation of dysphonia have been made without evidence related to clinical practice. This study aims to describe existing patterns of care for dysphonia to generate data for potential systemic improvement and provide a baseline for dysphonia recommendations.

- **Study design**: Retrospective review.

- **Methods**: Information regarding the complaint, including duration of hoarseness; inciting factors; number and type of previous physicians seen; Voice Handicap Index-10; and details of prior evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment was collected from patient records.

- **Results**: A total of 259 patients complaining of hoarseness were evaluated. Of those, 35.1% presented directly to subspecialty care, whereas 61% were previously evaluated by another otolaryngologist. Median times (in months) from symptom onset to evaluation were as follows: initial evaluation, 3.0; laryngoscopy, 3.0; stroboscopic exam, 5.8; subspecialty evaluation, 6.6. A total of 64.5% of patients had at least one incoming diagnosis; 45% of all incoming diagnoses were revised on re-evaluation. Diagnoses most commonly revised included "no abnormality", edema or laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPR), infection or allergy, and muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) or behavioral disorders. Final diagnoses that most frequently differed from incoming diagnoses were paresis; MTD or behavioral disorders; malignancy; and sulcus, atrophy, or scar.

- **Conclusions**: Patients received prompt laryngeal visualization; however, there were high rates of diagnostic revisions.

### Laryngeal cryptococcosis: Clinical presentation and treatment of a rare cause of hoarseness [^112fWHcM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Laryngeal cryptococcosis is rare, with few reported cases in the literature. We present investigation and treatment recommendations for this disease.

- **Study design**: A structured literature review, as well as additional cases and expert opinion, are presented.
- **Results**: Localized laryngeal cryptococcal infection most commonly presents with persisting hoarseness. Clinical suspicion of the disease is required for accurate diagnosis, with treatment based on the patient's immune status. Early microbiological advice and adequate follow-up are recommended to ensure disease resolution.
- **Conclusion**: Isolated laryngeal cryptococcosis is a rare presentation of fungal infection. It is easily treated and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with persisting hoarseness.

### Proliferative laryngitis with airway obstruction in an adult: Consider herpes [^112HUB9v]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Few cases of herpes simplex virus (HSV) affecting the larynx have been reported in the literature. Although HSV laryngitis appears to present with nonspecific symptoms, this is a potentially serious condition that can rapidly progress to unnecessary morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated accordingly. We report a case of HSV laryngitis in an individual with well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus infection and perform a comprehensive literature review of HSV laryngitis in adults. From this case report and review of the literature, we advocate early diagnostic biopsy of unusual or poorly responsive laryngeal lesions for pathology, culture, and virology studies.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^113up23Y]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Recommendations for clinical decision‐making:

- **Overview**: The profound reduction in access to laryngoscopy has necessitated the consideration of alternative approaches to inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) diagnostic and treatment pathways. Other instrumental assessments may be beneficial in detecting ILO, including spirometry and dynamic computerized tomography (CT) scanning. However, in the absence of robust validation, these techniques are not recommended for routine clinical practice. Additionally, accessibility to such assessments during the COVID‐19 era is restricted.

A pragmatic approach to the assessment of ILO is crucial to minimize ILO morbidity where possible. Diagnosis must heavily rely on clinical clues and be guided by results from previous investigations to exclude other causes of symptoms, primarily breathlessness. To minimize the risk of potential misdiagnosis (both under‐ and over‐diagnosis), we recommend the following:

- All patients should be managed through a dedicated multidisciplinary team (MDT), with a minimum requirement of a speech and language therapist (SLT) and a respiratory physician, both with experience in managing ILO and related conditions. It is highly recommended to also include a specialist respiratory physiotherapist with experience in managing breathing pattern disorders.
- Management decisions should be guided by the consensus recommended clinical pathway.
- "Suspected ILO" is the term used until an endoscopic evaluation is available to provide a confirmatory ILO diagnostic label.

### A cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence of Barrett esophagus in otolaryngology patients with laryngeal symptoms [^112Phh72]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Populations at risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma remain poorly defined. Laryngeal symptoms can be secondary to laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and can occur without associated gastroesophageal reflux symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation.

- **Goal**: We sought to determine the prevalence of Barrett esophagus (BE) in otolaryngology patients with laryngeal symptoms with or without typical gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms.

- **Study**: We performed a cross-sectional study of otolaryngology clinic patients who reported laryngeal symptoms. Symptoms, medications, and exposure histories were obtained. Unsedated transnasal endoscopy was performed. Suspected BE was biopsied and confirmed histologically. Risk factors and prevalence of BE were assessed.

- **Results**: Two hundred ninety-five patients were enrolled [73% male, median age 60 years (interquartile range 51 to 68 years)]. The overall prevalence of BE was 11.8% (n = 33). Antisecretory medication use was present in 56% (n = 156) of patients at enrollment. Compared with patients without BE, patients with BE were more likely to be male (P = 0.01) and to report occupational lung injury (P = 0.001). Duration, but not severity, of laryngeal symptoms significantly increased the odds of BE (odds ratio, 5.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–24.83; for a duration of symptoms > 5 years). Of patients with BE, 58% (n = 19) had coexisting LPR and GERD symptoms, and 30% (n = 10) had only LPR symptoms. Presence and size of hiatal hernia and length of columnar-lined esophagus were significant risk factors for BE.

- **Conclusions**: Long-standing laryngeal symptoms are associated with an increased risk of Barrett esophagus.

### Severe upper airway obstruction from cricoarytenoiditis as the sole presenting manifestation of a systemic lupus erythematosus flare [^117GsnYA]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Upper airway obstruction due to laryngeal involvement is a known complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Laryngeal involvement typically accompanies inflammatory activity involving other sites and varies from mild mucosal inflammation to bilateral vocal cord immobility. Cricoarytenoid arthropathy is a rare cause of severe airway obstruction in patients with SLE and almost always occurs in the presence of other associated symptoms.

Furthermore, in contrast to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, in whom chronic involvement of cricoarytenoid joints occurs more commonly and often requires surgical intervention, patients with SLE typically present with acute arthritis of cricoarytenoid joints and respond to corticosteroid therapy alone. We describe a patient with known SLE who presented with severe acute upper airway obstruction as the sole manifestation of active SLE after several years of quiescence.

The laryngeal involvement progressed from mucosal inflammation to acute cricoarytenoiditis, despite the administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy, necessitating emergent intubation and tracheostomy. This case illustrates the importance of considering SLE in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute upper airway obstruction.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^117NRo4h]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, laryngoscopy was the mandatory gold standard for the accurate assessment and diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction. However, upper airway endoscopy is considered an aerosol-generating procedure in professional guidelines, making routine procedures highly challenging and reducing the availability of laryngoscopy. In response, a multidisciplinary panel with broad experience in managing this disease convened and agreed on a recommended strategy for presumptive diagnosis in patients who cannot have laryngoscopy performed due to pandemic restrictions.

To maintain clinical standards while ensuring patient safety, we discuss the importance of triage, information gathering, symptom assessment, and early review of response to treatment. The consensus recommendations are potentially relevant to other future situations where access to laryngoscopy is restricted, though we emphasize that this investigation remains the gold standard.

### Laryngitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease: Increasing prevalence or poor diagnostic tests [^112gLntp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Laryngeal signs and symptoms are often associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, such diagnoses presume that laryngeal findings may be specific for GERD. Neither laryngoscopy, EGD, nor pH monitoring are specific tests for identifying GERD-related laryngitis. Non-placebo-controlled trials often show clinical benefit from proton pump inhibitor therapy; however, they suffer from a lack of controls. GERD may be one cause of laryngeal signs and symptoms in a subgroup of patients but not in all those currently suspected. Future studies are needed in this area to better delineate this association.

### Clinical practice guideline: Hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^1146o5kT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for treating patients who present with dysphonia. Dysphonia is characterized by altered vocal quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication and/or quality of life, affecting nearly one-third of the population at some point in their lives. This guideline applies to all age groups evaluated in settings where dysphonia would be identified or managed. It is intended for all clinicians likely to diagnose and treat patients with dysphonia.

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the quality of care for patients with dysphonia, based on the best evidence. Expert consensus is explicitly stated and supported with a detailed evidence profile for transparency when used to fill evidence gaps. The specific objectives of the guideline are to reduce inappropriate variations in care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm.

For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of advanced practice nursing, bronchoesophagology, consumer advocacy, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, laryngology, neurology, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, professional voice, pulmonology, and speech-language pathology.

- **Action statements**: The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs):
	- Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination to identify factors where expedited management may be necessary.

### Review: Diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^1172hLM3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils, commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most commonly encountered etiological agents, while yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations, such as immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals.

This manuscript, part 3 of 3, summarizes the state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Biomarkers, in conjunction with rapid antigen and/or nucleic acid amplification testing, are likely to become the standard of care for accurately diagnosing the etiological agents of pharyngitis. This novel testing paradigm has the potential to guide appropriate patient management and antibiotic stewardship by accurately determining if the cause of pharyngitis is due to a viral or bacterial etiology.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^112T5hgt]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach improves diagnostic precision and facilitates a meaningful clinical impact in inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO). However, in the absence of routine access to laryngoscopy, a critical component for MDT management of suspected ILO patients is missing; that is the gold-standard diagnostic tool.

The inability to perform an endoscopic evaluation of the larynx and/or continuous laryngoscopy during provocation limits the MDT's ability to:

- **Accurately confirm or refute ILO diagnosis**: Directly assess structure and function in the upper airway and rule out mimics that include serious structural issues requiring immediate surgical intervention (e.g. subglottic stenosis).
- **Assess relevant differential diagnoses**: Especially nasal and reflux disease.
- **Inform treatment regimens specific to the individual patient**: Provide biofeedback to the patient and teaching.
- **Monitor therapeutic response**.

Clinical symptoms can only be used as a guide, and without usual access to objective testing, it is not possible to confirm an accurate diagnosis. Over-diagnosis without laryngoscopy is a particular concern in this context. In 303 patients with a high clinical suspicion of ILO (after specialist MDT evaluation), we confirmed laryngoscopic appearances in only 74% (data on file). It may be that symptom-based questionnaires, such as the Pittsburgh Vocal Cord Dysfunction Index, can be used to help select patients, although further validation is needed. Such an approach has significant implications for ILO management, which should be considered carefully to minimize risk.

### Correlation between symptoms and laryngeal signs in laryngopharyngeal reflux [^111c6veY]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is diagnosed by the presence of laryngeal signs and symptoms. Some studies have noted that signs and symptoms may be nonspecific and may have poor correlation. However, many such studies were either observational or had short-term follow-up. Therefore, we conducted a subgroup analysis of a prospective controlled study with a one-year follow-up to study the correlation between signs and symptoms.

- **Study design**: Prospective study.

- **Methods**: Seventy-two patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease-related laryngeal symptoms/signs received a four-month trial of aggressive acid-suppressive therapy. Four-month symptomatic nonresponders (< 50% improvement) with continued laryngeal inflammation and normalized esophageal acid exposure were then offered laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The primary outcome was laryngeal symptom-sign correlation at one year post-surgery.

- **Results**: Twenty-five of 72 (35%) patients remained unresponsive after four months of aggressive acid-suppressive therapy. Ten (40%) patients agreed to undergo surgical fundoplication (mean age = 50, male = 4). The most common laryngeal symptoms were sore throat (40%), hoarseness (30%), and cough (20%), whereas the most common signs were medial arytenoid wall erythema/edema (60%), interarytenoid erythema (50%), and arytenoid complex erythema/edema (50%). At one-year post-fundoplication, laryngeal symptoms improved in only 1 of 10 (10%) patients, whereas signs improved in 8 of 10 (80%) patients.

- **Conclusions**: There appears to be poor correlation between signs and symptoms in patients with LPR.

### Self-care and clinical management of persons with laryngectomy during COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review [^113co4Az]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Stringent hand hygiene measures also apply to home caregivers of persons with laryngectomy. Direct contact with the tracheostoma, such as stoma care, voice prosthesis change, and inspection of leakage, is regarded as a high-risk procedure because of the increased chances of instigating cough and aerosolization. Meticulous hand washing prior to and after direct contact is essential for protecting themselves and the person with laryngectomy. It is also advisable for caregivers to wear a mask, disposable gloves, and goggles while in contact with the stoma.

- **Care of devices**: It is of utmost importance to follow strict hygiene practices with voice rehabilitation devices due to their close contact with the stoma, mouth, and nose.

	- **Voice prosthesis**: In tracheoesophageal speakers, stomal occlusion by finger for phonation increases the likelihood of virus transmission directly to the trachea if the hands are contaminated. Hand hygiene should be emphasized before and after speaking. Hands-free HME prevents the need for hand occlusion and is thus beneficial, especially during pandemic situations. Valves with silver oxide coating and Teflon are recommended to limit biofilm formation. An indwelling device should be cleaned with a dedicated brush. The cleaning brush should be immersed in 70% ethanol or 70% isopropyl alcohol for 10 minutes or 3% hydrogen peroxide for 60 minutes as a sanitary measure. Non-indwelling devices should be cleaned by immersing in disinfectants.

	- **Electro larynx**: The electrolarynx should be thoroughly cleaned using appropriate techniques to ensure hygiene.

### Acute infectious laryngitis: A case series [^111hXgFF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Although acute laryngitis is common, it is often managed by primary physicians. Therefore, video images documenting its signs are scarce. This series includes seven professional voice users who previously had undergone baseline strobovideolaryngoscopy (SVL) during routine examinations or evaluations for other complaints and who returned with acute laryngitis. Sequential SVL showed not only the expected erythema, edema, cough, and dysphonia, but also new masses in five of the seven subjects. All the signs returned to baseline. This series is reported to highlight the reversible structural changes that can be expected in patients with acute laryngitis and the value of conservative management.

### A novel case of paraglottic Burkholderia cepacia complex infection mimicking a laryngeal malignancy [^1165w7kg]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

The Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) is a rare pathogen that typically causes respiratory illnesses in immunocompromised individuals. We present a novel case of BCC manifesting as a laryngeal abscess, mimicking a laryngeal malignancy in an immunocompetent patient. A 74-year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure and was emergently intubated, revealing abnormal supraglottic tissue. ENT consultation post-extubation and flexible laryngoscopy suggested malignancy in the right supraglottis. A subsequent CT neck scan showed an expansive paraglottic mass, again consistent with an advanced malignancy.

During direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, purulence was encountered and cultures were obtained. Biopsy results showed benign mucosa with inflammation, and cultures identified BCC. The patient received 7 days of Levofloxacin and Ampicillin-Sulbactam before culture results were available. Follow-up 2 weeks later showed near-complete symptom resolution, normal supraglottic mucosa on flexible laryngoscopy, and interval CT neck showed resolution of the "mass".

This case highlights an unusual presentation of an acute paraglottic BCC infection initially mistaken for a laryngeal mass. BCC is typically a threat to individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) or other immunocompromised states due to its intrinsic antibiotic resistance. However, BCC is rarely implicated in paraglottic infections or abscess formation. This is the first reported case of a laryngeal BCC infection mimicking a laryngeal mass. It underscores the importance of maintaining an open differential diagnosis until pathology results are confirmed.

### Evaluation of early laryngeal reaction at oral food challenge [^114HSZfS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2022). High credibility.

Open oral food challenge (OFC) is a commonly used diagnostic method for food allergy; however, the occurrence of uncertain reactions leads to inconclusive results. We aimed to determine the associations between mild laryngeal symptoms and positive results in open OFCs.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively investigated medical records of high-risk children (aged 3–15 years) who had undergone open OFC for a low dose of peanuts, hen's egg, cow's milk, or wheat. The OFC result, severity of allergic reactions, and administered treatments during OFCs were compared between the subjects with and without laryngeal symptoms. The risks of a positive OFC result were assessed using logistic univariate and multivariate analyses, with age, sex, and serum levels of total and food-specific IgE as covariates.

- **Results**: Among the 198 patients who underwent OFC, 25 had mild laryngeal symptoms: 8 (32%), 7 (22%), 0 (0%), and 10 (40%) in the OFC trials with hen's egg, cow's milk, wheat, and peanuts, respectively. In the peanut OFCs, univariate analyses revealed a 5-fold higher risk of a positive result (odds ratio = 5.0 [95% CI = 1.1–22.8]) in the symptomatic subjects compared to the asymptomatic subjects. However, on multivariate analyses, none of the associations between the symptoms and a positive result were significant in any of the OFCs. The occurrence of anaphylaxis and adrenaline injections did not differ significantly between the symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects.

- **Conclusions**: Laryngeal symptoms should be considered a warning sign for a positive OFC result in peanut OFCs.

### Laryngomalacia [^112qhcMW]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in infants. Stridor results from upper airway obstruction caused by the collapse of supraglottic tissue into the airway. Most cases of laryngomalacia are mild and self-resolving, but severe symptoms require investigation and intervention. There is a strong association with gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with laryngomalacia; thus, medical treatment with antireflux medications may be indicated. Supraglottoplasty is the preferred surgical treatment of laryngomalacia, reserved only for severe cases. Proper identification of those patients who require medical and surgical intervention is key to providing treatment with successful outcomes.

### Evaluation of the patient with hoarseness [^114cM5B5]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Hoarseness has a broad range of etiologies, and in most cases, a diagnosis can be made by recording an accurate history and conducting a thorough physical examination. This paper presents an overview of the more common voice disorders and explains in which cases imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, are necessary. The essential imaging features are discussed.

### Hoarseness in adults [^115R2o7U]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hoarseness is a common presentation in primary care practices. Combined with other voice-related changes, it falls under the umbrella diagnosis of dysphonia. Hoarseness has a number of causes, ranging from simple inflammatory processes to less common psychiatric disorders to more serious systemic, neurologic, or cancerous conditions. Medication-induced hoarseness is common and should be considered. The initial evaluation begins with a targeted history and physical examination, while also looking for signs of potential systemic etiologies.

Treatment should begin with voice rest, especially avoidance of whispering, and conservative management directed toward a presumptive cause. For example, proton pump inhibitors are appropriate for hoarseness due to reflux, and proper vocal hygiene is recommended for vocal abuse-related indications. In the absence of a clear indication, antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, and proton pump inhibitors should not be used for the empiric treatment of hoarseness.

Direct visualization of the larynx and vocal folds, commonly mislabeled as vocal cords, should be performed within three months if an etiology has not been determined or if conservative management has been ineffective. Patients who experience symptoms lasting longer than two weeks and who have risk factors for dysplasia (e.g. tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, hemoptysis) may require earlier laryngoscopic evaluation. Voice therapy is effective for improving voice quality in patients with dysphonia if conservative measures are unsuccessful, and it can also be helpful for prophylaxis in high-risk populations.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^115YYuyH]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) is defined as "inappropriate laryngeal closure at the glottic and/or supraglottic level, which leads to dynamic airflow obstruction and causes breathing difficulties". Individuals with ILO present across varied healthcare settings with differing levels of morbidity. Presentation ranges from mild dyspnea to acute respiratory distress, which in severe cases may lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation; symptoms are typically episodic, occurring during inspiration and suddenly on exposure to certain triggers.

	- These symptoms lead to many individuals being misdiagnosed with asthma both acutely and in the community. Healthcare utilization and escalating pharmacological burden are common when symptoms do not respond to standard therapies. Furthermore, ILO and asthma can coexist, with up to 50% of people with asthma demonstrating abnormal laryngeal movements during respiration.

- **Diagnostics pre-COVID-19**: The diagnosis of ILO begins with a thorough evaluation of the clinical history. Typical clinical symptoms, such as difficulty breathing in, throat tightness/discomfort, and voice disturbance, may raise suspicion of ILO. Other clinical features suggestive of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO) include symptom onset during high-intensity exercise, accompanied by stridor and rapid resolution upon cessation of exercise. However, these features, when obtained from clinical history alone, have poor diagnostic precision and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Moreover, many symptoms, such as coughing and noisy breathing, can overlap with other conditions, further complicating the diagnosis.
