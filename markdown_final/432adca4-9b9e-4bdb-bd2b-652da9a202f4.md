## Question

How to treat sun poisoning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat "sun poisoning". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sun poisoning" actually means in clinical terms. Then, I should verify severity stratification and when to escalate care. Next, I will review first-line supportive measures, followed by pharmacologic options and their evidence base. After that, I need to check special scenarios like drug-induced photosensitivity and pediatric considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight prevention and follow-up, making sure each assertion is backed by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "sun poisoning" is a lay term that overlaps with severe sunburn and phototoxic or photoallergic reactions. Clinically, it encompasses severe sunburn with systemic symptoms, phototoxic drug reactions, and occasionally solar urticaria or polymorphous light eruption, so I need to ensure I'm addressing both the cutaneous injury and any systemic features or triggers [^41449d0d] [^e65aec24] [^140bd811].

> I should confirm severity before proposing treatment. Mild to moderate cases present with erythema, edema, pain, and pruritus, whereas severe cases involve extensive blistering, dehydration, fever, chills, nausea, or extreme pain; extensive blisters or systemic symptoms warrant urgent evaluation and may require hospitalization for fluid management and pain control, so I need to keep those thresholds in mind [^04c9b490] [^33f1ce74].

> Next, I will examine foundational supportive care, because that is consistently first-line. Cool baths or showers, cool wet compresses, and liberal application of bland emollients reduce discomfort; refrigerating emollients can add relief, and I should emphasize avoiding further sun exposure until healed. Wait, let me verify blister management: intact blisters should not be ruptured, but if tense or painful, they can be drained sterilely by nicking the edge and leaving the roof intact to serve as a biologic dressing, which aligns with burn-care principles for partial-thickness injury [^33f1ce74] [^04c9b490].

> I need to check pain and systemic symptom control. Oral NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen reduce pain and inflammation, and acetaminophen is reasonable if NSAIDs are contraindicated; aggressive oral hydration is important, especially with blistering or systemic symptoms, and rest in a cool environment helps thermoregulation and symptom control. Hold on, I should verify that these recommendations are consistent across authoritative sources; yes, CDC guidance supports NSAIDs, acetaminophen, fluids, and rest as core measures [^33f1ce74] [^3ae72112].

> Now, topical pharmacologics. I initially thought topical corticosteroids were categorically ineffective for sunburn, but wait, let me verify that nuance. A systematic review notes no consensus and highlights that many studies show limited or no benefit, yet a small randomized intra-individual trial showed modest improvements with medium-potency topical steroids on days 3–5 compared with no treatment; given low risk, a short course of low- to medium-potency steroid on intact skin can be considered for symptomatic relief, but I should not overstate efficacy. Diclofenac 1% gel is a reasonable NSAID alternative topically and is included in CDC guidance, though I should avoid applying it to broken skin [^aeca850b] [^8af4c3d5] [^33f1ce74] [^a760ef5b].

> Let me consider antipruritic options. Oral antihistamines can help with pruritus, particularly in solar urticaria or when itch is prominent; for solar urticaria specifically, non-sedating H1 antihistamines are foundational, and escalation to phototherapy or other specialist strategies may be needed if symptoms persist. I should confirm that this aligns with urticaria guidance; yes, contemporary reviews and guidelines support antihistamines and photoprotection as first-line in solar urticaria, with phototherapy reserved for refractory cases [^e4bc4d50] [^53436d9b] [^ad8ce6c2].

> But wait, what if the "sun poisoning" reflects a drug-induced phototoxic or photoallergic reaction. I need to ensure I screen medications and advise cessation of the culprit when feasible, as management hinges on removing the photosensitizer and strict photoprotection; common culprits include fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, NSAIDs, diuretics, and others, and reactions can be severe. Counseling to avoid sun and use broad-spectrum protection is essential, and I should double-check that this principle is consistent with drug-induced photosensitivity reviews; yes, cessation and photoprotection are core management steps [^caa96ba4] [^140bd811].

> I should review pediatric considerations. Children have thinner stratum corneum and higher surface-area-to-mass ratios, so percutaneous absorption and systemic effects can be more pronounced; avoid harsh topicals, prioritize cool compresses and bland emollients, and use acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain. Hold on, I should verify that these align with pediatric guidance; while pediatric-specific sunburn trials are limited, general pediatric dermatology principles and CDC first-aid guidance support conservative, supportive care with careful fluid management and age-appropriate analgesia [^3ae72112].

> Next, I should review what to avoid. Do not intentionally rupture intact blisters, avoid alcohol-containing lotions that can irritate, and avoid topical anesthetics like benzocaine due to risk of contact sensitization; I initially considered mentioning dibucaine as a topical anesthetic for sunburn pain, but wait, I should confirm its current relevance and safety profile. Dibucaine has historical labeling for sunburn pain relief, yet it is rarely used today and carries sensitization risk, so I should not recommend it routinely; instead, emphasize NSAIDs and nonpharmacologic cooling strategies [^33f1ce74] [^28b29c08] [^64ca406c].

> I will now examine prevention and follow-up, because recurrence risk is high without behavior change. Strict photoprotection with broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30 or higher, protective clothing, hats, and shade reduces future injury; I need to ensure I specify reapplication every 2 hours and after water exposure. For patients with repeated severe phototoxic or photoallergic reactions, or suspected photosensitivity disorders, referral to dermatology for phototesting and targeted therapy is appropriate. I should confirm that these prevention messages are consistent with public health guidance; yes, CDC and USPSTF emphasize regular sunscreen use, clothing, and shade as primary prevention, and dermatology sources support specialist evaluation for recurrent or atypical photosensitivity [^13a7cfa2] [^761d7bf4] [^e65aec24].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. For mild to moderate cases, use cool compresses or baths, liberal bland emollients, oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen, oral hydration, and rest; consider a short course of low- to medium-potency topical corticosteroid or diclofenac gel on intact skin for added symptom control. For severe cases with extensive blisters, fever, dehydration, or extreme pain, arrange urgent evaluation for fluid management, stronger analgesia, and possible hospitalization; apply sterile blister care principles and elevate edematous limbs. For suspected drug-induced photosensitivity, stop the culprit drug when feasible and reinforce strict photoprotection. For recurrent or atypical cases, refer to dermatology for phototesting and disease-specific management, including phototherapy for solar urticaria or polymorphous light eruption when indicated [^33f1ce74] [^04c9b490] [^e4bc4d50] [^53436d9b].

> Finally, I should double-check key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Supportive care remains the cornerstone, topical steroids may offer modest symptomatic benefit but are not disease-modifying, NSAIDs and hydration address pain and systemic effects, blister roofs should be preserved when possible, and prevention through photoprotection and medication review is essential to reduce recurrence. This approach aligns with CDC travel medicine guidance, contemporary dermatology reviews, and the limited but directionally consistent trial data on topical therapies [^33f1ce74] [^aeca850b] [^8af4c3d5].

Sun poisoning is best managed with **cool compresses, hydration, and NSAIDs** for pain and inflammation [^33f1ce74] [^3ae72112]. Topical hydrocortisone 1% can reduce redness and itch if the skin is intact, while aloe vera may soothe mild burns [^33f1ce74] [^3ae72112]. Avoid further sun exposure, do not break blisters, and seek medical care for severe pain, fever, dehydration, or if symptoms persist beyond 48 hours [^33f1ce74] [^3ae72112]. Prevention centers on **broad-spectrum SPF 30+**, protective clothing, and hydration [^13a7cfa2] [^761d7bf4].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Sun poisoning presents with:

- **Erythema**: Red, inflamed skin [^41449d0d].
- **Edema**: Swelling of exposed areas [^41449d0d].
- **Pain and pruritus**: Burning, itching, and tenderness [^41449d0d].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue [^41449d0d].
- **Blistering**: In severe cases, large bullae may form [^04c9b490].

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and examination; laboratory tests are generally unnecessary unless complications are suspected [^notfound].

---

## Immediate first aid and home care

### General measures

- **Cool compresses**: Apply cool, damp cloths or take cool baths/showers to relieve pain and reduce inflammation [^33f1ce74].
- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of fluids to replace fluid losses and prevent dehydration [^3ae72112].
- **Rest**: Avoid further sun exposure and rest in a cool, shaded environment [^3ae72112].

---

### Topical treatments

- **Aloe vera**: Apply aloe vera gel to soothe the skin and reduce inflammation [^3ae72112].
- **Topical corticosteroids**: Hydrocortisone 1% cream or ointment can reduce redness, swelling, and itching if the skin is intact [^33f1ce74].
- **Emollients**: Use bland moisturizers (e.g. petrolatum-based) to keep the skin hydrated and prevent peeling [^33f1ce74].

---

### Oral medications

Oral NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen reduce pain and inflammation [^33f1ce74]; **acetaminophen** is an alternative for those who cannot take NSAIDs.

---

## Medical interventions

Medical evaluation is indicated for **severe cases** — characterized by extensive blistering, severe pain, fever, dehydration, or systemic symptoms — or if symptoms persist beyond 48 hours [^3ae72112]. In such cases, clinicians may prescribe **prescription-strength topical corticosteroids** for more pronounced inflammation, administer intravenous fluids for dehydration or severe systemic symptoms, and provide wound care with sterile technique for large blisters to prevent infection [^04c9b490].

---

## Complications and risks

Untreated or improperly managed sun poisoning can lead to:

- **Infection**: Secondary bacterial infection of damaged skin [^notfound].
- **Dehydration**: Significant fluid loss through damaged skin [^3ae72112].
- **Hyperpigmentation**: Persistent darkening of the skin [^9c07851f].
- **Scarring**: Permanent skin damage in severe cases [^notfound].
- **Increased risk of skin cancer**: Chronic sun damage elevates risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers [^13a7cfa2].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention is essential to avoid recurrence:

- **Sunscreen**: Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, reapplying every 2 hours and after swimming or sweating [^13a7cfa2].
- **Protective clothing**: Wear long sleeves, hats, and sunglasses [^761d7bf4].
- **Avoid peak sun hours**: Limit exposure between 10 AM and 4 PM [^761d7bf4].
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake during sun exposure [^3ae72112].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require tailored care. In **pediatric patients**, use gentle topical treatments, ensure adequate hydration, and avoid systemic medications unless prescribed [^notfound]. In patients with **chronic photosensitivity disorders**, emphasize strict photoprotection and consider dermatology referral [^e65aec24].

---

Sun poisoning is a severe sunburn requiring prompt, supportive care: cool compresses, hydration, NSAIDs, and topical corticosteroids for intact skin. Severe cases need **medical evaluation**, and prevention relies on sunscreen, protective clothing, and avoiding peak sun.

### Hydroquinone (hydro-Q) [^c1996c79]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

CAUTION: Hydroquinone is a depigmenting agent that may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.
Test for skin sensitivity before using HYDRO-Q®by applying a small amount of the gel to an unbroken patch of skin and check within 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication but where there is itching and vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response further treatment is not advised. Close patient supervision is recommended. Contact with the eyes should be avoided. If no lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment the use of HYDRO-Q®should be discontinued. HYDRO-Q®is formulated for the treatment of dyschromia and should not be used for the prevention of sunburn.
Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight sustains melanocytic activity. To prevent repigmentation during treatment and maintenance therapy, sun exposure on treated skin should be avoided by application of a broad spectrum sunscreen SPF 15 or greater) or by use of protective clothing
Keep this and all medications out of reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, contact a physician or a poison control center immediately.
WARNING: Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause serious allergic reactions (e.g., hives, itching, wheezing, anaphylaxis, severe asthma attack) in certain susceptible persons
On rare occasions, a gradual blue-black darkening of the skin may occur, in which case, use of HYDRO-Q®should be discontinued and a physician contacted immediately

### Management of acute sunburn [^aeca850b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Current literature documents the use of many pharmacologic agents in the management of acute sunburn. While numerous studies have been undertaken, there is no consensus on an algorithm for such treatment. We review the literature for an evidence-based approach to the management of sunburn. A MEDLINE search was conducted whereby all published articles related to sunburn or ultraviolet (UV)-induced erythema from 1966–2001 were evaluated. Studies and reviews were excluded if they were not conducted in human beings. The results of these studies are varying and often conflicting in terms of clinical effectiveness or feasibility. A total of 40 studies were reviewed. Fourteen out of the 40 studies addressed the actual treatment of sunburn (i.e. the application of a substance after the development of signs or symptoms). The majority concluded that either corticosteroids, NSAIDs, antioxidants, antihistamines or emollients were ineffective at decreasing recovery time. The remaining studies showed mild improvement with such treatments, but study designs or methods were flawed. Furthermore, regardless of the treatment modality, the damage to epidermal cells is the same. Given the lack of convincing data and consensus of opinion regarding sunburn management, the most effective and practical approach to acute sunburn is symptomatic treatment of UV light-induced symptoms, including erythema, pain and pruritus.

### Lenacapavir sodium (Sunlenca) [^4ba3a303]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

No data are available on overdose of SUNLENCA in patients. If overdose occurs, monitor the patient for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with SUNLENCA consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. As lenacapavir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to be significantly removed by dialysis.

### Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) [^0ffe549f]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

CYANOKIT is indicated for cyanide poisoning and in this setting, patients will likely be unresponsive or may have difficulty in comprehending counseling information.

Erythema and Chromaturia

Advise patients that skin redness may last up to 2 weeks and urine coloration may last for up to 5 weeks after administration of CYANOKIT. While it is not known if the skin redness predisposes to photosensitivity, patients should be advised to avoid direct sun while their skin remains discolored.

Rash

Inform patients that an acneiform rash may appear anywhere from 7 to 28 days following hydroxocobalamin treatment. This rash will usually resolve without treatment within a few weeks.

Renal Function Monitoring

Advise patients that renal function will be monitored for 7 days following treatment with CYANOKIT or, in the event of renal impairment, until renal function returns to normal.

Pregnancy

Advise pregnant women that maternal cyanide poisoning results in fetal cyanide poisoning. Treatment for cyanide poisoning may be lifesaving for both the pregnant woman and fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to notify their provider if they were pregnant during therapy with CYANOKIT [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].

Lactation

Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CYANOKIT [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.2)].

### Drug-induced photosensitivity: new insights into pathomechanisms and clinical variation through basic and applied science [^caa96ba4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug-induced photosensitivity occurs when a drug is capable of absorbing radiation from the sun (usually ultraviolet A) leading to chemical reactions that cause cellular damage (phototoxicity) or, more rarely, form photoallergens (photoallergy). The manifestation varies considerably in presentation and severity from mild pain to severe blistering. Despite screening strategies and guidelines in place to predict photoreactive drugs during development there are still new drugs coming onto the market that cause photosensitivity. Thus, there is a continuing need for dermatologists to be aware of the different forms of presentation and the culprit drugs. Management usually involves photoprotection and cessation of drug treatment. However, there are always cases where the culprit drug is indispensable. The reason why some patients are susceptible while others remain asymptomatic is not known. A potential mechanism for the phototoxic reactions is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and there are a number of reasons why some patients might be less able to cope with enhanced levels of ROS.

### Environmental hazards, hot, cold, altitude, and sun [^a67b0f76]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

There has been an increase in both recreational and adventure travel to extreme environments. Humans can successfully acclimatize to and perform reasonably well in extreme environments, provided that sufficient time is given for acclimatization (where possible) and that they use appropriate behavior. This is aided by a knowledge of the problems likely to be encountered and their prevention, recognition, and treatment.

### Hydroquinone (ZO skin health pigment control program plus hydroquinone) [^c7cac193]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce undesired effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this product.

Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.

Avoid unnecessary sun exposure, use an effective broad-spectrum sunscreen agent or protective clothing should be worn to cover bleached skin to prevent re-pigmentation from occurring.

Hydroquinone may produce exogenous ochronosis, a gradual blue-black darkening of the skin. If this condition occurs, discontinue treatment and consult your physician.

Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, call a physician or a poison control center immediately.

### Pain, swelling and irritability in the sun: what is the diagnosis? [^b242d164]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of severe burning pain affecting both hands that had started within minutes of playing outdoors. His mother reported that he had been running his hands under cold water and shaking his hands and head to try and relieve the pain. On examination, there was swelling of his hands, eyelids and cheeks. His parents mentioned that his hands and face had 'swollen in the sun' every summer from the age of 2years. A 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of left upper limb swelling following a day of prolonged sun exposure. Examination revealed non-pitting oedema extending from her left shoulder to hand with no associated tenderness, erythema or rash. Her mother reported six previous episodes of irritability following sun exposure during which she would cry and flap her hands 'for hours'. Oral steroids and antihistamines were prescribed in both cases with little effect. Findings of routine baseline investigations were normal in both cases. A radiograph of the upper limb in the second patient disclosed nothing abnormal.

### Hydroquinone (skin lightener) [^51cd2eb0]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

CAUTION: Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.
Test for skin sensitivity before using Hydroquinone Cream by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin and check within 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching and vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, further treatment is not advised. Close patient supervision is recommended. Contact with the eyes should be avoided. In case of accidental contact, patient should rinse eyes thoroughly with water and contact physician. A bitter taste and anesthetic effect may occur if applied to lips. Keep out of reach of children. If no bleaching or lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment use, Hydroquinone Creamshould be discontinued. This productis formulated for use as a skin bleaching agent and should not be used for the prevention of sunburn.
Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of Hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight sustains melanocytic activity. After clearing and during maintenance therapy, sun exposure should be avoided on bleached skin by application of a sunscreen or sunblock agent, or protective clothing to prevent repigmentation. There are no sunblocking or sunscreening agents in DERMESSE SKIN LIGHTENER and since minimal sunlight exposure may reverse the bleaching effect of this preparation. It should be used only at night or on areas of the body covered by protective clothing. During the daytime, sunblocking or broad spectrum sunscreen preparations or protective clothing should be used to prevent the bleached areas from repigmentation.
Keep out of reach of children. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.
Warning: Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause serious allergic type reactions (e.g., hives, itching, wheezing, anaphylaxis, severe asthma attack) in certain susceptible persons.

### Solar panel installation workers exposed to pesticides during two agricultural applications-Michigan, August 2023 and may 2024 [^47637d06]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE
Characteristics of solar panel installation workers (N = 10) who sought medical care after being exposed to agricultural pesticides during two events — Michigan, August 2023 and May 2024

Abbreviations: ED = emergency department; EMS = emergency medical services.

*

†

§

Symptoms and medical evaluation. The company's safety manager telephoned the poison center for medical advice 10 minutes after the exposure. The workers reported dizziness, nausea, cough, irritated eyes, mouth numbness, headache, shortness of breath, chest tightness, skin redness, rash, or irritation, and muscle weakness. All eight workers were evaluated in an ED on the day of the exposure, placed in decontamination showers, and given intravenous fluids; laboratory bloodwork, chest radiographs, and electrocardiograms were analyzed. All workers were discharged from the ED the same day with no additional treatment. One worker who experienced persistent difficulty breathing and coughing at work visited the ED again 7 days later where he received an anticholinergic through a nebulizer and was prescribed a long-acting anticholinergic inhaler and an oral steroid. Four workers were referred by their employer to an occupational medicine physician 1 month after the exposure for ongoing shortness of breath, coughing, weekly headaches, and a sore throat. Symptoms among the other four workers resolved by the time they were discharged from the ED. The workers' signs and symptoms of eye, skin, and respiratory irritation were consistent with the known toxic effects of the pesticides identified by the manufacturers. With the exception of one worker who continued to require treatment for new-onset asthma 5 weeks after exposure, all exposed workers' symptoms were resolved by 5 weeks following the exposure. ED records of the two workers not interviewed indicated their symptoms subsided before they were discharged from the ED.

### Sun, iron, alcohol and intrinsic liver disease: a recipe for failure [^fd64d353]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 62-year-old Caucasian woman, with remote history of painful skin blistering and hypertrichosis, recent history of travel to Mexico and increased alcohol consumption, presented with progressively worsening jaundice and fatigue. Physical examination was remarkable for severe generalised jaundice, scleral icterus and erythematous facial blistering and scarring. Laboratory workup revealed markedly elevated total and direct bilirubin, mildly elevated transaminases, severe iron overload and increased urine coproporphyrin. Porphyria cutanea tarda was diagnosed, and she was treated with supportive measures including hydration and alcohol cessation. Pathology of her liver demonstrated mild iron overload and severe fatty infiltration. Hospital follow-up revealed complete resolution of jaundice and fatigue and near-normalisation of liver function tests.

### The life-threatening rash of poisoning [^4aa1bcb9]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Dermatology is frequently viewed by physician and surgical colleagues as a specialty with few emergencies. Although the majority of dermatology practice is in the office setting, cutaneous emergencies do occur through referrals from primary care and as ward consults. Even though cutaneous signs of poisoning would be an uncommon emergency consultation, it is important for dermatologists to be aware of the clinical presentations so as to be able instigate appropriate time critical treatments.

### Lomefloxacin hydrochloride (Maxaquin) [^c05e9b94]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Information for patients

Patients should be advised

to avoid to the maximum extent possible direct or indirect sunlight (including exposure through glass and exposure through sunscreens and sunblocks) and artificial ultraviolet light (eg sunlamps) during treatment with lomefloxacin and for several days after therapy;
that they may reduce the risk of developing phototoxicity from sunlight by taking the daily dose of lomefloxacin at least 12 hours before exposure to the sun (eg in the evening);
to discontinue lomefloxacin therapy at the first signs or symptoms of phototoxicity reaction such as a sensation of skin burning, redness, swelling, blisters, rash, itching, or dermatitis;
that a patient who has experienced a phototoxic reaction should avoid re-exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light until he has completely recovered from the reaction. In rare cases, reactions have recurred up to several weeks after stopping lomefloxacin therapy.
to drink fluids liberally;
that lomefloxacin can be taken without regard to meals;
that mineral supplements or vitamins with iron or minerals should not be taken within the 2-hour period before or after taking lomefloxacin (see Drug Interactions);
that sucralfate and antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, or Videx®(didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 4 hours before or 2 hours after taking lomefloxacin. (See PRECAUTIONS — Drug Interactions .)
that lomefloxacin can cause dizziness and lightheadedness and, therefore, patients should know how they react to lomefloxacin before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in activities requiring mental alertness and coordination;
to discontinue treatment and inform their physician if they experience pain, inflammation, or rupture of a tendon, and to rest and refrain from exercise until the diagnosis of tendinitis or tendon rupture has been confidently excluded;
that lomefloxacin may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions, even following the first dose, and to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a skin rash or other allergic reaction;
that convulsions have been reported in patients taking quinolones, including lomefloxacin, and to notify their physician before taking this drug if there is a history of this condition.
that antibacterial drugs including Maxaquin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Maxaquin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Maxaquin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^04c9b490]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Sun exposure in travelers — sunburn blister management states that steroids do not improve symptoms or hasten recovery. Patients with extensive blisters might require hospitalization for fluid replacement (oral or intravenous) and pain control. Treat these patients the same way as patients with thermal burns: maintain clean skin with gentle cleansing, then cover the sunburned areas liberally with emollients, and tense or painful blisters can be drained in a locally sterile manner, but a blister roof should remain intact to serve as a sterile dressing.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^e4bc4d50]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Solar urticaria — management emphasizes avoidance of identified wavelengths of light, with broad-spectrum sunscreens generally reported to be of limited benefit because most patients are sensitive to visible wavelengths. H1-antihistamines have been reported variably to prevent or ameliorate symptoms with repeated sun exposure. Patients have also been desensitized using broadband UVB, narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB), UVA, and visible light therapy, and skin exposed to natural sunlight on a regular basis might become less reactive than skin routinely covered. In phototherapy-based desensitization, the usual starting dose is less than the previously determined MUD, and therapeutic irradiation of increasing dose is administered several times a week, requiring 15 to 20 treatments.

### Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) [^349a6f10]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.5 Interference with Clinical Laboratory Evaluations and Clinical Methods

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

Because of its deep red color, hydroxocobalamin has been found to interfere with colorimetric determination of certain laboratory parameters (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urine parameters). In vitro tests indicated that the extent and duration of the interference are dependent on numerous factors such as the dose of hydroxocobalamin, analyte, methodology, analyzer, hydroxocobalamin concentration, and partially on the time between sampling and measurement.

The data presented in Table 2 is collected from in vitro studies and pharmacokinetic data in healthy volunteers and describes laboratory interference that may be observed following a 5 g dose of hydroxocobalamin. Interference following a 10 g dose can be expected to last up to an additional 24 hours. The extent and duration of interference in cyanide-poisoned patients may differ. In addition, results may vary substantially from one analyzer to another. Be aware of this when reporting and interpreting laboratory results.

Clinical Methods

Because of its deep red color, hydroxocobalamin may cause hemodialysis machines to shut down due to an erroneous detection of a "blood leak". This should be considered before hemodialysis is initiated in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin.

5.6 Photosensitivity

Hydroxocobalamin absorbs visible light in the UV spectrum. It therefore has potential to cause photosensitivity. While it is not known if the skin redness predisposes to photosensitivity, patients should be advised to avoid direct sun while their skin remains discolored.

5.7 Use of Blood Cyanide Assay

While determination of blood cyanide concentration is not required for management of cyanide poisoning and should not delay treatment with CYANOKIT, collecting a pretreatment blood sample may be useful for documenting cyanide poisoning as sampling post-CYANOKIT use may be inaccurate.

### Phenotypic and treatment outcome data on SUNCT and SUNA, including a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^9788575b]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Migrainous background

Both SUNCT and SUNA patients had a background migrainous biology in 57% of cases for which we had data. In a model examining the pain features, a migrainous background was strongly associated with background pain between attacks (Wald χ² = 6.5, p = 0.01) and worsening of pain during the attack (Wald χ² = 8.2, p = 0.004). In a model examining the canonical migraine features, the presence of nausea was not associated with migrainous biology (Wald χ² = 1.04, p = 0.307), whereas the presence of either photophobia or phonophobia was associated (Wald χ² = 6.8, p = 0.009). Worsening of background pain with movement was seen in 26% (n = 55) of SUNCT cases and in 46% (n = 28) of SUNA cases. Nausea was seen in 27% (n = 64) of SUNCT cases and 29% (n = 35) of SUNA cases. Similarly, for photophobia or phonophobia, 61% (n = 64) of SUNCT and 58% (n = 36) of SUNA cases had one, or both, symptoms.

What should I avoid while using PROTOPIC Ointment?

Do not use ultraviolet light therapy, sun lamps, or tanning beds during
treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment.
Limit sun exposure during treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment even when the
medicine is not on your skin. If you need to be outdoors after applying PROTOPIC
Ointment, wear loose fitting clothing that protects the treated area from the
sun. Ask your doctor what other types of protection from the sun you should
use.
Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages, dressings or wraps. You
can wear normal clothing.
Avoid getting PROTOPIC Ointment in the eyes or mouth. Do not swallow
PROTOPIC Ointment. If you do, call your doctor.

What are the possible side effects of PROTOPIC
Ointment?

Please read the first section of this Medication
Guide.

The most common side effects of PROTOPIC Ointment at
the skin application site are stinging, burning, or itching of the skin treated
with PROTOPIC. These side effects are usually mild to moderate, are most common
during the first few days of treatment, and usually go away as your skin
heals.

Other side effects include acne, swollen or infected
hair follicles, headache, increased sensitivity of the skin to hot or cold
temperatures, or flu-like symptoms such as the common cold and stuffy nose, skin
tingling, upset stomach, muscle pain, swollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes), or
skin infections including cold sores, chicken pox or shingles.

### Sun safety… [^13a7cfa2]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Sun safety is complicated by the important health benefits of outdoor activity and exercise. Overexposure to the sun and UV light is associated with painful sunburn in people with light skin and can cause irritation or excess skin darkening in those with medium or darker skin. Many episodes of overexposure may increase the risk of skin cancer and lead to early aging of the skin. People may choose safe sun practices: Options for Sun Protection Shade: Find a tree, umbrella, or shelter under an awning. Clothing: UV-protective gear, such as tightly woven clothing that you cannot see your hand through is best. The more skin coverage the better: long-sleeved shirts and long pants are best. If this is not possible, then wear a shirt that covers the shoulders and shorts with sunscreen on exposed skin.

Sunglasses: They should block both UV-A and UV-B to protect the delicate skin around the eyes and protect the eyes against cataracts. Sunscreen: Apply a generous layer of broad-spectrum sunscreen with sun protection factor 30 before going outside. If you use 2 coats, you miss fewer areas. Do one area of the body, let it dry, and then go back and apply another coat. After applying sunscreen, wash your hands to keep from getting it in your eyes. Sunscreen wears off, especially when toweling after swimming or sweating, and should be reapplied. Put it on again after 80 minutes of sweating or being in the water. Reapply every 2 hours if you are not wet. When and Where to Use Sun Protection Even when it is cloudy; clouds and haze do not block sunlight. Near water, snow, ice, and sand; UV is reflected and comes under the hat or umbrella to the skin. Protect children and teach them safe sun habits.

About 15 minutes of sun in the middle of the day in summer a few times a week will be enough for the body's vitamin D needs. Diets with egg yolks, fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel, and fortified milk and cereal can satisfy your vitamin D needs without sun exposure, or you can take supplements of 200 IUs per day up to age 50, 400 IUs to age 70, and 600 IUs over 70.

### Feeling the burn: phototoxicity and photoallergy [^140bd811]. Dermatologic Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

An interaction between light's radiation and certain exogenous and endogenous substances can lead to the development of photoallergic and/or phototoxic dermatoses. Clinically, reactions may range from acute and self-limited to chronic and recurrent. Delays in diagnosis are not uncommon due to complex clinical presentations, broad differentials, and limited number of specialists who perform phototesting. Therefore, a critical understanding of these dermatoses is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. The epidemiology, light sources, mechanisms, clinical presentations, evaluation protocols, common culprits, treatments, key challenges, and future directions related to photoallergy and phototoxicity are reviewed herein.

### A photodistributed rash in a patient on apixaban [^6bd9786e]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the recommended management strategy for this patient?
A. Discontinuation of apixaban in consultation with cardiologist, topical corticosteroids, and sun protection
B. Oral hydroxychloroquine
C. Methotrexate
D. Discontinuation of apixaban and initiation of rivaroxaban
E. Systemic corticosteroids

Answers:
A. Discontinuation of apixaban in consultation with cardiologist, topical corticosteroids, and sun protection – Correct. Initial management of SCLE involves topical corticosteroids for localized lesions and strict sun protection measures to prevent exacerbation of the photosensitive rash. Adjusting medications known to induce SCLE, if possible, is also recommended.
B. Oral hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. While hydroxychloroquine is a standard treatment for SCLE, it is often used in combination with topical corticosteroids initially, especially for mild cases. However, it is not typically the first-line therapy without adjunctive topical treatment.
C. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Methotrexate can be considered in more severe or refractory cases of SCLE but is not typically first-line therapy. It may be used as a steroid-sparing agent or in combination with other treatments.
D. Discontinuation of apixaban and initiation of rivaroxaban – Incorrect. Both apixaban and rivaroxaban are factor Xa inhibitors, or direct oral anticoagulants. This class of medication has been rarely reported as culprits of drug induced lupus and there is insufficient data to suggest switching to a medication within the same class is safe or effective.
E. Systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids are reserved for more severe cases or when topical treatments are inadequate. This patient was transitioned to ultra-potent topical steroids

### Purpura and erythema associated with cutaneous numbness and hyperesthesia [^58685869]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the treatment for this condition?
A. Topical corticosteroids
B. Aloe vera
C. Antibiotics
D. Self-resolution
E. Intralesional kenalog

Answers:
A. Topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. Topical corticosteroids are useful for dermatologic conditions whose etiology involves inflammation or hyperproliferation, neither of which are the etiology of our patient's condition.
B. Aloe vera – Incorrect. Aloe vera is occasionally used on sunburned skin; however, no clear evidence showing improved outcomes in superficial burns has been shown.
C. Antibiotics – Incorrect. Antibiotics can be used for an infectious process, but the etiology of our patient's condition is not infectious.
D. Self-resolution – Correct. The blanching resolved within hours, but the extensive erythema of her bilateral legs developed into ecchymoses within 24 hours. This interesting phenomenon of diving-related blanching with purpura is not previously described in the medical literature to our knowledge. The diver's ecchymoses resolved within 10 days without treatment.
E. Intralesional kenalog – Incorrect. Intralesional kenalog is used for various inflammatory conditions. The etiology of our patient's condition is not inflammatory.

### Vitamin D toxicity in a pediatric toxicological referral center; a cross-sectional study from iran [^f05f78b5]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble pro-hormone primarily synthesized in skin by sun-light exposure. Dairy products, fish, and mushrooms may also contain small amounts of vitamin D. This vitamin has a crucial role in the health of the musculoskeletal system. Furthermore, vitamin D has beneficial effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems.

Due to issues including heavy clothing, air pollution, reduced exposure to direct sunlight, inadequate nutrition, and lack of access to vitamin D-rich food especially among children, vitamin D deficiency is a common health problem in our country. Thus, consumption of vitamin D containing supplements is encouraged in Iran during the recent years making them more available for unintentional poisonings in children although the frequency of poisoning with these supplements is still low compared to other poisonings in them. Vitamin D toxicity may also happen as a result of inappropriate dose administration by physicians or errors in manufacturing or unlicensed vitamin D preparations.

Daily recommended dose of vitamin D supplements is reported to be 400 IU in infants, 600 IU in people younger than 70 years of age, and 800 IU in people over 70. Since studies in this regard are lacking in children, we aimed to assess all children with vitamin D toxicity referring to a tertiary referral center of toxicology during a year.

### Clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide [^e3df6635]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

- **Colitis**: Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2% / 2.5% should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1)

- **Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure**: Minimize sun exposure following drug application. (5.2)

5.1 Colitis

Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of clindamycin. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. When significant diarrhea occurs, Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2% / 2.5% should be discontinued.

Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death.

Studies indicate toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically.

5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure

Minimize sun exposure including use of tanning beds or sun lamps following drug application [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### The cockayne syndrome natural history (CoSyNH) study: clinical findings in 102 individuals and recommendations for care [^f5e8a2e2]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Dermatological and dental

In three individuals the presence of photosensitivity was unclear because of preemptive management. Twenty-three of 99 study participants have no dermal photosensitivity. Forty-six of 99 sunburn easily, but more explicit photosensitivity is present in only 40; these participants sunburn on cloudy days or blister following exposure to sunlight. Sun avoidance prevents issues among the latter group, whereas the former group effectively use simple measures, such as the use of sunscreen and hats. Individuals with CS are not at increased risk of developing skin cancers. Thinning hair and skin hyperpigmentation have been noted in previous reports and are present in 46 and 29% of our cohort, respectively, but they have no clinical significance. There is no evidence to support routine dermatology input in CS. Review may be required upon the initial presentation of more marked photosensitivity, however, and may be useful in individuals with dry or itchy skin. Dental caries, which likely represents enamel hypoplasia, has been reported more frequently in the literature than they occur in our cohort (46.4%). Nevertheless, families should be encouraged to maintain regular dental review so that problems relating to enamel hypoplasia can be addressed early.

Medication

We already highlighted (above and elsewhere) that metronidazole causes acute hepatic failure in CS, which may be fatal. The clinical presentation can be similar to an untreated paracetamol overdose, with extremely increased transaminase concentrations and significant clotting abnormalities. Metronidazole is therefore absolutely contraindicated in CS. Antibiotics of the same class should also be avoided, or used with extreme caution and close monitoring of liver function. There is no evidence of toxicity associated with drugs metabolized in the liver in general.

An exaggerated response to sedative and opioid medications — from respiratory depression to blunted affect lasting several days following administration of codeine — was reported in five cases.

### Vitamin D for the treatment of chronic painful conditions in adults [^fa023d42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is produced in the skin after sun-light exposure and can also be obtained through food. Vitamin D deficiency has recently been linked with a range of diseases including chronic pain. Observational and circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a role for vitamin D deficiency in the aetiology of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and adverse events of vitamin D supplementation in chronic painful conditions.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to September 2009. This was supplemented by searching the reference lists of retrieved articles, textbooks and reviews.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomised double blind trials of vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo or with active comparators for the treatment of chronic pain conditions in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. Pooled analysis was not undertaken due to paucity and heterogeneity of data.

Main Results

Four studies, with a total of 294 participants, were included. The studies were heterogeneous with regard to study quality, the chronic painful conditions that were investigated, and the outcome measures reported. Only one study reported a beneficial effect, the others found no benefit of vitamin D over placebo in treating chronic pain.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence base for the use of vitamin D for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. This is due to low quality and insufficient randomised controlled trials in this area of research.

### NIOSH fast facts: protecting yourself from sun exposure… [^3ae72112]. CDC (2020). Medium credibility.

Sunburn Sunburn is not immediately apparent. Symptoms usually start about 4 hours after sun exposure, worsen in 24–36 hours, and resolve in 3–5 days. They include red, tender and swollen skin, blistering, headache, fever, nausea, and fatigue. In addition to the skin, eyes can become sunburned. Sunburned eyes become red, dry, painful, and feel gritty. Chronic eye exposure can cause permanent damage, including blindness. First Aid
- Take aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen to relieve pain, headache, and fever.
- Drink plenty of water to help replace fluid losses.
- Comfort burns with cool baths or the gentle application of cool wet cloths.
- Avoid further exposure until the burn has resolved.
- Use of a topical moisturizing cream, aloe, or 1% hydrocortisone cream may provide additional relief. If blistering occurs:

- Lightly bandage or cover the area with gauze to prevent infection.
- Do not break blisters.
- When the blisters break and the skin peels, dried skin fragments may be removed and an antiseptic ointment or hydrocortisone cream may be applied. Seek medical attention if any of the following occur:

- Severe sunburns covering more than 15% of the body
- Dehydration
- High fever
- Extreme pain that persists for longer than 48 hours. Protect Yourself
- Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun when possible.
- Wear sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 15.
- SPF refers to how long a person will be protected from a burn. SPF only refers to UVB protection.
- **To protect against UVA, look for products containing**: Mexoryl, Parsol 1789, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, or avobenzone.
- Sunscreen performance is affected by wind, humidity, perspiration, and proper application.
- Throw away sunscreens after 1–2 years.
- Apply liberally at least 20 minutes before sun exposure.
- Apply to ears, scalp, lips, neck, tops of feet, and backs of hands.
- Reapply at least every 2 hours and each time a person gets out of the water or perspires heavily.

### Interventions for actinic keratoses [^6ac2f9d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Actinic keratoses are a skin disease caused by long-term sun exposure, and their lesions have the potential to develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Treatments for actinic keratoses are sought for cosmetic reasons, for the relief of associated symptoms, or for the prevention of skin cancer development. Detectable lesions are often associated with alteration of the surrounding skin (field) where subclinical lesions might be present. The interventions available for the treatment of actinic keratoses include individual lesion-based (e.g. cryotherapy) or field-directed (e.g. topical) treatments. These might vary in terms of efficacy, safety, and cosmetic outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical, oral, mechanical, and chemical interventions for actinic keratosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to March 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials registers, conference proceedings, and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the treatment of actinic keratoses with either placebo, vehicle, or another active therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors independently abstracted data, which included adverse events, and assessed the quality of evidence. We performed meta-analysis to calculate a weighted treatment effect across trials, and we expressed the results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. participant complete clearance rates), and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes (e.g. mean reduction in lesion counts).

Main Results

We included 83 RCTs in this review, with a total of 10,036 participants. The RCTs covered 18 topical treatments, 1 oral treatment, 2 mechanical interventions, and 3 chemical interventions, including photodynamic therapy (PDT). Most of the studies lacked descriptions of some methodological details, such as the generation of the randomisation sequence or allocation concealment, and half of the studies had a high risk of reporting bias. Study comparison was difficult because of the multiple parameters used to report efficacy and safety outcomes, as well as statistical limitations. We found no data on the possible reduction of squamous cell carcinoma. The primary outcome 'participant complete clearance' significantly favoured four field-directed treatments compared to vehicle or placebo: 3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronic acid (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.66; 3 studies with 420 participants), 0.5% 5-fluorouracil (RR 8.86, 95% CI: 3.67 to 21.44; 3 studies with 522 participants), 5% imiquimod (RR 7.70, 95% CI 4.63 to 12.79; 9 studies with1871 participants), and 0.025% to 0.05% ingenol mebutate (RR 4.50, 95% CI 2.61 to 7.74; 2 studies with 456 participants). It also significantly favoured the treatment of individual lesions with photodynamic therapy (PDT) compared to placebo-PDT with the following photosensitisers: aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (blue light: RR 6.22, 95% CI 2.88 to 13.43; 1 study with 243 participants, aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (red light: RR 5.94, 95% CI 3.35 to 10.54; 3 studies with 422 participants), and methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) (red light: RR 4.46, 95% CI 3.17 to 6.28; 5 studies with 482 participants). ALA-PDT was also significantly favoured compared to cryotherapy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.64). The corresponding comparative risks in terms of number of participants completely cleared per 1000 were as follows: 313 with 3% diclofenac compared to 127 with 2.5% hyaluronic acid; 136 with 0.5% 5-fluorouracil compared to 15 with placebo; 371 with 5% imiquimod compared to 48 with placebo; 331 with ingenol mebutate compared to 73 with vehicle; 527 to 656 with ALA/MAL-PDT treatment compared to 89 to 147 for placebo-PDT; and 580 with ALA-PDT compared to 443 with cryotherapy.5% 5-fluorouracil efficacy was not compared to placebo, but it was comparable to 5% imiquimod (RR 1.85, 95% Cl 0.41 to 8.33). A significant number of participants withdrew because of adverse events with 144 participants affected out of 1000 taking 3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronic acid, compared to 40 participants affected out of 1000 taking 2.5% hyaluronic acid alone, and 56 participants affected out of 1000 taking 5% imiquimod compared to 21 participants affected out of 1000 taking placebo. Based on investigator and participant evaluation, imiquimod treatment and photodynamic therapy resulted in better cosmetic outcomes than cryotherapy and 5-fluorouracil.

Authors' Conclusions

For individual lesions, photodynamic therapy appears more effective and has a better cosmetic outcome than cryotherapy. For field-directed treatments, diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, and ingenol mebutate had similar efficacy, but their associated adverse events and cosmetic outcomes are different. More direct comparisons between these treatments are needed to determine the best therapeutic approach.

Solar urticaria — clinical features and natural history describe rapid onset of wheals with sun exposure, generally within 1–3 minutes, with typical wheals developing within 1 to 3 minutes and a 1- to 3-hour delay reported but less typical. Symptoms usually resolve after stopping exposure, usually within 30 minutes and almost always within 24 hours, though in rare cases they can persist for more than 24 hours. It is initially present in pediatric and older adult (age > 65 years) patients, with a usual age of onset between 20 and 41 years, and retrospective studies suggest resolution in 15% to 86% of patients after 5 years of symptoms. Triggers include UVB (280–320 nm), UVA (320–400 nm), visible light (400–600 nm), and even infrared (> 600 nm) radiation.

Photosensitivity disorders in children encompass a diverse group of diseases. Compared to adult patients, underlying systemic disorders, including genetic or metabolic defects, are common causes in pediatric photosensitivity disorders. Photosensitivity in a child should be suspected if the child develops a sunburn reaction in sun-exposed sites after limited sun exposure. Diagnosis of a photodermatosis is made based on careful history taking and a physical examination. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis are essential to minimize long-term complications associated with inadequate photoprotection. In part I of this continuing medical education article, immunologically mediated photodermatoses, photodermatoses caused by exogenous photosensitizers, and the cutaneous porphyrias will be covered.

### The untold story of the scorching sun – A wake up call for sun protection [^6f5ab8f7]. Burns (2018). Low credibility.

Despite extensive warnings from health authorities regarding the dangers of direct sunlight exposure, most people still turn to sun bathing to get a golden tan. Unfortunately, that pleasant tan appearance is often lost because of over exposure to sunlight, resulting in painful red sunburns. In this paper we are reporting a case with significant sunburn injuries that required hospitalization and treatment in a burn center. Concurrently a pilot study was conducted to assess the knowledge about sun protection among the adult population and the results are discussed. The results obtained from the study revealed the lack of knowledge regarding sun protection and sun seeking behaviour among the responders. Deeper burns are rarely caused by direct sunlight exposure and are underreported in literature. Despite extensive health education and warnings, there are significant numbers of sunburn injuries reported annually. On most occasions, these are superficial and are in the form of erythema. Nonetheless, the public is unaware of the impending risks of developing deep sunburn injuries that can occur especially during protracted holiday exposures. Therefore, it is crucial to escalate public awareness and to implement preventive measures to reduce the short and long-term risks of sun exposure.

Background — Toxicodendron dermatitis epidemiology and course: Contact dermatitis from Toxicodendron species, including poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, affects millions of Americans annually, resulting in millions of visits to health care facilities each year. Approximately 50% to 75% of individuals react to urushiol, and skin effects including redness, papules and vesicles, and itching typically start within days of exposure and can last up to 3 weeks. Therefore, initial treatment is aimed at preventing or removing exposure to urushiol, with later first aid aimed at management of symptoms, and data on treatment effectiveness are limited, with few clinical trials.

### Photosensitivity disorders: cause, effect and management [^1b3dbab7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Abnormal photosensitivity syndromes form a significant and common group of skin diseases. They include primary (idiopathic) photodermatoses such as polymorphic light eruption (PLE), chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD), actinic prurigo, hydroa vacciniforme and solar urticaria, in addition to drug- and chemical-induced photosensitivity and photo-exacerbated dermatoses. They can be extremely disabling and difficult to diagnose. PLE, characterized by a recurrent pruritic papulo-vesicular eruption of affected skin within hours of sun exposure, is best managed by restriction of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and the use of high sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreens. If these measures are insufficient, prophylactic phototherapy with PUVA, broadband UVB or narrowband UVB (TL-01) for several weeks during spring may be necessary. CAD manifests as a dermatitis of chronically sun-exposed skin. Again, UVR exposure needs to be restricted; cyclosporine, azathioprine or PUVA may also be necessary. Actinic prurigo is characterized by the presence of excoriated papules and nodules on the face and limbs, most prominent and numerous distally. Actinic prurigo is managed again by restriction of UVR and the use of high SPF sunscreens; PUVA or broadband UVB therapy, or low doses of thalidomide may be necessary. Hydroa vacciniforme causes crops of discrete erythematous macules, 2 to 3mm in size, that evolve into blisters within a couple of days of sun exposure. Treatment for this rare disease is difficult; absorbent sunscreens and restricted UVR exposure may help. Solar urticaria is characterized by acute erythema and urticarial wealing after exposure to UVR. Treatment options for solar urticaria include non-sedating antihistamines such as fexofenadine and cetirizine; other options include absorbent sunscreens, restriction of UVR at the relevant wavelength, maintenance of a non-responsive state with natural or artificial light exposure and plasmapheresis. Industrial, cosmetic and therapeutic agents can induce exogenous drug- or chemical-induced photosensitivity. The clinical pattern is highly varied, depending on the agent; treatment is based on removal of the photosensitizer along with restriction of UVR exposure. Predominantly non-photosensitive dermatoses may also be exacerbated or precipitated by UVR; exposure to UVR should be reduced and sunscreens should be advocated, along with appropriate treatment of the underlying disease.

### Sun safety facts | Skin cancer… [^761d7bf4]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview Spending time outside is a great way to be physically active and reduce stress. You can work and play outside without raising your skin cancer risk by protecting your skin from the sun. Most skin cancers are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet light. UV rays are an invisible kind of radiation that comes from the sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. UV rays can damage skin cells. How to protect your skin from the sun Shade You can reduce your risk of sun damage and skin cancer by staying in the shade under an umbrella, tree, or other shelter. Your best bet to protect your skin is to use sunscreen or wear protective clothing when you're outside — even when you're in the shade. Clothing When possible, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts, which can provide protection from UV rays. If wearing this type of clothing isn't practical, try to wear a T-shirt or a beach cover-up. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection.

A wet T-shirt offers much less UV protection than a dry one, and darker colors may offer more protection than lighter colors. Some clothing is certified under international standards as offering UV protection. Hat For the most protection, wear a hat that has a brim all the way around that shades your face, your ears, and the back of your neck. A tightly woven fabric, such as canvas, works best to protect your skin from UV rays. Avoid straw hats with holes that let sunlight through. A darker hat may offer more UV protection. If you wear a baseball cap, you should also protect your ears and the back of your neck by wearing clothing that covers those areas, using sunscreen, or staying in the shade. Sunscreen Put on broad spectrum sunscreen that filters out both UVA and UVB rays and has an SPF of 15 or higher before you go outside. Don't forget to put a thick layer on all exposed skin. Get help for hard-to-reach places like your back.

And remember, sunscreen works best when combined with other options. Promote sun-safe behaviors
- Encourage students to wear hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen outdoors.
- Try to avoid scheduling outdoor activities when the sun is strongest.
- Provide breaks during outdoor activities so that students can reapply sunscreen and get water. Use proven educational programs Proven skin cancer prevention interventions and educational programs are available for child care centers and schools. The National Cancer Institute's Evidence-Based Cancer Control Programs website lists sun-safety programs for schools.

### Sun protection for preventing basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers [^10b2243c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

'Keratinocyte cancer' is now the preferred term for the most commonly identified skin cancers basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), which were previously commonly categorised as non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Keratinocyte cancer (KC) represents about 95% of malignant skin tumours. Lifestyle changes have led to increased exposure to the sun, which has, in turn, led to a significant increase of new cases of KC, with a worldwide annual incidence of between 3% and 8%. The successful use of preventive measures could mean a significant reduction in the resources used by health systems, compared with the high cost of the treatment of these conditions. At present, there is no information about the quality of the evidence for the use of these sun protection strategies with an assessment of their benefits and risks.

Objectives

To assess the effects of sun protection strategies (i.e. sunscreen and barrier methods) for preventing keratinocyte cancer (that is, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the skin) in the general population.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trial registries and the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of preventive strategies for keratinocyte cancer, such as physical barriers and sunscreens, in the general population (children and adults), which may provide information about benefits and adverse events related to the use of solar protection measures. We did not include trials focused on educational strategies to prevent KC or preventive strategies in high-risk groups. Our prespecified primary outcomes were BCC or cSCC confirmed clinically or by histopathology at any follow-up and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for eligibility using Early Review Organizing Software (EROS). Similarly, two review authors independently used predesigned data collection forms to extract information from the original study reports about the participants, methods of randomisation, blinding, comparisons of interest, number of participants originally randomised by arm, follow-up losses, and outcomes, and they assessed the risk of bias. We resolved any disagreement by consulting a third author and contacted trial investigators of identified trials to obtain additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one RCT (factorial design) that randomised 1621 participants. This study compared the daily application of sunscreen compared with discretionary use of sunscreen, with or without beta-carotene administration, in the general population. The study was undertaken in Australia; 55.2% of participants had fair skin, and they were monitored for 4.5 years for new cases of BCC or cSCC assessed by histopathology. We found this study to be at low risk of bias for domains such as allocation, blinding, and incomplete outcome data. However, we found multiple unclear risks related to other biases, including an unclear assessment of possible interactions between the effects of the different interventions evaluated (that is, sunscreen and beta-carotene). We found no difference in terms of the number of participants developing BCC (n = 1621; risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.43) or cSCC (n = 1621; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.54) when comparing daily application of sunscreen with discretionary use, even when analyses were restricted to groups without beta-carotene supplementation. This evidence was of low quality, which means that there is some certainty that future studies may alter our confidence in this evidence. We reported adverse events in a narrative way and included skin irritation or contact allergy. We identified no studies that evaluated other sun protection measures, such as the use of sun-protective clothing, sunglasses, or hats, or seeking the shade when outdoors.

Authors' Conclusions

In this review, we assessed the effect of solar protection in preventing the occurrence of new cases of keratinocyte cancer. We only found one study that was suitable for inclusion. This was a study of sunscreens, so we were unable to assess any other forms of sun protection. The study addressed our prespecified primary outcomes, but not most of our secondary outcomes. We were unable to demonstrate from the available evidence whether sunscreen was effective for the prevention of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Our certainty in the evidence was low because there was a lack of histopathological confirmation of BCC or cSCC in a significant percentage of cases. Amongst other sources of bias, it was not clear whether the study authors had assessed any interaction effects between the sunscreen and beta-carotene interventions. We think that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.

### Poisoning through pediatric skin: cases from the literature [^08416f8d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Poisoning through pediatric skin leading to acute systemic symptoms is a relatively uncommonly reported phenomenon. Systemic toxicity through the skin typically occurs by direct contact between therapeutic or non-therapeutic topical agents and the skin. Though uncommon, poisoning through pediatric skin can have significant consequences and must be recognized so the offending agent may be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. We performed a literature search for all article types between 1950 and April 2016 to provide a single source of detectable cases of acute toxicity in pediatric patients due to percutaneous exposure. This literature review discusses relevant pediatric skin physiology along with reports of poisoning events that resulted in systemic signs and symptoms and even death to provide a comprehensive report on causes of pediatric poisoning through the skin.

### UV-based therapy and vitamin D [^23884506]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The ultraviolet (UV) light spectrum has long been known to induce biologic effect on the skin. For a large number of cutaneous disorders, phototherapy and photochemotherapy are effective therapeutic options with excellent safety profiles and well-documented side effects. Despite their ease of administration and benefits, phototherapeutic treatment modalities require appropriate space for the equipment, trained staff, and patient education prior to initiating treatment. However, when the initial barriers to treatment can be overcome, UV therapy can offer patients significant relief from their cutaneous disease. Furthermore, UVB-based phototherapy can produce significant alteration to vitamin D levels. With the recent research implicating association of low vitamin D levels with a variety of health conditions, whether patients receiving phototherapy or, more specifically, those getting vitamin D supplement may be protected from these diseases remains to be established.

### Photoprotection for skin of all color: consensus and clinical guidance from an expert panel [^dab15a64]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The negative effects of sun exposure have become better accepted among health care professionals and the lay public over recent decades. Most attention has been focused on the effects of UV light, particularly UVB wavelengths (290–320 nm). Accordingly, products to protect skin from sunlight-associated harm (sunscreens) have been developed to minimize UVB exposure. The effects of longer wavelengths, including UVA (320–400 nm) and visible light (VL, 400–700 nm), are increasingly appreciated. VL accounts for approximately half of the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface and understanding of its effects on the skin is improving. Studies have shown that VL can induce hyperpigmentation in individuals with dark skin types (Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI). In addition, VL can contribute to the exacerbation of pigmentary disorders, including melasma. Because these findings are relatively new, there are gaps in understanding the needs for photoprotection and guidance for clinicians. A panel of dermatologists and photobiologists was convened to develop consensus recommendations and clinical guidance about sunscreen use relevant to the current understanding of risks associated with sun exposure using a modified Delphi method.

### Medical therapies for non-melanoma skin cancer [^1945631e]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The epidemic of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) continues, in part due to aging of the world's population, the frequency of early childhood sunburns, and episodic intense recreational sun exposure as opposed to sun exposure related to outdoor occupations. A nonsurgical approach to selected skin cancers could potentially decrease the expense and morbidity of surgical treatment for NMSC. The increase of comorbid medical conditions in the elderly makes alternatives to surgical management preferable under certain circumstances. This review will discuss medical alternatives ranging from biologic response modifiers to COX-2 inhibitors to lifestyle modifications, as well as their roles in the management of NMSC. This preliminary information will expand to include more therapeutic options for NMSC in the future. Further clinical trials are needed to better elucidate possible alternative treatment strategies for NMSC.

### A randomized, controlled study of the safety and efficacy of topical corticosteroid treatments of sunburn in healthy volunteers [^8af4c3d5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Topical glucocorticosteroids are frequently used for the treatment of sunburn despite the scarcity of randomized, double-blind controlled trials to support this indication. This randomized, intra-individually controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of two topical glucocorticosteroids, 0.1% methylprednisolone aceponate milk (MPA) and 0.1% hydrocortisone 17-butyrate emulsion (HCB), for treatment of sunburn in 24 healthy volunteers of skin type III. After irradiation of the skin by simulated sunlight, treatments were blinded and randomly allocated to 36 cm2 test areas on both sides of the spine. Volunteers were treated twice daily for 7 days and assessed daily with 1-day follow-up. The untreated area was not blinded. Primary efficacy measures were sum score and sunburn reaction based on erythema, oedema, burning and itching. Secondary efficacy measures were physician's global assessment, individual signs/symptoms, colorimetry, dermatological improvement, and time to healing. Intra-individual comparisons were made. Differences in sum score were apparent on days 3–4 and significant on days 4–5 for corticosteroids compared with nontreatment. Treated areas had significantly lower sunburn reaction than untreated areas (P = 0.1% and P = 0.5% for MPA and HCB, respectively). Differences between treatments were not significant. Secondary efficacy measures were in line with these findings. None of the three adverse events reported were considered to be related to treatment. We conclude that MPA and HCB are safe and effective in the treatment of sunburn.

Phytophotodermatitis and other noninfectious exposures — Phytophotodermatitis is a noninfectious condition resulting from the interaction of natural psoralens, most common in the juice of limes, and solar ultraviolet A radiation, and this often occurs on tropical vacations after travelers are outside, preparing food or drinks with locally purchased limes. Several days later, the involved surfaces may develop painful streaks of blisters, essentially the equivalent of an exaggerated sunburn, and the area heals slowly, evolving into asymptomatic hyperpigmented lines that may take weeks or months to resolve; because of the several-day delay between the exposure to lime juice and sunlight, people rarely self-identify the cause. Long linear lesions caused by cnidarian envenomation (e.g., stings from the tentacles of jellyfish or Portuguese man o' war [Physalia physalis]) often resemble phytophotodermatitis, and another common cause of an itchy, often blistering eruption is acute contact dermatitis due to black henna; in places where henna is commonly used, the compound paraphenylenediamine is often added to red or brown henna.

### Photoaggravated disorders [^a4b57ee8]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Photoaggravated skin disorders are diseases that occur without UV radiation but are sometimes or frequently exacerbated by UV radiation. In conditions, such as lupus erythematosus, photoaggravation occurs in a majority of patients, whereas in conditions, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, only a subset of patients demonstrate photoaggravation. Polymorphous light eruption is a common photodermatosis in all skin types, making it important to differentiate photoaggravation of an underlying disorder, such as lupus erythematosus, from superimposed polymorphous light eruption. Disease-specific treatments should be instituted where possible. A key component of management of photoaggravated conditions is photoprotection with behavioral change, UV-protective clothing, and broad-spectrum sunscreen.

The Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel to develop a set of evidence-based guidelines for prevention and treatment of frostbite. We present a review of pertinent pathophysiology. We then discuss primary and secondary prevention measures and therapeutic management. Recommendations are made regarding each treatment and its role in management. These recommendations are graded on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence and balance between the benefits and risks or burdens for each modality according to methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians. This is an updated version of the guidelines published in 2014.

Box 3.2.1 Heat stroke management — In the field, maintain the airway if the victim is unconscious and activate emergency medical services or plan for urgent evacuation, but do not delay cooling measures by 1 or more of these methods (in order of increasing effectiveness): move the victim to the shade or some cool place out of the sun; increase evaporative cooling by removing excess clothing to maximize skin exposure, spraying tepid water on the skin, and maintaining air movement by fanning, or alternatively place cool or cold wet towels over the body and fan to promote evaporation; apply ice or cold packs to the neck, axilla, groin, and as much of the body as possible; vigorously massage the skin to limit constriction of blood vessels and to prevent shivering, which will increase body temperature; immerse the victim in cool or cold water (e.g., a nearby pool, natural body of water, bath) — an ice bath cools fastest — and always attend and hold the person while in the water; if body immersion is not possible, immerse the forearms and hands in cool or cold water; and encourage rehydration for those able to take oral fluids.

Sunscreens — definitions, composition, and selection guidance: sunscreens are topical preparations that reduce ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the skin by using UV filtering agents, which fall into two categories, chemical and physical; commercial sunscreens can contain either type or both, often with more than one of each, and in the United States the Food and Drug Administration regulates UV filtering agents and commercial sunscreens, whereas other countries may permit UV filters not approved in the United States; for practical selection, the best sunscreens are those that people will apply properly and regularly, and most commercial sunscreens contain 2 or more UV filters; within this chapter, "UV filter" refers to the specific agent and "commercial sunscreen" refers to the branded product applied to skin.

Tetrodotoxin poisoning — treatment is supportive; there is no specific antidote for tetrodotoxin and management is to limit absorption, with gastric lavage and activated charcoal may be indicated to limit absorption of toxin. All patients should be admitted to a hospital for observation; in moderate or severe cases, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit, and intravenous fluids, vasopressors, endotracheal intubation, and respiratory support may be necessary. Bradycardia may respond to atropine.

Phytophotodermatitis and other noninfectious exposures describe a noninfectious condition resulting from the interaction of natural psoralens, most common in the juice of limes, and solar ultraviolet A radiation, which often occurs on tropical vacations after travelers are outside preparing food or drinks with locally purchased limes. Several days later the involved surfaces may develop painful streaks of blisters, essentially the equivalent of an exaggerated sunburn; the area heals slowly, evolving into asymptomatic hyperpigmented lines that may take weeks or months to resolve, and because of the several-day delay between the exposure to lime juice and sunlight people rarely self-identify the cause. Long linear lesions caused by cnidarian envenomation (e.g., stings from the tentacles of jellyfish or Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis)) often resemble phytophotodermatitis, and another common cause of an itchy, often blistering eruption is acute contact dermatitis due to black henna.

### Updates in the general approach to the pediatric poisoned patient [^1efc7e48]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Poison prevention remains essential to prevent the most vulnerable population from becoming exposed to potentially lethal toxins. The evaluation of a child presumed to have been exposed to a toxic substance should include a precise history of the exposure, a physical examination, and knowledge of current ingestions and recreational practices. New treatments and research guiding therapy continue to evolve. Poison centers and medical toxicologists can be consulted to assist with the diagnosis of medicinal/drug overdoses, for advice about the pitfalls inherent in stabilizing children who have been exposed to toxic compounds, and for treatment recommendations based on the latest research.

Overdosage

There have been no system reactions reported from the use of topical hydroquinone. However, treatment should be limited to relatively small areas of the body at one time, since some patients experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation which does not preclude treatment.

### Extracorporeal treatment for lithium poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^270a4128]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup was created to provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of extracorporeal treatments in poisoning. Here, the EXTRIP workgroup presents its recommendations for lithium poisoning. After a systematic literature search, clinical and toxicokinetic data were extracted and summarized following a predetermined format. The entire workgroup voted through a two-round modified Delphi method to reach a consensus on voting statements. A RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was used to quantify disagreement, and anonymous votes were compiled and discussed in person. A second vote was conducted to determine the final workgroup recommendations. In total, 166 articles met inclusion criteria, which were mostly case reports, yielding a very low quality of evidence for all recommendations. A total of 418 patients were reviewed, 228 of which allowed extraction of patient-level data. The workgroup concluded that lithium is dialyzable (Level of evidence = A) and made the following recommendations: Extracorporeal treatment is recommended in severe lithium poisoning (1D). Extracorporeal treatment is recommended if kidney function is impaired and the [Li(+)] is > 4.0 mEq/L, or in the presence of a decreased level of consciousness, seizures, or life-threatening dysrhythmias irrespective of the [Li(+)] (1D). Extracorporeal treatment is suggested if the [Li(+)] is > 5.0 mEq/L, significant confusion is present, or the expected time to reduce the [Li(+)] to < 1.0 mEq/L is > 36 hours (2D). Extracorporeal treatment should be continued until clinical improvement is apparent or [Li(+)] is < 1.0 mEq/L (1D). Extracorporeal treatments should be continued for a minimum of 6 hours if the [Li(+)] is not readily measurable (1D). Hemodialysis is the preferred extracorporeal treatment (1D), but continuous RRT is an acceptable alternative (1D). The workgroup supported the use of extracorporeal treatment in severe lithium poisoning. Clinical decisions on when to use extracorporeal treatment should take into account the [Li(+)], kidney function, pattern of lithium toxicity, patient's clinical status, and availability of extracorporeal treatments.
