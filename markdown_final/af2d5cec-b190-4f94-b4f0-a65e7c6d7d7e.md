## Question

meningismus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about meningismus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining meningismus and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance and limitations of classic meningeal signs. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis across infectious and noninfectious causes. After that, I need to check the immediate diagnostic workup, including when to image before lumbar puncture and what CSF studies to order. Then, I should confirm empiric management principles and special populations. Finally, I will consider prognostic implications and synthesize a practical clinical approach with explicit cautions and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Meningismus refers to the syndrome of meningeal irritation characterized by neck stiffness and pain with flexion, photophobia, and positive Kernig's or Brudzinski's signs, reflecting mechanical stimulation of inflamed meninges and nerve roots; it is a clinical correlate of meningeal inflammation rather than a disease itself, and it can accompany both infectious and noninfectious processes.

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance of classic signs before I overinterpret them. I initially thought Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs were highly sensitive, but hold on, I should double-check that. Contemporary data show variable and often modest sensitivity and specificity; for example, a meta-analysis found nuchal rigidity sensitivity around 46%, and a Cochrane review showed pooled sensitivity and specificity for jolt accentuation of about 65% and 70%, respectively, with even lower sensitivity in those with impaired consciousness, so absence of meningeal signs cannot reliably exclude meningitis [^113FsECM] [^116P8gxK]. I should also note that in children, the absence of meningeal signs lowers the likelihood of bacterial meningitis, but again, no single sign is diagnostic, reinforcing the need to integrate the entire clinical picture [^114gjgb6].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis systematically. Infectious etiologies include acute bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, and subacute or chronic infections such as tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and Lyme neuroborreliosis; noninfectious causes include drug-induced aseptic meningitis, autoimmune meningitis, and even primary headache disorders in children where meningismus may be surprisingly prominent, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on infection alone [^117R9wb8] [^111PEg6t] [^1151vBq6] [^1116Tsqu] [^115sDHja] [^114JbzsD]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or has recent neurosurgery? In those contexts, healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis must be considered, and the absence of fever does not exclude infection, so I should maintain a low threshold for CSF evaluation [^116wyCTw] [^11714E2w].

> I will now examine the immediate diagnostic workup. I need to ensure I do not delay antibiotics while waiting for tests; if acute bacterial meningitis is suspected, empiric therapy should be started promptly, ideally within 60 minutes, while arranging lumbar puncture as soon as feasible, preferably before antibiotics when safe to do so [^1147poxR] [^115wWaAm] [^115dDsVZ]. Hold on, I should verify when to obtain neuroimaging before LP. If there are signs of raised intracranial pressure, focal deficits, new-onset seizures, GCS 10 or less, papilledema, or severe immunocompromise, guidelines recommend obtaining a head CT or MRI before LP to mitigate herniation risk, but I must not delay antibiotics for imaging if the patient is unstable or imaging is not immediately available [^114r7May] [^113wEp42] [^115wWaAm].

> Let me think about the CSF studies I should order once LP is performed. I should confirm that CSF Gram stain, culture, cell count with differential, protein, and glucose with a CSF-to-blood glucose ratio are foundational, and I should add PCR-based pathogen testing when available to improve detection, especially if cultures are negative after antibiotics; considering CSF lactate before antibiotics can help distinguish bacterial from aseptic etiologies in some settings [^1157Kvjx] [^116DoYRE] [^113NwW9t] [^112NcocW]. I need to ensure blood cultures are obtained before antibiotics when possible, as they can identify the pathogen and support diagnosis when CSF is deferred or nondiagnostic [^116GNQkz].

> Next, I should review empiric management principles. For suspected community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults, vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone is standard, with adjunctive dexamethasone given before or with the first antibiotic dose to reduce neurologic sequelae. I should tailor the regimen to local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks, and escalate or narrow based on culture and susceptibility results [^1169xEEF] [^117DWcBD] [^115sbTvg]. For pediatric patients, similar principles apply, with age-appropriate cephalosporins and vancomycin as indicated, and dexamethasone considered particularly for pneumococcal disease. I should confirm dosing and local pediatric pathways to avoid delays [^115VveNx].

> I should double-check special populations and scenarios. In suspected meningococcal disease, early recognition and immediate antibiotics are critical given the risk of rapid deterioration; public health steps including chemoprophylaxis for close contacts and notification are essential to prevent secondary cases, so I must not overlook these steps once the patient is stabilized [^116iz2eJ]. In patients with recent neurosurgery or head trauma, I need to consider healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis, where fever may be absent and CSF cell count, glucose, and protein can be unreliable; a high index of suspicion and early source control when indicated are crucial [^116wyCTw] [^112jjCLs]. In immunocompromised hosts, cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis move up the differential, and I should consider serum and CSF cryptococcal antigen, TB testing, and broader infectious evaluations guided by epidemiology and risk [^114PnMCy] [^117LFvAT].

> Let me reconsider prognostic implications to frame urgency. Acute bacterial meningitis carries substantial mortality and morbidity even with modern care, with adult mortality around one-third historically, underscoring why any patient with meningismus warrants expedited evaluation and empiric therapy while the definitive workup proceeds [^117R9wb8]. I should also remember that viral meningitis is more common than bacterial in many settings, but distinguishing them reliably requires CSF analysis; therefore, I must avoid prematurely excluding bacterial disease based on a seemingly benign presentation [^113EXoNF] [^111PEg6t].

> Finally, I need to synthesize a practical approach. If meningismus is present, I should immediately assess for red flags requiring imaging before LP, initiate empiric antibiotics without undue delay, obtain blood cultures, and perform LP as soon as safe. If LP is deferred for imaging, I must not withhold antibiotics, and I should return to complete CSF analysis promptly to refine diagnosis and management [^1147poxR] [^114r7May] [^115dDsVZ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benignity; even in children with chronic headaches where meningismus can be surprisingly frequent, new or evolving meningeal signs should trigger a careful re-evaluation for secondary causes rather than automatic reassurance [^114JbzsD].

Meningismus is the **triad of neck stiffness, photophobia, and headache**, reflecting meningeal irritation from infection, inflammation, or hemorrhage. It is a clinical syndrome, not a disease, and is most often due to **meningitis** (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or **subarachnoid hemorrhage**. Diagnosis relies on clinical signs (Kernig, Brudzinski, jolt accentuation) [^116s5u5y] [^116P8gxK] and CSF analysis [^117BXXpX]; **do not delay antibiotics for imaging** if bacterial meningitis is suspected [^1143Bp56] [^115dDsVZ]. Management is cause-specific: urgent empiric antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis [^115dDsVZ], antivirals for HSV/VZV, and neurosurgical intervention for hemorrhage or mass effect. Prognosis varies by etiology — bacterial meningitis has high morbidity and mortality if treatment is delayed [^115Exw4y] — whereas viral meningitis generally resolves with supportive care [^115Exw4y].

---

## Clinical features and signs

Meningismus presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Neck stiffness**: Resistance to neck flexion due to spasm of the cervical muscles [^116s5u5y].

- **Photophobia**: Sensitivity to light, often accompanied by phonophobia [^117R9wb8].

- **Headache**: Typically severe, diffuse, and worsened by movement [^117R9wb8].

- **Kernig's sign**: Resistance or pain on passive extension of the knee when the hip is flexed [^116s5u5y].

- **Brudzinski's sign**: Involuntary flexion of the knees and hips in response to passive neck flexion [^116s5u5y].

- **Jolt accentuation**: Worsening of headache with horizontal head rotation at 2–3 Hz; modest sensitivity, limited specificity [^116P8gxK].

---

## Etiology

Meningismus is a manifestation of meningeal irritation and has **diverse etiologies**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Bacterial meningitis (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae) [^117R9wb8] [^116iz2eJ] <br/> - Viral meningitis (enteroviruses, HSV, VZV) [^115efzj8] <br/> - Fungal meningitis (Cryptococcus neoformans) [^11254jkq] <br/> - Tuberculous meningitis [^notfound] |
| Non-infectious | - Subarachnoid hemorrhage [^notfound] <br/> - Intracranial tumors [^notfound] <br/> - Autoimmune meningitis (e.g. SLE) [^1112XB45] <br/> - Drug-induced meningitis (e.g. NSAIDs, antibiotics) [^115sDHja] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnostic approach to meningismus includes:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and physical examination to identify meningeal signs and associated symptoms [^116s5u5y].

- **Lumbar puncture (LP)**: Gold standard for diagnosing meningitis; analyze CSF for cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, culture, and PCR [^117BXXpX] [^116dQtEh].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT to identify mass lesions, hemorrhage, or raised intracranial pressure before LP if indicated [^114r7May] [^113wEp42].

- **Laboratory tests**: Blood cultures, inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) [^114BN4av], and serological tests as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Management

Management of meningismus depends on the **underlying etiology**:

- **Bacterial meningitis**: Immediate empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone plus vancomycin) [^1169xEEF]; add dexamethasone to reduce neurological complications [^117DWcBD].

- **Viral meningitis**: Supportive care; acyclovir for HSV/VZV if suspected [^111PEg6t].

- **Subarachnoid hemorrhage**: Neurosurgical intervention and supportive care [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune or drug-induced meningitis**: Discontinue offending agent; immunosuppressive therapy as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology and timeliness of treatment**. Bacterial meningitis carries high morbidity and mortality if treatment is delayed [^115Exw4y], whereas viral meningitis generally has a favorable outcome with supportive care [^115Exw4y]. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and autoimmune meningitis have variable prognoses depending on severity and response to therapy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Meningismus is a clinical syndrome characterized by neck stiffness, photophobia, and headache, indicating meningeal irritation. Prompt recognition, accurate diagnosis, and **timely management** are essential to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.

Clinical and Public Health Management of Meningococcal Disease

Early recognition of meningococcal disease is important for prompt diagnosis and initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Symptoms of meningitis include sudden onset of high fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, altered mental status, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Meningococcemia might present as fever; malaise; cold hands and feet; leg or other body pain; vomiting; diarrhea; and maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric rash. The diagnosis of confirmed meningococcal disease is made either through isolation of N. meningitidis or detection of N. meningitidis –specific nucleic acid in a specimen obtained from a normally sterile body site (e.g. blood or cerebrospinal fluid). Culture is the preferred confirmatory test because it allows for further characterization of the strain; however, serogroup-specific polymerase chain reaction testing using a validated assay is a sensitive method for identifying N. meningitidis, particularly in situations in which antimicrobial therapy was initiated before specimen collection. Because N. meningitidis infections typically are severe, antibiotics should be started immediately for a patient with suspected meningococcal disease without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Several antibiotics are available for the treatment of meningococcal disease, including ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and, when the diagnosis is confirmed, penicillin.

Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of a patient with meningococcal disease is important to prevent secondary cases. Several antibiotics are recommended for chemoprophylaxis, including ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and ceftriaxone; azithromycin can be used in areas with sustained ciprofloxacin resistance (currently rare in the United States). Additional information on identification of close contacts and administration of chemoprophylaxis is available in CDC's Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases.

The investigation of and response to meningococcal disease outbreaks rely on comprehensive epidemiologic and laboratory investigation of cases, identification of persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease as a result of the outbreak and, in certain situations, implementation of vaccination campaigns and use of expanded antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. Additional information is available in CDC's Guidance for the Evaluation and Public Health Management of Suspected Outbreaks of Meningococcal Disease.

### Total antioxidant / oxidant status in meningism and meningitis [^115heV5x]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant/oxidant status of serum and cerebrospinal fluid in children with meningismus and acute bacterial meningitis. Twenty-three children (age range, 0.75 to 9 years) with fever and meningeal signs that required analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid, but no cytologic or biochemical evidence of meningitis in their serum and cerebrospinal fluid, constituted the meningismus group. Thirty-one children (age range, 0.5 to 10 years) with acute bacterial meningitis constituted the meningitis group. Twenty-nine healthy children (age range, 0.5 to 11 years) were recruited as control subjects. Antioxidant status (ascorbic acid, albumin, thiol, uric acid, total bilirubin, total antioxidant capacity, catalase and ceruloplasmin concentrations) and oxidant status (lipid hydroperoxide and total oxidant status) were measured. The serum antioxidant status was lower, and oxidant status levels higher in both meningitis and meningismus subjects than in the control children (P < 0.001). Cerebrospinal fluid oxidant status was lower in the meningitis group than in the meningismus group (P < 0.05). These results indicate that serum antioxidant status was lower, and serum oxidant status was higher in children in the meningismus and meningitis groups, whereas cerebrospinal fluid oxidant status was higher in the meningismus group than in the meningitis group.

### Meningococcal meningitis and COVID-19 co-infection [^111cws5z]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial co-infection in the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes but remains little understood. A 22-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of fever, headache, neck stiffness, rigours and confusion. She was noted to have a purpuric rash over her hands and feet. Cerebrospinal fluid bacterial PCR was positive for Neisseria meningitidis A concurrent nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. She was treated with antibiotics for bacterial meningitis and made a complete recovery. Bacterial infection from nasopharyngeal organisms has followed previous pandemic viral upper respiratory illnesses and the risk of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 remains unclear. Research characterising COVID-19 should specify the frequency, species and outcome of bacterial co-infection. Management of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 presents major challenges for antimicrobial stewardship and clinical management. Judicious use of local antibiotic guidelines and early liaison with infection specialists is key.

### To LP or not to LP? Identifying the etiology of pediatric meningitis [^115kj8VC]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction of conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis has led to a substantial reduction in cases of acute bacterial meningitis in countries with high routine childhood immunization coverage. The majority of children hospitalized with meningitis in high-income countries have viral or aseptic meningitis and do not require antibiotic treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is irreplaceable in appropriately diagnosing and treating bacterial meningitis and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics and prolonged hospitalizations in children with viral meningitis. New diagnostic tests have improved detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid, underscoring the importance of promptly performing lumbar puncture when meningitis is suspected. This article provides an overview of acute bacterial and viral meningitis in children, focusing on the changing epidemiology, the advantages and limitations of conventional and newer diagnostic methods, and considerations for clinical practice.

Drug-induced aseptic meningitis attributable to trimethoprim alone has only rarely been documented in the literature. A previously healthy adolescent male presented to our hospital with recurrent headaches, photophobia, and meningismus after serially starting and stopping trimethoprim. Cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed elevated white blood cell counts with a polymorphonuclear predominance. This case is the second documented report of trimethoprim-induced aseptic meningitis in a pediatric patient.

### EFNS guideline on the management of community-acquired bacterial meningitis: report of an EFNS task force on acute bacterial meningitis in older children and adults [^1152z1ea]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial meningitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, timing, EFNS 2008 guidelines recommend to initiate pre-hospital antibiotic therapy only in patients with a strong suspicion of disseminated meningococcal infection (meningococcemia) because of the unpredictable risk of early circulatory collapse from adrenocortical necrosis (Waterhouse-Fredrichsen syndrome). Consider initiating rapid pre-admission antibiotic therapy in other patients only if a delay in excess of 90 minutes in hospital transfer is anticipated.

### How to use clinical signs of meningitis [^116s5u5y]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Meningitis is a critical diagnosis not to miss in children presenting with fever. Since the early 20th century, classical clinical signs have been used to aid the diagnosis of meningitis. These classical signs are nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign. Each of these relies on the principle that stretching the inflamed meningeal membranes causes clinically detectable irritation. Several primary studies have quantified the diagnostic performance of clinical examination in detecting meningitis in children. The results of these studies vary significantly due to methodological differences, clinical heterogeneity and interobserver variability. However, their findings demonstrate that positive meningitic signs increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of meningitis, and the absence of meningitic signs reduces this probability. These signs have greatest utility when combined with other features in the history and examination to contribute to a comprehensive clinical assessment.

### WHO guidelines on meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care [^1147poxR]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute bacterial meningitis, more specifically with respect to lumbar puncture, WHO 2025 guidelines recommend to perform lumbar puncture as soon as possible in patients with suspected acute meningitis, preferably before initiating antimicrobial treatment, unless specific contraindications or reasons for deferral exist.

### WHO guidelines on meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care [^115wWaAm]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute bacterial meningitis, more specifically with respect to lumbar puncture, WHO 2025 guidelines recommend to defer lumbar puncture if cranial imaging is not readily accessible and any concerning features (Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 10, focal neurological signs, cranial nerve deficits, papilledema, new-onset seizures in adults, or a severely immunocompromised state) are identified until these features have resolved. Do not delay treatment when lumbar puncture is deferred.

### Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: a unique presentation of Haemophilus influenzae type A meningitis [^115tsADF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

In this case report, we describe a unique case of Haemophilus influenzae type A meningitis in a 7-month-old previously healthy girl that presented with an isolated cranial nerve (oculomotor) palsy without other signs and symptoms classically associated with this entity such as fever, meningismus, or a generally ill appearance. Oculomotor nerve abnormalities are rare in pediatrics. Congenital oculomotor palsy is the most common cause followed by trauma, infection, inflammatory conditions, neoplasm, aneurysm or other vascular events, and ophthalmoplegic migraines, respectively. Therefore, had it not been for the unusual magnetic resonance imaging findings identified in this patient prompting an extensive infectious workup with lumbar puncture, the diagnosis and treatment of meningitis may have been delayed further or missed all together. This fact emphasizes the importance of maintaining a broad differential when children present with neurologic abnormalities such as cranial nerve palsies.

### Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults [^112zcghW]. Practical Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of effective antibiotics, vaccination programmes and skilled acute-care facilities, there is still a significant mortality and morbidity from bacterial meningitis. Neurologists are often called on to "rule out bacterial meningitis", which can be difficult with the history and physical examination alone. In this review the authors will discuss the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults, focussing particularly on the management of patients with neurological complications, and stressing the importance of adjunctive dexamethasone.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^11624erc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Neurosurgery or head trauma — signs suggestive of infection and recognition caveats: New headache, fever, evidence of meningeal irritation, seizures, and/or worsening mental status are suggestive of ventriculitis or meningitis in the setting of recent trauma or neurosurgery (strong, moderate). Fever, in the absence of another clear source of infection, is suggestive of CNS infection in the setting of recent head trauma or neurosurgery (weak, low). Recognition is challenging because the recognition of infectious meningitis or ventriculitis in patients who have had recent neurosurgery or head trauma can be difficult because patients may not be able to provide any history, and fever and altered mental status may be the only signs of infection.

### Clinical features suggestive of meningitis in children: a systematic review of prospective data [^114gjgb6]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Clinical diagnosis of pediatric meningitis is fundamental; therefore, familiarity with evidence underscoring clinical features suggestive of meningitis is important.

Objective

To seek evidence supporting accuracy of clinical features of pediatric bacterial meningitis.

Methods

A review of Medline, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, and PubMed was conducted for all articles of relevance. Articles contained prospective data of clinical features in children with laboratory-confirmed bacterial meningitis and in comparison groups of those without it. Two authors independently assessed quality and extracted data to calculate accuracy data of clinical features.

Results

Of 14 145 references initially identified, 10 met our inclusion criteria. On history, a report of bulging fontanel (likelihood ratio [LR]: 8.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4–26]), neck stiffness (7.70 [3.2–19]), seizures (outside febrile-convulsion age range) (4.40 [3.0–6.4]), or reduced feeds (2.00 [1.2–3.4]) raised concern about the presence of meningitis. On examination, jaundice (LR: 5.90 [95% CI: 1.8–19]), being toxic or moribund (5.80 [3.0–11]), meningeal signs (4.50 [2.4–8.3]), neck stiffness (4.00 [2.6–6.3]), bulging fontanel (3.50 [2.0–6.0]), Kernig sign (3.50 [2.1–5.7]), tone up (3.20 [2.2–4.5]), fever of > 40°C (2.90 [1.6–5.5]), and Brudzinski sign (2.50 [1.8–3.6]) independently raised the likelihood of meningitis. The absence of meningeal signs (LR: 0.41 [95% CI: 0.30–0.57]) and an abnormal cry (0.30 [0.16–0.57]) independently lowered the likelihood of meningitis. The absence of fever did not rule out meningitis (LR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.53–0.92]).

Conclusions

Evidence for several useful clinical features that influence the likelihood of pediatric meningitis exists. No isolated clinical feature is diagnostic, and the most accurate diagnostic combination is unclear.

### MeningiSSS: a new predictive score to support decision on invasive procedures to monitor or manage the intracerebral pressure in children with bacterial meningitis [^115QPFVE]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Weaknesses

When creating any new predictive score, overfitting the model is a well-known risk, either by adding several criteria fitting the dataset or testing a vast number of outcomes. In our study, we tried to reduce this risk in two ways: by basing our predictive score on a systematic review of previously identified risk factors and by using a limited number of predefined outcomes. The systematic review investigated general risk factors for overall adverse outcome, neurological sequelae, or death rather than our specific outcome. However, the risk of overfitting should still be reduced despite this disadvantage.

The main strength of this study lies in the standardized data collection process, ensuring that all available data were collected in the same manner. However, as this is a retrospective study, there are also limitations regarding the data. Lack of standardized protocols for clinical examinations and laboratory analyses could result in complications or disabilities being missed, underestimating their occurrence. In addition, a historical material is likely to have a different etiological distribution than today, with a higher occurrence of H. influenzae and S. pneumonia. However, we did not see any difference in the MeningiSSS ability to predict outcome for different causative pathogens; therefore, this issue should be minor.

Despite being collected retrospectively during a 30-year period, treatment strategies used in our study are comparable to those used in other high-income countries today. This allows us to interpret our results in today's settings and suggests that the MeningiSSS could be suitable for further trials and validation with the aim of future clinical use.

### Typhus group Rickettsia community-acquired bacterial central nervous system infections: we must think outside the box! [^112ekESP]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Typhus group rickettsiosis (TGR), caused by Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia prowazekii, are globally distributed vector-borne diseases with increasing cases. Diagnosis is usually clinical, confirmed by seroconversion of IgG antibodies. Human infection occurs in diverse geographic areas with some developing CNS infection characterized by fever, headache, meningismus, and/or focal signs - usually beyond the first week of initial symptomatology. Seizures and other CNS manifestations have been observed. When untreated, infection may result in neurologic sequelae and even death. This study presents a systematic review of all documented cases of Rickettsia typhi meningoencephalitis published since 2015 with the addition of five cases of TGR in South Coastal Texas, USA. This review followed the guidelines outlined in PRISMA. A schematic explanation of the pathophysiology is offered. CSF may present with high opening pressure, mild to moderate pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein levels, and low csf/serum glucose ratio, or normal findings. Meningeal enhancement, intracranial hypertension, and focal abnormalities have been described in imaging studies, but can be normal. Treatment with doxycycline leads to prompt resolution of symptoms. Failure to initiate early empiric treatment can lead to serious consequences. The study recommends routine testing for TGR in patients from endemic areas with classical symptoms when other diagnoses are inconclusive or in cases with atypical presentations. The authors advocate for incorporating empiric treatment for murine typhus into community-acquired bacterial meningitis guidelines in endemic areas; and stress the importance of enhancing laboratory diagnostic capabilities in public health entities world-wide. Further studies of community acquired mengingoencephalitis caused by TGR are highly encouraged.

IrAE-Ns affecting the CNS

For purposes of this discussion, the CNS is defined to include the meninges and the parenchyma of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. Meningitis is a syndrome of headache, fever and neck stiffness; focal neurological deficits or seizures should be taken as evidence of parenchymal CNS involvement. The parenchyma can be affected by inflammation of the gray and/or white matter (encephalitis), demyelination or vasculitis (which can lead to CNS ischemia). An attempt should be made to attribute neurological symptoms that localize to the CNS to one of these major categories, recognizing that this may, in some cases, be difficult for non-specific symptoms (as discussed above).

The evaluation of CNS disease relies primarily on a combination of head and spinal cord imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Head imaging (CT or MRI) should be performed prior to lumbar puncture (LP) to exclude mass lesions that may cause herniation and because LP can cause pachymeningeal enhancement.

MRI has superior sensitivity to detect many abnormalities compared with CT. MRI of the brain with contrast is recommended to evaluate for leptomeningeal and/or pachymeningeal enhancement, and for evidence of CNS metastasis, encephalitis, vasculitis, and demyelination. Head CT evaluates for cerebral edema, strokes and hemorrhages but is unlikely to demonstrate leptomeningeal or pachymeningeal inflammation. If MRI brain is not possible, then head CT is preferably performed with contrast. A head CT rather than an MRI may also be warranted in more acute presentations given the rapidity with which it can be obtained.

In all cases, it is important to rule out infectious disease as well as CNS involvement by the primary malignancy. In certain situations, serologic tests can identify antibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis or demyelinating disease. Antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen positivity may suggest an autoimmune tendency but are of unclear pathogenic significance in isolation. Serum evaluation for specific infectious agents should be dictated by local prevalence, seasonal incidence, travel history and other patient risk factors such as intravenous drug use or high-risk sexual exposure. If concern about undiagnosed infectious disease persists, additional testing including metagenomic next-generation sequencing can be considered, typically with guidance from an infectious disease expert. Given its invasive nature, brain biopsy is not commonly pursued but may very rarely be needed to rule out alternative etiologies.

Flow chart of study and final diagnoses of patients recruited

CSF = cerebrospinal fluid. *Patients were screened on receipt of a CSF sample in the laboratory. The majority of patients screened and subsequently not recruited did not have meningitis in the differential diagnosis. Mostly, patients had a lumbar puncture to rule out subarachnoid haemorrhage. †Of the non-meningitis cases, 123 were non-specified viral illnesses, 18 were urinary tract infections, 94 were other infections, 95 were headaches or migraines, and 124 were other or unknown illnesses. ‡Median CSF leucocyte count was 12.5 × 10⁶ cells per L (IQR 6–46), and 22 of 41 patients had a leucocyte count of < 10 × 10⁶ cells per L. §See table 2 for more details.

### Aseptic and bacterial meningitis: evaluation, treatment, and prevention [^115Exw4y]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The etiologies of meningitis range in severity from benign and self-limited to life-threatening with potentially severe morbidity. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt recognition and treatment. Mortality remains high despite the introduction of vaccinations for common pathogens that have reduced the incidence of meningitis worldwide. Aseptic meningitis is the most common form of meningitis with an annual incidence of 7.6 per 100,000 adults. Most cases of aseptic meningitis are viral and require supportive care. Viral meningitis is generally self-limited with a good prognosis. Examination maneuvers such as Kernig sign or Brudzinski sign may not be useful to differentiate bacterial from aseptic meningitis because of variable sensitivity and specificity. Because clinical findings are also unreliable, the diagnosis relies on the examination of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from lumbar puncture. Delayed initiation of antibiotics can worsen mortality. Treatment should be started promptly in cases where transfer, imaging, or lumbar puncture may slow a definitive diagnosis. Empiric antibiotics should be directed toward the most likely pathogens and should be adjusted by patient age and risk factors. Dexamethasone should be administered to children and adults with suspected bacterial meningitis before or at the time of initiation of antibiotics. Vaccination against the most common pathogens that cause bacterial meningitis is recommended. Chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is helpful in preventing additional infections.

Chronic meningitis is a syndrome characterised by persistent and progressive signs and symptoms of meningitis along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and elevated protein that fail to improve over 4 weeks. A detailed and careful history and examination is required along with CSF parameters to guide a clinician towards the aetiology of the problem. Neuroimaging modalities have become a useful tool in the quest for a diagnosis in such cases. An interesting case is described in real time illustrating the process of making a diagnosis in chronic meningitis with an insight into investigations and subsequent management.

Aggressive early treatment of meningococcal disease can reduce mortality. This relies on prompt recognition and treatment of the complications of septicaemia and meningitis, appropriate ongoing intensive care where necessary, and adequate management of multiple organ failure. Most children with meningococcal disease survive intact, but long term sequelae are increasingly recognised and make follow up essential. New treatments continue to be evaluated, but none has so far proven to be effective in further reducing morbidity or mortality. Simple, timely therapeutic manoeuvres may greatly improve the prospects for survival.

IDSA 2017 healthcare-associated ventriculitis/meningitis — evidence summary for CSF shunt infection symptoms notes that the most frequent symptoms are headache, nausea, lethargy, and change in mental status, seen in as many as 65% of infected patients. Fever is reported in as few as 14% to as many as 92% of cases, so the absence of fever cannot exclude infection, and pain may be absent in as many as 60% of infections. Clinically, individual symptoms are not typically both sensitive and specific, the vast majority of shunt infections occur in the first few months after shunt surgery with predictive values of symptoms changing by timing, and symptoms and signs may be referable either to the proximal or distal portion of the shunt.

### Clinical reasoning: a 67-year-old woman with progressive headache, visual hallucinations, and seizures [^11469QYR]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for 3 months of new-onset headaches and meningismus that progressed to focal neurologic deficits. These first manifested as episodes of flashing lights and black blotches obscuring her vision for minutes. She also began to have visual hallucinations with formed letters and words projected onto nearby walls. She developed gait unsteadiness and difficulty using her phone and reading a clock. She was seen by neuro-ophthalmology and found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia, at which point she was admitted for further evaluation. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, left homonymous hemianopsia, simultagnosia and agraphesthesia, and asymmetric reflexes with an upgoing toe on the left. A brain MRI revealed asymmetric, bilateral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal abnormalities, and extensive leptomeningeal enhancement. In the hospital, the patient suffered a seizure and was started on an anticonvulsant. Initial testing for infectious, inflammatory, and malignant conditions was unrevealing. A brain biopsy was ultimately performed and a diagnosis was made. We discuss the differential diagnosis of progressive new headache and meningismus, localization of the symptoms and examination, and the initial workup pursued in advance of biopsy. After a discussion of the pathologic diagnosis, we discuss treatment and management, as well as outline atypical features in our case as compared with prior literature. This case provides a pathologic diagnosis, offers correlation with the patient's clinical-radiological presentation, and discusses appropriate acute treatment and relapse prevention for this entity.

### A systematic review of neurological symptoms and complications of COVID-19 [^115xSn1c]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In COVID-19 patients, neurological manifestations such as impaired consciousness, stroke, and seizure have been reported, with a higher incidence in those with a more severe course of COVID-19. However, these manifestations not necessarily require direct infection of the peripheral (PNS) or the central nervous system (CNS), but could also occur secondary to a severe systemic reaction in response to a viral infection outside the nervous system. In the past months, reports of meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, or peripheral nerve affection in the context of COVID-19 were published, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect structures of the nervous system. However, a systematic review that differentiates between neurological symptoms occurring during systemic viral infections in general from SARS-CoV-2-specific neurological complications has not been published.

### Meningismus is a commonly overlooked finding in tension-type headache in children and adolescents [^114JbzsD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

At present, both migraine and tension-type headaches in children are believed to be chronic primary headaches. Meningeal signs in both cases are ignored or not examined, and the neurologic status is considered normal. This is the first study that focuses on meningeal signs in children with chronic headaches. The study population comprised 1738 patients aged 5 to 17 years who were examined in an outpatient neurologic clinic over a 6-year period. Particular attention was paid to examination of meningeal signs, including nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's three signs (upper, middle, and lower), the "tripod" sign, and Guillain's and facial signs; the presence of these signs was regarded as meningismus syndrome. Some meningeal signs were found in 12% of 1007 children suffering from migraine, whereas 97% of 731 children with tension-type headaches had the whole set of meningeal signs. This suggested that meningismus is the major clinical syndrome in chronic tension-type headaches in children and adolescents. Chronic mild sterile (possibly autoimmune) inflammation of meninges (dura mater) can be caused by a preceding infection, as well as minor trauma of the head and/or back. Prolonged rest in a recumbent position usually resulted in relief or complete disappearance of both headache and meningeal signs. Monitoring of the meningeal signs is helpful for evaluation of the patient's condition in the course of treatment.

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^116GNQkz]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Bacterial meningitis

All CMGs covering bacterial CNS infections recommended urgent LP and most recommended blood sampling (Table 3), since a positive CSF culture is confirmative of bacterial meningitis and enables in vitro testing of antimicrobial susceptibility to optimise antibiotic treatment, and urgent LP increases diagnostic chances. If CSF examination is not possible, serum markers of inflammation and blood cultures, especially if taken prior to antibiotics, can support the diagnosis and immunochromatographic antigen testing and PCR can provide additional information. The CMG by MSF did not recommend LP for new cases in an epidemic context when a meningococcal aetiology was confirmed. Sixty-nine percent (n = 11/16) recommended a CT scan before LP if clinical signs of raised ICP. In contrast, the CMG by NICE stated that CT is unreliable for identifying raised ICP and recommended clinical assessment instead of CT.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: adult bacterial meningitis [^1169xEEF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bacterial meningitis in adults is a rare but serious condition that carries a high rate of morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights pearls and pitfalls of acute bacterial meningitis in adults, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Meningitis encompasses a broad spectrum of disease involving inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. It classically presents with fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status, but this triad is not present in all cases. Up to 95% of patients will have at least two of the following four cardinal symptoms: fever, nuchal rigidity, altered mental status, and headache. The most common bacterial etiologies are S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. Cerebrospinal fluid testing obtained by lumbar puncture remains the gold standard in diagnosis. Head computed tomography prior to lumbar puncture may not be necessary in most patients. Empiric treatment consists of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and dexamethasone. Elevated intracranial pressure should be managed using established neurocritical care strategies.

Conclusion

A better understanding of the pearls and pitfalls of acute bacterial meningitis can assist emergency clinicians in pursuing its timely diagnosis and management.

### High-throughput sequencing for the aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis. A narrative review and clinical appraisal [^113K2PDh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Viral aetiologies are the most common cause of central nervous system (CNS) infections. Approximately one-half of CNS infections remain of undetermined origin. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) brought new perspectives to CNS infection investigations, allowing investigation of viral aetiologies with an unbiased approach. HTS use is still limited to specific clinical situations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to evaluate the contribution and pitfalls of HTS for the aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis in CNS patient samples.

Sources

PubMed was searched from 1 January 2008 to 2 August 2018 to retrieve available studies on the topic. Additional publications were included from a review of full-text sources.

Content

Among 366 studies retrieved, 29 used HTS as a diagnostic technique. HTS was performed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy samples of 307 patients, including immunocompromised, immunocompetent paediatric, and adult cases. HTS was performed retrospectively in 18 studies and prospectively in 11. HTS led to the identification of a potential causal virus in 41 patients, with 11 viruses known and ten not expected to cause CNS infections. Various HTS protocols were used.

Implications

The additional value of HTS is difficult to quantify because of various biases. Nevertheless, HTS led to the identification of a viral cause in 13% of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis cases in which various assays failed to identify the cause. HTS should be considered early in clinical management as a complement to routine assays. Standardized strategies and systematic studies are needed for the integration of HTS in clinical management.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension mimicking aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1115SxQ2]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

An excruciating headache of instantaneous onset is known as a thunderclap headache. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is the prototypical cause, but other serious disorders may also present with a thunderclap headache, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, carotid artery dissection, and pituitary apoplexy. We report a group of patients with thunderclap headaches as the initial manifestation of spontaneous intracranial hypotension caused by a spinal cerebrospinal fluid leak.

Methods

Among 28 patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension due to a documented spinal cerebrospinal fluid leak, four (14%) initially experienced an excruciating headaches of instantaneous onset.

Results

The mean age of the four patients (two men and two women) was 35 years (range, 24–45 yr). Nuchal rigidity was present in the three patients who sought early medical attention, and they underwent emergency computed tomographic scanning, lumbar puncture, and cerebral angiography to rule out an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The delay between the onset of headache and diagnosis of intracranial hypotension ranged from 4 days to 5 weeks. A fourth patient did not seek medical attention until 1 month after the ictus.

Conclusion

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension should be included in the differential diagnosis of thunderclap headache, even when meningismus is present.

### Meningitis [^115VveNx]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Based on strong evidence, blood cultures usually recover the causative organism of bacterial meningitis in children not pretreated with antibiotics. Based on moderate evidence, pretreatment does not adversely affect the cerebrospinal fluid cell count, but it decreases the positive test result for cerebrospinal fluid culture, especially for meningococcal meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, children with suspected bacterial meningitis and no clinical signs of brain herniation do not need neuroimaging as part of their initial clinical evaluation. Dexamethasone adjunctive therapy in children with pneumococcal meningitis is controversial. Some experts recommend neuroimaging toward the end of therapy for all neonates with bacterial meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, home intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be an option in selected cases of pediatric bacterial meningitis.

### Viral (aseptic) meningitis: a review [^111PEg6t]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2019). Medium credibility.

Viral meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges associated with acute onset of meningeal symptoms and fever, pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid, and no growth on routine bacterial culture. It is sometimes associated with viral encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. Viruses reach the central nervous system (CNS) hematogenously or in a retrograde manner from nerve endings. The viral etiology varies according to age and country. Molecular diagnostics technology has helped improve the rate of pathogen detection reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and length of hospitalization. Most of the viral infections detailed in this article have no specific treatment other than supportive care. Many of the viruses discussed are preventable by vaccination and proper skin protection against transmitting vectors.

### Emergency diagnosis and treatment of adult meningitis [^115sYmMa]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Despite the existence of antibiotic therapies against acute bacterial meningitis, patients with the disease continue to suffer significant morbidity and mortality in both high and low-income countries. Dilemmas exist for emergency medicine and primary-care providers who need to accurately diagnose patients with bacterial meningitis and then rapidly administer antibiotics and adjunctive therapies for this life-threatening disease. Physical examination may not perform well enough to accurately identify patients with meningitis, and traditionally described lumbar puncture results for viral and bacterial disease cannot always predict bacterial meningitis. Results from recent studies have implications for current treatment guidelines for adults with suspected bacterial meningitis, and it is important that physicians who prescribe the initial doses of antibiotics in an emergency setting are aware of guidelines for antibiotics and adjunctive steroids. We present an overview and discussion of key diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in the emergency evaluation and treatment of adults with suspected bacterial meningitis.

### Distinguishing cytomegalovirus meningoencephalitis from other viral central nervous system infections [^115efzj8]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hallmarks of cytomegalovirus (CMV) meningoencephalitis include fever, altered mental status, or meningismus with pleocytosis, elevated protein and hypoglycorrhachia on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging may show ventriculitis, ependymitis or periventricular enhancement. Studies are limited comparing clinical and laboratory characteristics to other viral etiologies.

Objectives

This multi-center, retrospective cohort analysis reviewed patients with CMV meningitis or encephalitis and compared clinical features, laboratory findings and outcomes to the most common viral causes of meningoencephalitis.

Study Design

Patients with encephalitis or aseptic meningitis and detectable genetic material by polymerase chain reaction were identified. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and neuroimaging were collected from the electronic medical record. Data analysis was performed comparing CMV to other viral etiologies.

Results

485 patients were evaluated and included cases of CMV (n = 36) which were compared with herpes simplex virus (n = 114), enterovirus (n = 207), varicella zoster virus (n = 41) and West Nile virus (n = 81). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was seen more frequently in CMV infection compared with all other viral etiologies. Clinical presentations and CSF findings of other viral etiologies differ compared with CMV. Hypoglycorrhacia occurred more often with CMV compared with other viral pathogens. Outcomes were significantly worse compared with enterovirus, herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus but not West Nile virus.

Conclusions

CMV meningoencephalitis occurs most often in patients with HIV and encephalitis occurs more frequently than meningitis. Clinical and laboratory findings differ compared with other viral etiologies and can support consideration of CMV in the differential diagnosis of patients with meningoencephalitis.

Chronic meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges with subacute onset and persisting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities lasting for at least one month. Several non-infectious and infectious etiologies are known to be causative. The wide range of different etiologies renders the approach to patients with this syndrome particularly difficult. There is no standardized diagnostic procedure, thus, taking an in depth history combined with a complete physical examination is mandatory in every patient. This review aims to present the current knowledge on etiology, neurological course of disease, diagnostic and therapeutic management steps of patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of chronic meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Still, the etiology of one third of patients remains unclear, reflecting the diagnostic challenge of this syndrome for each physician or neurologist, respectively. However, most patients with idiopathic chronic meningitis have a relatively good outcome.

### Diagnostic test accuracy of jolt accentuation for headache in acute meningitis in the emergency setting [^116P8gxK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges, the layers that protect the brain and spinal cord. Acute meningitis is an emergent disease that develops over the course of hours to several days. Delay in treatment can lead to serious outcomes. Inflammation of the meninges is assessed by analysing cerebrospinal fluid. Identifying the pathogen in cerebrospinal fluid is another way to diagnose meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid is collected by doing a lumbar puncture, which is an invasive test, and can be avoided if a physical examination excludes the diagnosis of meningitis. However, most physical examinations, such as nuchal rigidity, Kernig's test, and Brudzinski's test, are not sufficiently sensitive to exclude meningitis completely. Jolt accentuation of headache is a new and less well-recognised physical examination, which assesses meningeal irritation. It is judged as positive if the headache is exacerbated by rotating the head horizontally two or three times per second. A 1991 observational study initially reported high sensitivity of this examination to predict pleocytosis. Pleocytosis, an abnormally high cerebrospinal fluid sample white cell count, is an accepted indicator of nervous system infection or inflammation. Jolt accentuation of headache may therefore accurately rule out meningitis without the use of lumbar puncture. However, more recent cross-sectional studies have reported variable diagnostic accuracy.

Objectives

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of jolt accentuation of headache for detecting acute meningitis in emergency settings. Secondary objectives: to investigate the sources of heterogeneity, including study population, patient condition, and types of meningitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Elsevier) to 27 April 2020. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Ichushi-Web Version 5.0 to 28 April 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of jolt accentuation of headache for people with suspected meningitis in emergency settings. We included participants of any age and any severity of illness. Meningitis should be diagnosed with any reference standard, such as cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, proof of causative agents, or autopsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collated study data. We assessed methodological quality of studies using QUADAS-2 criteria. We used a bivariate random-effects model to determine summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity where meta-analysis was possible. We performed sensitivity analyses to validate the robustness of outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included nine studies (1161 participants). Five studies included only adults. Four studies included both adults and children; however, the proportion was not reported in three of these studies. The youngest child reported in the studies was aged 13 years. There was no study including only children. The reference standard was pleocytosis in eight studies, and the combination of pleocytosis and increased protein in the cerebrospinal fluid in one study. Two studies also used smear or positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid. Risk of bias and concern about applicability was high in the participant selection domain for all included studies and the consciousness subgroup. Overall, pooled sensitivity was 65.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 37.3 to 85.6), and pooled specificity was 70.4% (95% CI 47.7 to 86.1) (very low-certainty evidence). We established the possibility of heterogeneity from visual inspection of forest plots. However, we were unable to conduct further analysis for study population, types of meningitis, and participants' condition, other than disturbance of consciousness (a secondary outcome). Amongst participants whose consciousness was undisturbed (8 studies, 921 participants), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 75.2% (95% CI 54.3 to 88.6) and 60.8% (95% CI 43.4 to 75.9), respectively (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Jolt accentuation for headache may exclude diagnoses of meningitis in emergency settings, but high-quality evidence to support use of this test is lacking. Even where jolt accentuation of headache is negative, there is still the possibility of acute meningitis. This review identified the possibility of heterogeneity. However, factors that contribute to heterogeneity are incompletely understood, and should be considered in future research.

### Clinical reasoning: a young woman with rapidly progressive weakness and paresthesia [^115rqLrG]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A 24-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented with a 2-month history of rapidly progressive asymmetric weakness and paresthesia that began in her left lower extremity and progressed to involve both legs and arms. It was associated with overflow urinary incontinence and significant weight loss. In addition, she complained of a constant occipital headache that worsened in the supine position and was associated with photophobia, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and horizontal binocular diplopia. She also had signs of meningismus, decreased left facial sensation, and right sensorineural hearing loss. Because multifocal localization suggests a wide variety of possible differential diagnoses, this study expands on the differential of a subacute multifocal process while highlighting the importance of identifying appropriate risk factors and performing a relevant yet focused diagnostic workup.

### The diagnostic value of the neurological examination in coma of unknown etiology [^113FsECM]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are several reasons that may explain the shortcomings of the neurological examination as a diagnostic tool in unconscious patients. Ideally, primary structural brain pathologies underlying disorders of consciousness should be clinically detectable by abnormal neurological findings. However, even in patients with unimpaired consciousness, the sensitivity of many clinical tests such as testing for meningism is well below 100%. A recent meta-analysis reported a sensitivity of 46.1% for nuchal rigidity in patients with suspected meningitis. A Cochrane review indicated a sensitivity of 75.5% for the jolt accentuation of headache, which decreased to 65.3% when patients with impaired consciousness were included.

Further, significant abnormal findings in unconscious patients are also found in patients without acute brain damage and systemic disorders. Obviously, constricted pupils are caused by opioid intoxication more often than by isolated pontine damage. But maybe less obviously, the whole range of possible metabolic disorders (depending on their severity) may also cause asymmetrical neurological abnormalities that may be misleading. Moreover, neurological abnormalities may have been pre-existing and may thus falsely suggest acute structural brain damage. Not knowing a patient's detailed past medical history, which is often the case early on in an emergency, may therefore also misdirect the course of management if major decisions are mainly based on clinical findings. Neurological abnormalities are thus generally not entirely specific for acute neurological causes.

Another problem is that many patients presenting with CUE have, in fact, more than just one underlying pathology that could explain the disorder. As reported earlier, one third of patients who were managed according to the same standard operating procedure were found to have multiple coma-explaining conditions. For example, subdural hemorrhage may have led to asymmetrical motor dysfunction. However, if this clinical information alone determines further management, equally pressing and coexisting disorders such as acute hepatic failure following chronic substance abuse and now severe acute intoxication may go undetected.

Furthermore, there is a significant interobserver variability associated with neurological observations in general and specifically so in unconscious patients. Subtle abnormalities are easily missed or underestimated while certain phenomena tend to be overestimated (e.g. minimal differences in pupil size, stiffness of the neck, spontaneous eye movements) or misread (e.g. directional vs. non-directional reaction to painful stimuli).

irMeningitis

Subtypes, evaluation and definitions of irMeningitis syndromes are presented in table 1. The rationale for common, possible and uncommon disease-specific testing is outlined.

Table 1
irMeningitis

Common

In addition to the diagnostic tests described above, LP with CSF studies evaluates for inflammation (expect pleocytosis, elevated protein) and excludes other causes of meningeal disease (expect negative cytology and flow cytometry, negative Gram stain and culture, negative infectious studies). Specific CSF studies are recommended for universally common infectious agents such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cryptococcal disease. Further CSF and/or serum infectious studies may be determined by local epidemiology, seasonal incidence, travel history and patient-specific risk factors. Blood cultures evaluate for septic meningitis.

Possible

As previously discussed, MRI is generally preferred to head CT except in very urgent circumstances.

Uncommon

Meningeal biopsy is needed only in exceptional circumstances (eg, chronic pachymeningitis or continued concern of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis despite unrevealing CSF studies). Sometimes, CSF cytokine profiles are not widely available but can sometimes differentiate between infectious and aseptic meningitis, and etiologies such as CNS lymphoma.

### Practice parameter: evaluation of children and adolescents with recurrent headaches: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice committee of the Child Neurology Society [^111b8gJc]. Neurology (2002). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of pediatric recurrent headache — examination and indications for ancillary testing: Evaluation begins with thorough history, vital signs, and complete neurologic examination including the optic fundus, and the principle indication for performance of ancillary diagnostic testing rests on information or concerns revealed during this fundamental process. There is a lack of consensus concerning the role of diagnostic testing including routine laboratory testing, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, electroencephalography (EEG), and neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For acute severe presentations when serious conditions are suspected, if subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute or chronic meningitis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or certain other conditions are suspected, lumbar puncture when opening pressure measurement and appropriate ancillary testing are indicated, and if the clinical examination demonstrates nuchal rigidity with or without alteration of consciousness, signs of increased intracranial pressure, mental status changes, or lateralizing features, neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture may need to be performed. The presence of headache accompanied by fever or in the immunocompromised patient must raise concerns for infections such as meningitis, either bacterial or viral.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of coccidioidomycosis in HIV-associated and pediatric populations range from mild self-limited illness to disseminated disease including pneumonia, bone and joint infection, and meningitis, with increased risk of dissemination in immunocompromised individuals and in specific groups such as previously healthy blacks, Hispanics, and Filipinos, and pregnant women in the second or third trimester or postpartum. Diffuse pulmonary infection and extrathoracic dissemination have been associated with decreased CD4 counts, increased HIV RNA levels, and lower likelihood of having received potent antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among children with meningitis, fever may be absent, meningismus occurs in only 50% of patients, and hydrocephalus occurs in most (83%–100%) children with coccidioidal meningitis; bone and joint involvement is rare in HIV-infected patients.

### Acute bacterial meningitis in adults [^117R9wb8]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bacterial meningitis:

- **Definition**: ABM is an acute inflammation of the meninges, particularly the arachnoid and the pia mater, associated with the invasion of bacteria into the subarachnoid space.
- **Pathophysiology**: Bacterial meningitis is mostly caused by S. pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides.
- **Disease course**: Bacterial invasion to the CNS through the bloodstream or direct access leads to ABM, which causes clinical manifestations of fever, malaise, headache, meningismus, photophobia, phonophobia, vomiting, altered mental status, focal neurological signs (epileptic seizures, or paresis of a limb), and coma.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bacterial meningitis is associated with a 34% mortality rate.

### A healthy toddler with fever and lethargy [^11527apK]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

A 21-month-old previously healthy girl presented to the emergency department initially with fever, rhinorrhea, and poor oral intake. She was subsequently discharged from the hospital on amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media but presented hours later on the same day with continued poor oral intake, decreased urine output, and lethargy. The patient was afebrile on examination without a focal source of infection or evidence of meningismus, but she was lethargic and minimally responsive to pain and had reduced strength in the upper and lower extremities. Initial laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis with a neutrophil predominance and bandemia, hyponatremia, mild hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, elevated transaminases, a mild metabolic acidosis, glucosuria, ketonuria, and hematuria. Follow-up tests, based on the history and results of the initial tests, were sent and led to a surprising diagnosis.

### The history and current relevance of the eponymous signs of meningitis [^116QwzJ9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

During the past several decades, researchers have shown that the eponymous signs of meningitis have reduced sensitivity and specificity compared with when they were originally described. This may be because of the changing epidemiology of meningitis and its treatment or it may be because of variations in performance of the maneuvers. For example, in the original descriptions, the Kernig sign (resistance of leg extension) is best elicited with the patient sitting and the Brudzinski nape of the neck sign involves holding down the patient's chest as the neck is flexed. These and other lesser-known signs of meningitis by Amoss, Bikeles and Edelmann all relate to the mechanics of stretching inflamed meninges, and this review will allow the clinician to understand how the history related to these maneuvers is still germane to clinical practice today.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, autoimmune polyradiculoneuropathy that improves with immune-modulating treatment if instituted early in the illness. Preliminary diagnosis relies on the clinician's recognition of the typical symptoms and signs as supporting evidence of the illness, such as nerve conduction studies, which may not be available emergently. We report eight children with Guillain-Barré syndrome in whom the initial presentation was atypical and suggested a primary central nervous system illness. In these patients, the predominant clinical symptoms included drowsiness, headache, irritability, and meningismus, although the classic features of Guillain-Barré syndrome (weakness, hyporeflexia) were also present. The atypical presentation caused delay in diagnosis in some cases. It is important to recognize this variant of pediatric Guillain-Barré syndrome to ensure expeditious diagnosis and treatment.

Clinical manifestations — Cryptococcosis often presents with subtle and non-specific findings, such as fever and headache; early diagnosis requires consideration of this infection in symptomatic patients whose CD4 counts indicate severe immunosuppression. In both HIV-infected adults and children, meningoencephalitis is the most common initial manifestation of cryptococcosis and the disease typically evolves over days to weeks with fever and headache. Less frequent findings include nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and focal neurologic signs, as were seen among 30 HIV-infected children in the United States, whereas children in Zimbabwe presented with an acute form of neurologic cryptococcosis with 69% with nuchal rigidity, 38% with seizure activity, and 23% with focal neurologic signs.

### Signs of meningeal irritation at the emergency department: how often bacterial meningitis? [^1114ZQ3Z]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Although signs of meningeal irritation are highly indicative of meningitis, they are not pathognomonic. In this study, we described the final diagnoses in children with signs of meningeal irritation, and we assessed the frequency of bacterial meningitis related to specific signs of meningeal irritation.

Methods

Information was collected from records of 326 patients (aged 1 month to 15 years) who visited the emergency department of the Sophia Children's Hospital between 1988 and 1998 with signs of meningeal irritation, assessed by either the general practitioner or the pediatrician.

Results

Bacterial meningitis was diagnosed in 99 patients (30%), viral or aseptic meningitis in 43 (13%). Other diagnoses were pneumonia (8%), other serious bacterial infections (2%), and upper respiratory tract infections or other self-limiting diseases (46%). Presence of one of the signs of meningeal irritation assessed by the pediatrician was related to bacterial meningitis in 39%. Specific tests eliciting meningeal irritation, such as Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs, were not related to a higher frequency of bacterial meningitis than neck stiffness and the tripod phenomenon. In children ≤ 1 year, bacterial meningitis is more frequently related to presence of irritability and a bulging fontanel.

Conclusion

Bacterial meningitis is present in 30% of children with signs of meningeal irritation. Presence of meningeal irritation as assessed by the pediatrician is related to bacterial meningitis in 39%. A better prediction of bacterial meningitis was not achieved by using more specific tests for signs of meningeal irritation.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme neuroborreliosis — role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination: Because recommended treatment may be the same whether meningitis is present or not, CSF examination in suspected neuroborreliosis must serve 4 purposes: first, if meningitis is suspected, to permit exclusion of bacterial, viral, or other etiologies besides Lyme neuroborreliosis; second, if CSF pleocytosis (typically lymphocytic or monocytic) is evident, to provide assessment of treatment efficacy and a baseline for comparison because pleocytosis typically improves but may take an extended period to resolve; third, to permit a more definitive diagnosis of CNS neuroborreliosis, particularly with parenchymal brain or spinal fluid inflammation and intrathecal antibody production, noting CSF may be normal if limited to the peripheral nervous system; and fourth, to allow assessment for raised intracranial pressure in pseudotumor-like presentations, particularly in children, even without other signs or symptoms of meningitis.
