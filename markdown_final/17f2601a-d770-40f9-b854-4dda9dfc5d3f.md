## Question

In a 65-year-old patient with left upper leg numbness and stinging that began approximately 3 days ago, what is the appropriate workup?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the appropriate workup should be for a 65-year-old with left upper leg numbness and stinging that began approximately 3 days ago. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate clinical assessment with a focused history and exam to screen for red flags and localize the lesion. Then, I should stratify risk to determine whether early imaging is warranted. Next, I will outline first-line conservative management and define the reassessment window. After that, I need to specify when to obtain MRI and electrodiagnostic testing. I will also consider musculoskeletal mimics in parallel, think through advanced or rare etiologies if initial studies are unrevealing, and finish with referral thresholds and a succinct timeline algorithm, all while double-checking guideline alignment at each step [^1151j7Un] [^116uiKNp] [^112BNubN].

> Let me first confirm the key elements of the history. I need to characterize the precise topography, quality, radiation, temporal profile, and triggers, while screening for red flags such as cancer, infection, immunosuppression, trauma, and cauda equina symptoms; I should also ask about vascular claudication versus neurogenic patterns, because that distinction changes downstream decisions. Wait, let me verify a potential mapping pitfall: I initially equated anterolateral thigh symptoms with L4–L5, but that's not quite right; anterolateral thigh paresthesia often implicates the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve or upper lumbar roots (L2–L3), whereas L4 is more medial leg and L5 involves the dorsum of the foot — so I should correct that localization error now to avoid anchoring bias. For neuropathic descriptors, I expect electric, burning, or shooting qualities in radicular pain, sometimes with dysesthesias not perfectly dermatomal, whereas nonspecific mechanical pain behaves differently, so I need to keep those distinctions in mind during history taking [^112P9eXD] [^1125kYvd] [^112BNubN].

> Next, I will examine systematically. I need to check strength in key myotomes (hip abduction L5, knee extension L3–L4, ankle dorsiflexion L4–L5), map sensory loss by dermatomes (L4 medial leg, L5 dorsum foot, S1 lateral foot), and test reflexes (patellar L4, Achilles S1), while also performing dural tension signs such as a supine straight leg raise and Lasègue's maneuvers. Hold on, I should verify expected test characteristics so I don't over-interpret a single sign: the supine straight leg raise has sensitivity about 0.67, Lasègue's 0.77–0.83, and crossed Lasègue's has higher specificity, which means no single test rules in or out radiculopathy reliably in isolation; converging findings increase confidence. I must also palpate the greater trochanter and assess hip provocation (FABER, Ober) to differentiate GTPS or intra-articular hip disease when the neuro exam is otherwise normal [^113pSq1m] [^115begMi] [^1125kYvd].

> Now, I should stratify risk to decide on imaging timing. If there are red flags, rapidly progressive neurologic deficits, or cauda equina features, I should proceed directly to urgent MRI; if not, a conservative trial is appropriate. But wait, I should double-check the age-related nuance: at age 65, if there was low-velocity trauma, known osteoporosis, or chronic steroid use, lumbar X-rays and possibly earlier MRI may be justified; otherwise, isolated sensory symptoms without red flags typically do not mandate immediate imaging. I need to ensure I document the absence or presence of these risk modifiers clearly before deferring imaging [^114UwfEa] [^1151j7Un] [^113sgg8c] [^112BNubN].

> For initial management without red flags, I will recommend activity as tolerated (avoid bed rest), short course NSAIDs or acetaminophen if not contraindicated, and early, guided physical therapy, while coaching on the natural history that many radiculopathies improve within weeks. Let me reconsider the imaging threshold so I don't drift from guidelines: both ACR and ACP/APS suggest deferring MRI for acute radicular symptoms unless severe or progressive deficits emerge, reserving imaging if symptoms persist after a structured 4–6 week trial in candidates for interventions. I should set a clear reassessment plan within 2–6 weeks to track trajectory and pivot if needed [^1151j7Un] [^116uiKNp] [^115gx6pQ].

> At the 6-week decision point, if symptoms are persistent or worsening, I should order a lumbar MRI without contrast as the initial imaging modality to evaluate for disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or other compressive and noncompressive causes; if new motor weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction, or systemic red flags appear earlier, I should not wait. Hold on, I should verify modality and contrast selection: noncontrast MRI is typically first-line for radiculopathy; I reserve contrast for prior surgery, infection, tumor, or when directed by specific clinical questions. I also need to document candidacy for epidural steroid injection or surgery, since that affects the rationale for imaging per guideline language [^1151j7Un] [^116NfdxE] [^114UwfEa] [^116uiKNp].

> Electrodiagnostic testing is my next adjunct if the diagnosis remains uncertain, if symptoms persist beyond about 3–4 weeks (to allow denervation changes), or if I need to localize the affected root level for procedural planning. I should confirm the test characteristics: EMG is highly specific but only moderately sensitive for radiculopathy, and a positive EMG may predict better response to epidural steroids or surgery; conversely, specialized modalities like dermatomal SEPs lack sufficient evidence for routine use. I will time EMG/NCS to maximize yield and to help distinguish radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or musculoskeletal mimics when imaging is equivocal [^111bipo2] [^113Cx7Q3] [^111akkLN].

> In parallel, I must actively consider musculoskeletal mimics, especially given "left upper leg" localization. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome presents with lateral hip pain, point tenderness over the greater trochanter, and pain with resisted hip abduction, often with a normal neurologic exam; diagnostic trochanteric or bursal injection can clarify. But wait, what if the hip joint is the pain generator? A diagnostic intra-articular hip injection can exceed 90% accuracy in differentiating hip pathology from spinal sources. If symptoms are purely anterolateral thigh with sensory disturbance, I need to check for meralgia paresthetica from lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment, with confirmation by nerve block when needed. If examination implicates these mimics, targeted hip/pelvis imaging or ultrasound can be decisive [^1125kYvd] [^111fzxKn] [^111WgvrR].

> If MRI and EMG are unrevealing but symptoms persist, I will now examine advanced options. Diffusion-weighted MR neurography can highlight nerve root signal changes when conventional MRI is normal, though availability and artifacts can limit utility; selective nerve root blocks can be diagnostic and therapeutic when the symptomatic level remains uncertain. But hold on, I should also think extraspinal: retroperitoneal or pelvic processes like hydronephrosis compressing psoas can mimic radiculopathy, and rare lesions such as Tarlov cysts may cause root symptoms; these should be considered when clinical features are atypical or discordant with standard imaging [^116rT7iX] [^111mrqow] [^1115zYRH] [^111wzs63] [^114M6GtN].

> Regarding referral and interventions, I should confirm urgency versus routine timelines. Urgent spine referral is indicated for cauda equina syndrome, progressive neurologic deficits, or intractable pain with a confirmed compressive lesion; routine referral is appropriate after 6–12 weeks of conservative care when imaging confirms a surgically amenable lesion or for consideration of epidural steroid injection, which offers short-term relief for radicular pain but limited evidence for long-term benefit. I need to double-check surgical timing: discectomy can speed recovery in persistent radiculopathy due to ongoing compression after about 4–6 weeks of appropriate conservative care, but fusion should not be offered for radiculopathy from disc herniation [^1157A2Hc] [^112nUiaX] [^114kY8YK] [^1169Kw5h].

> Let me summarize the algorithm with explicit checkpoints. Weeks 0–3: perform detailed history and exam, screen for red flags, begin analgesia and activity as tolerated, consider early PT, and educate on expected course, with follow-up at 2–6 weeks. Weeks 4–6: if improving, continue conservative care; if persistent or worse, proceed to lumbar MRI without contrast if an intervention candidate, and consider EMG/NCS if diagnosis remains unclear or to plan interventions. Week 6–8+: if MRI is negative or equivocal, use EMG/NCS to adjudicate radiculopathy versus peripheral or musculoskeletal causes and pursue targeted evaluation for mimics; escalate to specialist referral for injections or surgery if appropriate. Throughout, maintain a parallel lens for musculoskeletal mimics and extraspinal etiologies to avoid missed diagnoses [^1151j7Un] [^116uiKNp] [^1125kYvd].

> Before closing, I should verify common interpretive pitfalls. MRI can show root compression at levels that do not match the clinical syndrome, and false positives are not rare — clinical correlation is essential; this is especially true in older adults, where multilevel degenerative changes can obscure a single-root lesion. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from imaging alone; concordance between the exam, EMG, and targeted imaging should guide management, reducing unnecessary procedures and aligning treatment with the true pain generator [^115g9pgr] [^114RqT9H] [^115gx6pQ].

For a 65-year-old with new left upper leg numbness and stinging, the workup should begin with a **focused history and exam** to localize the deficit and screen for **red flags** [^112BNubN]. If **red flags** are present, obtain an **urgent MRI** of the lumbar spine and pelvis; otherwise, obtain MRI if symptoms persist or progress after 4–6 weeks of conservative care [^1151j7Un]. Electrodiagnostic testing (**EMG/NCS**) [^111akkLN] is indicated when the diagnosis is unclear or to distinguish radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy [^111bipo2]. Consider vascular studies when pulses are diminished or when vascular claudication is suspected [^1122AtEq]. Early imaging is warranted if the patient is elderly, has osteoporosis, or is on chronic steroids [^113sgg8c].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

### Clinical history

Elicit onset and duration; an **acute 3-day onset** suggests radiculopathy, plexopathy, or peripheral neuropathy. Characterize pain with neuropathic descriptors — burning, stinging, or electric quality — which suggest nerve involvement [^112P9eXD]. Review associated symptoms, including weakness, gait instability, bowel or bladder dysfunction, and systemic features such as fever or weight loss. Obtain a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, malignancy, recent trauma, infections, and autoimmune disorders, and review medications, including anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and chronic corticosteroid use. Screen for **red flags** such as rapid progression, severe weakness, saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder dysfunction, fever, weight loss, and history of malignancy [^112BNubN].

---

### Physical examination

Perform a **focused neurological examination**, including sensory testing (light touch, pinprick, vibration, proprioception), myotomal motor strength, reflexes (patellar, Achilles), coordination, and gait assessment [^113pSq1m]. Include special tests — straight leg raise, femoral nerve stretch test, and Tinel's sign at the inguinal ligament for meralgia paresthetica — and perform a vascular examination assessing pulses, bruits, and capillary refill. Identify **red flags**, including motor weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, saddle anesthesia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction [^112BNubN].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for acute left upper leg numbness and stinging includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Radiculopathy | - Lumbar disc herniation (L2-L4) [^117X8FP5] <br/> - Lumbar spinal stenosis [^114GkY1G] <br/> - Foraminal stenosis <br/> - Degenerative disc disease |
| Peripheral neuropathy | - Femoral neuropathy <br/> - Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy (meralgia paresthetica) <br/> - Diabetic neuropathy <br/> - Entrapment neuropathies [^111akkLN] |
| Plexopathy | - Lumbosacral plexopathy (diabetic amyotrophy, neoplastic infiltration, radiation-induced) [^111WRb8K] [^111xa8up] |
| Vascular | - Peripheral arterial disease <br/> - Femoral artery aneurysm <br/> - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [^117X8FP5] [^1122AtEq] |
| Musculoskeletal | - Hip osteoarthritis <br/> - Greater trochanteric pain syndrome <br/> - Myofascial pain syndrome [^117X8FP5] |
| Systemic | - Multiple sclerosis <br/> - Guillain-Barré syndrome <br/> - Amyloidosis [^111wUq3K] |

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Initial laboratory tests

- **CBC**: Evaluate for infection, anemia, malignancy.
- **ESR/CRP**: Inflammatory markers for infection, inflammatory arthritis, malignancy.
- **CMP**: Electrolyte abnormalities, renal/hepatic dysfunction.
- **HbA1c**: Screen for diabetes mellitus.
- **TSH**: Evaluate thyroid dysfunction.
- **Vitamin B12**: Screen for deficiency-related neuropathy.

---

### Imaging studies

- **MRI lumbar spine**: Preferred initial imaging for suspected radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, or disc herniation [^1151j7Un].
- **MRI pelvis**: Evaluate for plexopathy, femoral neuropathy, or pelvic masses [^111xa8up].
- **MRI hip**: Assess for hip joint pathology, greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1125kYvd].
- **CT myelography**: Alternative if MRI contraindicated [^115Bvxxi].
- **Ultrasound**: Evaluate for DVT, femoral artery aneurysm.

---

### Electrodiagnostic studies

Electrodiagnostic studies comprise **EMG/NCS** [^111akkLN], which help differentiate radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy and assess severity and chronicity [^111bipo2].

---

### Additional tests (if indicated)

Order **lumbar puncture** when CNS infection or inflammatory demyelinating disease (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome) is suspected. Use a selective nerve root block as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for radiculopathy [^1115zYRH]. Obtain vascular studies, such as ankle-brachial index and Doppler ultrasound, when vascular claudication is suspected [^1122AtEq].

---

## Indications for urgent or emergent evaluation

Immediate evaluation and intervention are required if:

- **Rapidly progressive neurological deficits**: Motor weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign [^112BNubN].
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction.
- **Suspected vascular compromise**: Acute limb ischemia, DVT.
- **Suspected infection or malignancy**: Fever, weight loss, history of malignancy [^114UwfEa].

---

## Management plan

Begin with **conservative management**, including physical therapy, analgesics, neuropathic pain agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin, and corticosteroids for inflammation. Consider interventional procedures — epidural steroid injections [^1157A2Hc] and selective nerve root blocks — if symptoms persist or if localization supports a focal source. Reserve surgical intervention for severe or progressive neurological deficits, refractory radiculopathy, or structural lesions causing nerve compression [^112nUiaX].

A 65-year-old patient with acute left upper-leg numbness and stinging requires a **focused history, physical exam, and targeted diagnostics** to localize the lesion and identify the cause. MRI is the preferred initial imaging modality for suspected radiculopathy or spinal stenosis [^1151j7Un], while EMG/NCS help differentiate radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy [^111bipo2]. Urgent evaluation is necessary for **rapidly progressive deficits, cauda equina syndrome, vascular compromise, or suspected infection or malignancy**.

### Evaluation of persons with suspected lumbosacral and cervical radiculopathy: Electrodiagnostic assessment and implications for treatment and outcomes (Part II) [^111akkLN]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Low credibility.

The electrodiagnostic (EDX) examination with needle electromyography (EMG) is the most important means of testing for radiculopathy. This test has modest sensitivity but high specificity and complements imaging of the spine. In this second of a two-part review, the implications of electrodiagnostic findings for diagnosis and clinical management of persons with radiculopathy are reviewed. An EMG-confirmed lumbosacral radiculopathy is associated with better clinical outcomes for persons undergoing aggressive conservative management. A positive EMG test portends a better clinical response to epidural corticosteroid injections. If a person undergoes spine surgery, a positive pre-operative EMG for radiculopathy is also associated with better outcomes.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^115Q14bg]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Our review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement. Details of our protocol were registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO No. CRD42011001197). This review was initially conducted in partial fulfillment of a doctoral dissertation in epidemiology as an unpublished manuscript, which we updated to September 2023.

- **Data sources and search strategy**: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Trials Registry, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts Related to Effects; initially from 1970 to March 2016. In February 2022, we conducted an update and identified records published between April 2016 and January 2022. We ran a final search update to 21 September 2023. Search strategies combined terms from three key concepts: intervertebral disc herniation, lumbar spine, and etiology, and were developed in consultation with an experienced information specialist (Appendix 1 in Online Supplementary Material). The reference lists of all eligible studies were also searched for additional relevant studies.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible studies were published in English, French, or Spanish that used cohort, case-control, or randomized trial (only potentially eligible for risk factor evidence) designs to examine the incidence of and/or risk factors for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy in adults (aged 18 years or older). We excluded studies of asymptomatic LDH or LDH due to neoplasm, infection, fracture, dislocation, or similar conditions.

### Compression of root level in a patient with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging [^113igpiy]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by acute, painless, recurrent mononeuropathies that are secondary to compression or minor trauma. This case is the first to report an intraspinal compression of the radicular nerve by schwannoma in a patient with HNPP. A 66-year-old woman developed left foot drop and paresthesia of the lateral aspects of the left distal lower leg. An electromyography showed left L5 radiculopathy and severe peripheral polyneuropathy. A lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging revealed a radicular nerve in the intradural and extramedullary space being compressed by schwannoma. She previously had symptoms of foot drop several years ago, and HNPP was confirmed by peripheral myelin protein 22 deletion. She was surgically treated for L5 radiculopathy, which might have been caused by a traction of the nerve root by schwannoma at the intradural and extramedullary space. After surgical treatment, her symptoms of foot drop had improved from zero grade to IV+ grade within 4 weeks. The occurrence of HNPP and schwannoma in the same patient may be coincidental, but it is tempting to speculate that they share a common genetic basis. Therefore, for patients with HNPP, it is important to consider not only an electrophysiologic study but also a magnetic resonance imaging to locate the exact pathologic site.

### Comparison of surgical and electrodiagnostic findings in single root lumbosacral radiculopathies [^114sGY4m]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

To identify the segmental innervation of L-2-S-1 muscles, we compared the preoperative electrodiagnostic examinations of 45 patients with single-level lumbosacral radiculopathies confirmed radiologically and surgically. The electrodiagnostic findings were classified as abnormal only by the needle examination and only if muscles demonstrated active denervation or a marked neurogenic motor unit potential firing pattern. In comparison to other surgical, intraoperative root stimulation, and clinical studies, we found several differences. Overall, there was little overlap among L-2–4, L-5, and S-1 radiculopathies. The tibialis anterior was predominantly L-5 innervated, the gastrocnemius (medial and lateral head) predominantly S-1 innervated, and the biceps femoris (short and long head) exclusively S-1 innervated. The two heads of biceps femoris were not affected in any patients with L-5 radiculopathy in whom they were examined. These findings help guide both the clinician and surgeon in the diagnosis and treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathies.

### Exhausting fatigue influences F-wave and peripheral conduction velocity, following lumbar radiculopathy [^111QiePR]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether mechanical nerve root compression could indirectly contribute to early muscle fatigue due to impaired activation.

Patients' two legs and the control group's dominant leg underwent exhausting foot dorsiflexion against a 2 kg weight. Electrophysiological parameters were measured under three conditions: before, upon completion of, and five minutes after the exhausting effort (causing unbearable fatigue). The study was conducted in a warm room (24°C) in the EMG laboratory of a rehabilitation center using standard equipment. Eighteen patients participated in the study (12 males and six females, mean age 47.8 ± 12.0 years), suffering from lumbar radiculopathy with unilateral complaints at the L4, L5 innervation territory. There were 22 matched controls (18 males and four females, mean age 44.4 ± 9.9 years) who were healthy subjects. The peroneal nerve was stimulated supra-maximally, behind the fibular head. Recording the activity of the anterior tibial muscle served to calculate F-wave latency, the conduction velocity of the nerve and muscle complex (NMCV), the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, and the exhaustion time.

Following the exhausting fatigue, the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and control legs exhibited a significant decrease in NMCV and reduced CMAP amplitude (p < 0.05). In each condition (rest, effort, recovery), the patients' two leg types exhibited similar NMCV.

### Motor amplitudes may predict electromyography-confirmed radiculopathy in patients referred for radiating limb pain [^113ioPMJ]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Low credibility.

Radiculopathy is diagnosed by needle electromyography, with nerve conduction studies excluding alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: In patients referred for electrodiagnostic evaluation of radiating limb pain, we compared ulnar motor amplitudes between those with and without electromyographically confirmed C8 radiculopathy, as well as fibular motor amplitudes between those with and without electromyographically confirmed L5 radiculopathy.

- **Results**: Patients with electromyographically confirmed C8 or L5 radiculopathy demonstrated decreased ulnar or fibular motor amplitudes, respectively, as compared to patients without radiculopathy. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, with areas under the curve of 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. Optimal cut-offs for electromyographically confirmed C8 and L5 radiculopathies were 10.2 mV and 3.6 mV, respectively, with associated sensitivities/specificities of 0.86/0.74 and 0.92/0.60.

- **Discussion**: Ulnar and fibular motor amplitudes may have clinical utility in assessing the likelihood of patients demonstrating electromyographically confirmed C8 and L5 radiculopathies with active denervation. The findings may be particularly useful in patients intolerant of needle electromyography.

### Accuracy of clinical tests in detecting disk herniation and nerve root compression in subjects with lumbar radicular symptoms [^115begMi]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

To investigate the accuracy of three commonly used neurodynamic tests (slump test, straight-leg raise [SLR] test, and femoral neurodynamic test), and two clinical assessments for determining radiculopathy (radiculopathy I: one neurologic sign; radiculopathy II: two neurologic signs corresponding to one specific nerve root), in detecting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (extrusion, subarticular nerve root compression, and foraminal nerve root compression), a validity study was conducted in a secondary care setting.

A total of 99 subjects (mean age 58 years; 54% women) with lumbar radicular symptoms were included. They were referred for epidural steroid injection and had positive clinical and MRI findings. Positive clinical findings included the slump test (n = 67), SLR test (n = 50), femoral neurodynamic test (n = 7), radiculopathy I (n = 70), and radiculopathy II (n = 33). Positive MRI findings included extrusion (n = 27), subarticular nerve compression (n = 14), and foraminal nerve compression (n = 25).

- **Interventions**: Not applicable.

- **Main outcome measures**: Accuracy of clinical tests in detecting MRI findings was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristics analysis with the area under the curve (AUC).

- **Results**: The slump test had the highest sensitivity in detecting extrusion (.78) and subarticular nerve compression (1.00), but the respective specificity was low (.36 and .38). Radiculopathy I was most sensitive in detecting foraminal nerve compression (.80) but had low specificity (.34).

### Identifying lumbosacral plexus nerve root abnormalities in patients with sciatica using 3T readout-segmented echo-planar diffusion weighted MR neurography [^116rT7iX]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old man experienced severe right leg pain and numbness. DWI-RESOLVE images with b = 50, b = 500, and b = 800 show the right L5 nerve root, indicated by arrows on each image. Both readers evaluated the nerve as positive for abnormality, with grade IV abnormal size and signal intensity, on axial DWI-RESOLVE images. Sagittal T2W TSE images of the lumbar spine revealed no significant disc herniation or other potential causes for symptoms. The color-mapped image demonstrates asymmetry in the right L5 nerve. Long arrows indicate the abnormal right L5 nerve, and a short arrow indicates the normal contralateral left L5 nerve.

The inter-observer agreement κ for each nerve graded by the readers was calculated. The κ values revealed excellent inter-observer agreement for the evaluation of all lumbosacral nerve abnormalities with the DWI-RESOLVE sequence, ranging from 0.87 to 0.94. Specific inter-observer agreement values were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87–0.97) for L5, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75–0.99) for S1, 0.94 (95% CI: 0.85–1.0) for S2, and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.8–1.1) for the sciatic nerve.

### Utility of electrodiagnostic testing in evaluating patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy: An evidence-based review [^113Cx7Q3]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lumbar spinal stenosis, specifically concerning EMG, the AANEM 2010 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend the following electrodiagnostic studies:

- **Dermatomal/segmental somatosensory-evoked potentials**: Studies of the L5 or S1 dermatomes are not supported.
- **Paraspinal mapping with needle EMG**: This is not recommended for sacral radiculopathy.
- **Motor-evoked potentials with root stimulation**: Not recommended for making an independent diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Adjacent double-nerve root contributions in unilateral lumbar radiculopathy [^113Ma1tW]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and imaging characteristics, as well as the injection response of adjacent double-root contributions to unilateral lumbar radiculopathy in a typical interventional spine practice. Image-guided selective nerve root block or steroid injection is commonly performed for lumbar radiculopathy.

- **Materials and methods**: In 132 of 350 patients (37.7%) with unilateral radiculopathy, adjacent double-nerve root block or steroid injection was performed based on preprocedural clinical and imaging characteristics. Clinical presentation (including pain pattern and VAS), response to injection, and imaging features of potential root compression or irritation (such as disk protrusion and subarticular/foraminal stenosis) were tabulated.

- **Results**: Clinically, a subset of patients with both L4+L5 and L5+S1 radiculopathy presented with proximal sciatica only, in addition to those with typical L4, L5, or S1 radicular patterns. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated evidence of adjacent double-root abnormality in 56 of 79 (71%) patients without prior surgery (single-level disease in 32; two-level disease in 24) and in all 53 patients with prior lumbar surgery (scar in 42; separate-level root abnormality in 13). Adjacent double-level replication of the patient's familiar pain was present in 82 of 132 (62%) patients, with single-root replication in 37 (28%) and no response in 13 (10%). Typical sciatica was encountered by injection at L4 (15%-33%), likely reflecting furcal nerve lumbar plexus contribution from L5. Sensations from each injected root usually replicated separate recognizable pain patterns.

### Relationships between the integrity and function of lumbar nerve roots as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and neurophysiology [^112mLVAi]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained bilaterally from the target muscles, tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL). Pairs of Ag/AgCl electrodes (self-adhesive, 2 cm diameter, CareFusion, UK) were positioned parallel to the muscle fiber orientation. A ground electrode was placed over the left lateral malleolus. For the TA, electrodes were positioned one-third of the way down a line between the head of the fibula and the superior aspect of the medial malleolus; for the SOL, two-thirds of the way down a line between the medial condyle of the femur and the medial malleolus. Participants were additionally asked to contract the target muscles by ankle dorsiflexion or plantarflexion to confirm that the electrodes were located over the most prominent muscle bulk. EMG data were filtered (10–1000 Hz), amplified (1000×; Iso-DAM, World Precision Instruments, UK) and sampled at 2 kHz using a Power 1401 data acquisition system and Signal v5 software (Cambridge Electronic Design [CED], UK) connected to a computer for subsequent offline analysis.

- **TMS**: TMS was delivered to the motor cortex using a Magstim 200 2 mono-phasic stimulator (The Magstim Company Ltd. UK) connected to a figure-of-eight coil (wing outer diameter 10 cm), positioned over the approximate location of the primary motor cortex at a site which elicited a maximal motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the contralateral target muscle.

- **Experimental parameters**: Measurements were conducted while participants were seated in an armchair with the torso supported by the backrest and feet strapped securely on a wood plate on the floor.

Electrodiagnostic evaluations are commonly requested for patients with suspected radiculopathy. Understanding lower extremity musculoskeletal conditions is essential for electrodiagnostic medicine specialists, as musculoskeletal disorders often mimic or coexist with radiculopathy. This review delineates radicular pain from other types originating from the lumbosacral spine and describes musculoskeletal conditions frequently mimicking radiculopathy, such as those that cause radiating pain and sensorimotor dysfunction.

In clinical evaluation, a history of pain radiating along a specific dermatomal territory with associated sensory disturbance suggests radiculopathy. Physical examination findings consistent with radiculopathy include myotomal weakness, depressed or absent muscle stretch reflexes, focal atrophy along a discrete nerve root territory, and potentially positive dural tension maneuvers like the straight leg raise. However, electrodiagnostic medicine specialists must be knowledgeable of musculoskeletal mimics, which may manifest as incomplete radiation within or beyond a dermatomal territory, non-radiating pain, tenderness, and give-way weakness in the context of a normal neurological examination.

A systematic approach to musculoskeletal examination is vital, and this review focuses on high-yield physical examination maneuvers and diagnostic investigations to differentiate between musculoskeletal conditions and radiculopathy. This approach ensures accurate diagnoses, promotes resource stewardship, enhances patient satisfaction, and optimizes care delivery.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111fzxKn]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) can be challenging to differentiate from radiculopathies due to several overlapping characteristics. First, the pain distribution in GTPS often resembles L3, L4, or L5 radiculopathies, as patients commonly report pain radiating along the lateral thigh in a distal manner. Second, patient histories and physical examination findings in GTPS frequently coincide with those found in radiculopathy, such as thigh pain (58%), pain below the knee (67%), and ipsilateral lower extremity weakness (62%).

Additionally, patients with radiculopathy have an increased risk of developing GTPS because of biomechanical alterations such as Trendelenburg gait. Similarly, patients with painful lower extremity conditions are at heightened risk of lumbosacral radiculopathy due to spinal imbalances. Gluteus medius weakness can lead to biomechanical alterations associated with GTPS, so clinicians should strongly consider that GTPS may co-occur with L5/S1 radiculopathy.

GTPS is characterized by:

- **Pain at the lateral hip**: Pain may radiate down the lateral thigh, with point tenderness at the greater trochanter when palpated or when lying on the affected side.
- **Pain with resisted hip abduction**: Observed in a side-lying position and lateral hip pain at end-range motion for hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation (i.e. the FABER test, sometimes termed Patrick's test).
- **Ober's test**: This test involves the patient lying in lateral decubitus with the affected side up while the examiner passively abducts and extends the hip, then slowly lowers the leg to its passive resting position. It is frequently used to evaluate patients with suspected GTPS.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: Recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC Spine Imaging Working Group [^115gx6pQ]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality often used to depict spinal structural abnormalities that may cause low back pain (LBP). With its high soft tissue contrast, MRI allows assessment of multiple structures including intervertebral discs, nerve roots, contents of the central spinal canal, ligaments, and facet joints. While MRI is superb at identifying tissue-specific pathology along the spine, the clinical relevance of these findings is often uncertain. Thus, diagnostic MRI for LBP is only recommended in certain patients.

The American College of Physicians' guidelines for diagnostic imaging suggest immediate imaging when there are major risks, such as suspicion of cancer, spinal infection, cauda equina syndrome, or presence of severe neurological deficits, but advise deferral of imaging pending a trial of treatment in cases where there are weaker risk factors. Notably, only in a minority of patients can LBP be attributed to a specific pathology (e.g. vertebral fracture or disc herniation with nerve compression), while the great majority of patients are assigned a diagnosis of non-specific LBP (i.e. pain for which the distinct patho-anatomical basis cannot be determined).

Some lumbar MRI findings that are common in patients with LBP are also common in asymptomatic subjects, which makes it difficult to define a causal relationship in individual patients and has led to questions about the diagnostic value of such findings. However, some lumbar MRI findings are more prevalent in patients with LBP than in asymptomatic subjects. Those include…

### A sensitive electrodiagnostic method for detecting sensory conduction deficits in an experimental single lumbar radicular lesion [^113SgnPb]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: For a single L5 radicular lesion produced by constant, localized compression, sequential changes of epidurally recorded potentials after sciatic nerve stimulation or direct L5 root stimulation were compared with those after indirect L5 root stimulation with a collision technique in rats.

- **Objective**: To determine whether the use of the collision technique improves the diagnostic yield of the lumbosacral-evoked potential study for a single radicular lesion.

- **Summary of background data**: Clinical recording of the evoked potentials at serial intervertebral spaces after stimulation of the peroneal or tibial nerve was less sensitive than expected for a single radicular lesion. This is presumably because peripheral nerve stimulation activates more than a nerve root, thereby allowing normal responses arising from the unaffected roots to mask mild conduction abnormalities of the diseased root. Furthermore, direct stimulation of the nerve root with a monopolar electrode, despite potential advantages, produces an overloading stimulus artifact. This precludes accurate recording because of the short distance between the stimulus and recording sites. A collision technique should circumvent these problems.

- **Methods**: A vascular clip was applied to the L5 root, and evoked potentials were recorded epidurally at T10–11 after sciatic nerve stimulation (Group 1, 11 rats), L5 root stimulation (Group 2, 14 rats), or a combination of L6 root and sciatic nerve stimulation (Group 3, 11 rats), at 3-minute intervals during a 15-minute period of compression and additionally 15 minutes.

### Diagnostic capability of low- versus high-field magnetic resonance imaging for lumbar degenerative disease [^111NsmvU]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Cohort study.

- **Objective**: To investigate the diagnostic capability of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with high-field MRI for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine.

- **Summary of background data**: Low-field MRI has several advantages over high-field magnetic resonance systems, including easier installation and lower purchase and maintenance costs. The diagnostic capability of low-field MRI for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine has not been compared with that of high-field MRI.

- **Methods**: A total of 100 patients (mean age: 56.3 years, range: 32–80; female:male ratio = 59:41) with neurogenic claudication or sciatica were studied. All patients underwent MRI of the lumbar spine on both low-field (0.25T) and high-field (1.5T or 3.0T) magnetic resonance systems. Intervertebral disc herniation, central canal stenosis, lateral recess stenosis, exit foraminal stenosis, and nerve root compression at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 were evaluated by two radiologists for both low- and high-field systems using established reliable grading systems.

- **Results**: There was excellent agreement between low- and high-field MRI with regard to grading the presence and severity of disc herniation (r = 0.92–0.94; P < 0.05), central canal stenosis (r = 0.89–0.91; P < 0.05), lateral recess stenosis (r = 0.81–0.87; P < 0.05), and exit foramen stenosis (r = 0.81–0.89; P < 0.05). Descending or exiting nerve root compression occurred in 52% of patients at L3-L4, L4-L5, or L5-S1 levels, with good agreement between low-field and high-field MRI (r = 0.71–0.76; P < 0.05) for nerve root compression.

- **Conclusion**: Excellent agreement was observed between low-field and high-field MRI for the assessment of lumbar degenerative disease.

### Double crush syndrome [^112g8yCT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Double crush syndrome is a distinct compression occurring at two or more locations along the course of a peripheral nerve that can coexist and synergistically increase symptom intensity. Dissatisfaction after treatment at one site may result from persistent pathology at another site along a peripheral nerve. Double crush syndrome is a controversial diagnosis; some scientists and surgeons believe it is an illness construction that may do more harm than good because it emphasizes an objective pathophysiologic explanation for unexplained symptoms, disability, and dissatisfaction that may be more psychosocially mediated. However, peripheral neuropathy may coexist with compressive neuropathy and contribute to suboptimal outcomes following nerve decompression. To better manage patients' expectations, treating practitioners should be aware of the possibility of concomitant cervical radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as the presence of underlying systemic neuropathy.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: An update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^1177U8RA]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

- **Versus neuropathic pain conditions**: Neuropathic pain conditions, including radiculopathies and peripheral neuropathies, often mimic myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) due to overlapping symptoms, such as radiating or referred pain patterns. Radiculopathies involve compression or irritation of the nerve roots, resulting in pain, numbness, and weakness along the distribution of the affected nerve root. Similarly, peripheral neuropathies arise from damage to peripheral nerves, typically presenting with burning, tingling, or electric shock-like sensations alongside pain.

Despite the similarities, there are distinct differences. Neuropathic pain is characterized by specific neurological signs, including sensory deficits and, when motor nerve fibers are involved, muscle weakness and altered reflexes — features that are absent in MPS. Additionally, while neuropathic pain patterns align with dermatomal distributions corresponding to affected nerve pathways, the referred pain patterns in MPS originate from trigger points in specific muscles and do not follow a dermatomal pattern. A thorough neurological examination is crucial, as it can help identify sensory abnormalities, muscle weakness, and reflex changes that are hallmarks of neuropathic conditions.

### Rare extraspinal cause of acute lumbar radiculopathy [^111wzs63]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old man presented to an outpatient pain management clinic with an antalgic gait and left lower extremity (LLE) radiculopathy from an unknown etiology. A lumbar MRI revealed minimal disc protrusion at L3 and a partially visualized left-sided kidney abnormality. Abdominal and pelvic CT demonstrated severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney compressing the left psoas major. The patient was immediately referred to an outside hospital for a nephrology workup, and following the placement of a nephrostomy tube, his radicular pain resolved. He remained asymptomatic at a 4-week follow-up.

We found two cases of postsurgical retroperitoneal fluid collection that caused lumbar radiculopathy, but none associated with hydronephrosis. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to report hydronephrosis as the potential etiology of lumbar radiculopathy. This highlights an important clinical reminder: to consider extraspinal etiologies in all patients who present with lumbar radiculopathy when clinical symptoms, examination findings, and diagnostic studies present with unusual characteristics.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine after epidural and nerve root injection therapy: Evaluation of soft tissue changes [^113BeGVg]. Clinical Imaging (2006). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate soft tissue changes after nerve root and epidural injections in the lumbar spine of patients with radiculopathy.

- **Materials/methods**: Patients underwent a multiple-shot injection protocol to the nerve root/epidural space. The MRI protocol included T1-weighted, T2-weighted, STIR, and contrast-enhanced, fat-saturated T1-weighted sequences before and after treatment.

- **Results**: In all treated patients, a diffuse wedge-shaped edema in paravertebral tissues with slight contrast enhancement was seen. Two small hematomas in the paravertebral muscle were noted. No changes in the epidural space, the presence of an abscess, or lipodystrophy in the epidural/nerve root space were observed.

- **Conclusion**: Normal tissue changes after injection therapy for lumbar radiculopathy include wedge-shaped tissue edema at the injection level. In a minority of patients, small hematomas may occur.

### Root compression on MRI compared with clinical findings in patients with recent onset cervical radiculopathy [^115g9pgr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of symptomatic and asymptomatic root compression caused by herniated discs and spondylotic foraminal stenosis by MRI in patients with recent onset cervical radiculopathy.

Seventy-eight patients with symptoms and signs of cervical radiculopathy of less than one month's duration were included. The authors determined the clinically suspected level of root compression in each patient. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated MRIs, blinded to the clinical findings. For each patient, the level of root compression on MRI was compared with the clinically affected level. The authors also examined the cause of compression: herniated disc, spondylotic foraminal stenosis, or both.

The results indicated that in 73% of patients, the clinically affected root was compressed on MRI. In 45%, MRI showed root compression without clinical substrate, together with or to a lesser extent without, the coexistence of compression of the clinically affected root. MRIs were assessed as normal in 13–15% of cases, and in 9–10%, only asymptomatic roots were compressed. Herniated discs without spondylosis were more often responsible for root compressions only at the clinically affected level, while spondylotic foraminal stenosis caused multiple root compression, including compression of clinically unaffected roots.

The conclusion drawn from the study is that MRI findings in patients with cervical radiculopathy should be interpreted together with the clinical findings, as false-positive and false-negative MRIs occur rather frequently.

### Tarlov cyst as a rare cause of S1 radiculopathy: A case report [^114M6GtN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

A 37-year-old female physician presented with a chief complaint of left posterior thigh pain, which began insidiously approximately four months before her initial examination. Initially, she had been evaluated by her physician, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered. The MRI scan was reported to be within normal limits, with the exception of minimal disc bulging at L4–5. She had received physical therapy with little benefit and was referred for physiatric assessment.

Review of the patient's original MRI scan showed the presence of perineurial (Tarlov) cysts within the sacral canal at the level of S2, with compression of the adjacent nerve root. Subsequent electrodiagnostic testing showed axonal degeneration consistent with an S1 radiculopathy. Tarlov cysts can be a rare cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of radicular leg pain.

### Radiculopathy in the setting of lumbar nerve root compression due to an extradural intraforaminal lipoma: A report of 3 cases [^112WU5aU]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2015). Low credibility.

A true adult spinal lipoma is an exceedingly rare cause of lumbar compression neuropathy. Only five cases of true extradural intraforaminal lipomas have been documented in the medical literature. The diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for this specific lipoma have yet to be established. This report features three histologically confirmed cases of extradural intraforaminal spinal lipomas that recently presented to the authors' practice. In addition, the literature was surveyed to include the five previously reported cases of true adult extradural intraforaminal spinal lipomas.

The consistency in presentation, response to surgical intervention, and postoperative recovery in these eight cases supports surgical intervention at the time of diagnosis. The authors' findings support elevated clinical suspicion, efficient diagnosis based on MRI, and early surgical intervention for this rare pathological entity. All cases presented in this report were symptomatic and occurred in the absence of other significant pathologies such as general spinal epidural lipomatosis, intradural lesions, tethering, severe degenerative stenosis, or herniated discs.

The clinical, neuroradiological, and histological findings characteristic of a true adult extradural intraforaminal lipoma are emphasized to differentiate this lesion from the more common etiologies for lumbar compression neuropathy. Heightened awareness and clinical suspicion for the focal, foraminal spinal lipoma as a cause of radiculopathy symptoms will enable more efficient diagnosis and treatment.

### Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of symptomatic nerve root of patients with lumbar disk herniation [^114icEGu]. Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can provide valuable structural information that may be useful for evaluating pathological changes of the lumbar nerve root. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) neurography has recently been introduced as an alternative way to visualize nerves, but at the time of writing, quantitative DWI and MR neurography have not been applied to evaluate the pathology of lumbar nerve roots.

- **Methods**: Our purpose was to visualize lumbar nerve roots and to analyze their morphology by MR neurography, and to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of lumbar nerve roots compressed by herniated disks using 1.5-T MR imaging. Ten consecutive patients (median age: 48.0, range: 20–72 years) with monoradicular symptoms caused by a lumbar herniated disk and 14 healthy volunteers were studied. Regions of interest were placed on the lumbar roots at dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and distal spinal nerves on DWI to quantify mean ADC values. The spinal nerve roots were also visualized by MR neurography.

- **Results**: In the patients, mean ADC values were significantly greater in the compressed DRG and distal spinal nerves than in intact nerves. MR neurography also showed abnormalities such as nerve swelling at and below the compression in the symptomatic nerve root. Increased ADC values were considered to be due to edema and Wallerian degeneration of compressed nerve roots.

- **Conclusion**: DWI is a potential tool for analysis of the pathophysiology of lumbar nerve roots compressed by herniated disks.

### Synovial chondromatosis presenting with lumbar radiculopathy [^112TKgP1]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

A case report of lumbar synovial chondromatosis with radiculopathy describes a rare occurrence where synovial chondromatosis of a lumbar facet joint extended into the spinal canal, compromising the lumbar nerve root. This report aims to raise awareness among spinal surgeons of this unusual clinical problem.

Synovial chondromatosis is characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovium of a facet joint and is most commonly found in large joints. Its occurrence in the spine is rare, and there has been no previous report of associated lumbar radiculopathy.

A 24-year-old woman presented with low back pain and right sciatica lasting for 5 months, without any objective weakness. Computed tomography scans revealed multiple calcified nodules anterior and medial to the right apophyseal joint of L5-S1, extending into the spinal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lobulated, heterogeneous enhancing extradural mass originating from the anteromedial aspect of the right L5-S1 facet joint. The lesion was excised in multiple pieces using a curette after exposing the corresponding intervertebral space through a conventional interlaminar approach. Histologic examination confirmed the presence of nodules of hyaline cartilage beneath the synovial cell lining.

The patient experienced complete relief from low back pain and right sciatica 5 days post-surgery, with all neurologic tests remaining normal thereafter. Synovial chondromatosis can compromise lumbar nerve roots when it extends into the spinal canal.

### Diffuse age-related lumbar MRI changes confound diagnosis of single (L5) root lesions [^114RqT9H]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

L5 radiculopathy has characteristic clinical and electrodiagnostic features, including radicular pain; weakness or denervation of hip abductors, ankle dorsiflexors, and inverters; and pre-ganglionic dorsal foot sensory loss. It is unknown how often patients with this distinctive clinical-electrodiagnostic presentation have isolated L5-root compression on neuroimaging or more widespread, possibly age-related, lumbar neuroforaminal or spinal stenosis.

- **Methods**: A study-blinded neuroradiologist quantitated lumbosacral neuroforaminal, lateral recess, and spinal stenosis in 26 consecutive patients with unilateral, clinically and EMG-ascertained L5 monoradiculopathy, and quantitated a global neuroforaminal and spinal stenosis score (SSS).

- **Results**: Only 9 patients (35%) had isolated L5-root compression, 14 (54%) had multi-root compression, and 3 (12%) had normal neuroimaging. Increasing age correlated with SSS, and the 9 patients with isolated L5-root compression were significantly younger than patients with multi-root involvement.

- **Conclusions**: This study underscores the role of clinical and electrodiagnostic data when interpreting lumbosacral neuroimaging, particularly in older patients.

### Value of 3D MR lumbosacral radiculography in the diagnosis of symptomatic chemical radiculitis [^117BWMeH]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

Radiologic methods for the diagnosis of chemical radiculitis associated with annular tears in the lumbar spine have been rare. Provocative diskography is one of the methods for diagnosing diskogenic chemical radiculitis but is invasive. A reliable imaging method for replacing provocative diskography and diagnosing chemical radiculitis is required. Our aim was to investigate the value of 3D MR radiculography depicted by rendering imaging in the diagnosis of symptomatic chemical radiculopathy associated with annular tears.

- **Materials and methods**: The study population consisted of 17 patients (age range, 32–88 years) with unilateral radiculopathy. Symptomatic chemical radiculopathy was confirmed with provocative CT diskography and/or provocative selective nerve root block for agreement of sides and levels. By adhering to the principles of selective excitation (Proset imaging), we acquired 3D coronal FFE sequences with selective water excitation. Morphologic changes in the ipsilateral symptomatic nerve root caused by chemical radiculopathy were compared with those in the contralateral nerve root on 3D MR lumbosacral radiculography.

- **Results**: Pain reproduction at the contrast-leak level during diskography (n = 4) and selective nerve root injection (n = 13) showed concordant pain in all patients. All patients with symptomatic chemical radiculopathy showed nerve root swelling in both ipsilateral levels and sides on 3D MR radiculography. The most common nerve root affected by chemical radiculopathy was the L5 nerve root (n = 13).

### Clinical applications of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar foraminal nerve root entrapment [^115PZqGC]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can provide valuable structural information about tissues that may be useful for clinical applications in evaluating lumbar foraminal nerve root entrapment. Our purpose was to visualize the lumbar nerve root, analyze its morphology, and measure its apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in healthy volunteers and patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis using 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging. Fourteen patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis and 14 healthy volunteers were studied.

Regions of interest were placed at the fourth and fifth lumbar root at dorsal root ganglia and distal spinal nerves (at L4 and L5) and the first sacral root and distal spinal nerve (S1) on DWI to quantify mean ADC values. The anatomic parameters of the spinal nerve roots can also be determined by neurography. In patients, mean ADC values were significantly higher in entrapped roots and distal spinal nerves than in intact ones. Neurography also showed abnormalities such as nerve indentation, swelling, and running transversely in their course through the foramen.

In all patients, leg pain was ameliorated after selective decompression (n = 9) or nerve block (n = 5). We demonstrated the first use of DWI and neurography of human lumbar nerves to visualize and quantitatively evaluate lumbar nerve entrapment with foraminal stenosis. We believe that DWI is a potential tool for diagnosis of lumbar nerve entrapment.

### Detection of lumbosacral nerve root compression with a novel composite nerve conduction measurement [^112gAcTu]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

This study utilized multivariate logistic regression techniques to develop a composite nerve conduction measurement for detecting lumbosacral (L5, S1, or both) nerve root compression.

- **Objectives**: The primary aim was to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of this composite nerve conduction measurement in detecting lumbosacral nerve root compression.

- **Summary of background data**: Nerve root involvement is characterized by clinical abnormalities, confirmed by radiologic and electrodiagnostic studies. While imaging studies can visualize structural abnormalities, they often have high false-positive rates. Electrodiagnostic methods, including nerve conduction studies, assess the physiologic integrity of the nerve roots. Despite their clinical value in evaluating nerve root compromise, previous applications of nerve conduction studies have produced inconsistent results.

- **Methods**: Two subject groups were compared. The L5-S1 compression group included 25 patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed lumbosacral (L5, S1, or both) nerve root compression and symptoms appropriately distributed. Most subjects (22) demonstrated at least one of the following during physical examination: positive straight-leg raise test, diminished ankle reflexes, sensory loss, or weakness. The control group comprised 35 asymptomatic individuals with no history of radiculopathy or potentially confounding neuropathology.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113pSq1m]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Physical examination tests have poor sensitivity and/or specificity for identifying radiculopathy when used in isolation, whether radiculopathy is due to disc herniation or other causes. Nevertheless, recommended physical examination maneuvers for the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy include manual muscle testing, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of ankle dorsiflexion weakness at 69% and lateral four toe extension weakness at 76% for L4/5 radiculopathy. Sensory testing shows a PPV of 76% and 50% for sensory abnormalities in the L5 and S1 dermatomes, respectively. The supine straight leg raise has a sensitivity of 0.67, which is superior to the seated straight leg raise, with a sensitivity of 0.41. Supine Lasegue's sign has a sensitivity range of 0.77–0.83, and supine crossed Lasegue's sign has a specificity range of 0.74–0.89.

Other physical examination maneuvers that may aid in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy include reflexes at the patellar and Achilles tendons. Ipsilateral absent or reduced reflexes at the patellar tendon show a sensitivity range of 0.18–0.67 and a specificity range of 0.66–0.90, suggesting L4 radiculopathy. Reflexes at the Achilles tendon have a sensitivity range of 0.14–0.67 and a specificity range of 0.60–0.93, suggesting L5/S1 radiculopathies.

Imaging modalities, particularly MRI, are frequently used to investigate low back pain and/or suspected radiculopathy. However, abnormalities on MRI are highly prevalent, even among asymptomatic persons. Consequently, resource stewardship organizations such as Choosing Wisely (USA) and Choosing Wisely Canada, as well as numerous specialty societies, recommend the judicious selection of patients who require imaging.

### Relationships between the integrity and function of lumbar nerve roots as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and neurophysiology [^1137Syne]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Corticospinal excitability measurements were performed on each target muscle separately while participants maintained contraction levels at 10% MVC of the target muscle. Active motor threshold (AMT) was established for each target muscle and defined as the lowest intensity of TMS that evoked visible MEPs in at least three of six consecutive trials. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were evoked by TMS, and an input-output relationship of MEP amplitude to stimulus intensity (IO curve) was constructed. Stimulus intensities started at 10% below the AMT and increased in 10% steps of AMT until the intensity reached the maximal device output. Intensities were randomized, and six MEPs at each intensity were recorded. TMS pulses were given every 8 seconds with several periods of rest provided to participants between trials to avoid muscle fatigue.

- **M-wave and F-waves**: A maximal motor response (M max) and F-waves were measured using supramaximal stimuli via a cathode to the common peroneal nerve around the fibular head (for TA) or the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa (for SOL) (Digitimer DS7, Digitimer UK, 500-μs pulse duration). The anode was placed over the patella on the stimulated side. Five M max at the same intensity were recorded; an intensity of 120% of the intensity used to elicit M max was delivered to the nerve at 1 Hz until 20 F-waves were recorded.

### Cervical radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, presentation, and clinical evaluation [^117GwPNu]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a common condition that typically results from compression and inflammation of the cervical nerve root or roots in the region of the neural foramen. It is frequently caused by cervical disc herniation and cervical spondylosis. The diagnosis can be established by history and physical examination. However, care should be taken, as diagnoses can mimic or coexist with cervical radiculopathy, such as entrapment neuropathies. The pathophysiology, presentation, and clinical evaluation of cervical radiculopathy are discussed.

This adjunct sequence (including b-50 images) added 10 min to a routine lumbar spine MR protocol (7 min if b-50 imaging is not obtained), which is not an insignificant time penalty. However, we consider that the benefits (objective demonstration of a radiculopathy) may outweigh this time cost. While it may be particularly beneficial for patients when the initial clinical diagnosis is clinically uncertain, it may also have a useful role in assessing response to treatment.

A technical limitation of this study is that despite the MR system passing all QA performance tests, magnetic susceptibility artifact was noted on the DWI-RESOLVE images acquired from some patients. This artifact degrades image quality, and in particular, adversely affected the quality of the DWI-RESOLVE images of nerves located at the margins of the defined FOV, typically the sciatic nerve. The artifact may obscure the affected nerve or give the false impression of asymmetric nerve signal intensity; however, the artifact is relatively easily identified by radiologists. In this study, nerve evaluation was avoided at the level at which the artifact was identified. The Study showed that the L5 and S1 nerves were principally affected compared with the S2 and/or sciatic nerves, which was in line with a previous study of 97 patients with radicular symptoms which found the number of abnormalities involving the L5 and S1 lumbosacral nerves was higher than for the L4, S2 and S3 lumbosacral nerves. Of note, all the patients characterized as positive with regard to nerve abnormality in this study matched the

### The electrodiagnostic sensitivity of proximal lower extremity muscles in the diagnosis of L5 radiculopathy [^113dkJ3V]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the electrodiagnostic (EDx) sensitivity of proximal lower extremity muscles, including tensor fascia lata (TFL) and gluteus medius (GMED), in the diagnosis of L5 radiculopathy. Eleven EDx recordings with L5 radiculopathy were collected. The motor unit action potentials were assessed for morphology, stability, and firing characteristics. A descriptive analysis was performed.

- **Findings**:
	- In proximal L5-supplied muscles, 4 of 11 recordings were abnormal in TFL only, with normal GMED.
	- Four of 11 recordings had similar findings in both muscles.
	- Two of 11 had abnormal findings in both muscles, but TFL had more noticeable findings.
	- One had abnormal findings in both muscles, but GMED findings were more noticeable.
	- No patient had abnormalities limited to GMED.

TFL was more sensitive than GMED in detecting L5 radiculopathy. Knowing which muscles are more likely to show abnormalities can improve the efficiency of EMG and reduce patient discomfort.

### Relationships between the integrity and function of lumbar nerve roots as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and neurophysiology [^112PddrU]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence has shown that L5 and S1 nerve roots respond to neurophysiological testing differently. Previous work on the sensitivity of neurophysiological testing for each level of lumbar nerve root lesion found that the percentage of positive pathological results on EMG and in F-wave latencies were higher in L5 nerve root lesions than in S1 nerve root lesions. This may also explain the correlation between neurophysiology and DTI, which was not evident for the S1 nerve root but was found for the L5 nerve root. Alternatively, the discrepancy in correlations could be explained by the lack of variability in our healthy subject data; the DTI data were consistent, and the neurophysiological data were within normal ranges. It is therefore possible that associations might be revealed under pathological conditions, where changes in both neurophysiological and structural parameters are likely. A further study of the relationships between DTI metrics and neurophysiological measures in patients with compressed lumbar nerve roots is currently in progress.

In conclusion, the findings provide a preliminary set of normative values of diffusion metrics for L5 and S1 nerve roots, which suggests the potential for this DTI technique to be used in assessing lumbar spinal nerves in clinical settings. The values from the healthy subjects were highly consistent across the nerves of both sides as well as across levels. The relationships between DTI parameters and neurophysiological measures demonstrate the utility of using DTI metrics as a measure of nerve integrity and function.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1146s8Am]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Numerous musculoskeletal disorders outside of the lumbosacral spine can mimic the pain that often accompanies lumbosacral radiculopathy. In addition, various musculoskeletal disorders can coexist with lumbosacral radiculopathy or present in individuals referred for lumbosacral radiculopathy with normal electrodiagnostic testing (EDX) or other, non-radiculopathy peripheral nerve disorders. For instance, Cannon et al. found that among 170 individuals referred for EDX for suspected lumbosacral radiculopathy, nearly one in three had at least one of the following: myofascial pain syndrome, iliotibial (IT) band or greater trochanteric pain syndrome, or plantar fasciitis (PF). Consequently, providers of electrodiagnostic evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy should have a comprehensive understanding of musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those whose symptoms may imitate those of radiculopathy.

The objective of this review is to provide an evidence-informed synthesis of common musculoskeletal disorders and their presenting features. This information is contrasted with lumbosacral radiculopathy to assist electrodiagnostic medicine specialists and other healthcare providers in making accurate diagnoses.

Musculoskeletal mimics of radiculopathy by level

Landmarks for palpation tenderness relevant to the assessment of these conditions are illustrated in Figure 2. Musculoskeletal mimics of L1 radiculopathies tend to cause pain in the inguinal region; epidemiologically, L1 radiculopathies are rare, and clinicians should strongly consider the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Similarly, L2 radiculopathies are rare; for patients with pain in the groin and proximal thigh referred for suspected L2 radiculopathy, the examining clinician should strongly consider other diagnoses. Radiculopathy affecting the L3 nerve root, which typically causes pain in the medial knee, is uncommon, whereas musculoskeletal conditions that reproduce pain in this region are common. Radiculopathies affecting the L4 nerve root, which causes pain in the medial leg, are also uncommon compared to L5 and S1 radiculopathies, but more common than L1–L3 radiculopathies. Although L5 and S1 radiculopathies, which typically cause pain in the anterolateral leg and posterior thigh, respectively, comprise the bulk of lumbosacral radiculopathies, conditions that mimic radicular pain in these distributions are also common. Common musculoskeletal mimics of radiculopathy are summarized in Table 2.

- **Figure 2**: Selected anatomical landmarks for palpation tenderness on physical examination. Palpation of the above landmarks can be useful for identifying potential generators of patients' pain. The presence of pain on palpation at these landmarks as part of a comprehensive history and physical examination may suggest the diagnosis.

### Causes of lumbosacral plexopathy [^111xa8up]. Clinical Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The lumbosacral plexus represents the nerve supply to the lower back, pelvis, and legs. This review focuses on diseases and disorders affecting this pathway as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). We stress the need to review the lumbosacral plexus in patients with non-specific symptoms such as back, hip, and pelvic pain, and in those who present with sciatica unaccompanied by demonstrable intervertebral disc prolapse. We illustrate that the imaging appearances may be non-specific and reinforce the importance of the clinical history and the use of tissue sampling to achieve an accurate diagnosis.

### Clinical outcomes of 3T magnetic resonance imaging-guided lumbar and sacral foraminal injections [^111e6kSx]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

An analysis was conducted using non-contrast CT and MRI scans obtained in a 64-year-old man with left L5 radiculopathy, secondary to L5 anterolisthesis, and severe L5-S1 neural foraminal narrowing. The axial oblique CT image revealed fibrotic changes inside the neural foramen that obscured a clear delineation of the exiting nerve. In contrast, the axial oblique proton density-weighted MRI image provided a clear depiction of the nerve.

The aim of the report was to provide updates and improvements to the technical and clinical workflows on 48 procedures, evaluate responses to infiltration up to 5 months of follow-up, and perform a comparison with CT-guided intervention data available in the literature.

### Efgartigimod as add-on treatment in refractory Guillain-Barré syndrome: A case report [^115ziHjH]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The patient's medical history was unremarkable, apart from a sequestrectomy 2 months before for L5 radiculopathy.

Nerve conduction studies (NCS) showed an increase in distal latencies, a reduction in conduction velocities, and reduced persistence of F waves. The sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP) was normal.

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, performed six hours after admission, showed normal findings, whereas whole spinal cord MRI revealed gadolinium enhancement of the cauda equina.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit as she was tetraplegic, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and a nasogastric tube for nutrition. The next morning, plasmapheresis (PLEX) at 3 L/session was initiated on alternate days for five sessions. Tracheostomy was performed 8 days after admission, and gastrostomy was positioned 14 days after admission. At the conclusion of the PLEX treatment, the patient remained severely tetraparetic and mechanically ventilated.

Blood tests, including WBC and RBC count, electrophoresis, and reactive C protein, alongside serological tests for IgM and IgG for Cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and Hepatitis E, returned negative. Serum collected at admission was analyzed for anti-ganglioside antibodies (GM-1 IgG and IgM, GT1a IgG and IgM, GD1a IgG and IgM, GD1b IgG and IgM, GQ1b IgG and IgM) and antibodies directed against nodal/paranodal structures (Caspr-1, Contactin-1, Neurofascin-155 and -186), all of which were negative.

On day 14, NCS showed inexcitable nerves in the lower limbs and a severe reduction of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the median nerve.

- **Postoperative imaging**: Figure 2 depicts anterioposterior and lateral X-ray films taken after kyphoplasty.

A 73-year-old female case study revealed low back pain with left calf radiating pain and numbness for two months. Her medical history highlighted type II diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and Ahlbäck Grade III osteoarthritis of the right knee, status post total knee arthroplasty. Additionally, an old L4 osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) status post-vertebroplasty was detected through lumbar X-ray and MRI (Figure 3). Given her baseline condition and risks associated with conventional surgery, a transforaminal full-endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy and discectomy (FELFD) was performed to address her L4-L5 left foraminal stenosis and upward migrated disc herniation (Figure 4). Her symptoms improved immediately post-surgery, with her Visual Analog Scale (VAS) leg pain score decreasing from 7 preoperatively to 2 one day after the operation. Consequently, she was discharged and scheduled for regular follow-up.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113oJPvC]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Low back pain is among the top reasons patients seek medical care. It is responsible for more disability than any other musculoskeletal condition and has significant direct and indirect economic and healthcare costs. Low back pain is often associated with distinct pain conditions including referred pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy, all of which are common presenting features in patients referred for electrodiagnostic assessment. However, not all pain that affects or radiates to the buttock, thigh, or leg is caused by compression of lumbosacral spinal nerve roots.

The differential diagnosis for back pain radiating or extending into the lower limb is broad, as multiple structures and conditions can produce back and lower extremity pain. These include lumbosacral radiculopathy, non-radiculopathy disorders of the peripheral nervous system, disorders of the central nervous system, and musculoskeletal disorders. Musculoskeletal disorders, the focus of this review, can mimic and/or occur concurrently with lumbosacral radiculopathy. For example, estimates of the prevalence of lumbosacral radiculopathy range from 3% to 5% of the adult population, far lower than the point prevalence of low back pain (10%–30%) or greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) (6.6%–15%). These figures underscore the importance of correctly identifying radiculopathy with or without other concomitant musculoskeletal diagnoses.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111hJa24]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal disorders are common in patients referred to electrodiagnostic medicine specialists. Not all pain that radiates to the buttock, thigh, leg, or foot arises from compression of one or more lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders that may mimic radiculopathy is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing and potentially inappropriate invasive procedures, improving patient care and satisfaction.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to EMG, AANEM 2010 guidelines recommend obtaining the following electrodiagnostic studies to aid the clinical diagnosis in patients with suspected lumbosacral radiculopathy:

- **Peripheral limb EMG**: Consider using peripheral limb EMG to evaluate nerve function.
- **Paraspinal mapping with needle EMG in lumbar radiculopathy**: This method helps in assessing the involvement of paraspinal muscles.
- **H-reflex in S1 radiculopathy**: Utilize the H-reflex to diagnose radiculopathy at the S1 level.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117X8FP5]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Radiculopathy is a syndrome of neurological impairment affecting sensory and/or motor function of a spinal nerve root, typically arising from nerve root injury or compression. Patients' symptoms and signs vary depending on which nerve root is affected, as outlined in Table 1 and Figure 1. Although the precise frequency of lumbosacral radiculopathies is unknown, the majority involve the L5 and/or S1 nerve roots, as the L4/L5 and L5/S1 intervertebral discs are most prone to herniation. Depending on the direction of herniation, either the L5 and/or S1 nerve root can be affected. Similar to radiculopathy from disc herniation, radiculopathy due to other etiologies, such as degenerative spondyloarthropathy, typically resolves spontaneously within weeks to months but may persist in some patients.

- **Common features of radiculopathies by level**:
	- Radiculopathy often includes radiating pain and/or sensory loss along dermatomal territories and is sometimes termed "sciatica" by patients and healthcare providers. The character of the pain may be neuropathic — burning, electric — or may be described as dull or aching. Patients may or may not experience low back pain. Factors on history that correlate highly with nerve root impingement on imaging and/or radiculopathy on EDX include:
	- Pain that radiates within a specific dermatome (odds ratio [OR] 4.1)
	- Pain with coughing or sneezing (OR 3.2)
	- Subjective muscle weakness (OR 2.2)
	- Subjective sensory loss (OR 2.1)

### Clinical evidence of chemical radiculopathy [^114d1og5]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

It is universally accepted that an anatomical abnormality such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis can lead to radicular leg pain. There is some controversy as to whether radicular pain can be caused by a non-structural, solely biochemical disorder. Prior studies using biochemical analysis of inflammatory mediators of the disc or surrounding structures have enumerated many possible biochemical mediators of radicular pain. However, such studies have not definitively demonstrated whether these inflammatory mediators are the causes of radicular pain or whether these mediators are simply products of the degenerative cascade.

The purpose of this paper is to report on patients who satisfy strict criteria affirming a diagnosis of radiculopathy in the presence of normal imaging studies. The study was designed as a prospective case series of patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria at a university hospital outpatient physiatric spine practice. Inclusion criteria consisted of symptoms with extremity pain greater than axial pain, examination findings demonstrating a new myotomal deficit that correlates with the root level predicted by the dermatomal pain distribution, and failure to improve after at least four weeks of active physical therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging had to be void of local nerve root pathology as per review by the first author and the interpreting radiologist. Each patient was required to have a positive electromyographic study for an acute radiculopathy and a positive fluoroscopically guided diagnostic selective nerve root block.

### Chronic tophaceous gout mimicking widespread metastasis [^112KmsjV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Gout is a common crystal-induced arthropathy affecting mainly the joints of the appendicular skeleton; however, rarely, this condition affects the axial skeleton as well. Spinal gout can cause radiculopathy, cord compression, canal stenosis, and discitis. We describe a case of a 71-year-old woman where the initial presentation of destructive arthropathy and spinal masses secondary to axial gout was mistaken for a metastatic malignancy. Despite chronic polyarthropathy and bilateral subcutaneous gouty tophi, spinal gout was not considered a differential diagnosis during the initial assessment.

The patient was managed conservatively with pharmacological treatment, resulting in improvement of her upper limb radiculopathy and systemic joint pain, although there was little improvement in mobility. Such extensive involvement is rare, and the masses can mimic an underlying metastatic disease. Careful history and clinical examination recognizing polyarthropathy and subcutaneous tophi can aid the clinician in making the right diagnosis and instituting the correct treatment. Delay in recognizing gout as a differential diagnosis can lead to marked morbidity, as illustrated in our case.

### Clinical reasoning: A 61-year-old man with progressive right leg numbness and weakness [^111WRb8K]. Neurology (2024).

Approaching patients with lumbosacral plexopathies or radiculoplexus neuropathies can be challenging, and a well-defined strategy considering specific etiologies is necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. In this case, a 61-year-old man presented with a 10-year history of slowly progressive right lower extremity numbness and weakness. His examination was marked by right lower extremity weakness, decreased temperature/pinprick and proprioceptive/vibratory sensations, hypotonia, muscle atrophy, and absent right patellar and ankle deep tendon reflexes. His workup was notable for electrodiagnostic findings of chronic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy and neuroimaging revealing marked enlargement, T2 signal abnormality, and faint contrast enhancement in multiple nerves. A targeted fascicular nerve biopsy yielded the final diagnosis of a rare disease.

This case highlights the differential diagnoses of lumbosacral plexopathies or radiculoplexus neuropathies, including a guided workup. We also discuss the typical features of a rare diagnosis and its therapeutic options.

### Diagnostic challenges in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy: Avoiding misdiagnosis of a treatable hereditary neuropathy [^111wUq3K]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

ATTR amyloidosis had been misdiagnosed in 49 out of 150 cases (32%). The most frequently considered alternative diagnoses were CIDP, lumbar and sacral radiculopathy, lumbar canal stenosis, paraproteinaemic peripheral neuropathy, AL amyloidosis, and other causes of acquired neuropathy.

Thirty patients (61%) received immunotherapy, including:

- **Intravenous immunoglobulins**: 22 patients (45%).
- **Steroids**: 25 patients (51%).
- **Immune suppressors**: 6 patients (12%).

A combination of these treatments was used in 22 cases (45%) without clinical improvement. Moreover, 11 patients (22%) previously diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and radiculopathy secondary to degenerative spine disorder underwent spine surgery, with no or only transient clinical improvement of symptoms.

The delay from disease onset to correct diagnosis was significantly longer in misdiagnosed patients compared with those not misdiagnosed (46.4 ± 25.4 months vs. 34.7 ± 26 months; p = 0.01). In a multivariate logistic regression model, late onset after 55 years, absence of family history, male gender, and absence of symptomatic heart involvement were independently associated with misdiagnosis. However, autonomic dysfunction, small fiber neuropathy symptoms, and mutation type (Val30Met vs. non-Val30Met) were not associated with misdiagnosis.

Seventy-six patients underwent a tissue biopsy before being referred to our center. The tissue biopsy failed to show amyloid deposits in 9 out of 35 nerve biopsies (25%) and 15 out of 32 fat pad biopsies (47%).

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. Outcomes from the NeuPSIG working group [^112P9eXD]. Pain (2023). High credibility.

- **Radicular pain without radiculopathy**: Radicular pain is likely associated with hyperexcitability and ectopic discharges of dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. This hyperexcitability and these ectopic discharges may be due to inflammatory irritation, ischemia, or mechanical deformation of neural structures, or a combination of these and their downstream mechanisms, such as inflammation.

	The pain may be described as shocking, lancinating, electric, stabbing, or shooting and is often accompanied by a dull background ache. We have further added sharp and burning as potential pain descriptors, as these are frequently reported by patients with lumbar radicular pain. With radicular pain, the pain may be spontaneous or evoked, for instance, by certain movements of the spine or leg. In addition to pain, patients may experience paraesthesia and dysaesthesia, such as tingling, a "woolen feeling", or "a block of ice".

	The pain can be felt deep or cutaneous and may radiate into the leg in areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes. The working group further agreed to remove the original description of "band-like" location of the pain, which seemed sufficiently covered by "areas reminiscent of, but not necessarily identical to, dermatomes".

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) have a history of symptoms notable for pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks, known as neurogenic claudication. Those with more pronounced LSS may develop lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and imbalance in gait. Symptoms of neurogenic claudication typically abate with sitting down or leaning forward, referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis predominantly affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may experience radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. Because LSS is a slowly progressing condition, a rapid onset of symptoms may indicate a different pathology.

To confirm clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required. MRI remains the most common imaging modality to assess LSS, as physical examination and x-ray imaging do not have high sensitivity or specificity. There is significant variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and a lack of standardization may contribute to increased heterogeneity in the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low-cost and readily available. Radiological anteroposterior (AP) and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may reveal segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, should also be considered.
