## Question

Which GLP-1 medication is best for chronic kidney disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which GLP-1 receptor agonist is best for chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the question applies to type 2 diabetes with CKD or CKD without diabetes. Then, I should verify which GLP-1 agents have the strongest and most direct kidney-outcome evidence. Next, I will review guideline positions and how they prioritize agents. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetics and safety in CKD, including dose adjustments and tolerability. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note caveats about combination therapy and ongoing research.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the answer differs if we are dealing with type 2 diabetes plus CKD versus CKD without diabetes. The highest-quality evidence and regulatory positioning for GLP-1 RAs in CKD come from trials and guidelines in type 2 diabetes, whereas evidence in non-diabetic CKD remains limited and is not yet practice-changing, so I should anchor the recommendation to T2D with CKD and flag the non-diabetic CKD gap explicitly [^90b09e50] [^53ec6305].

> Next, I should review which GLP-1 agents have the most compelling kidney-outcome data. Semaglutide has the strongest and most direct evidence from FLOW, a dedicated kidney-outcomes trial stopped early for efficacy, showing a 24% reduction in a composite kidney endpoint and slower eGFR decline, which materially shifts the balance toward semaglutide for CKD progression risk reduction in T2D [^355059c3] [^d3c17c20]. Dulaglutide has robust supportive data from REWIND and AWARD-7, demonstrating reduced composite renal outcomes and slower eGFR decline versus insulin in advanced CKD, reinforcing its credibility for kidney protection in T2D with CKD [^4af59810] [^3363fecc]. Liraglutide's LEADER trial showed cardiovascular and kidney signals, but the kidney outcomes were secondary and less definitive than FLOW, so while supportive, it is not as strong as semaglutide or dulaglutide for primary kidney endpoints [^4e064086] [^7c45da64].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify guideline direction because it often crystallizes the hierarchy of choices. KDIGO 2024 recommends a long-acting GLP-1 RA with documented cardiovascular benefits for adults with T2D and CKD who are not at glycemic targets on metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or cannot use those agents, and it explicitly advises prioritizing agents with proven CV benefit, which aligns with choosing semaglutide or dulaglutide over short-acting or less proven agents [^90b09e50] [^fe32f368]. The ADA 2025 Standards similarly endorse GLP-1 RAs with demonstrated benefit in T2D with CKD to reduce cardiovascular risk and kidney disease progression, again favoring agents with robust outcome data [^b1de4bd1] [^acd1c4e8]. VA/DoD guidance goes further, recommending liraglutide or dulaglutide as options to reduce CKD progression in T2D with albuminuric CKD, reflecting a strong kidney-outcome emphasis in this population [^d517b2df] [^a2f62cef].

> I need to check pharmacokinetics and safety in CKD, because dose adjustments and tolerability matter in eGFR decline. Semaglutide, dulaglutide, and liraglutide do not require dose adjustment down to eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m² and have reassuring safety profiles in CKD, including low hypoglycemia risk and no excess acute kidney injury signal in pooled analyses, which supports their use across a wide range of kidney function in T2D [^7b8f8c57] [^41f5e536]. Short-acting agents like exenatide and lixisenatide are renally cleared and generally avoided in advanced CKD, so I should exclude them from consideration in eGFR < 30 or when eGFR is declining rapidly [^7b8f8c57].

> Let me consider mechanism and additive therapy, because this influences sequencing with SGLT2 inhibitors. GLP-1 RAs confer kidney protection partly via weight, blood pressure, and glycemic effects, but also through direct renal mechanisms such as reduced intraglomerular pressure, anti-inflammatory effects, and modulation of the RAAS, which complements SGLT2 inhibitors rather than replacing them; thus, guidelines position GLP-1 RAs after SGLT2 inhibitors when feasible, with combination therapy offering additive cardiorenal benefits in appropriate patients [^965a9e82] [^d72386df]. I should confirm that FLOW and contemporary meta-analyses support meaningful kidney risk reduction with semaglutide, reinforcing its role as first among GLP-1 RAs for CKD outcomes in T2D [^355059c3] [^8ee958ee].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD without diabetes? I should double-check that evidence. KDIGO 2024 is evaluating GLP-1 RAs in non-diabetic CKD, but there is no completed definitive trial establishing kidney benefit in that population yet, so routine use for CKD without T2D is not recommended pending stronger data, and I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize from T2D to non-diabetic CKD [^53ec6305] [^8ceb97a8].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a clear hierarchy. For adults with T2D and CKD, semaglutide has the most compelling and direct kidney-outcome evidence from FLOW and should be the preferred GLP-1 RA when available and tolerated, followed closely by dulaglutide given REWIND and AWARD-7 results and guideline endorsement, with liraglutide as a reasonable alternative if semaglutide or dulaglutide are not suitable, while avoiding short-acting renally cleared agents in advanced CKD and prioritizing long-acting agents with proven cardiovascular benefits to align with KDIGO and ADA guidance [^355059c3] [^90b09e50] [^b1de4bd1] [^7b8f8c57]. I should confirm that therapy is layered onto foundational CKD care, including RAAS blockade and, when indicated, SGLT2 inhibition, with shared decision-making around injection therapy, gastrointestinal tolerability, and cost [^d72386df] [^39437760].

Semaglutide is the **best GLP-1 medication for chronic kidney disease (CKD)** because it is the only GLP-1 RA with a dedicated kidney outcomes trial (FLOW) [^006ab06a] demonstrating a **24% reduction in kidney failure, sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline, or renal/cardiovascular death** in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD [^355059c3]. It also slows eGFR decline by 1.16 mL/min/1.73 m²/year and is **safe across CKD stages without dose adjustment** [^7b8f8c57]. Guidelines prioritize semaglutide for T2D with CKD when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or as add-on therapy, and it is the only GLP-1 RA with an FDA-approved indication to reduce the risk of worsening CKD in T2D [^90b09e50] [^355059c8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting semaglutide in CKD

### FLOW trial (NCT03819153)

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 3,533 patients with T2D and CKD (eGFR 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m², UACR > 100 mg/g).
- **Primary outcome**: 24% reduction in kidney failure, sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline, or renal/cardiovascular death (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.88) [^355059c3].
- **Secondary outcomes**: Slower annual eGFR decline (–1.16 vs –2.19 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) and lower MACE and all-cause mortality.
- **Safety**: No excess adverse events, including acute kidney injury or severe hypoglycemia [^41f5e536].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

Meta-analyses show GLP-1 RAs reduce **composite kidney outcomes** (HR ~0.82) and **kidney failure** (HR ~0.84) in T2D, with semaglutide showing the most consistent and robust effects [^8ee958ee] [^c1a6722c]. In CKD subgroups, semaglutide and dulaglutide demonstrate **significant reductions in kidney outcomes**, including slower eGFR decline and less albuminuria progression [^c1a6722c] [^4af59810].

---

## Comparison with other GLP-1 receptor agonists

| **Medication** | **Key ckd evidence** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Semaglutide | - FLOW trial <br/> - 24% reduction in kidney outcomes <br/> - FDA-approved CKD indication | Strongly recommended; preferred agent |
| Dulaglutide | - REWIND and AWARD-7 <br/> - Reduced albuminuria and slower eGFR decline | Recommended; alternative agent |
| Liraglutide | - LEADER <br/> - Reduced albuminuria and CV events | Recommended; alternative agent |
| Exenatide, lixisenatide | Limited CKD-specific outcome data | Not preferred; limited evidence |

---

Semaglutide is the **only GLP-1 RA with a dedicated CKD outcomes trial** and regulatory approval for CKD risk reduction, placing it ahead of alternatives [^355059c3].

---

## Safety and tolerability in CKD

- **Renal clearance**: Semaglutide is minimally renally cleared, allowing use across CKD stages without dose adjustment [^7b8f8c57].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low risk when used alone; monitor if combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^43f3677d].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Transient nausea/vomiting; start low and titrate slowly to improve tolerability [^3549bf60].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **KDIGO 2024**: Recommends long-acting GLP-1 RAs with proven CV benefit (semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide) for T2D with CKD not at glycemic targets on metformin/SGLT2i or unable to use them [^90b09e50] [^fe32f368].
- **ADA 2025**: Recommends GLP-1 RAs with proven benefit (including semaglutide) to reduce CKD progression and CV risk in T2D with CKD [^b1de4bd1] [^acd1c4e8].
- **VA/DoD 2025**: Strongly recommends adding a GLP-1 RA (prefer semaglutide or dulaglutide) to ACEi/ARB in T2D with albuminuric CKD to reduce CKD progression, MACE, and mortality [^a2f62cef] [^d517b2df].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Patient selection**: Prioritize patients with T2D and CKD, especially with albuminuria or declining eGFR [^90b09e50].
- **Combination therapy**: Can be used with SGLT2 inhibitors for additive cardiorenal benefit [^d72386df] [^7e5bb670].
- **Monitoring**: Track eGFR, UACR, and electrolytes; counsel on GI effects and hydration [^3549bf60].

---

Semaglutide is the **best GLP-1 medication for CKD** because it has the most robust kidney-outcome evidence, regulatory approval for CKD risk reduction, and strong guideline support, with favorable safety across CKD stages [^355059c3] [^90b09e50].

## References

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^3a2b4cee]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects around 10% of the global population and is most often caused by diabetes. Diabetes with CKD (diabetic kidney disease, DKD) is a progressive condition that may cause kidney failure and which contributes significantly to the excess morbidity and mortality in these patients. DKD is treated with direct disease-targeting therapies like blockers of the renin-angiotensin system, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as well as indirect therapies impacting hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, obesity and hypertension, which all together reduce disease progression. While no glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) are currently indicated to improve kidney outcomes, accumulating evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) corroborates a kidney-protective effect in people with T2D and CKD, and GLP-1 RAs are now mentioned in international treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with CKD. GLP-1 RAs are indicated to improve glycaemia in people with T2D; certain GLP-1 RAs are also approved for weight management and to reduce cardiovascular risk in T2D. Ongoing pivotal trials are assessing additional indications, including T2D with CKD. In this article, we review and discuss kidney outcomes from a multitude of completed clinical trials as well as real-world evidence and ongoing clinical trials.

Background

Approximately 40% of people with diabetes develop kidney failure and experience an accelerated risk of cardiovascular complications. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are glucose-lowering agents that manage glucose and weight control.

Objectives

We assessed the benefits and harms of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched to 10 September 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies were eligible if participants with diabetes and CKD were randomly allocated to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, placebo, standard care or a second glucose-lowering agent. CKD included all stages (from 1 to 5).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias assessment tool 2. Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and/or hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes included death (all-cause and cardiovascular), 3- and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney failure, composite kidney outcome, and severe hypoglycaemia. The secondary outcomes included non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, non-fatal peripheral arterial events, heart failure, hospitalisation due to heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, doubling of serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, albuminuria progression, vascular access outcomes, body weight, body mass index, fatigue, life participation, peritoneal dialysis infection, peritoneal dialysis failure, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, HbA1c, sudden death, acute MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularisation. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Forty-two studies involving 48,148 participants were included. All studies were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and no studies were carried out on children. The median study age was 66 years. The median study follow-up was 26 weeks. Six studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1–2, 11 studies in people with CKD stages 3–5, one study in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1–2 and 3–5. Risks of bias in the included studies for all the primary outcomes in studies that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists to placebo were low in most methodological domains, except one study that was assessed at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data for death (all-cause and cardiovascular). The overall risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death in studies that reported the treatment effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were assessed as unclear or at high risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. For GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to insulin or another GLP-1 receptor agonist, the risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death was low or unclear. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; I² = 23%; 8 studies, 17,861 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.05; I² = 42%; 7 studies, 17,801 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably decreased 3-point MACE (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; I² = 65%; 4 studies, 19,825 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 4-point MACE compared to placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89; 1 study, 2,158 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on absolute risks of clinical outcomes, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent all-cause death in 52 people with CKD stages 1–2 and 116 in CKD stages 3–5, cardiovascular death in 34 people with CKD stages 1–2 and 71 in CKD stages 3–5, while 95 CKD stages 1–2 and 153 in CKD stages 3–5 might experience a major cardiovascular event for every 1000 people treated over 1 year. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably had little or no effect on kidney failure, defined as starting dialysis or kidney transplant (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 4,134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or on composite kidney outcomes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 16,849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25; I² = 44%; 4 studies, 6,292 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care or other hypoglycaemic agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on risks of fatigue, life participation, amputation or fracture.

Authors' Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced all-cause death but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death in people with CKD and diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonists probably lower major cardiovascular events, probably have little or no effect on kidney failure and composite kidney outcomes, and may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with CKD and diabetes.

### Clinical profile and treatment patterns in individuals with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who initiate a GLP-1 receptor agonist: a multinational cohort study [^355059c3]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Diabetes with CKD is the most common underlying cause of kidney failure, accounting for almost 50% of cases in the developed world. Additionally, people with T2D and CKD are at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Available therapies for preventing and reducing the risk of CKD progression among patients with T2D include renin-angiotensin system inhibitor drugs (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also have favorable renal effects given their direct and indirect mechanisms of action, including stimulating pathways responsible for reducing oxidative stress in the kidneys, reducing inflammation, and promoting weight loss and glucose control. GLP-1 RAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney outcomes. Specifically, evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials, in which kidney outcomes have been captured as secondary endpoints, and from observational studies suggests that treatment with a GLP-1 RA is associated with cardiovascular benefits in patients with prediabetes and T2D, and with lower risks of composite kidney outcomes in patients with T2D. Moreover, FLOW, the first randomized trial designed to study the effects of GLP-1 RAs on kidney outcomes, showed a 24% reduction in the risk (hazard ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.88) of a primary composite kidney outcome (kidney failure onset, at least a 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] from baseline, or death from kidney-related or cardiovascular causes) when comparing patients initiating semaglutide with patients initiating placebo. In 2025, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the GLP-1 RA semaglutide to reduce the risk of worsening CKD, and the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs as a second-line therapy for patients with T2D and CKD who have not met their glycemic targets despite use of metformin and an SGLT2i or for those who are unable to tolerate these medications.

### Kidney and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with CKD receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^c1a6722c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists improve cardiac and kidney outcomes in patients with diabetes; however, their efficacy in individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported through May 25, 2024.

Setting & Study Populations

Adult participants in RCTs with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2.

Selection Criteria For Studies

RCTs including adults (≥ 18 years old) with varying degrees of kidney function, including individuals with CKD characterized by a baseline eGFR of < 60mL/min/1.73m 2, that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists with control treatments with respect to a composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, or a composite CV disease outcome. From among 212 screened studies, 12 trials involving that included participants with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2 were included.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators extracted the data.

Analytical Approach

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, and composite CV outcome were estimated using random-effects models. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE system.

Results

The analyses included 17,996 RCT participants with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2. GLP-1 receptor agonists were significantly associated with a reduced risk of the composite kidney outcome (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.77–0.94]; P = 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I 2 < 0.01%). GLP-1 receptor agonists were also associated with a reduced the risk of a > 30% eGFR decline (OR, 0.78; P = 0.004), a > 40% decline (OR, 0.76; P = 0.01), and a > 50% decline (OR, 0.72; P < 0.001). Risk of all-cause mortality was also lower in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60–0.98], P = 0.03), though there was high heterogeneity (I 2 = 71.6%). Composite CV outcomes were also lower with the use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74–0.99], P = 0.03; I² = 40.3%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to human GLP-1 backbone agents showed enhanced benefits.

Limitations

Inconsistent kidney outcome definitions, focus on diabetic populations in most studies, and potential publication bias.

Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists improved kidney and CV outcomes, and survival in patients with CKD enrolled in an array of clinical trials.

Registration

Plain-Language Summary

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce body weight and improve glycemic control. They also have been shown to protect the heart and kidney in people with diabetes. However, the extrapolation of these findings to those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. This study meta-analyzed data from clinical trials focusing on patients with CKD and noted that GLP-1 receptor agonists may slow kidney disease progression and lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and death. These findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists offer multiple kidney and cardiovascular benefits to people with CKD.

### Emerging evidence for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists in slowing chronic kidney disease progression [^790de599]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease continues to increase, and several novel therapeutic agents have been shown to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease in those with diabetes. This review summarizes more recent data on the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and kidney outcomes.

Recent Findings

Posthoc analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials, as well as several retrospective studies, demonstrate benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy for chronic kidney disease progression in diabetics. Although limited randomized clinical trials evidence assessing the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney outcomes in diabetic chronic kidney disease patients have been published, FLOW-CKD trial was halted based on interim data for efficacy, and results are awaited.

Summary

GLP-1 receptor agonism is a promising therapy for slowing the progression of diabetic chronic kidney disease. Recent studies support kidney benefits GLP-1 receptor agonists over insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4-inhibitors, and the FLOW-CKD trial would inform the potential benefits for reducing the need for dialysis and kidney-disease related mortality in those with kidney disease.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^fb12fa48]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Looking to the future

With the growing number of therapeutic options for people with T2DM, there is a need to better understand the optimal combination of treatments. There is strong evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists also reduce the risk of a range of cardiovascular events. The types of events prevented with GLP-1 receptor agonists, and time frames over which benefits accrue, highlight that the mechanism of cardioprotection with these agents is likely to be distinct from SGLT2 inhibitors and mediated mainly through anti-atherothrombotic effects. In contrast, SGLT2 inhibitors have greater benefits on HF and kidney outcomes, underscoring their unique haemodynamic effects. Additionally, GLP-1 receptor agonists are permitted for use down to an eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in some regions, presenting an important treatment option for patients with advanced CKD. The contrasting mechanisms and benefits of these two classes of drugs raise the possibility that combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors could provide additive cardiovascular and kidney benefits. Short-term trials of semaglutide and dulaglutide suggest that combination treatment reduces HbA1c and body weight to a greater extent than SGLT2 inhibition alone, without additional safety concerns. However, randomized evidence on patient-level cardiovascular and kidney outcomes is currently lacking and a trial designed to test these agents in combination would be very valuable. In lieu of such trials, the uptake of SGLT2 inhibitors in routine clinical practice will mean that future randomized studies, including of GLP-1 receptor agonists, may well include substantial numbers of participants receiving SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, and thus provide indirect evidence on the effects of these drug classes used in combination.

Prescribing for both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in a T1D population identified in Cosmos increased between 2010 and 2023.

Differences in characteristics of the overall T1D population and those newly prescribed the medications are often associated with elevated cardiorenal risk profiles, suggesting use of these newer treatments was intended to address additional medical needs.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally. People with T2D have a high prevalence and incidence of CKD, which presents an increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Cardiovascular complications are an especially relevant concern for individuals with both diabetes and CKD. The treatment approach for people with CKD is multidisciplinary, with the aim being primarily to slow the progression of disease to avoid dialysis or kidney transplantation and secondarily to reduce the cardiovascular risk that accompanies CKD. Currently available therapies with demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular events and kidney outcomes among patients with T2D include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (ns-MRAs). Among the latter class, finerenone is the drug with more robust and well-documented evidence supporting cardiovascular and kidney benefits among patients with CKD and T2D; finerenone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022 specifically to prevent CKD disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD associated with T2D.

The 2022 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines recommend SGLT2i as first-line therapy as part of a comprehensive management approach for people with T2D and CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. A growing body of clinical trial evidence suggests a protective effect of GLP-1 RA on cardiorenal outcomes compared with placebo or with standard of care; indeed, the first GLP-1 RA was recently approved by the US FDA for reducing the risk of worsening kidney disease and cardiovascular death in patients with T2D and CKD. While KDIGO guidelines do not explicitly recommend the use of GLP-1 RA as first-line therapy for CKD in T2D, KDIGO's comprehensive risk reduction strategy includes GLP-1 RA as an additional therapy option for patients at risk of insufficient glycemic control. Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i in patients with T2D concluded that both medication classes have cardiovascular and kidney benefits but with notable differences in benefits and harms.

Summary and future perspectives

While results from the large, controlled clinical trials, meta-analyses and the available real-world evidence implies a potential kidney-protective effect of GLP-1 RAs in people with T2D and high cardiovascular risk, a dedicated, properly powered kidney outcomes trial in participants with CKD remains needed to confirm this hypothesis. To that end, the FLOW trial has been initiated (Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03819153); FLOW is a multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, outcomes trial with a composite kidney outcome as the primary, confirmatory endpoint. The trial is currently ongoing testing the 1.0 mg s.c. version of the GLP-1 RA semaglutide versus placebo on top of standard of care. As the primary objective, FLOW will evaluate whether semaglutide can delay the progression of kidney impairment and lower the risk of death from kidney failure or CVD in people with T2D and CKD, of whom the vast majority enrolled in the trial has been selected for very high risk of CKD progression. FLOW, which will enrol around 3,500 participants, is expected to finalise in mid 2024.

In addition, studies investigating the kidney-specific mechanisms of action for GLP-1 RA are warranted. Here, the REMODEL trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04865770), which enrols a trial population similar to the one in FLOW, is ongoing. REMODEL, as well as the SMART trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04889183) in people with overweight/obesity and elevated albuminuria but without diabetes, are expected to complement and expand on the scientific insights gained from the FLOW trial.

Another area that needs clarification is if there are particular segments among people with diabetes and CKD that may benefit the most from GLP-1 RA treatment. As discussed above, the most pronounced kidney risk reduction seems to be seen for individuals with pre-existing CKD. Studies like REMODEL and FLOW may provide insights that could help optimising therapy.

### Effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^8ee958ee]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and can also have kidney benefits. However, whether GLP-1 receptor agonists improve clinically important kidney outcomes remains uncertain. We aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Methods

For this meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials that included at least 500 participants with type 2 diabetes, compared a GLP-1 receptor agonist with placebo with at least 12 months of follow-up, and reported a primary clinical kidney or cardiovascular outcome, from database inception to March 26, 2024. Post hoc, we included the SELECT trial (NCT03574597), which enrolled participants with cardiovascular disease and a BMI of 27 kg/m 2 or more without diabetes. Study-level summary data were extracted independently by two authors for inclusion in this random-effects analysis. The main kidney outcome was a composite outcome, consisting of kidney failure (kidney replacement therapy or a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min per 1·73 m 2), a sustained reduction in eGFR by at least 50% or the nearest equivalent, or death from kidney failure. The main cardiovascular outcome was MACE, consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024528864.

Findings

Of the 5140 records identified through the literature search, 11 trials, involving 85373 participants (29386 female, 55987 male), were included in the meta-analysis. In participants with type 2 diabetes (67769), GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the composite kidney outcome by 18% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·73–0·93; I² = 26·41%), kidney failure by 16% (HR 0·84, 0·72–0·99; I² = 0%), MACE by 13% (HR 0·87, 0·81–0·93; I² = 49·75%), and all-cause death by 12% (HR 0·88, 0·83–0·93; I² = 0%). The effect on the composite kidney outcome (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·72–0·92; I² = 23·11%), kidney failure (HR 0·84, 0·72–0·98; I² = 0%), MACE (HR 0·86, 0·80–0·92; I² = 48·9%), and all-cause death (HR 0·87, 0·82–0·91; I² = 0%) was similar when the SELECT trial was included, with no evidence of heterogeneity between this trial and those including participants with type 2 diabetes (p heterogeneity > 0·05). There was no difference in the risk of serious adverse events, including acute pancreatitis and severe hypoglycaemia, between the GLP-1 receptor agonist and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR] 0·95, 95% CI 0·90–1·01; I² = 88·5%). However, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more frequently in the GLP-1 receptor agonist groups (RR 1·51, 95% CI 1·18–1·94; I² = 96·3%).

Interpretation

We found evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce clinically important kidney events, kidney failure, and cardiovascular events.

Funding

None.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: a narrative review of the key evidence with practical considerations [^bd1300a6]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are incretin-mimetic agents that are effective adjuncts in the treatment of diabetes. This class of medications is also associated with promoting weight loss and a low risk of hypoglycemia, and some have been shown to be associated with a significant reduction of major cardiovascular events. Mounting evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs have benefits beyond reducing blood glucose that include improving kidney function in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a common microvascular complication of T2DM. Several large clinical studies, the majority of which are cardiovascular outcome trials, indicate that GLP-1 RA therapy is safe and tolerable for people living with T2DM and compromised renal function, and also suggest that GLP-1 RAs may have renoprotective properties. Although evidence from clinical trials has shown GLP-1 RAs to be safe and efficacious in people living with T2DM and renal impairment, their use is uncommon in this patient population. With continuing developments in the field of GLP-1 RA therapy, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits and practical use of GLP-1 RAs, as well as the clinical evidence, in order to achieve positive patient outcomes. Here, we review evidence on GLP-1 RA use in people living with T2DM and CKD and summarize renal outcomes from clinical studies. We provide practical considerations for GLP-1 RA use to provide an added benefit to guide treatment in this high-risk patient population.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^4b196523]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent introduction of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and a third-generation, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone, has greatly improved the treatment armamentarium for DKD. Some SGLT-2 inhibitors have been proven effective in reducing the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events. – Nevertheless, current treatment options remain sparse and of insufficient efficacy on preventing progression of CKD; people with DKD continue to experience declining kidney function, they often suffer from poor health-related quality of life, and some ultimately develop kidney failure and a need for kidney replacement therapy. Thus, additional efficacious and well-tolerated therapeutic strategies to prevent or manage DKD are still needed.

In this article, we review current evidence supporting the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) as kidney-protective agents in the management of T2D with CKD. GLP-1 RAs are efficacious and well-tolerated glucose-lowering agents regardless of kidney function. In addition, GLP-1 RAs have proven benefits on weight loss, and certain members of the drug class reduce cardiovascular risk. Because no dedicated kidney outcomes trial has yet been completed with GLP-1 RAs, none of the agents are currently indicated to improve kidney outcomes. However, one such outcomes trial is ongoing with the GLP-1 RA semaglutide (FLOW, Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03819153). At this time, the drug class is recommended as second-line therapy (after metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors) in current guidelines to improve glycaemic control and reduce cardiovascular risk in people with T2D and CKD.

The clearance of drug compounds often happens via the kidneys and may be lower when kidney function is impaired. In those cases, the blood concentration and half-life of the compound can be increased, resulting in an elevated risk of side effects. In persons with diabetes and impaired kidney function, many diabetes medications therefore need to be used with caution (e.g. at a reduced dose level) if at all. However, no reduction in dose is required for any of the GLP-1 RAs marketed today according to kidney function. Indeed, most of the agents can be used also in people with advanced CKD, while some are subject to restrictions due to lack of data.

In summary, safety and tolerability of the GLP-1 RAs have been thoroughly investigated in people with CKD and are well established.

Kidney-related efficacy results with GLP-1 RAs

As outlined above, there is a well-established strong association between DKD/CKD and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, including a markedly increased risk of heart failure (HF) and atherosclerotic CVD. Indeed, the cardiovascular prognosis following a diabetes diagnosis greatly worsens if the person also develops CKD. On the other hand, DKD may also precipitate or exacerbate CVD. In response to injuries or impaired function, the kidney may be involved in mechanisms that mediate aberrant vascular changes, which can essentially initiate a vicious circle leading to progressive loss of kidney function. Because of the strong association between CKD and CVD, clinical trials investigating the cardiovascular effects of GLP-1 RAs in populations enriched for high cardiovascular risk de facto also comprise many participants at high risk of kidney disease. Therefore, currently, the most robust evidence on the kidney-beneficial effects of GLP-1 RAs is data collected in the dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) completed for all GLP-1 RAs (Table 1 and Figure 2). Some of the CVOTs were in fact enriched for people with pre-existing kidney disease, and most have evaluated kidney outcomes as secondary or exploratory endpoints. Composite kidney outcomes have been used across the CVOTs, and even though the definitions and components of the composites have differed slightly, they are sufficiently alike to allow for comparisons across trials and for meta-analysis. Outcomes definitions are available in Figure 2. In general, analysis of data from these CVOTs has indicated that GLP-1 RAs may offer kidney-protective benefits (Figure 1). It is important, however, to be aware that kidney outcomes were evaluated as secondary endpoints and that the trials were not powered or otherwise specifically designed to confirm the effects of GLP-1 RAs on kidney-related clinical outcomes and on kidney function and kidney damage [usually evaluated using estimated GFR (eGFR) and albuminuria]. While albuminuria has been shown to be well correlated with clinical kidney outcomes, it remains a surrogate endpoint with the relatively lowest importance following the clinical outcomes and eGFR, including eGFR slope.

The KDIGO 2020 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management Chronic Kidney Disease recommend that people living with T2DM and CKD with eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 should receive metformin and SGLT2i (Fig. 2). For those who do not achieve glycemic targets with lifestyle therapy, metformin, and SGLT2i, or who cannot tolerate these agents, whether due to adverse events or because other restrictions apply, other medications are recommended. Of these, GLP-1 RAs are generally preferred because of their demonstrated cardiovascular benefits and potential for improved renal outcomes. In addition, GLP-1 RAs are particularly effective in reducing HbA1c, which is especially relevant as HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5% have been shown to be associated with increased incidence of microvascular complications while it is challenging to achieve HbA1c levels < 6.5% with other treatments without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^bfc7d683]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

Practical Use of GLP-1 RAs in People Living with CKD

In this section we provide general recommendations for GLP-1 RA use in people with CKD. The information for GLP-1 RA use for patients without CKD will also be included to enhance the context.

Current Treatment Guidelines for People Living with CKD

By nature, T2DM is a heterogenous and progressive disease for which a wide variety of treatment options exist and where treatment paradigms continue to evolve. Several international organizations have provided clinical practice guidelines to aid physicians in optimizing therapy for people living with CKD.

The general guidelines for management of T2DM that are provided by the ADA can aid physicians in navigating the overall treatment landscape. Pharmacologic intervention is usually initiated with a single oral agent, usually metformin, combined with lifestyle modifications. If HbA1c remains elevated, metformin treatment is followed by sequential addition of oral agents before intensification to injectables in a stepwise approach. Although the primary goal of diabetes management is to reduce glycemia and diabetes-related complications, special consideration needs to be taken in people living with compromised renal function. For example, metformin is regarded as contraindicated if eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia.

In 2020, the ADA provided a revision to the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes with updated guidelines recommending the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs to treat people living with T2DM and CKD independently of baseline A1C, individualized A1C target, or metformin use (summarized in Fig. 2). These revised changes take into consideration the latest trial findings on SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA and suggest that these medications are the preferred option for people when CKD predominates, independent of HbA1c. If CKD is the predominant condition, the recommendation is to start with an SGLT2i with evidence of reducing CKD progression, assuming eGFR is adequate. If SGLT2i is not tolerated or contraindicated, or if eGFR is less than adequate (< 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), then a GLP-1 RA is recommended.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains the main cause for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. Both CKD and ESKD lead to major increases in risk of cardiovascular disease and death in people with diabetes. Despite optimal management of lifestyle, glucose levels and hypertension, residual risk remains high, indicating that additional therapies to mitigate the burden of the disease are desired. In past decades, new treatment options for the management of diabetes have emerged, of which some have showed promising renoprotective potential. This review discusses current understanding of the renal effects of glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists and their potential use in prevention and treatment of DKD.

### Mechanisms and clinical applications of incretin therapies for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^4aafc001]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide. Development of DKD increases risks for cardiovascular events and death. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist have demonstrated improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in large-scale clinical trials.

Recent Finding

GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/glucose-depending insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists have robust glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of hypoglycemia even in advanced stages of DKD. Initially approved as antihyperglycemic therapies, these agents also reduce blood pressure and body weight. Cardiovascular outcome and glycemic lowering trials have reported decreased risks of development and progression of DKD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events for GLP-1 receptor agonists. Kidney and cardiovascular protection is mediated partly, but not entirely, by lowering of glycemia, body weight, and blood pressure. Experimental data have identified modulation of the innate immune response as a biologically plausible mechanism underpinning kidney and cardiovascular effects.

Summary

An influx of incretin-based therapies has changed the landscape of DKD treatment. GLP-1 receptor agonist use is endorsed by all major guideline forming organizations. Ongoing clinical trials and mechanistic studies with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists will further define the roles and pathways for these agents in the treatment of DKD.

### Combination therapy with kidney protective therapies: optimizing the benefits? [^7e5bb670]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent advances in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have led to the development of several new agents that are kidney protective, particularly in people with diabetes. These agents include sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). This review summarizes the available data regarding the effects of using these therapies in combination.

Recent Findings

There is convincing evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs individually improve kidney function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people with CKD, especially diabetic CKD. There is some evidence that GLP-1RAs may be beneficial, but further studies are needed. The available data support an additive kidney and cardiovascular benefit using combination therapy with SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs, and possibly with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, but more long-term data are needed. The currently available data suggest that combining these agents would likely be beneficial and may be an appropriate long-term strategy.

Summary

Several new agents are useful in slowing the progress of CKD. Further research to identify which combinations of agents work best together and which combinations are most effective for people with different characteristics, in order to personalize treatment and improve outcomes for people with CKD, should be a priority.

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^fb08e8eb]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes has not been systematically reviewed across baseline kidney function groups. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (RAs) in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We performed a PubMed/Medline search of randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs versus placebo in patients with and without diabetes from inception to January 2025. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, CKD progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The relative risk (RR) was estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Nine RCTs were included with a total of 75,088 patients, including 17,568 with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Use of an GLP-1 RA in patients with CKD was associated with a lower incidence of MACE (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95; P 0.006) and of CKD progression (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94; P 0.002), compared with placebo. There was no differential treatment effect of GLP-1 RA on these endpoints by CKD status at baseline.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs offer substantial cardiovascular and renal protection in patients with CKD. These findings support their use in CKD patients and confirms that these therapies may be continued as kidney function declines.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: a narrative review of the key evidence with practical considerations [^7b8f8c57]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The Lancet Commission on Diabetes recently performed a comprehensive analysis of available data on diabetes care to provide a summary of the best evidence for effectively managing diabetes. Of the key messages provided in their summary, the commission states that SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA therapies can reduce cardiovascular–renal diseases and all-cause death by up to 40% in people living with T2DM, independently of their effect on lowering blood glucose concentration.

Should a physician decide that a GLP-1 RA would benefit their patient, the next challenge is deciding upon which to prescribe as there are a variety of GLP-1 RAs with regulatory approval in U.S. and European markets, each with different profiles in relation to duration of action (short-acting vs. long-acting), indications (monotherapy and/or combined therapy), timing and ease of dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. The variation in profiles means that GLP-1 RAs can be used for treating most stages of CKD, although as described above, there is an exception for people with ESRD (< 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or on dialysis) that is dependent on the prescribing information set by regulators. According to the U.S. and European prescribing information, the majority of GLP-1 RAs can be used without dose adjustments in people with mild (eGFR 60–89 ml/min/1.73 m 2) or moderate (eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m 2) renal impairment. The use of exenatide and its analog, lixisenatide, both GLP-1RAs that cannot be metabolized in circulation and must be cleared renally, is more restricted depending on the CKD grade and prescribing information set by regulators. Currently, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and liraglutide are the only GLP-1 RAs recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) without any dose adjustment in people living with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2). Figure 5 summarizes the use of GLP-1 RAs in people with renal impairment that is based on either the FDA-approved U.S. prescribing information or the EMA-approved summary of product characteristics.

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

Treatment with GLP-1 RA in People Living with T2DM and CKD

The GLP-1 RA class of medications are incretin-mimetics that have been available from 2005, of which exenatide was the first to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since then, additional GLP-1 RAs have gained regulatory approval in both the USA and Europe. These medications have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in controlling glycemia through HbA1c reduction. The glucose-lowering effect is due to GLP-1 RA binding to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor in the pancreas where insulin secretion is promoted while glucagon secretion is suppressed. Additional benefits include improved metabolic control and weight loss by acting on the gut, where they slow gastric emptying, and the central nervous system, where they suppress appetite. Target tissues for GLP-1 are highlighted in Fig. 3 and include the heart and kidney. The GLP-1 RAs have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes, with liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide demonstrating a reduction of major cardiovascular events in people with established cardiovascular disease. Dulaglutide has also demonstrated reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people without established cardiovascular disease. These agents act on the kidneys, with clinical evidence suggesting they promote renal protection. Direct renal benefits include decreased glomerular atherosclerosis, inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system, stimulation of proximal tubule natriuresis, and reduced fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, while they indirectly reduce renal risk factors by reducing hypertension, decreasing weight, and improving glycemic control. The potential direct and indirect benefits mediated by GLP-1 RA are summarized in Fig. 4. For a more detailed overview on the potential mechanisms by which GLP-1 RA may exert these effects on the kidney, we refer readers to recent review articles. Importantly unlike many other glucose-lowering medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs do not have a relative contraindication in people with renal impairment.

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^4bdb532b]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these constraints, our meta-analysis has several unique strengths. It includes data from 17 568 patients with CKD across 9 trials with diverse inclusion criteria, representing a broad patient population. The absence of significant heterogeneity for major renal and cardiovascular outcomes and the consistency of results across various analyses further strengthen our findings.

An important aspect of our analysis is the consistency of the benefits observed across different patient populations. GLP-1 RAs demonstrated a consistent reduction in both cardiovascular and renal events independently of diabetes or CKD status. Moreover, the effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs did not vary based on the timing of patient inclusion in the studies. Whether patients were enrolled at earlier or later stages of CKD, the protective effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes remained. Future meta-analyses using patient-level data could provide a more granular understanding of how renal function impacts the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs. Such studies could incorporate standardized definitions for renal outcomes, such as the composite of 40% GFR decline, ESKD, or renal death, as primary endpoints, which would improve comparability. Moreover, future research should aim to include more ethnically diverse populations, especially those from underserved areas.

In conclusion, GLP-1 RAs offer substantial cardiovascular and renal protection, making them a valuable treatment option for patients with CKD. These findings support their use in CKD patients with eGFR as low as 60 ml/min/1.73 m², and confirms that these therapies may be continued as kidney function declines, until the need for renal replacement therapy arises.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist vs dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor use with mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease [^d91dbdfb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

However, randomized clinical trials have usually excluded or enrolled small numbers of patients with advanced-stage CKD or ESKD. Meanwhile, DPP-4 inhibitors are commonly prescribed to patients with advanced-stage CKD or ESKD owing to their safety profiles and effectiveness for glucose controldespite the neutral effect on the kidneys and cardiovascular outcomes. However, the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment with improved survival has been discussed less frequently for patients with advanced CKD or ESKD. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there have been no real-world studies comparing GLP-1 receptor agonists with DPP-4 inhibitors for treatment of patients with advanced-stage CKD or ESKD. In this study, we aimed to assess whether use of GLP-1 receptor agonists among patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 5 CKD or ESKD was associated with better outcomes compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists for nephroprotection and cardioprotection in patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. A consensus statement by the EURECA-M and the DIABESITY working groups of the ERA-EDTA [^64343f76]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major problem of public health. Currently, many of these patients experience progression of cardiovascular and renal disease, even when receiving optimal treatment. In previous years, several new drug classes for the treatment of type 2 DM have emerged, including inhibitors of renal sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Apart from reducing glycaemia, these classes were reported to have other beneficial effects for the cardiovascular and renal systems, such as weight loss and blood pressure reduction. Most importantly, in contrast to all previous studies with anti-diabetic agents, a series of recent randomized, placebo-controlled outcome trials showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are able to reduce cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, as well as progression of renal disease, in patients with type 2 DM. This document presents in detail the available evidence on the cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues, analyses the potential mechanisms involved in these actions and discusses their place in the treatment of patients with CKD and DM.

Mechanisms of action

Currently, the mechanisms of action underlying the potential kidney-protective benefits of GLP-1 RAs in DKD are not fully elucidated (Figure 1). It has been speculated that the beneficial effects on CKD risk factors, such as blood glucose, systolic blood pressure and body weight indirectly improve kidney function, and mediation analyses using data from the LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and REWIND CVOTs suggest that these effects partially, but only to a minor extent, explain the potential kidney benefits of GLP-1 RAs. Nevertheless, considering the importance of obesity/overweight in CKD, and that SGLT2 inhibitors only modestly reduce body weight, the weight-reducing benefit of GLP-1 RAs may arguably be of importance in the management of CKD. In AWARD-7, a clinical benefit on kidney function (attenuated eGFR decline) of dulaglutide was observed even though glycaemic equipoise was ensured using an active comparator (insulin glargine), indicating that the kidney benefit was not driven by improvements in glycaemic control.

Multiple direct actions have been suggested, including reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress and improved kidney oxygenation or perfusion; however, only a few smaller non-clinical and clinical studies have explored this. Furthermore, these studies have primarily focussed on the acute-phase response immediately after GLP-1 exposure in the setting of normal kidney function with or without diabetes.

While the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on oxidative stress have only been sparsely studied, accumulating evidence are available to suggest that GLP-1 RAs reduce systemic inflammation and that semaglutide specifically down-regulate the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes. – Additional studies are warranted to investigate whether the potential anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 receptor agonism may in fact play a role in the potential kidney-protective benefit of the GLP-1 RA drug class or certain of the specific compounds.

Changes in kidney haemodynamics induced by GLP-1 RAs might depend on baseline kidney function and these observations have not been consistent across studies. – In the acute phase, GLP-1 RA therapy has been shown to induce natriuresis, and the increased salt delivery in the distal nephron could reduce intraglomerular pressure via tubular glomerular feedback. Moreover, the compounds also suppress angiotensin II and renin, – thereby modulating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). The relevance of these findings is not fully established, however, and should be investigated in mechanistic clinical trials.

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^15caaa3a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis evaluates the effects of GLP-1 RA-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with or without CKD. In this report, we demonstrate that GLP-1 RAs reduce the absolute risk of MACE and renal outcomes regardless of CKD status. Importantly, these therapies maintain their protective effects even in patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. There is no significant interaction with renal function, and the benefits of GLP-1 RAs remain consistent irrespective of the timing of patient inclusion in the trials.

GLP-1 RAs are well-documented for their ability to lower glucose levels, induce modest weight loss, and reduce blood pressure. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that binds GLP-1 receptors, which are found in multiple organ systems, such as digestive, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Glucose-lowering effects are mediated by the stimulation of insulin release and the suppression of glucagon secretion, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Beyond their metabolic effects, GLP-1 RAs also modulate inflammation, an increasingly important factor in the pathophysiology of diabetes. GLP-1 receptor activation plays a protective role against oxidative injury, which is particularly relevant to its cardiovascular and kidney protective effects.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^52555d83]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) reduce kidney risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), prominently in those with chronic kidney disease. It is unclear whether these findings may apply to broader populations of patients with T2D treated in real-world settings and compared to active controls. We summarised real-world data of adverse kidney outcomes among patients with T2D initiating GLP-1 RA versus other glucose-lowering agents.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for observational cohort studies (April 2005-January 2025; PROSPERO CRD42023405356). Initiators of GLP-1 RA were compared to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sulfonylureas, or basal insulin. Outcomes included risks of albuminuria progression, ≥ 40 or ≥ 50% eGFR reduction from baseline, acute kidney injury (AKI), kidney-related hospitalizations, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), per data availability. We synthesised the data using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios (HR)s in random-effect models.

Results

Thirty-one studies were eligible, encompassing 1,601,389 patients (mean age 49–78 years, 5%-64% women), with 21, 6, 5, and 1 of them using SGLT2i, DPP4i, basal insulin, and sulfonylureas as a comparator, respectively. Compared with SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA initiators had higher risks for AKI (HR [95% CI] 1.12 [1.05–1.20]), kidney-related hospitalizations (1.66 [1.01–2.73]), and ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR (1.40 [1.27–1.53]), without evidence for differences in risks of ≥ 50% eGFR reduction or ESKD. Compared to DPP4i, GLP-1 RA initiators had lower risks for experiencing ≥ 50% eGFR reduction (0.84 [0.76–0.92]), kidney-related hospitalizations (0.73 [0.65–0.83]), and ESKD (0.70 [0.63–0.78]). Similar benefits were observed when comparing GLP-1 RA to sulfonylureas. Compared to basal insulin, GLP-1 RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of albuminuria progression (0.89 [0.80–0.99]), with inconsistent data regarding possible benefits in reducing ESKD risk.

Conclusions

In patients with T2D, initiation of GLP-1 RA in real-world settings may be associated with improved kidney outcomes compared to DPP4i, sulfonylureas, and basal insulin, and worse kidney outcomes compared to SGLT2i.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^ba257863]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dual agonists activating the GLP-1 receptor and the receptor of the other major hormone of the incretin system, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), are also in clinical development. Such and other combination therapies that integrate a GLP-1 RA and additional relevant compounds may hold additional potential. Results from the SURPASS programme for tirzepatide have shown that this dulaglutide-based GLP-1/GIP dual agonist provide profound glycaemic and weight-related benefits, which may translate into corresponding kidney-protection. Furthermore, the combination of the once-weekly GLP-1 RA semaglutide and the amylin analogue, cagrilintide, has displayed similar promising efficacy results on body weight that seem to go beyond what is achievable with semaglutide alone. Amylin clearance predominantly happens via the renal route, suggesting the effects of amylin, whether beneficial or risk-associated, could be more pronounced in people with CKD.

The current KDIGO guideline recommends blockade of the RAAS and SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with DKD. In addition, the American Diabetes Association now recommends finerenone in case of SGLT-2 inhibitor intolerance or inadequacy. Further expanding the treatment options for people with DKD, GLP-1 RA treatment may provide additional benefits (Figure 1), including body weight reduction. Recent evidence supports the safe combined use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAsand that the benefits of finerenone are independent of GLP-1 RA treatment in people with DKD. Thus, combined appropriate use of these three drug classes may offer added or even synergistic benefits to people with DKD.

In conclusion, data from clinical trials and real-world evidence suggest a potential kidney-protective effect of GLP-1 RAs in DKD as reflected by the prioritisation of the drug class in current treatment guidelines. Confirmatory and mechanistic trials are ongoing, which will provide additional insights, potentially allowing for the approved use of GLP-1 RAs to address the profound current unmet medical need for kidney protection in diabetes, alone or in combination with other treatment options.

### Efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors with and without glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists: a SMART-C collaborative meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^d72386df]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists both improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. We sought to evaluate whether the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are consistent in patients receiving and not receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Methods

We conducted a collaborative meta-analysis of trials included in the SGLT2 Inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium, restricted to participants with diabetes. Treatment effects from individual trials were obtained from Cox regression models and pooled using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. The two main cardiovascular outcomes assessed included major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death), and hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death. The main kidney outcomes assessed were chronic kidney disease progression (≥ 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], kidney failure [eGFR < 15 mL/min/1·73 m 2, chronic dialysis, or kidney transplantation], or death due to kidney failure), and the rate of change in eGFR over time. Safety outcomes were also assessed.

Findings

Across 12 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 3065 (4·2%) of 73238 participants with diabetes were using GLP-1 receptor agonists at baseline. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in participants both receiving and not receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists (hazard ratio [HR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·63–1·03 vs 0·90, 0·86–0·94; p-heterogeneity = 0·31). Effects on hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death (0·76, 0·57–1·01 vs 0·78, 0·74–0·82; p-heterogeneity = 0·90) and chronic kidney disease progression (0·65, 0·46–0·94 vs 0·67, 0·62–0·72; p-heterogeneity = 0·81) were also consistent regardless of GLP-1 receptor agonist use, as was the effect on the chronic rate of change in eGFR over time (heterogeneity = 0·92). Fewer serious adverse events occurred with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo, irrespective of GLP-1 receptor agonist use (relative risk 0·87, 95% CI 0·79–0·96 vs 0·91, 0·89–0·93; p-heterogeneity = 0·41).

Interpretation

The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes are consistent regardless of the background use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. These findings suggest independent effects of these evidence-based therapies and support clinical practice guidelines recommending the use of these agents in combination to improve cardiovascular and kidney metabolic outcomes.

Safety and tolerability of GLP-1 RAs in people with CKD

The safety and tolerability of GLP-1 RAs are well established based on the clinical development programmes as well as extensive post-marketing experience.– In general, the drug class is associated with gastrointestinal side effects, primarily nausea, which are transient, related to treatment initiation and dose escalation, and mild to moderate in the majority of cases. To improve tolerability, gastrointestinal side effects are mitigated using a dose-escalation regimen. Gastrointestinal events, which can also include vomiting, may in rare cases lead to dehydration and, especially in people with pre-existing CKD, dehydration can lead to acute kidney injury. This is reflected in the prescribing information for GLP-1 RAs. However, analysis of data for semaglutide pooled from seven of the trials from the clinical development programme (SUSTAIN) did not find an increased risk of acute kidney injury with this GLP-1 RA; similar findings were also apparent for liraglutide in the data from LEADER.

Data from the CVOTs discussed in this review have corroborated the safety and tolerability of the use of GLP-1 RA in people with T2D and CKD. In LEADER, there was no difference in the overall occurrence of adverse events in the liraglutide versus placebo group according to the presence or absence of albuminuria, and same trend was observed based on eGFR.

Because GLP-1 RAs function in a blood glucose-dependent manner, the risk of severe hypoglycaemic episodes is lowand primarily observed if treatment is combined with insulins or SUs. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia was found to be lower with liraglutide compared with placebo for people with reduced eGFR or albuminuria in LEADER (HRs = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.43–0.91 and 0.57, 95% CI = 0.40–0.82, respectively).

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^a7a96a95]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Aims

Randomized placebo‐controlled clinical trials showed that glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RA) reduce kidney risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), prominently in those with chronic kidney disease. It is unclear whether these findings may apply to broader populations of patients with T2D treated in real‐world settings and compared to active controls. We summarised real‐world data of adverse kidney outcomes among patients with T2D initiating GLP‐1 RA versus other glucose‐lowering agents.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for observational cohort studies (April 2005–January 2025; PROSPERO CRD42023405356). Initiators of GLP‐1 RA were compared to sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl‐peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sulfonylureas, or basal insulin. Outcomes included risks of albuminuria progression, ≥ 40 or ≥ 50% eGFR reduction from baseline, acute kidney injury (AKI), kidney‐related hospitalizations, and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), per data availability. We synthesised the data using inverse variance‐weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios (HR)s in random‐effect models.

Results

Thirty‐one studies were eligible, encompassing 1,601,389 patients (mean age 49–78 years, 5%–64% women), with 21, 6, 5, and 1 of them using SGLT2i, DPP4i, basal insulin, and sulfonylureas as a comparator, respectively. Compared with SGLT2i, GLP‐1 RA initiators had higher risks for AKI (HR [95% CI] 1.12 [1.05–1.20]), kidney‐related hospitalizations (1.66 [1.01–2.73]), and ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR (1.40 [1.27–1.53]), without evidence for differences in risks of ≥ 50% eGFR reduction or ESKD. Compared to DPP4i, GLP‐1 RA initiators had lower risks for experiencing ≥ 50% eGFR reduction (0.84 [0.76–0.92]), kidney‐related hospitalizations (0.73 [0.65–0.83]), and ESKD (0.70 [0.63–0.78]). Similar benefits were observed when comparing GLP‐1 RA to sulfonylureas. Compared to basal insulin, GLP‐1 RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of albuminuria progression (0.89 [0.80–0.99]), with inconsistent data regarding possible benefits in reducing ESKD risk.

Conclusions

In patients with T2D, initiation of GLP‐1 RA in real‐world settings may be associated with improved kidney outcomes compared to DPP4i, sulfonylureas, and basal insulin, and worse kidney outcomes compared to SGLT2i.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Evidence has emerged of the potential kidney-protective effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
To date, data have mostly been derived from cardiovascular (CV) outcome or glycaemic control trials featuring populations not selected for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or with kidney disease events as secondary outcomes.
Reduction of CKD progression by GLP-1RAs is yet to be confirmed and requires dedicated trials of kidney outcomes with GLP-1RAs.

What this study adds?

FLOW (NCT03819153) is a dedicated kidney outcomes trial to assess semaglutide, a once-weekly GLP-1RA, in a population with CKD and T2D at high risk of kidney disease progression.
The trial is designed to assess whether treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide delays the progression of kidney disease and lowers the risk of kidney failure, as well as kidney and CV disease mortality, compared with placebo in people with CKD and T2D.
Baseline data from the FLOW trial, which is ongoing, show that enrolled participants are nearly all classified as high or very high risk for CKD progression according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines categorisation, which assesses risk based on estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin:creatinine ratio.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

The FLOW trial will provide evidence on the effects of semaglutide on kidney outcomes, potentially expanding treatment options for patients with T2D to slow the progression of CKD and reduce kidney failure.

### Influence of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal parameters: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^83e1a26d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes has become widespread, with approximately 463 million people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) over recent years. By 2045, diabetes will affect at least 700 million people. Approximately 25–30% of patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes is currently the primary cause of end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy. Patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) often have high rates of cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, infections, and mortality.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the most commonly used drugs for treating diabetes. Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that clinical chronic renal events can be decreased by intensive glucose control, blood pressure decline, and the renin-angioten-sin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonized by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Even with recommended RAAS blockers, patients with DKD are at a substantial risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A previous study has reported that, the use of medications such as GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i delays or minimizes microvascular and macrovascular damage.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists — metabolic effects, kidney outcome mediation, tolerability, and implementation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are summarized as follows: These agents reduce blood pressure (BP) by approximately 3–4 mm Hg and produce a mean weight reduction of approximately 3 kg, and in mediation analyses lower glycemia, BP, and weight only modestly mediated (10%-25%) kidney outcomes including a decline in eGFR to < 45 mL/min/ 1.73 m^2. Gastrointestinal side effects are the most common dose-limiting side effect; starting at the lowest dose and titrating judiciously to achieve tolerability is prudent with counseling on eating behaviors to minimize intolerance. Use remains limited: 6.8% of patients with diabetes and CKD were prescribed a GLP1 receptor agonist in 2019–2020, persistent use for at least 90 days was 6.3%, and initiation was reported in 17% of commercially insured patients in 2020. CKM guidance from the AHA recommends GLP1 receptor agonists for patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity to reduce atherosclerotic CVD risk, weight, and glycemia, and liraglutide should be the first GLP1 receptor agonist to obtain generic status, possibly in 2024.

### Outcomes in new user cohorts of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^41715cb7]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this multinational, multidatabase study of patients with CKD and T2D, IRs of clinical outcomes were described in users of SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA — antidiabetic medications with cardiorenal protective effects — using data from 2012 to 2019 before these effects were widely recognized or the medications were approved for these indications. The study was not designed to compare medication effects across the two cohorts, and it was noted that across all data sources and at baseline, new users of GLP-1 RA had a different baseline clinical profile from that of new users of SGLT2i. Understanding the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes and kidney failure in patients receiving antidiabetic medications with cardiorenal protective effects is a first step in designing future studies to compare the incidence of these outcomes related to new and existing treatments for CKD.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors in advanced chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease: real world effectiveness and persistence of therapy [^58b515af]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) reduce cardiovascular events, improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and slow progression of nephropathy. Despite these benefits and professional society treatment guidelines recommendations, GLP-1RAs remain under-utilized in people with advanced CKD and ESKD due to tolerability and safety concerns.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing clinical outcomes and medication use details after initiating GLP-1RA or dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) in people with T2D and advanced CKD or ESKD. Eligible patients were identified via electronic health record query with extraction of baseline demographics, vital signs, and laboratory values. A manual chart review was undertaken to confirm eligibility, medication use, and extract a detailed account of all side effects.

Results

A total of 236 eligible patients (149 in the GLP-1RA group and 87 in the DPP-4i group) were identified. The average duration of treatment was 1036 (± 909.9) and 1109 (± 1090.9) days for GLP-1RA and DPP-4i, respectively. The average percentage weight loss from baseline to 36 months of treatment in the GLP-1RA group was -9.6% (95% CI, -11.3 to -7.8) versus -2.4% (95% CI, -5.4 to 0.5) in the DPP-4i group (estimated treatment difference (ETD) -7.1 (95% CI, -10.6 to -3.7) percentage-points, p < 0.001). The change in HbA1c from baseline to 36 months of treatment was significantly greater in the GLP-1RA (-1.0%) compared with the DPP-4i group (0.2%) (ETD -1.2 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.3) percentage-points, p = 0.04).

Conclusion

In patients with T2D and advanced CKD or ESKD, treatment with GLP-1RAs in a real-world setting had long treatment persistence, and compared to DPP-4is, was associated with greater weight loss and glycemic improvement.

Hypoglycemia

Despite having a pronounced anti-hyperglycemic effect, GLP-1 RAs are not typically associated with hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. Caution is advised, with dose reduction recommended in some cases, when they are combined with a sulphonylurea or insulin as the risk of hypoglycemia is higher. In clinical trials examining GLP-1 RA in combination with a sulphonylurea (with or without metformin) or insulin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was low overall, but increased when compared with placebo. When GLP-1 RAs are not used concomitantly with a sulphonylurea or insulin, routine glucose monitoring is unnecessary due to the low risk of developing hypoglycemia.

### Progress in the management of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^c60e82f7]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease in the world. Risk factor modification, glucose control, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade have remained the standard of care for 2 decades. New therapeutic agents have emerged in recent years, demonstrating kidney and cardiovascular benefits, and herein we review recent clinical trials on this topic.

Recent Findings

After the publication of several cardiovascular outcome trials for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), new trials have focused ON primary kidney-specific outcomes demonstrating safety and benefits among patients with proteinuric CKD; patients with or without diabetes, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) respectively. Similarly, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (ns-MRAs) and glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. Recently, clinical practice guidelines have also been updated to reflect this new evidence.

Summary

In summary, SGLT-2i, GLP-1 RAs, and ns-MRAs have demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney benefits, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbation among diverse patient population.

Guideline recommendations relating to combination therapy in CKD with T2D

Three treatment guidelines — Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (2022), American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2024), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) (2022) — provide recommendations that relate to drug combinations for specific clinical scenarios in the management of CKD associated with T2D (Fig. 3). The KDIGO also recently published their 2024 update to the Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD.

Fig. 3
Current practice guideline recommendations for combination therapies in patients with T2D at risk of CKD. KDIGO 2022, ADA 2024 Chap. 11, and AACE 2022 and KDIGO 2024 S/R = strong support/recommended by at least one of the practice guidelines; PP = Practice Point (by KDIGO, not a formal recommendation); NG = not graded AACE, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology; ADA, American Diabetes Association; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CV, cardiovascular; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes; ns-MRA, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; T2D, type 2 diabetes

Before discussing the specific combinations, the base therapy for the combinations, or first-line drug therapies, needs to be considered. The glucose-lowering agents metformin and SGLT2is are recommended by the KDIGO 2022 guidelines as first-line therapies in patients with T2D, and all three guidelines recommend a RAAS inhibitor, at the maximum tolerated dose, as a standard of care for patients with T2D and albuminuria.

SGLT2is are recommended if eGFR is ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to reduce progression of CKD and risk of CVD, with the KDIGO and ADA guidelines also adding that patients are to have a UACR ≥ 200 mg/g. Where the combination of metformin and SGLT2i is insufficient to control blood glucose or cannot be tolerated by patients, GLP-1 RAs are recommended; AACE guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs in patients with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for glycemic control and to reduce risk of atherosclerotic CV disease and progression of albuminuria. GLP-1 RAs are generally preferred after consideration of several factors when selecting additional drugs to manage glycemia, such as patient preferences, comorbidities, eGFR, and cost.

Dulaglutide: REWIND and AWARD-7

Most data on the renal effects of the GLP-1 RA dulaglutide originate from the REWIND CVOT in individuals with T2D and increased CV risk, as well as from the AWARD-7 randomised controlled trial comparing dulaglutide versus glargine for metabolic effect in people with T2D and advanced CKD. In REWIND, dulaglutide statistically significantly reduced the risk of a pre-defined kidney outcome by 15% versus placebo (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77–0.93) (Figure 2), driven mainly by the lower incidence of new-onset macroalbuminuria (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.68–0.87), whereas there were nominal but no statistically significant effects on the two other components [sustained decline in eGFR of at least 30% (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.78–1.01) and need for chronic kidney replacement therapy (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.39–1.44)]. A sensitivity analysis found a statistically significant relative risk reduction in terms of a sustained decline in eGFR of at least 50% (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.41–0.76). In AWARD-7, a secondary endpoint was the decline in eGFR, which was statistically significantly more subtle after 1 year in participants treated with dulaglutide (especially the highest dose tested, that is, 1.5 mg once weekly) compared with those treated with insulin glargine. Of note, the eGFR decline was in general more pronounced in AWARD-7 participants with pre-existing macroalbuminuria (urinary UACR > 300 mg/g).

Evidence from Clinical Trials

General Overview of Cardiovascular Outcome Trials

Currently, clinical trials that report kidney outcomes as the primary endpoint of GLP-1 RA therapy are lacking. The most reliable evidence for positive renal outcomes from GLP-1 RA use comes from cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs); however, these studies were not designed or powered for this specific purpose. These trials were conducted in response to guidelines mandated by the U.S. FDA in 2008 which suggested that sponsors evaluate new T2D therapies for cardiovascular risk. Since 2015, seven CVOTs have been completed that assess the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs, including ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide), EXSCEL (exenatide), HARMONY (albiglutide), REWIND (dulaglutide), and PIONEER-6 (oral semaglutide). Although only the CVOTs investigating liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide independently demonstrated a reduction in the three-component major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-3) score (consisting of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), a meta-analysis combining results demonstrated that GLP-1 RA treatment decreased MACE-3 by 12% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82–0.94), indicating improved cardiovascular outcomes in people living with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease.

### How to individualize renoprotective therapy in obese patients with chronic kidney disease: a commentary by the diabesity working group of the ERA [^b1fe9927]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The inter-related pandemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are fueling a rise in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which amplifies the risk of cardiovascular events and which may progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Treatment options for such patients have rapidly expanded over the past decade, and continue to evolve. Herein, we primarily focus on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and their role in the management of CKD in the setting of overweight/obesity and T2DM. Recommendations from the recent KDIGO CKD guidelines are summarised, and new evidence arising since publication of these guidelines is highlighted. We review clinical studies supporting the role of GLP-1RAs in patients with diabesity and CKD, including the FLOW trial, as well as exploring potential mechanisms of their nephroprotective effects. Their role in the management of patients with ESKD on maintenance dialysis and after kidney transplantation, while less evidence-based, is also discussed. The potential for other gut hormone-based therapies including GLP-1/GIP dual agonists (tirzepatide), triple agonists (incorporating glucagon agonism), and amylin analogues to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD is explored. We highlight the role of novel therapies distinct from the gut-kidney axis, including nsMRAs. We outline the potential for multi-target therapy incorporating RAASis, SGLT2is, incretin-based treatments and nsMRAs to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with overweight/obesity and T2DM. Current unknowns in the timing and sequence of multi-target therapy in patients with CKD are emphasised. Priority research questions for the future are highlighted throughout the review.

### The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^28bd7156]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

This review examines the available literature on the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is an important cause of end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy, and diabetic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). GLP-1RAs are proven to be safe in terms of CVD, and some of them have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The effect of GLP-1RAs on hard renal endpoints has yet to be established; to date, there have been no published GLP-1RA clinical trials with primary renal endpoints. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a renal protective role of GLP-1RAs, highlighting the secondary renal outcomes from recent cardiovascular outcome trials of this class of glucose-lowering therapies.

### Evidence-based treatment of hyperglycaemia with incretin therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease [^0c22aa9f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

For patients with T2D and advanced CKD, there is a need to better understand how to appropriately manage hyperglycaemia. The goal of treatment should be glycaemic control to targets based upon individual risk profiling as well as patient preferences and values. Treatment approaches should take into account the need to avoid hypoglycaemia, and to protect kidney function while reducing CVD risk. To date, there is a relative lack of data from clinical trials to inform choices of glucose‐lowering agents for this population. Although data are available for the use of incretin therapies, DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 RAs, in patients with T2D and advanced CKD, additional studies are needed to establish optimal strategies for glycaemic control. Until such data are available, treatment regimens with currently available glucose‐lowering agents can be individually tailored to meet the needs of these patients.

### Comparative analysis on renal and cardiovascular outcomes of antidiabetic treatment in chronic kidney disease patients – A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^def3d14f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication that increases the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and kidney failure. Recent therapies, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, show promise in improving outcomes. However, evidence of their comparative effectiveness in reducing CV and renal outcomes is scarce.

Materials and Methods

We searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2014 and 2024. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of antidiabetic drugs on cardiorenal outcomes. Primary outcomes were (1) major adverse CV events (MACE), (2) composite renal outcomes, (3) all-cause mortality. Other outcomes included heart failure (HF), stroke, macroalbuminuria, and a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 40% or renal replacement therapy.

Results

Twenty-six studies with 143296 participants with T2DM and CKD were included. SGLT2 inhibitors were highly effective in reducing the risk of renal outcomes such as composite events (P-score: 0.94), eGFR decline > 40% or renal replacement therapy (0.99) and CV outcomes such as MACE (0.93) and HF (1.00) followed by GLP-1 RA. While GLP-1 RA was particularly effective in reducing the risk of MI (0.87), macroalbuminuria (0.86) and stroke (0.83) compared to SGLT2 inhibitors. Both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are highly effective (0.83) in reducing all-cause mortality. DPP-4 inhibitors had limited benefits compared to SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RA.

Conclusion

SGLT2 inhibitors followed by GLP-1 RA provide strong benefits for CV and kidney health in patients with T2DM and CKD. SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrate superior benefit over GLP-1 receptor agonists for HF and renal outcomes, highlighting their preferred role in these clinical scenarios.

In AWARD-7, dulaglutide "experienced significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia (blood glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL) compared to insulin glargine," and "liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide do not require dosage adjustment for low eGFR." Transplant and dialysis considerations are that "Recommendations are the same for kidney transplant recipients as other CKD patients; however, experience in patients requiring dialysis is lacking, but pharmacokinetic studies showed no excess side effects across the entire range of kidney function, including dialysis." Weight effects are emphasized as "studies have shown a 5%-10% body weight loss with GLP-1 RAs in obese individuals," while "the lack of uniformity of cardiovascular benefits among the approved drugs in this class precludes concluding that the cardiovascular benefits are a class effect." Kidney outcome signals vary, as "Although the AWARD-7 trial of patients with stage 3 CKD treated with dulaglutide suggested that there was some preservation of eGFR, the subgroup with stage 3 CKD in the larger REWIND trial did not show a significant benefit on the sustained decline of eGFR of > 30%," and "The FLOW trial may help clarify the role of the injectable semaglutide on reduction of kidney disease progression as a primary outcome."

### GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2-is to lower glucose and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and diabetic kidney disease [^fb698ef2]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The landscape of diabetes management has changed, such that the goal of pharmacotherapy extends beyond glucose-lowering to prioritize risk reduction of cardiovascular disease and diabetic kidney disease. Two newer classes of medications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is), have become first line therapies for many patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications of type 2 diabetes. This review article will describe the mechanism of action, evidence for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, contraindications, adverse effects, and risk mitigation strategies for the GLP-1 RA and SGLT2-I drug classes. In addition, we will provide a practical approach for primary care clinicians to prescribe, adjust, and combine these medication classes, while considering patient preference, tolerability, comorbidities, cost, and availability.

Weight Loss

In addition to improving glycemic control, GLP-1 RAs demonstrate a benefit on body weight. This is an important treatment aspect, as weight reduction most likely plays an important role in the prevention and reduced progression of CKD, an association demonstrated in people with macroalbuminuria having undergone bariatric surgery. Data from an early meta-analysis of 18 trials provided evidence that in people living with T2DM, GLP-1 RAs promote a mean weight loss of 2.8 kg (− 3.4 to − 2.3 kg). Weight loss varies depending on the dose and type of medication, with differences observed in head-to-head studies. In SUSTAIN-7, a study comparing semaglutide to dulaglutide in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM, a greater reduction in body weight was observed with 0.5 mg semaglutide (4.6 kg, standard error [SE] 0.28) compared with 0.75 mg dulaglutide (2.3 kg, SE 0.27) (estimated treatment difference [ETD] − 2.26 kg, 95% CI − 3.02 to − 1.51; p < 0.0001) and with 1.0 mg semaglutide (6.5 kg, SE 0.28) compared with 1.5 mg dulaglutide (3.0 kg, SE 0.27) (ETD − 3.55 kg, 95% CI − 4.32 to − 2.78; p < 0.0001) at 40 weeks. Significant reductions in body weight are observed with 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide, doses which have been recently approved for people living with T2DM who are taking metformin but experiencing inadequate glycemic control. In the AWARD-11 trial, the efficacy and safety of 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg dulaglutide was evaluated at 36 and 52 weeks; the results also demonstrated that these doses led to significant reductions in body weight. Specifically, with 4.5 mg dulaglutide, the weight reduction was 5.0 kg at 52 weeks of treatment. Compared with the 1.5 mg dulaglutide group, body weight was significantly decreased in the 3.0 mg (ETD − 0.9, 95% CI − 1.4 to − 0.4 kg; p < 0.05 and 4.5 mg (ETD − 1.6, 95% CI − 2.1 to − 1.1 kg; p < 0.001) dulaglutide groups at 36 weeks.

### Can GLP-1 receptor agonists slow the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease? [^ba32b67f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Main text

The Gila monster's venom proved to be a critical breakthrough in the development of a transformative class of modern therapeutics: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These drugs have gained unprecedented attention not only for their glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) but also for their effectiveness as weight-loss agents, with outcomes even comparable to bariatric surgical interventions. GLP-1 RAs mimic the actions of the incretin hormone GLP-1, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon release, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety.

Accumulating evidence now suggests that the beneficial effects of GLP-1 RAs extend beyond glycemic and metabolic control to include cardiovascular risk reduction and nephroprotection. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the potential benefits of GLP-1 RAs in kidney disease, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Among these, the FLOW trial provided the strongest evidence. The trial showed that Semaglutide was associated with 24% reduction in major kidney disease events and a slower annual eGFR decline by 1.16 mL/min/1.73 m²/year compared to placebo in patients with DKD. Similarly, the AWARD-7 trial showed that DKD patients receiving dulaglutide exhibited slower eGFR decline compared to insulin-only group over 52 weeks. LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 trials found that liraglutide and Semaglutide, respectively, reduced cardiovascular events in high-risk T2D patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The trials also showed a significant reduction in new-onset macroalbuminuria with liraglutide and a reduction in new or worsening nephropathy with Semaglutide. These findings certainly puts GLP-1 RAs on the map as promising therapies for patients with DKD, offering dual benefits for both cardiovascular and kidney protection.

### Upcoming drug targets for kidney protective effects in chronic kidney disease [^ddbacb47]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a high risk of heart disease and end-stage kidney disease. This review describes how new medications, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASi), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), can lower heart-kidney risk in people with CKD. GLP1RA are already recommended for managing blood sugar in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes and have been shown to lower the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease. GLP1RA will likely soon be included in clinical guidelines, but further research is needed to understand how these medications protect the kidneys. ASi are another new medication that lower the protein found in urine. Larger trials are being done to see how well these medications work in slowing CKD. Lastly, both sGC agonists and ERAs have been shown to relax blood vessels to improve blood flow in the kidney, and reduce the amount of protein found in urine, both of which are critical to protecting kidneys. Larger clinical trials are being done to see if these medications prevent CKD from getting worse. In summary, this review describes the new and promising treatments for CKD. These therapies hold the potential to slow kidney disease and improve the wellbeing of patients. Further research of these new treatments is important for improving CKD care.

Abstract

Despite recent advancements in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), identifying novel therapies beyond guideline-directed therapies that reduce residual cardiorenal risk remains imperative. In this review, we highlight the clinical evidence supporting emerging therapies for CKD, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) and other incretin-based therapies, aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASI), endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) agonists and anti-inflammatory drugs. Long-acting GLP1RA are already recommended for glycemic control in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes and the large, dedicated kidney outcome trial FLOW was recently stopped early for efficacy. Emerging clinical trial evidence supports the concept that ASI also provide additional benefit on top of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which remain a cornerstone of CKD treatment. Next, we consider the use of sGC agonists, which target nitric oxide bioavailability and thereby reduce albuminuria. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential of ERA, which act through hemodynamic and anti-fibrotic mechanisms, thereby addressing a common final pathway in the development of CKD. Accordingly, our review highlights the changing therapeutic landscape for CKD with promising agents to further prevent the progression of kidney disease.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, increasing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension and death., Given that the prevalence of CKD in T2D is predicted to increase over the next 20 years, additional treatment strategies that offer kidney protection will be critical for this patient population. Therapeutic agents that showed CV and/or kidney benefits are approved for use in patients with T2D, including treatments from the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) class.CV outcomes trials, including LEADER, REWIND, SUSTAIN‐6 and AWARD‐7, have proven the CV benefits and reported a kidney protective effect of GLP‐1RAs, in addition to glucose and weight‐reducing effects. Notably, the LEADER trial included patients with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 80 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (~75% of patients had an eGFR of ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and showed a reduction in blood glucose and body weight with liraglutide that was independent of eGFR at baseline, with subgroup analyses suggesting the potential for greater benefit with respect to CV outcomes in patients with a lower eGFR.CV benefits were also observed with injectable semaglutide in the SUSTAIN‐6 trial in which > 70% of patients had normal kidney function or mild kidney impairment at baseline. Secondary outcomes and analyses from GLP‐1RA trials have suggested that these agents may also have kidney protective effects, but these observations need to be confirmed in dedicated trials with a primary kidney disease outcome, such as the ongoing FLOW trial of injectable semaglutide versus placebo., In patients with CKD and T2D, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines of 2020 recommends a GLP‐1RA with a proven CV benefit for those who have not achieved glycaemic targets following therapeutic management with metformin and a sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Clinical profile and treatment patterns in individuals with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who initiate a GLP-1 receptor agonist: a multinational cohort study [^23584c44]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Novel therapies are emerging for the prevention of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Within the FOUNTAIN platform (NCT05526157; EUPAS48148), this real-world study aimed to characterize cohorts of adults with CKD and T2D starting therapy with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in Europe, Japan, and the United States (US) during 2012–2021.

Methods

This multinational, multicohort study was conducted in five data sources: the Danish National Health Registers (DNHR) (Denmark), PHARMO Data Network (PHARMO) (The Netherlands), Valencia Health System Integrated Database (VID) (Spain), Japan Chronic Kidney Disease Database Extension (J-CKD-DB-Ex) (Japan), and Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database (CDM) (US). Eligible patients had T2D (defined by data source-specific algorithms) and CKD (based on diagnosis codes, estimated glomerular filtration rate values, and/or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) and initiated an GLP-1 RA during 2012–2021. Baseline demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were analyzed, and treatment patterns were described.

Results

Study cohorts included 18,929 GLP-1 RA initiators in DNHR; 476 in PHARMO; 11,798 in VID; 329 in J-CKD-DB-Ex; and 70,158 in CDM. Across cohorts, mean age ranged from 66.1 years in J-CKD-DB-Ex to 67.9 years in CDM, and between 46.6% (PHARMO) and 59.6% (J-CKD-DB-Ex) of patients were men. There was a steady increase in GLP-1 RA initiators from 2012 (when 1.6–4.8% of GLP-1 RA initiators started therapy) to 2019 (when 19.8–31.5% started therapy). The median duration of initial treatment with a GLP-1 RA ranged from 2.3 months (PHARMO) to 12.4 months (VID). At 1-year follow-up, between 52% (CDM) and 78% (DNHR) of patients were receiving treatment. Findings suggested that GLP-1 RA use was independent of CKD severity.

Conclusions

During 2012–2021, GLP-1 RA use steadily increased across multinational cohorts of patients with T2D and CKD, and persistence with treatment was high. GLP-1 use was independent of CKD severity.

PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a high risk of heart disease and end-stage kidney disease. This review describes how new medications, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASi), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), can lower heart–kidney risk in people with CKD.

KDOQI US commentary — introduction and scope of KDIGO 2024 CKD guideline: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 37 million people in the United States, with hypertension and diabetes mellitus the most common risk factors and many individuals unaware due to the condition's asymptomatic nature and low rates of albuminuria testing. The KDIGO 2024 CKD guidelines, last updated in 2012, outline areas spanning identification/evaluation, risk assessment, management of progression and systemic complications, medication management, and team-based/collaborative care models. Multiple high-quality clinical trials show several medication classes reduce kidney failure, kidney function decline, death due to kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease in adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus; drug classes include a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, and the commentary acknowledges novel agents such as sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^61f47a8d]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2024 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommended using GLP‐1 RA in patients with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualised glycaemic targets despite using metformin and SGLT2i or cannot use SGLT2i. Following the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of semaglutide observed in the FLOW trial, the 2025 guidelines noted that semaglutide can also be used as a first‐line agent for people with T2D and CKD. Relying on accumulating data that adding GLP‐1 RA to SGLT2i may offer additional kidney and cardiovascular benefits, several guidelines now recommend using both disease/diabetes‐modifying drugs (DMDs) together in many groups of patients with type 2 diabetes. No randomized controlled kidney outcome trial has directly compared kidney outcomes between GLP‐1 RA versus SGLT2i; thus, it is not clear which one is more beneficial, especially in low‐resource settings where patients may not have simultaneous access to both DMDs. This systematic review and meta‐analysis indicated that GLP‐1 RAs appeared to be associated with lower kidney risk compared to other glucose‐lowering agents but were inferior or not superior compared with SGLT2i. However, in addition to kidney protection, GLP‐1 RAs have additional benefits such as lowering blood glucose, body weight, blood pressure, and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The differential mechanisms of action, clinical benefits, and side effects of GLP1 RAs and SGLT2i, should be taken into consideration in the treatment choice to allow personalised tailoring of treatment.

This study has several limitations. A limited number of studies have reported kidney outcomes following initiation of GLP‐1 RA compared to a single class of GLAs in real‐world. We excluded studies that compared GLP‐1 RA against cohorts that combined several classes of GLAs due to the large heterogeneity in kidney outcomes among the GLAs' classes, as observed in our analysis. Real‐world data are limited by selection bias, as physicians aim to tailor treatment to patients' characteristics and preferences. Partially addressing these limitations, we included only studies that applied a statistical approach to balance the cohorts (e.g. inverse probability treatment weighting or propensity score), although no statistical method can completely emulate randomisation. Additional challenges in real‐world studies include variable duration of follow‐up, study populations, frequency of laboratory measurements, and baseline medications, among others.

The REWIND Trial (Once-Weekly Dulaglutide)

The Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial consisted of 9901 participants, of whom 31.5% had previous cardiovascular disease, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Predefined secondary outcomes showed that 1.5 mg once-weekly dulaglutide was associated with reduced composite renal outcomes, defined as the first occurrence of new macroalbuminuria, sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 30%, or chronic renal replacement therapy. A post-hoc analysis evaluated the effect of dulaglutide and placebo on renal outcomes related to kidney function, defined as the composite endpoint of sustained eGFR decline ≥ 40%, ESRD, or all-cause death. The incidence rate of the composite endpoint was determined to be significantly lower in participants treated with dulaglutide compared with placebo (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75–0.92, p < 0.001).

The PIONEER-6 Trial (once-daily semaglutide)

The Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment-6 (PIONEER-6) trial assessed CV safety of oral semaglutide in 3,183 participants of whom 856 had an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and 1051 had microalbuminuria or proteinuria. Renal or microvascular composite endpoints were not assessed; however, a CVOT of oral semaglutide is planned with renal outcomes as secondary endpoints (A Heart Disease Study of Semaglutide in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes [SOUL]).

Future studies are needed dedicated to understanding the primary kidney outcomes of GLP-1 RA use and to confirm the renoprotective benefits of this drug class.

The FLOW (A Research Study to See How Semaglutide Works Compared to Placebo in People With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease) trial will be the first study designed to specifically examine the effects of a GLP-1 RA on primary kidney outcomes. The trial is ongoing with results to be expected between 2024 and 2025. Challenges for conducting such trials include their expense, due to being both large and long-term, a high regulatory bar, and difficulty in enrolling enough participants in this particular population.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of the global diabetes burden and is the leading cause of kidney failure in developed countries. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 40% of people with T2D, and in comparison with T2D alone, comorbid CKD leads to three times greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) are recommended in patients with T2D, and guidelines were updated in 2020 to recommend GLP‐1RAs for patients with T2D and CV disease and/or high risk for CV events to reduce the risk of CV disease progression.GLP‐1RAs are also recommended for use in patients with CKD and T2D who have not achieved individualized glycaemic targets despite use of metformin and a sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Moreover, despite the use of guideline‐recommended therapies, some patients with CKD and T2D still experience CKD progression or kidney failure, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic options in this patient population. Previous CV outcome trials have indicated potential benefits with regard to kidney outcomes. Thus, GLP‐1RAs have been shown to reduce the risk of developing or worsening CKD mostly by reducing the development of overt albuminuria. Potential protective mechanisms of GLP‐1RAs include attenuation of oxidative stress, fibrosis, and cellular apoptosis in the kidney. In a pooled analysis of the SUSTAIN 6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long‐term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes) and LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) trials, semaglutide and liraglutide were suggested to have kidney‐protective effects in patients with T2D, which will need to be proven by the ongoing FLOW trial.

### Managing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in clinical practice [^7bee7148]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

The obesity epidemic has significantly heightened the impact of cardiometabolic risk factors on the global burden of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), originally developed for type 2 diabetes treatment, have demonstrated in randomised controlled trials their ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. This has led to substantial improvements in patient outcomes. SGLT2i, in particular, are the first class of drugs proven to improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and evidence is accumulating to suggest that also GLP-1RA might be beneficial in these patients. Remarkably, the benefits of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i are independent of type 2 diabetes status or baseline renal function. The critical role of these drug classes in managing high cardiovascular risk patients is increasingly acknowledged in guidelines, which now advocate their use across broader clinical phenotypes. This review compiles evidence supporting the use of these drugs in various clinical scenarios, highlighting their impact on outcomes and identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from their prescription. Guideline recommendations are summarised at the conclusion of each section. In the conclusion, we highlight how these drugs have changed our approach to cardiometabolic diseases and emphasise the potential advantages achievable by using their reciprocal combination and combinations with other drugs representing the foundation of the guidelines-directed medical therapy.

Background and Objectives

The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney benefits in the LEADER trial, particularly in participants with CKD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This post hoc analysis evaluated the safety of liraglutide treatment in patients with CKD in LEADER. Overall, 9340 patients were randomized to liraglutide or placebo, both in addition to standard of care. Of those, 2158 patients had CKD versus 7182 without CKD (defined as eGFR < 60 versus ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, respectively); 966 patients had macroalbuminuria and 2456 had microalbuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g and ≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g, respectively). At baseline, the mean eGFR in patients with CKD was 46 ± 11 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 versus 91 ± 22 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in those without CKD. Time to first event within event groups was analyzed using Cox regression with treatment group, baseline eGFR group, or baseline albuminuria group as fixed factors.

Results

Overall, serious adverse events were more frequently recorded in patients with CKD compared with those without CKD (59% versus 50%; interaction P = 0.11); however, they occurred to the same extent in those on liraglutide versus placebo. Similarly, no interaction of adverse events with randomized therapy was observed in patients with micro- or macro- versus normoalbuminuria (interaction P = 0.11). Risk of severe hypoglycemia was significantly reduced with liraglutide versus placebo in patients with CKD or with micro- or macroalbuminuria (hazard ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.91] and 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.82], respectively).

Conclusions

In LEADER, the use of liraglutide in those with CKD was safe, with no difference between patients with and without CKD.

### Kidney and cardiovascular-protective benefits of combination drug therapies in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes [^7cf9d0c5]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Combinations with GLP-1 RAs

Several clinical trials have shown significant CV benefits of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2D who were at high risk of CV events, with many of these individuals also taking a RAAS inhibitor at baseline. In many cases, this benefit of a GLP-1 RA was also seen in patients with or without kidney dysfunction at baseline. Key data from GLP-1 RAs trials are summarized in Table 2.

In T2D, GLP-1–stimulated insulin secretion is diminished, although this process may be restored with administration of a GLP-1 RA. GLP-1 RAs are also associated with gastric emptying and increased satiety, leading to weight loss. The importance of this mechanism is highlighted by recent research that suggests that weight loss at thresholds associated with normoglycemia and normotension may reduce CKD.

GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is exhibit different mechanisms that affect glucose metabolism; consequently, GLP-1 RAs are typically added to current antiglycemic treatments if there is ongoing hyperglycemia despite treatment and after taking patient factors into account. In some instances, SGLT2is may offer more cardiorenal protection than GLP-1 RAs alone, further indicating a need to combine these therapies to maximize the cardiorenal protection afforded to patients at risk. In a meta-analysis of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i clinical trials, the authors concluded that the prevention of heart failure and kidney disease progression by SGLT2is should be considered in the decision-making process when treating people with T2D; although SGLT2is may be preferred over GLP-1 RAs in select patients. Overall, combining an SGLT2i and a GLP-1 RA may provide a holistic approach to improving outcomes in patients with CKD and high CV risk.

The impact of the GLP-1 RA semaglutide (plus maximum tolerated RAAS inhibitor) on kidney and CV outcomes is being investigated in the ongoing phase 3 FLOW clinical trial in patients with T2D and CKD (NCT0381915) (Table 3). This trial was stopped in October 2023 at interim analysis due to meeting certain prespecified efficacy criteria (Novo Nordisk company announcement, October 10, 2023) (Table 3).
