## Question

Odansetrone dosage for adolescence

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ondansetron dosing for adolescents across different indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the adolescent age range and how it maps to pediatric versus adult labeling. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and doses for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatrics. Next, I will examine off-label uses in acute gastroenteritis and cyclic vomiting syndrome, including weight-based dosing and safety. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic considerations that might influence dose selection. Finally, I will synthesize practical, indication-specific dosing recommendations with caveats about hepatic impairment and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the adolescent definition and labeling context. Adolescents are generally 12 to 17 years old, and for ondansetron, the FDA pediatric labeling applies to patients 4 years and older, with adolescents falling under the 12 to 17-year dosing band for certain indications, so I should align recommendations with both pediatric and adult data where appropriate [^0eac2d42] [^1a2b9ed8].

> I will now examine the FDA-labeled indication for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatrics. For adolescents aged 12 to 17 years receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, the labeled regimen is 8 mg orally 30 minutes before chemotherapy, then 8 mg again 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg twice daily for 1 to 2 days after chemotherapy completion; this mirrors adult dosing and is supported by pediatric trials showing comparable efficacy to adults [^0eac2d42] [^24ab5079].

> Wait, let me verify the IV regimen for adolescents because it is often used in oncology settings. The pediatric IV dose for moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy is 0.15 mg/kg per dose for three doses, administered 30 minutes before chemotherapy and then at 4 and 8 hours; this weight-based approach is consistent with pediatric pharmacokinetics and is appropriate for adolescents as well, with typical adolescent weights yielding total daily doses within the adult range when using the same 0.15 mg/kg framework [^6c4d54e4] [^b91ef880].

> Next, I should review off-label use in acute gastroenteritis, where evidence supports ondansetron to facilitate oral rehydration. For adolescents with clinically significant vomiting from acute gastroenteritis, a single oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg is reasonable and evidence-based, with a typical maximum of 8 mg per dose; this aligns with pediatric emergency care data and guideline endorsements that allow consideration of ondansetron to improve oral rehydration success in children older than 4 years and adolescents [^50682c41] [^fbabdc94] [^51f34a76].

> Hold on, I should verify the bimodal-release data in adolescents. A randomized trial of a 24 mg bimodal-release ondansetron tablet in patients 12 years and older with acute gastroenteritis showed improved 24-hour treatment success versus placebo, supporting a single-dose strategy in selected adolescents; however, this formulation is investigational and not standard of care, so I should present it as an option with limited generalizability pending broader validation [^21b5fc71] [^5dd20086].

> Let me consider cyclic vomiting syndrome, where evidence is indirect and dosing is extrapolated. Expert consensus suggests ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg per dose every 4 to 6 hours orally, ODT, topical, or IV, with a usual maximum of 8 mg per dose; given the very low certainty of evidence, this remains a conditional recommendation, and clinicians should individualize based on response and comorbidities, including attention to QT risk and drug interactions [^25610953] [^e7a14394] [^fc942e1f].

> I need to ensure I address pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics that could influence dosing. In children older than about 4 months through adolescence, weight-based dosing normalizes exposure to adult levels because clearance and volume of distribution are similar to adults when normalized to body weight; however, CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers may have reduced ondansetron efficacy, so if antiemetic failure occurs, consider alternative agents rather than simply escalating the dose beyond 0.15 mg/kg [^a0f72e7e] [^f1eee50d].

> But wait, what if the adolescent has hepatic impairment. I should double-check the hepatic dosing cap. In severe hepatic impairment, the total daily dose should not exceed 8 mg regardless of indication, so for adolescents with Child-Pugh score 10 or higher, I must reduce the dose accordingly and avoid exceeding 8 mg in 24 hours [^0eac2d42] [^1e8d3cdf].

> Let me synthesize practical, indication-specific dosing for adolescents. For chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, use 8 mg orally 30 minutes before chemotherapy, 8 mg again 8 hours later, then 8 mg twice daily for 1 to 2 days, or use 0.15 mg/kg IV for three doses at 0, 4, and 8 hours relative to chemotherapy. For acute gastroenteritis, a single oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg with a maximum of 8 mg is reasonable to facilitate oral rehydration. For cyclic vomiting syndrome, 0.15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours with a maximum of 8 mg per dose is suggested, recognizing the low-certainty evidence base and the need to monitor for QT effects and drug interactions [^0eac2d42] [^6c4d54e4] [^50682c41] [^25610953].

> I should confirm safety monitoring points. Although ondansetron has a favorable safety profile, clinicians should screen for congenital long QT syndrome, concomitant QT-prolonging drugs, and electrolyte disturbances before use, and consider ECG monitoring in high-risk scenarios; these precautions are especially relevant in adolescents with cardiac risk factors or polypharmacy [^77ae5b3b] [^beb0b57a].

> In summary, adolescents aged 12 to 17 years generally follow adult-equivalent dosing for labeled indications and weight-based pediatric dosing for other contexts. The most defensible, evidence-aligned approach is 8 mg orally for CINV as labeled, 0.15 mg/kg orally or IV for acute gastroenteritis and CVS with attention to 8 mg per dose caps, and strict adherence to the 8 mg daily maximum in severe hepatic impairment, with pharmacogenomic and QT-risk considerations guiding therapy if response is suboptimal [^0eac2d42] [^50682c41] [^25610953] [^1e8d3cdf] [^f1eee50d].

Ondansetron dosing for adolescents depends on the indication and route of administration. For **chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting**, the FDA-labeled oral dose is 8 mg 30 minutes before chemotherapy, repeated 8 hours later, then 8 mg every 12 hours for 1–2 days [^0eac2d42]; the IV dose is 0.15 mg/kg every 4–8 hours, not to exceed 16 mg per dose [^6c4d54e4]. For **acute gastroenteritis**, a single oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg (max 8 mg) is recommended to facilitate oral rehydration [^50682c41] [^51f34a76]. For **postoperative nausea and vomiting**, 4 mg IV or IM is given at the end of surgery [^notfound]; oral dosing is not established in pediatrics. In severe hepatic impairment, do not exceed 8 mg/day [^0eac2d42] [^1e8d3cdf].

## Indications and recommended dosages

| **Indication** | **Route** | **Recommended dosage for adolescents (≥ 12 years)** |
|-|-|-|
| Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) | Oral | 8 mg administered 30 minutes before chemotherapy, repeated 8 hours after the first dose, then 8 mg every 12 hours for 1–2 days after completion of chemotherapy [^0eac2d42] |
| Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) | IV | 0.15 mg/kg per dose administered every 4–8 hours, not to exceed 16 mg per dose [^6c4d54e4] |
| Acute gastroenteritis (off-label) | Oral | 0.15 mg/kg once (maximum 8 mg) [^50682c41] [^51f34a76] |
| Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) | IV/IM | 4 mg administered at the end of surgery [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Hepatic impairment**: In severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 10), do not exceed a total daily dose of 8 mg [^0eac2d42] [^1e8d3cdf].
- **Renal impairment**: No dosage adjustment is required for renal impairment [^1e8d3cdf].
- **Safety monitoring**: Monitor for QT prolongation, especially in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or those receiving concomitant QT-prolonging medications [^77ae5b3b] [^beb0b57a].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

- **CINV**: Multiple pediatric trials demonstrate efficacy of ondansetron in preventing CINV, with dosing strategies mirroring adult regimens [^24ab5079] [^3b616546].
- **Acute gastroenteritis**: Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show that a single oral dose of ondansetron reduces vomiting, facilitates oral rehydration, and decreases the need for intravenous fluids and hospitalization in pediatric patients [^51f34a76] [^50682c41].
- **PONV**: Intravenous ondansetron is effective in preventing PONV in pediatric patients, though oral dosing is not established in this population [^3598d588].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **CINV**: 8 mg orally 30 minutes before chemotherapy, repeated 8 hours later, then 8 mg every 12 hours for 1–2 days; or 0.15 mg/kg IV every 4–8 hours, not exceeding 16 mg per dose [^0eac2d42] [^6c4d54e4].
- **Acute gastroenteritis**: 0.15 mg/kg orally once (maximum 8 mg) [^50682c41] [^51f34a76].
- **PONV**: 4 mg IV or IM at the end of surgery [^notfound].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Do not exceed 8 mg/day in severe hepatic impairment [^0eac2d42] [^1e8d3cdf].

---

Ondansetron is effective for adolescent nausea and vomiting when dosed by indication, with **weight-based dosing** for gastroenteritis and fixed dosing for CINV and PONV; monitor for QT effects and adjust in hepatic impairment.

### Bimodal release ondansetron for acute gastroenteritis among adolescents and adults: a randomized clinical trial [^204c0c42]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that ondansetron is beneficial to treat vomiting in the adult and adolescent acute care population and the first to specifically evaluate acute gastroenteritis. Treatment with an oral agent has the advantage of avoiding intravenous drug administration and fluid replacement. A bimodal release antiemetic tablet has the dual benefit of rapid onset of efficacy and prolonged duration of activity compared with currently available oral preparations. The sustained therapeutic action of bimodal release ondansetron contrasts with shorter acting preparations whose effect may wear off before another dose is taken, risking early recurrence of nausea or vomiting.

Compared with shorter acting preparations, time-release formulations have the advantages of dosing convenience, less fluctuation in blood levels, and better health outcomes across a number of disease states. Although not studied in gastroenteritis to our knowledge, simplification of dosing regimens and reduction in tablet burden with a once daily administration has been shown to improve adherence compared with conventional formulations with short half-lives that must be given 3 or more times per day. Among the potential disadvantages of a longer acting preparation is the reduced potential for dosage adjustment. In our study, metoclopramide was given to those who failed study treatment, and additional study would be needed to determine optimal rescue strategies for those who do not respond to bimodal release ondansetron.

### Update on nonantibiotic therapies for acute gastroenteritis [^50682c41]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to provide an update of nonantibiotic therapies for acute gastroenteritis (AGE), focusing on antiemetics and probiotics.

Recent Findings

The mainstay of therapy for nonsevere AGE remains oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Recent randomized controlled trials and metaanalyses have further strengthened the evidence-base supporting single-dose ondansetron administration in emergency departments to facilitate ORT based on evidence that it safely reduces intravenous fluid administration and hospitalization rates. Intravenous ondansetron administration and multiple-dose use should be avoided. A bimodal release ondansetron formulation was shown to improve outcomes in adolescents and adults with AGE in one study, but further evidence is required to support use. Recent large trials evaluating probiotic administration demonstrated a lack of benefit and guidelines that recommend their use should reevaluate their positions in light of this evidence. Furthermore, caution should be exercised when use is considered in high-risk populations and settings.

Summary

The benefits, dosing/route, and target populations most likely to benefit from ondansetron have been further clarified. Optimization of the real-life effectiveness of this therapy will require implementation strategies. Recent high-quality evidence showing a lack of efficacy and potential harm associated with probiotic use suggests that routine use for AGE should be discouraged.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride and dextrose [^6c4d54e4]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting:

Adult Dosing:

The recommended I.V. dosage of ondansetron injection for adults is a single 32-mg dose or three 0.15-mg/kg doses. A single 32-mg dose is infused over 15 minutes beginning 30 minutes before the start of emetogenic chemotherapy. The recommended infusion rate should not be exceeded (see OVERDOSAGE). With the three-dose (0.15-mg/kg) regimen, the first dose is infused over 15 minutes beginning 30 minutes before the start of emetogenic chemotherapy. Subsequent doses (0.15 mg/kg) are administered 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron injection.

Ondansetron injection should not be mixed with solutions for which physical and chemical compatibility has not been established. In particular, this applies to alkaline solutions as a precipitate may form.

Flexible Plastic Container: REQUIRES NO DILUTION. Ondansetron in 5% Dextrose Injection, 32 mg in 50 mL.

Pediatric Dosing:

On the basis of the available information (see CLINICAL TRIALS: Pediatric Studies and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics), the dosage in pediatric cancer patients 4 to 18 years of age should be three 0.15-mg/kg doses. The first dose is to be administered 30 minutes before the start of moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy, subsequent doses (0.15 mg/kg) are administered 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of Ondansetron in 5% Dextrose Injection. The drug should be infused intravenously over 15 minutes. Little information is available about dosage in pediatric cancer patients younger than 6 months of age.

Dosing information for pediatric cancer patients 6 months to 48 months of age is approved for GlaxoSmithKline Corporation's ondansetron injection. However, due to GlaxoSmithKline's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled for use in this subpopulation of pediatric patients.

Flexible Plastic Container: REQUIRES NO DILUTION. Ondansetron in 5% Dextrose Injection, 32 mg in 50 mL.

Geriatric Dosing:

The dosage recommendation is the same as for the general population.

Dosage Adjustment for Patients With Impaired Renal Function:

The dosage recommendation is the same as for the general population. There is no experience beyond first-day administration of ondansetron.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^861d47dc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The European Academy of Pediatrics and the European society for Developmental Perinatal and Pediatric Pharmacology recommends in a recent joint position statementthat off‐label prescribing for children is considered to be rational and clinically appropriate if the benefits outweigh the risks. However, specific guidance on how to assess the benefits and risks of off‐label use is lacking. The applicability of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodologyused in evidence based medicine to assess benefits and risks of an intervention is limited as the GRADE methodology does not sufficiently address important topics from regulatory science. Critical missing topics include appropriate dose selection, assessment of suitable drug formulation availability, and safety. Particular attention to dose selection is needed, as the age‐specific changes in pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) could significantly impact the dose required to reach the target exposure.

To overcome the inherent challenges of off‐label prescribing in children, we developed a practical framework for healthcare professionals and guideline working groups: Benefit and Risk Assessment for Off‐label use (BRAvO). This framework describes whether and how to perform a benefit‐risk analysis for off‐label pediatric prescribing, including dose selection to ultimately optimize drug efficacy and safety. In this tutorial we present the framework and demonstrate its practical application through an example: off‐label use of ondansetron for gastroenteritis‐induced nausea and vomiting.

### Ondansetron tablets (ondansetron) [^24ab5079]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

In a double-blind US, trial in 336 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing either methotrexate or doxorubicin, ondansetron tablets 8 mg administered twice a day, was as effective as ondansetron tablets 8 mg administered 3 times a day in preventing nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron Tablets 8 mg three times daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. See Table 8 for the details of the dosage regimens studied and results of this trial. Table 8: Emetic Episodes-Treatment Response after Ondansetron Tablets Administered Twice a Day and Three Times a Day

Re-treatment

In single-arm trials, 148 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy were re-treated with ondansetron tablets 8 mg three times daily during subsequent chemotherapy for a total of 396 re-treatment courses. No emetic episodes occurred in 314 (79%) of the re-treatment courses, and only 1 to 2 emetic episodes occurred in 43 (11%) of the re-treatment courses.

 Pediatric Trials

Three open-label, single-arm, non-US trials have been performed with 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens. The initial dose of ondansetron tablets injection ranged from 0.04 to 0.87 mg per kg (total dose of 2.16 mg to 12 mg) followed by the administration of oral doses of ondansetron tablets ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In these trials, 58% of the 170 evaluable patients had a complete response (no emetic episodes) on Day 1. In 2 trials, the response rates to ondansetron tablets 4 mg three times a day in patients younger than 12 years was similar to ondansetron tablets 8 mg three times daily in patients 12 to 18 years. Prevention of emesis in these pediatric patients was essentially the same as for adults.

Randomization and Study Procedures

A computer-generated allocation sequence was used for randomization, and a central call-in center directed stratification by age (< 18 vs ≥ 18 years). The study drug was administered in a 3:2 active to placebo ratio. The experimental drug or a like-appearing placebo tablet was sealed in a box identified only by an assigned study number. After obtaining consent, the on-site clinical investigator contacted the central randomization call-in center and was directed to use the numbered sealed box corresponding to the randomized allocation. No information regarding the contents of the numbered sealed box was provided to the study investigator.

The allocated study tablet was administered before any ED intervention. If the tablet was vomited within 15 minutes of administration, another tablet was given. If vomiting first occurred between 15 and 30 minutes after administration of the first tablet, another tablet was not given and the patient was permitted to continue the study.

Oral ingestion of fluids was encouraged during the ED stay to treat dehydration according to clinical status and the patient's ability to tolerate oral hydration. Additional testing, including imaging or laboratory tests, could be performed any time at the discretion of the treating clinician. Intravenous preparations of other medications, such as antibiotics, were permitted as long as the infusion volume was less than 100 mL. At 4 hours after study drug ingestion, the patient was assessed for discharge, although the duration of ED treatment could exceed 4 hours if needed. Patients who were ED treatment successes were discharged with 3 additional study tablets to take 1 every 24 hours as needed for up to 3 days.

Antipyretic, antidiarrheal, proton pump inhibitor, and antacid medications were permitted at any point during the study. For patients whose treatment failed, metoclopramide was the suggested default rescue medication. Ondansetron and any other 5-HT3 antagonist were not permitted for at least 24 hours after study drug administration.

At discharge, patients were given diary cards to record any episodes of vomiting, bowel movements, and severity of nausea, as well as other symptoms of gastroenteritis, adverse events, and any medications taken, whether for gastroenteritis or other indications. Patients were contacted daily by telephone to retrieve the relevant information.

Primary End Point Definition

The primary end point was treatment success, defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria from 30 minutes through 24 hours after the first dose of study medication: (1) without further vomiting, (2) without rescue medication for nausea or vomiting, and (3) no intravenous hydration.

THE RIGHT DOSE FOR ONDANSETRON

A pediatric dose has been established by the license for PONV and CINV. Extrapolation of efficacy and dose based on data in PONV and CINV is considered feasible. Nonetheless, as part of this tutorial, we illustrate the assessment of the dose for ondansetron.

Ondansetron is cleared by the liver, rather than by renal excretion. Oral availability is ~ 60%.

Adults

A phase I study in adults has shown that anti‐emetic efficacy was seen at all dose levels (0.04–0.48 mg/kg) with no significant differences in efficacy between dose levels. In addition, no dose limiting toxicity was observed. The number and intensity of adverse events, of which headache was the most common, appeared to increase at the 0.48 mg/kg dose level. Plasma concentrations for efficacy were not established.

Children

Table 2 shows the PK properties in different age groups Half‐life and volume of distribution are higher in infants of 1–4 months old compared with older children. These differences can be partly explained by a higher percentage of total body water in neonates and infants and hence a larger volume of distribution for water soluble drugs, such as ondansetron. In children 3–12 years old, clearance and volume of distribution are similar to those in adults when normalized for bodyweight. Weight‐based dosing thus compensates for age‐related changes and is effective in normalizing of systemic exposure in 3–12‐year‐old pediatric patients. The systemic exposure (area under the curve (AUC)) of ondansetron after oral or i.v. administration in children > 4 months old and adolescents is similar to the exposure in adults.

Table 2
PK properties of ondansetron in different age‐groups

Population PK study, n = 124 (745 samples) age 1 month–48 months

Ondansetron PK data from two pediatric studies were pooled. Simulations predicted the clearance of ondansetron to be reduced by 53% and 76% in pediatric patients aged 1 month and 3 months, which could result in exposure to ondansetron up to 65% greater in these patients compared with older children. A single dose of 0.1 mg/kg in children ≤ 6 months is predicted to result in exposure similar to a 0.15 mg/kg dose in older children. Authors recommend close monitoring of adverse effects of patients < 4 months receiving ondansetron.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^5c9839f0]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.

Completed placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in theses patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. Post-marketing experience includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced adverse events, some clinically serious, after use of subcutaneous sumatriptan and/or oral sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. A myocardial infarct has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in pediatric patients who might receive injectable, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan in patients aged younger than 18 years is not recommended.

Geriatric Use

The use of sumatriptan in elderly patients is not recommended because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function, they are at higher risk for CAD, and blood pressure increases may be more pronounced in the elderly (see WARNINGS).

For pediatric patients between 6 months and 1 year of age and/or 10 kg or less: Depending on the fluid needs of the patient, Ondansetron Injection may be diluted in 10 to 50 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection or 0. 9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Dosage and Administration The recommended dosage for adult and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older for prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy is 0. 15-mg/kg per dose for 3 doses.

Caution: Dilution of Ondansetron Injection is required in adult and pediatric patients prior to administration. 3 For pediatric patients prevention of nausea and vomiting was only studied in patients who had not received prophylactic ondansetron.
2. 3 Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, a single maximal daily dose of 8 mg infused over 15 minutes beginning 30 minutes before the start of the emetogenic chemotherapy is recommended. There is no experience beyond first-day administration of ondansetron in these patients. The clearance of ondansetron in pediatric patients aged 1 month to 4 months is slower and the half-life is ~2. 5-fold longer than patients who are aged > 4 to 24 months. As a precaution, it is recommended that patients younger than 4 months receiving this drug be closely monitored. Pediatric cases consistent with serotonin syndrome have been reported after inadvertent oral overdoses of ondansetron in young children. Reported symptoms included somnolence.

In a double-blind, U.S. trial in 336 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing either methotrexate or doxorubicin, ondansetron 8 mg administered twice a day, was as effective as ondansetron 8 mg administered 3 times a day in preventing nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron 8 mg three times daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. See Table 8 for the details of the dosage regimens studied and results of this trial.

Re-treatment

In single-arm trials, 148 patients receiving cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy were re-treated with ondansetron 8 mg three times daily during subsequent chemotherapy for a total of 396 re-treatment courses. No emetic episodes occurred in 314 (79%) of the re-treatment courses, and only 1 to 2 emetic episodes occurred in 43 (11%) of the re-treatment courses.

Pediatric Trials

Three open-label, single-arm, non-U.S. trials have been performed with 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens. The initial dose of ondansetron injection ranged from 0.04 to 0.87 mg per kg (total dose of 2.16 mg to 12 mg) followed by the administration of oral doses of ondansetron ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In these trials, 58% of the 170 evaluable patients had a complete response (no emetic episodes) on Day 1. In 2 trials, the response rates to ondansetron 4 mg three times a day in patients younger than 12 years was similar to ondansetron 8 mg three times daily in patients 12 to 18 years. Prevention of emesis in these pediatric patients was essentially the same as for adults.

### Safety of ondansetron loading doses in children with cancer [^4ef7de96]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

In highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the recommended dose of the serotonin-receptor antagonist ondansetron (5 mg/m² q8h) may be insufficient to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In adults, ondansetron-loading doses (OLD) of 32 mg are safe. We aimed to evaluate in children the safety of an OLD of 16 mg/m² (top, 24 mg) i.v., followed by two doses of 5 mg/m² q8h.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective single-center study included all pediatric oncology patients having received ≥ 1 OLD between 2002 and 2005. Adverse events (AE) definitely, probably, or possibly related to OLD were studied, excluding AE not or unlikely related to the OLD. Associations between potential predictors and at least moderate AE were analyzed by mixed logistic regression.

Results

Of 167 patients treated with chemotherapy, 37 (22%) received 543 OLD. The most common AE were hypotension, fatigue, injection site reaction, headache, hot flashes/flushes, and dizziness. At least mild AE were described in 139 OLD (26%), at least moderate AE in 23 (4.2%), and severe AE in 5 (0.9%; exact 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4–2.1). Life-threatening or lethal AE were not observed (0.0%; 0.0–0.6). At least moderate AE were significantly more frequent in female patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.5; 95% CI 1.4–8.8; p = 0.010), after erroneously given second OLD (17.0; 1.9–154; p = 0.012) and higher 24 h cumulative surface corrected dose (1.26 per mg/m²; 1.06–1.51; p = 0.009). OLD given to infants below 2 years were not associated with more frequent AE.

Conclusions

Ondansetron-loading doses of 16 mg/m² (top, 24 mg) i.v. seem to be safe in infants, children, and adolescents.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron tablets have been established in pediatric patients 4 years and older for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Use of ondansetron tablets in these age-groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of ondansetron tablets in adults with additional data from 3 open-label, uncontrolled, non-US trials in 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Additional information on the use of ondansetron in pediatric patients may be found in ondansetron injection prescribing information.

The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for:

prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.
prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy.
prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects enrolled in cancer chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting in US-and foreign-controlled clinical trials, for which there were subgroup analyses, 938 (19%) were aged 65 years and older.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years of age and older and younger subjects. A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life were seen in patients older than 75 years compared with younger subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There were an insufficient number of patients older than 75 years of age and older in the clinical trials to permit safety or efficacy conclusions in this age-group. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dosage adjustment is needed in elderly patients.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and the apparent volume of distribution is increased, resulting in a significant increase in the half-life of ondansetron. Therefore, do not exceed a total daily dose of 8 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^4d55a5de]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Appropriate dose based on PK studies

The appropriate dose for children ≥ 1–6 months is 0.1 mg/kg/dose, with a maximum of 8 mg/dose. For children ≥ 6 months, the 0.15 mg/kg/dose should be used.

Spahr Schopfer et al. conclude that a dose of 0.1 mg/kg in children 3–12 years old results in PK parameters of ondansetron predictable and similar to those in adults.

Dose in efficacy studies

Dose evaluated in meta‐analyses in children from 1 months to 18 years varied from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/dose orally or intravenously in single or repeated doses.

Dose response studies

Dose response has been evaluated in several pediatric studies in PONV concluding that low dose (< 0.1 mg/kg) and high dose (0.15–0.2 mg/kg) are equally effective. Treatment of nausea and vomiting involves different receptors. If ondansetron is not effective at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, a combination of anti‐emetic drugs should be used instead of increasing the dose of ondansetron.

Can the dose be simulated?

Dose simulations are performed by Mondick et al.

Conclusion on dose

Dose response studies in PONV show that lower doses (< 0.1 mg/kg) are equally effective as higher doses (0.15–0.2 mg/kg). Therefore, for children > 6 months, a 0.1 mg/kg/dose is recommended, with the option to repeat the dose up to 3 times daily.

PK parameters indicate that infants (≤ 6 months) need a lower daily dosage as clearance is lower in this age group. At the same time, as young infants have an increased volume of distribution (Vd), the initial dose should at least be similar to older children or even higher to attain the same maximum concentration (C max). Hence, for infants < 6 months, a 0.1 mg/kg/dose as an initial dose is recommended, with the option to repeat the dose up to 2 times daily, instead of 3 times daily.

Secondary Outcomes

In the per-protocol analysis, a total of 123 treatment successes (69.5%) were observed in the bimodal release ondansetron group compared with 67 treatment successes (54.9%) in the placebo group, and the absolute probability difference for treatment success was 14.6% (95% CI, 3.0%-25.8%). The proportion of treatment success was 27% higher for patients who received bimodal release ondansetron compared with those who received the placebo (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05–1.53; P = 0.01) (Table 2).

Fifteen patients required repeated dosing because of vomiting in the first 15 minutes after tablet ingestion, including 8 patients (4.2%) in the bimodal release ondansetron group and 7 patients (5.4%) in the placebo group. Among these, 3 patients in the bimodal release ondansetron group were treatment successes and 1 patient in the placebo group was a treatment success.

Patients for whom treatment did not fail were given 3 additional tablets on discharge and directed to take 1 as needed every 24 hours. Most patients did not take additional doses after leaving the ED or urgent care center, with 20 of 196 discharged patients (10.2%) taking all 3 additional doses over the subsequent 3 days. Four days after initial ED discharge, treatment was successful for 114 patients (59.4%) in the bimodal release ondansetron group and 67 patients (51.9%) in the placebo group (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93–1.40; P = 0.19). A total of 4 patients (2.1%) in the bimodal release ondansetron group and 4 patients (3.1%) in the placebo treatment group returned to the ED for gastrointestinal symptoms within 4 days of initial dosing.

### Bimodal release ondansetron for acute gastroenteritis among adolescents and adults: a randomized clinical trial [^06d4b7e7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute gastroenteritis is a common illness, with approximately 179 million episodes occurring in the United States each year, resulting in 600 000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths. Viruses are the most common identifiable cause, and disease occurs throughout the year, with outbreaks most frequent in the winter and spring. The disease is spread easily and clusters occur when people gather in close quarters or when food or water become contaminated with the virus.

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are typical symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, and other symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and malaise. Dehydration is an important contributor to the morbidity associated with gastroenteritis, and fluid repletion is a mainstay of treatment. The illness is usually self-limited, and for most individuals, nausea and vomiting are the rate-limiting factors for successful fluid replacement. Patients unable to tolerate oral hydration may need intravenous fluids in the emergency department (ED) or other acute care settings.

Medications commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting in the acute care setting include ondansetron, metoclopramide, and prochlorperazine. Several pediatric studies, most involving children younger than 12 years, have demonstrated a reduction in the need for intravenous hydration and immediate hospitalization using oral or intravenous ondansetron to treat gastroenteritis-related emesis. In contrast, a Cochrane reviewindicated a paucity of studies evaluating adults treated in the ED and concluded there was no evidence to support the superiority of any antiemetic drug, oral or intravenous, over placebo in treating nausea and vomiting. Vomiting is a common complaint in the ED, and even without evidence-based guidance, these drugs are routinely given to adolescents and adults for a range of conditions, including acute gastroenteritis. Ondansetron is the most widely used antiemetic in the acute care setting, with over 21.7 million uses annually and is second only to sodium chloride as the most commonly prescribed drug in EDs in the United States.

### Aprepitant for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial [^b0bd01c5]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, is recommended in combination with other anti-emetic agents for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy in adults, but its efficacy and safety in paediatric patients are unknown. We did this phase 3 trial to examine the safety and efficacy of such treatment in children.

Methods

In this final analysis of a phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-blind study, patients aged 6 months to 17 years with a documented malignancy who were scheduled to receive either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy were randomly assigned with an interactive voice response system to an age-based and weight-based blinded regimen of aprepitant (125 mg for ages 12–17 years; 3.0 mg/kg up to 125 mg for ages 6 months to < 12 years) plus ondansetron on day 1, followed by aprepitant (80 mg for ages 12–17 years; 2.0 mg/kg up to 80 mg for ages 6 months to < 12 years) on days 2 and 3, or placebo plus ondansetron on day 1 followed by placebo on days 2 and 3; addition of dexamethasone was allowed. Randomisation was stratified according to patient age, planned use of chemotherapy associated with very high risk of emetogenicity, and planned use of dexamethasone as an anti-emetic. Ondansetron was dosed per the product label for paediatric use or local standard of care. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication) during the 25–120 h (delayed phase) after initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy. Efficacy and safety analyses were done with all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01362530.

Findings

Between Sept 22, 2011, and Aug 16, 2013, 307 patients were randomly assigned at 49 sites in 24 countries to either the aprepitant group (155 patients) or to the control group (152 patients). Three patients in the aprepitant group and two in the control group did not receive study medication, and thus were excluded from analyses. 77 (51%) of 152 patients in the aprepitant group and 39 (26%) of 150 in the control group achieved a complete response in the delayed phase (p < 0.0001). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (23 [15%] of 152 in the aprepitant group vs 21 [14%] of 150 in the control group), anaemia (14 [9%] vs 26 [17%]), and decreased neutrophil count (11 [7%] vs 17 [11%]). The most common serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia (23 [15%] patients in the aprepitant group vs 22 [15%] in the control group).

Interpretation

Addition of aprepitant to ondansetron with or without dexamethasone is effective for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients being treated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

Limitations

This study had limitations, including the relatively few adolescent patients enrolled; therefore, the comparison of treatment response among age subgroups was not feasible. Furthermore, most of the pediatric patients were enrolled at 1 site, which limits generalizability of the age-related results. Another limitation was the lack of confirmatory testing of the diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis. Stool sample diagnostics may not detect any pathogens, and results would not have been immediately available in the ED setting at the time of enrollment. Additionally, almost all patients had what clinicians determined to be acute gastroenteritis. Our inclusion criteria mimicked actual practice; therefore, results should be generalizable to patients treated in the acute care setting with similar symptoms.

### Bimodal release ondansetron for acute gastroenteritis among adolescents and adults: a randomized clinical trial [^21b5fc71]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Vomiting resulting from acute gastroenteritis is commonly treated with intravenous antiemetics in acute care settings. If oral treatment were beneficial, patients might not need intravenous administered hydration or medication. Furthermore, a long-acting treatment could provide sustained relief from nausea and vomiting.

Objective

To determine whether an experimental long-acting bimodal release ondansetron tablet decreases gastroenteritis-related vomiting and eliminates the need for intravenous therapy for 24 hours after administration.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial included patients from 19 emergency departments and 2 urgent care centers in the United States from December 8, 2014, to February 17, 2017. Patients 12 years and older with at least 2 vomiting episodes from presumed gastroenteritis in the previous 4 hours and symptoms with less than 36 hours' duration were randomized using a 3:2 active to placebo ratio. Analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis and conducted from June 1, 2017, to November 1, 2017.

Intervention

Bimodal release ondansetron tablet containing 6 mg of immediate release ondansetron and 18 mg of a 24-hour release matrix for a total of 24 mg of ondansetron.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment success was defined as no further vomiting, no need for rescue medication, and no intravenous hydration for 24 hours after bimodal release ondansetron administration.

Results

Analysis included 321 patients (mean [SD] age, 29.0 [11.1] years; 195 [60.7%] women), with 192 patients in the bimodal release ondansetron group and 129 patients in the placebo group. Treatment successes were observed in 126 patients in the bimodal release ondansetron group (65.6%) compared with 70 patients in the placebo group (54.3%), with an 11.4% (95% CI, 0.3%-22.4%) absolute probability difference. The proportion of treatment success was 21% higher among patients who received bimodal release ondansetron compared with those who received a placebo (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00–1.46; P = 0.04). In an analysis including only patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and no major protocol violations, there were 123 treatment successes (69.5%) in the bimodal release ondansetron group compared with 67 treatment successes (54.9%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05–1.53; P = 0.01). Adverse effects were infrequent and similar to the known safety profile of ondansetron.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that a long-acting bimodal release oral ondansetron tablet was an effective antiemetic among adolescents and adults with moderate to severe vomiting from acute gastroenteritis. The drug benefits extended to 24 hours after administration. Bimodal release ondansetron may decrease the need for intravenous access and emergency department care to manage acute gastroenteritis.

Background

Paediatric AGE represents a significant healthcare burden, including 1.5 million office visits, 200 000 hospitalisations and 300 deaths annually in the USA. Mild to moderate dehydration is a common sequelae optimally addressed through oral rehydration therapy. Ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3-serotonin antagonist, is effective at improving the success of oral rehydration and can be a safe and effective component of AGE therapy. It decreases vomiting, the need for intravenous fluid resuscitation, and hospitalisations for AGE. It has an excellent safety profile, with no attributed mortality, and only rare dysrhythmias in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, with no clinical examples since the 32 mg intravenous dosage was discontinued. In paediatric emergency department trials, intravenous ondansetron did not cause QTc prolongation on serial ECGs taken up to 1-hour postadministration. Given the extreme rarity of significant adverse events, joint guidelines published by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases encourage prescribing a short course of the medication. Previous studies conducted in emergency departments show improved outcomes in line with our aims of ondansetron use. Retrospective studies in paediatric patients with AGE found a decrease in return visits and shorter length of visitassociated with increased ondansetron use. A recent meta-analysis further supports the use of ondansetron in paediatric AGE, reinforcing ondansetron's benefits of decreasing use of intravenous rehydration, duration of nausea/emesis, and need for hospitalisation. Rutman et al implemented a clinical pathway emphasising oral rehydration and ondansetron for paediatric AGE and showed sustained decrease in intravenous fluid use and length of emergency room stay. Additionally, an economic analysis estimated an annual savings of US$65 000 000 in the USA based on routine administration of oral ondansetron to eligible paediatric patients with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting or dehydration.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^3598d588]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric postoperative vomiting (POV) prophylaxis — risk-stratified recommendations and antiemetic options are described as follows: Major pediatric risk prediction models show minimal difference in predicted risk between zero and one risk factor, with reported values of 9% and 5% versus 10% and 6%, and there is a lack of robust evidence for prophylactic regimens with greater than two pharmacologic agents; for pediatric patients without risk factors, a single prophylactic agent (preferably ondansetron or dexamethasone) is recommended, and escalation to a two-agent regimen (typically combining ondansetron and dexamethasone) is advisable for one or two risk factors, whereas for three or more risk factors the current evidence does not conclusively favor routine addition of a third agent, with emphasis instead on modifying baseline risk factors such as eliminating nitrous oxide, using propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia, employing local and regional techniques, incorporating multimodal analgesia, and minimizing opioid use. For specific agents, evidence supporting the role of propofol as an antiemetic and risk mitigation strategy is outlined in the risk mitigation section. For 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, the effectiveness and safety, particularly of ondansetron (0.05 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg) in children, are well established (A1, table 3), and a study comparing ondansetron (0.2 mg/kg) to dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) in children receiving cochlear implants found significant PONV reduction without notable QTc changes, although caution is advised in patients with existing cardiac conduction issues.

Intravenous 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for acute cyclic vomiting syndrome — Recommendation 8 and supporting remarks indicate that the guideline panel suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects); the panel noted that ondansetron is readily available, familiar and widely used both in home and ED settings, is considered probably effective especially in those with lower-intensity attacks though part of its apparent efficacy may result from treatment bias or placebo effect, and decreasing nausea and vomiting may dampen anticipatory anxiety which can trigger recurrent CVS attacks and facilitate the maintenance of hydration and concomitant oral anti-migraine medication such as NSAIDs, triptans, and sedatives such as diphenhydramine; alternate formulations, including orally dissolving tablets and topical forms, were noted to be effective based on positive clinical experience by the expert panel, and early intervention with a topical formulation may provide relief of nausea and facilitate tolerance for subsequent oral abortive agents including aprepitant; background notes that ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with established antiemetic efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of pediatric CINV, and that oral ondansetron is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has lower bioavailability compared with the IV form.

Recommendation 8 — For acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes not responding to outpatient abortive therapies in children and adolescents, the guideline panel suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) with a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects. Ondansetron is readily available, familiar and widely used both in home and ED settings and is considered probably effective, especially in those patients with lower-intensity attacks; decreasing nausea and vomiting may dampen anticipatory anxiety that can trigger recurrent CVS attacks and may also facilitate the maintenance of hydration and concomitant anti-migraine medication such as NSAIDs, triptans, and sedatives such as diphenhydramine that may facilitate sleep. Alternate formulations, including orally dissolving tablets and topical forms, were noted to be effective based on positive clinical experience by the expert panel, and early intervention with a topical formulation may provide relief of nausea and facilitate tolerance for subsequent oral abortive agents including aprepitant. Background notes that ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with established antiemetic efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of pediatric CINV, and that oral ondansetron is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has lower bioavailability compared with the IV form.

### Antiemetic medication for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in childhood [^acd2beee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting remain a problem for children undergoing treatment for malignancies despite new antiemetic therapies. Optimising antiemetic regimens could improve quality of life by reducing nausea, vomiting, and associated clinical problems. This is an update of the original systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and adverse events of pharmacological interventions in controlling anticipatory, acute, and delayed nausea and vomiting in children and young people (aged less than 18 years) about to receive or receiving chemotherapy.

Search Methods

Searches included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, International Society of Paediatric Oncology, Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer, and ISI Science and Technology Proceedings Index from incept to December 16, 2014, and trial registries from their earliest records to December 2014. We examined references of systematic reviews and contacted trialists for information on further studies. We also screened the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently screened abstracts in order to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a pharmacological antiemetic, cannabinoid, or benzodiazepine with placebo or any alternative active intervention in children and young people (less than 18 years) with a diagnosis of cancer who were to receive chemotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted outcome and quality data from each RCT. When appropriate, we undertook meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included 34 studies that examined a range of different antiemetics, used different doses and comparators, and reported a variety of outcomes. The quality and quantity of included studies limited the exploration of heterogeneity to narrative approaches only. The majority of quantitative data related to the complete control of acute vomiting (27 studies). Adverse events were reported in 29 studies and nausea outcomes in 16 studies. Two studies assessed the addition of dexamethasone to 5-HT3 antagonists for complete control of vomiting (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 3.04). Three studies compared granisetron 20 mcg/kg with 40 mcg/kg for complete control of vomiting (pooled RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). Three studies compared granisetron with ondansetron for complete control of acute nausea (pooled RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; 2 studies), acute vomiting (pooled RR 2.26; 95% CI 2.04 to 2.51; 3 studies), delayed nausea (pooled RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38; 2 studies), and delayed vomiting (pooled RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.29; 2 studies). No other pooled analyses were possible. Narrative synthesis suggests that 5-HT3 antagonists are more effective than older antiemetic agents, even when these agents are combined with a steroid. Cannabinoids are probably effective but produce frequent side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Our overall knowledge of the most effective antiemetics to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in childhood is incomplete. Future research should be undertaken in consultation with children, young people, and families that have experienced chemotherapy and should make use of validated, age-appropriate measures. This review suggests that 5-HT3 antagonists are effective in patients who are to receive emetogenic chemotherapy, with granisetron or palonosetron possibly better than ondansetron. Adding dexamethasone improves control of vomiting, although the risk-benefit profile of adjunctive steroid remains uncertain.

Emetogenicity of chemotherapy is often categorised into 'low' causing a 10–30%, 'moderate' causing a 30–90%, and 'high' causing over a 90% incidence of emesis in the absence of prophylaxis. Recommended NK1 antagonists: aprepitant or fosaprepitant. Recommended 5HT3 receptor antagonists: palonosetron, ondansetron, granisetron, or tropisetron

* The use of olanzapine would be off-label as this medicine is not yet indicated for use in the treatment of CINV in children and young people

 recommends ondansetron and granisetron as 5HT3 receptor antagonists

Recommendations are informed by systematic reviews and evidence syntheses that have identified and combined evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) using either narrative synthesis or conventional meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis is a textual approach to analysing relationships within and between studies and therefore cannot provide a statistical summary of relative treatment effect when multiple studies assess the same treatments. Meta-analysis does produce statistical summary estimates for treatments that have been compared directly in clinical trials but combines evidence of the relative treatment effect (and associated uncertainty) of two interventions meaning not all treatments can be compared to every other. For antiemetic use within children undergoing chemotherapy, this means that the overall picture of which antiemetics are most effective remains incomplete, including knowledge of optimal dosing and scheduling of antiemetics. Formal comparison of antiemetic efficacy in children is even more lacking for less well-reported outcomes, such as nausea, despite this outcome being identified as being more distressing to patients.

Methods

Trial Design

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group RCT evaluating the safety and efficacy of bimodal release ondansetron. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are presented in Supplement 1. The study was approved by the investigational review board for each participating institution. Written informed consent was obtained from participants 18 years and older, and study participants aged 12 to 17 years required both consent from a parent or guardian and assent from the participant. This study is reported following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Setting and Participants

Individuals 12 years and older who presented to 1 of 19 EDs or 2 urgent care centers in the United States with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis were screened for eligibility from December 8, 2014, to February 17, 2017. Those with 2 or more episodes of vomiting in the 4 hours prior to arrival and with duration of vomiting less than 36 hours were eligible for enrollment. Among the exclusion criteria were pregnancy, having recently undergone an abdominal surgical procedure, any history of bariatric surgical procedures or bowel obstruction, unhealthy alcohol use or illicit drug use, an electrocardiographic corrected QT interval greater than 450 ms on ED arrival, concomitant use of any drug known to prolong the QT interval, evidence of severe dehydration, or having serious medical comorbidities, including heart failure or severe renal or liver disease, or a presumed diagnosis other than acute gastroenteritis. Individuals with type 2 diabetes could be enrolled if they were not using insulin and their bedside glucose level at the time of enrollment was less than 200 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the eAppendix in Supplement 2.

Patients described current nausea using a 5-point Likert numeric rating scale that included written cues, with 0 indicating none (ie, no nausea) and 4 indicating the most severe symptoms (ie, nausea as bad as it can be). Initially, only patients 50 years and older were required to have data on baseline complete blood count, biochemical profile, and urinalysis results. A protocol amendment early in the study required all patients 40 years and older and those of any age with diabetes to have data from these baseline assessments. After approximately half of the required patients were enrolled, the protocol was modified at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration to include a baseline complete blood count and biochemical blood testing, including potassium and magnesium levels, and an electrocardiogram at baseline and 4 hours after dosing for all subjects.

Pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome — acute antiemetic therapy with ondansetron/5‑HT3 receptor antagonists: Ondansetron is widely used in the acute management of CVS, and the panel judged the desirable effects as moderate based on indirect evidence including a retrospective pediatric migraine study demonstrating 90% efficacy in controlling vomiting (formulation not specified). None of the studies reported on side effects of 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists and the panel judged the undesirable effects as small, noting reported constipation, headache, transaminitis, and QTc interval prolongation. The panel rated the overall certainty of the evidence as very low, judged the balance of effects to probably favor the intervention, considered it to be cost‑effective due to prevention of hospitalizations, and judged it probably acceptable and feasible with probably no impact on health equity. The guideline panel determined that while certainty is very low, the use of IV ondansetron is supported by its indirect efficacy, broad availability and safety in a diversity of settings, with much of these data also applying to enteral 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists; despite widespread use there is a paucity of high‑quality effectiveness evidence, and the intervention was judged to have neutral effects on health equity and probably be acceptable and feasible, particularly when used within individualized protocols. Implementation considerations include potential drug interactions and risks of QTc interval prolongation; for most younger patients, dose ranges between 0.13 and 0.26 mg/kg showed no major outcome differences. Subgroup considerations include patients whose disease is refractory to outpatient interventions and requiring IV intervention, and periodic re‑evaluation of efficacy is essential. The panel recommended trials assessing the efficacy of ondansetron singly or as part of a multi‑drug protocol for pediatric CVS in both the home and acute care setting and also recommends head‑to‑head comparison trials between IV 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists and NK‑1 receptor antagonists.

Pediatric Studies:

Four open-label, noncomparative (one US, three foreign) trials have been performed with 209 pediatric cancer patients 4 to 18 years of age given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens. In the three foreign trials, the initial ondansetron injection dose ranged from 0.04 to 0.87 mg/kg for a total dose of 2.16 to 12 mg. This was followed by the oral administration of ondansetron ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In the US trial, ondansetron injection was administered intravenously (only) in three doses of 0.15 mg/kg each for a total daily dose of 7.2 to 39 mg. In these studies, 58% of the 196 evaluable patients had a complete response (no emetic episodes) on day 1. Thus, prevention of vomiting in these pediatric patients was essentially the same as for patients older than 18 years of age.

Clinical trial information in pediatric cancer patients 6 months to 48 months of age is approved for GlaxoSmithKline Corporation's ondansetron injection. However, due to GlaxoSmithKline's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled for use in this subpopulation of pediatric patients.

### Antiemetics for reducing vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents [^1b6ac212]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Vomiting caused by acute gastroenteritis is very common in children and adolescents. Treatment of vomiting in children can be problematic and the use of antiemetics remains a controversial issue. There have been concerns expressed about apparently unacceptable levels of side effects such as sedation and extrapyramidal reactions, which are associated with some of the earlier generation of antiemetics.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antiemetics on gastroenteritis induced vomiting in children and adolescents.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register (searched 28 July 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2005). Published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week and Digestive Disease Week were handsearched. Members of the Cochrane UGPD Group were contacted for details of any ongoing or relevant unpublished clinical trials. The search was re-run on 12th July 2006 and one new trial was found.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing antiemetics and/or placebo in children and adolescents, under the age of 18, with vomiting due to gastroenteritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects data was collected from the studies.

Main Results

Three trials involving 396 participants were included. Although no data were available for the precise time to cessation of vomiting (the primary outcome specified in the protocol for this review), one trial reported that the proportion of patients without vomiting over a 24 hour period was higher in the ondansetron and metoclopramide groups than placebo. In the second trial, ondansetron ensured complete anti-emesis for 8/12 (67%) patients within the first 4 hours and in 7/12 (58%) patients in the first 24 hr period. A few secondary outcomes were reported in the included trials. The third trial reported that 14% of patients who received ondansetron vomited during oral rehydration (which was given over one hour period after randomization) compared to 35% of the placebo group.

Authors' Conclusions

The small number of included trials provided some, albeit weak and unreliable, evidence which appeared to favor the use of ondansetron and metoclopramide over placebo to reduce the number of episodes of vomiting due to gastroenteritis in children. The increased incidence of diarrhea noted with both ondansetron and metoclopramide was considered to be as a result of retention of fluids and toxins that would otherwise have been eliminated through the process of vomiting.

### Aprepitant in adolescent patients for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of efficacy and tolerability [^dc302a10]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant, plus a 5HT3 antagonist and corticosteroid is well-tolerated and effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults but has not been formally assessed in adolescents.

Procedure

Patients age 11–19 years old receiving emetogenic chemotherapy were randomized 2:1 to aprepitant triple therapy (aprepitant [A] 125 mg p.o., dexamethasone [D] 8 mg p.o., and ondansetron [O] 0.15 mg/kg i.v. t.i.d. day 1; A 80 mg, D 4 mg, and O 0.15 mg/kg t.i.d. day 2; A 80 mg and D 4 mg day 3; and D 4 mg day 4) or a control regimen (D 16 mg and O 0.15 mg/kg t.i.d. day 1; D 8 mg and O 0.15 mg/kg t.i.d. day 2; and D 8 mg days 3 and 4). The primary endpoint was the difference in drug-related adverse events during and for 14 days following treatment. Efficacy and aprepitant pharmacokinetics were assessed.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between aprepitant (N = 28) and control (N = 18) groups. Febrile neutropenia was more frequent in the aprepitant group (25% vs. 11.1%). Complete response (CR) rates were 35.7% for aprepitant triple therapy versus 5.6% for the control group. Mean plasma aprepitant AUC(0–24 hr) and C(max) on day 1 and mean trough concentrations on days 2 and 3 were consistently lower compared to historical data obtained from healthy adults; however, the differences were not clinically significant.

Conclusion

Aprepitant triple therapy was generally well tolerated; CR were greater with aprepitant, although not statistically significant. Pharmacokinetics suggest that the adult dosing regimen is appropriate for adolescents.

4.3 Recommendation 8. We conditionally recommend aprepitant to abort symptoms of a CVS episode

Grade: Conditional recommendation, very low‐quality evidence. Vote: > 80% agreement

There is a single open‐label trial of oral aprepitant used as abortive treatment of CVS in children and adolescents who were refractory to conventional treatment. 43 All children > 20 kg were given the standard regimen used in chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) of 125 mg initially during the prodrome, then 80 mg daily for the following 2 days as needed. Oral aprepitant could be retained if administered during a prodrome at least 30 minutes before the onset of vomiting. At the end of 12 months, this recurring abortive regimen significantly reduced the duration of episodes from 5 days to 1 day, the number of vomits from 9 to 4 times per hour, and the number of hospital admissions from 9 to 2.5. Side effects appear to be mild, and the medication was well tolerated. There are no data on the use of intravenous fosaprepitant (phosphorylated prodrug of aprepitant) in CVS, although it has been used effectively in moderate and highly emetogenic CINV. 74

Based upon low‐quality evidence in children and adolescents and positive clinical experience, the committee recommends aprepitant as a potentially effective second‐line abortive agent. We recommend using a standard dosing regimen of 125 mg, 80 mg, and 80 mg on three consecutive days with the first dose to be taken as early in the prodrome and before the onset of vomiting. The target individuals in whom abortive aprepitant is recommended include those who are refractory to standard abortive therapy (eg, sumatriptan and ondansetron) and those who have a defined prodrome or a predictable periodicity (episode which occurs in relation to the menstrual cycle) in which aprepitant can be initiated a day or two before the anticipated onset of vomiting. Difficulties with obtaining insurance approval for aprepitant and IV fosaprepitant have been a barrier to its use despite demonstrated efficacy.

### Palonosetron versus ondansetron for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients with cancer receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy: a randomised, phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority study [^f64b7bb7]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Palonosetron has shown efficacy in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults undergoing moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. We assessed the efficacy and safety of palonosetron versus ondansetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients.

Methods

In this multicentre, multinational, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 study, paediatric patients aged between 0 and younger than 17 years, who were naive or non-naive to chemotherapy, and scheduled to undergo moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for the treatment of malignant disease were randomised centrally (1:1:1) to receive up to four cycles of 10 μg/kg or 20 μg/kg palonosetron on day 1, or three 150 μg/kg doses of ondansetron on day 1, scheduled 4 h apart, according to a static central permuted block randomisation scheme by an interactive web response system. Randomisation was stratified according to age and emetogenicity. Treatment allocation was masked to project team members involved in data collection and analysis, and members of the investigator's team. The primary endpoint was complete response (no vomiting, retching, or use of rescue drugs) during the acute phase (0–24 h post-chemotherapy) of the first on-study chemotherapy cycle, as assessed in the population of randomly assigned patients who received moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy and an active study drug. The primary efficacy objective was to show the non-inferiority of palonosetron versus ondansetron during the acute phase (0–24 h post-chemotherapy) of the first on-study chemotherapy cycle through comparison of the difference in the proportions of patients who achieved a complete response with palonosetron (πT) minus ondansetron (πR) versus a preset non-inferiority margin (δ -15%). To be considered as non-inferior to ondansetron, for at least one of the doses of palonosetron, the lower limit of the 97.5% CI for the weighted sum of the differences in complete response rates had to be superior to -15%. Safety was assessed, according to treatment received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01442376, and has been completed.

Findings

Between Sept 12, 2011, and Oct 26, 2012, we randomly assigned 502 patients; 169 were assigned to receive 10 μg/kg palonosetron, 169 to receive 20 μg/kg palonosetron, and 164 to receive 3×150 μg/kg ondansetron, of whom 166, 165, and 162, respectively, were included in the efficacy analysis. In the acute phase, complete responses were recorded in 90 (54%) patients in the 10 μg/kg palonosetron group, 98 (59%) in the 20 μg/kg palonosetron group, and 95 (59%) in the ondansetron group. Non-inferiority versus ondansetron was shown for 20 μg/kg palonosetron in the acute phase (weighted sum of the differences in complete response rates 0.36% [97.5% CI -11.7 to 12.4]; p = 0.0022). Non-inferiority versus ondansetron was not shown for 10 μg/kg palonosetron in the acute phase (weighted sum of the differences in complete response rates -4.41% [97.5% CI -16.4 to 7.6]). In the first on-study treatment cycle, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 134 (80%) of 167 patients who received 10 μg/kg palonosetron, 113 (69%) of 163 who received 20 μg/kg palonosetron, and 134 (82%) of 164 who received ondansetron. The most common drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were nervous system disorders, mainly headache, which occurred in three (2%) patients who received 10 μg/kg palonosetron, one (< 1%) patient who received 20 μg/kg palonosetron, and two (1%) patients who received ondansetron. The incidence of serious adverse events in the first on-study treatment cycle was lower in the 20 μg/kg palonosetron group (43 [26%]) than in the 10 μg/kg palonosetron group (52 [31%]) and the ondansetron group (55 [34%]).

Interpretation

Non-inferiority was shown for 20 μg/kg palonosetron during the acute phase of the first on-study chemotherapy cycle. 20 μg/kg palonosetron is now indicated by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients aged 1 month to younger than 17 years.

Conclusions

The findings of this serial cross-sectional study suggest that opportunities for pharmacogenetic implementation among pediatric patients in the US are abundant. For pediatric institutions interested in implementing pharmacogenetic testing, the utility will likely be greatest for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, particularly for the antiemetic ondansetron, analgesics, and antidepressants.

### Prescribing prevalence of medications with potential genotype-guided dosing in pediatric patients [^954ac10e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the prescribing of CPIC level A medications in pediatric patients among diverse sites in the US. The primary findings are that prescriptions for CPIC level A drugs are common (annual prescribing prevalence of approximately 8000 to 11 000 per 100 000 patients) in pediatrics and may be relevant to a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas, the importance of which may differ across institutions. Overall, we estimate that more than 1.3% of patients (> 1300 per 100 000) would have potential recommendations for or may require drug selection or dosing changes based on current guidelines and pharmacogenetic testing results alone. Of the 20 relevant genes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 had the largest potential effect, because they affect commonly prescribed analgesics and antidepressants as well as the antiemetic ondansetron in the pediatric setting.

Our study focused on patients younger than 21 years, with most aged 3 to 14 years. Pediatric-specific analyses are important to quantify patterns of prescribing, highlight knowledge gaps, and quantify the potential effect of pharmacogenetics based on age, demographic characteristics, and drugs within pediatrics. One single-center studyreported similar prevalences of prescribing, which differed from prevalences in adults. A 5-year study across Alberta, Canada, demonstrated that codeine-containing medications and ondansetron were the most commonly prescribed medications with pharmacogenetic-based prescribing guidelines in pediatric patients.

CYP2D6- and CYP2C19- associated drugs were the most commonly prescribed and represented most actionable exposures (87.6%). This includes all CPIC guideline recommendations, including those rated as optional in the guideline. Institutions have implemented clinical testing of these genes to guide drug or dose selection in pediatric patients. CPIC guidelines are available for the CYP2D6 substrates ondansetron, select opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, atomoxetine, tamoxifen, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; there are also CPIC guidelines for the CYP2C19 substrates tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, clopidogrel, and voriconazole. Initial data support the utility of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 genotype-guided therapies for pediatrics, and are anticipated from the IGNITE II Pragmatic Trials Network.

A drug is granted a license for use after a thorough assessment of risks and benefits based on high-quality scientific proof of its efficacy and safety. Many drugs that are relevant to children are not licensed for use in this population implying that a thorough assessment of risks and benefits in the pediatric population has not been made at all, implying a negative risk-benefit balance in children, or implying insufficient information to establish the risk-benefit balance. Use of drugs without positive assessment of risks and benefits exposes children to potential lack of efficacy, unknown toxicity, and harm. To aid guideline committees and individual prescribers, we here present a tutorial of the Benefit and Risk Assessment for Off-label use (BRAvO) decision framework. This pragmatic framework offers a structured assessment of benefits and risks of off-label drug use, including a clinical pharmacological based approach to age-appropriate dose selection. As proof of concept and to illustrate the practical use, we have applied the framework to assess benefits and risks of off-label use of ondansetron for gastroenteritis-induced nausea and vomiting. The framework could also guide decisions on off-label use in other special populations (e.g., pregnant women, elderly, obese, or critically ill patients) where off-label drug use is frequent, thereby contributing to effective and safe pharmacotherapy.

### Antiemetics for reducing vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents [^51f34a76]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vomiting is a common manifestation of acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents. When untreated it can be a hindrance to oral rehydration therapy, which is the cornerstone in the management of acute gastroenteritis. Evidence is needed concerning the safety and efficacy of antiemetic use for vomiting in acute gastroenteritis in children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and effectiveness of antiemetics on gastroenteritis induced vomiting in children and adolescents.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conferences. The search was re-run and is up to date as on 20 July 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing antiemetics with placebo or no treatment, in children and adolescents under the age of 18, for vomiting due to gastroenteritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included seven trials involving 1,020 participants. Mean time to cessation of vomiting in one study was 0.34 days less with dimenhydrinate suppository compared to placebo (P value = 0.036). Pooled data from three studies comparing oral ondansetron with placebo showed: a reduction in the immediate hospital admission rate (RR 0.40, NNT 17, 95% CI 10 to 100) but no difference between the hospitalization rates at 72 hours after discharge from the Emergency Department (ED); a reduction in IV rehydration rates both during the ED stay (RR 0.41, NNT 5, 95% CI 4 to 8), and in follow-up to 72 hours after discharge from the ED stay (worst-best scenario for ondansetron RR 0.57, NNT 6, 95% CI 4 to 13) and an increase in the proportion of patients with cessation of vomiting (RR 1.34, NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 7)). No significant difference was noted in the revisit rates or adverse events, although diarrhea was reported as a side effect in four of the five ondansetron studies. In one study the proportion of patients with cessation of vomiting in 24 hours was (58%) with IV ondansetron, (17%) placebo and (33%) in the metoclopramide group (P value = 0.039).

Authors' Conclusions

Oral ondansetron increased the proportion of patients who had ceased vomiting and reduced the number needing intravenous rehydration and immediate hospital admission. Intravenous ondansetron and metoclopramide reduced the number of episodes of vomiting and hospital admission, and dimenhydrinate as a suppository reduced the duration of vomiting.

### Antiemetic drug use in children: what the clinician needs to know [^87198af7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Vomiting is not only unpleasant for both children and families, but can lead to frequent hospital admission. The persistent vomiting hampers oral intake and increases the risk of dehydration, so the proper use of antiemetic drugs can be useful. The pharmacological treatment of vomiting in children remains a challenge for the pediatrician because several antiemetics are prescribed as "off-label", outside their authorized drug label. Domperidone and ondansetron are the most commonly known antiemetic drugs. A single oral dose of ondansetron has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent vomiting, the need for intravenous fluids, and hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis. There is enough evidence to support ondansetron administration in children, so the clinical use can be defined as "off-label/on evidence". This review aims to provide an overview of therapeutic use, safety, and main pharmacological properties of antiemetic drugs in children. A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed MEDLINE database was carried out to identify all articles published in English from 1998 to February 2018. At present time, the "off-label/on-evidence" use of some antiemetics could improve the success rate of oral rehydration therapy in pediatric emergency settings and to change the management of vomiting with the prevention of the complications.

### Single daily dosing versus divided dosing intravenous ondansetron to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting among children: a comparative randomized double-blind controlled trial [^fa2d0436]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common complication in cancer treatment. Ondansetron is an effective antiemetic drug widely used to prevent CINV; however, the effective administrative dosing strategies among pediatrics remain unclear. The study aimed to investigate clinical effectiveness of single daily dosing versus divided dosing ondansetron.

Methods

In all, 194 children undergoing chemotherapy were randomized to receive either single daily dosing (0.3 mg/kg/dose) or divided dosing (0.15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours) intravenous ondansetron for 24 hours. Clinical parameters including number of emesis episodes, nausea scores, appetite levels, parent's satisfaction, and adverse effects within 24 hours were analyzed.

Results

No significant differences were found between the two dosing strategies concerning number of emesis episodes and parent's satisfaction. However, nonleukemic hematologic malignancies and concurrent administration of intrathecal methotrexate-hydrocortisone-cytarabine (IT-MHA) were associated with increased risk of acute-phase vomiting. Interestingly, none of the patients aged under 7 years, receiving divided dosing ondansetron, presented nausea symptoms compared with those receiving single daily dosing (p-value .034). No significant differences regarding headache were observed between the two dosing strategies and none of the patients experienced QTc prolongation.

Conclusion

Ondansetron administered as divided dosing should be considered among children aged under 7 years to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and among patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy to maintain their appetite. Both administrative dosing strategies were well tolerated with no significant adverse effects.

Abortive interventions (IV) — The guideline panel suggests early presentation and immediate IV fluid for treatment of acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects). The guideline panel suggests IV fluid rehydration for treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and there is no research evidence regarding the use of D10 versus D5 IV fluids in the setting of acute CVS episodes; no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made. The guideline panel suggests using an IV NK-1 receptor antagonist (e.g., fosaprepitant) and an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (each a conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

### Utilisation of drugs with pharmacogenetic recommendations in children in Switzerland [^7a1b8df0]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The antiemetic drug ondansetron (8.3%) was also quite prevalent in our study population, an observation which corresponds to results from other studies. Besides its approved indications, ondansetron is also used off-label for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis. Additionally, it is the sole antiemetic approved for treating postoperative and radiation-induced vomiting in Switzerland from the first month of life.

Compared to the high prevalence of depression in adolescents (33%), the number of claims of PGx antidepressants is low (escitalopram = 0.5%, sertraline = 0.8%). One explanation for this result is that, according to current guidelines, sertraline is the second-line treatment for unipolar depression in children and adolescents. The first choice is fluoxetine, which is not a PGx antidepressant and was therefore not investigated further in our study. Tricyclic antidepressants, which are also PGx drugs, have shown no benefit in treating depression in children and are therefore unlikely to be used in our population.

### Ondansetron and probiotics in the management of pediatric acute gastroenteritis in developed countries [^d3d0f58c]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common and impactful disease, typically managed with supportive care. There is considerable interest in the role of adjunctive therapies, particularly ondansetron and probiotics in improving AGE outcomes. The purpose of this review is to present the latest evidence regarding the use of these agents in children with AGE in developed countries.

Recent Findings

Single-dose oral ondansetron is effective and safe in reducing hospital admissions and the use of intravenous rehydration in children with AGE in emergency-department-based trials. Ondansetron use has increased significantly; however, 'real-world' studies of effectiveness have documented less impressive clinical impacts. Similarly, probiotic consumption is growing rapidly. Although several strains appear to reduce the duration of diarrhea in hospitalized children, current data are insufficient to support the routine use of probiotics in outpatient pediatric AGE.

Summary

Ondansetron and probiotics may improve patient outcomes in pediatric AGE. Appropriate strategies are needed to optimally integrate oral ondansetron into clinical practice to maximize its potential benefits. Although probiotics remain a promising option, there are challenges in generalizing the data available to patients presenting for outpatient care. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively guide the clinical use of probiotics in outpatients in developed countries.

### Prescribing prevalence of medications with potential genotype-guided dosing in pediatric patients [^57b1ed61]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Genotype-guided prescribing in pediatrics could prevent adverse drug reactions and improve therapeutic response. Clinical pharmacogenetic implementation guidelines are available for many medications commonly prescribed to children. Frequencies of medication prescription and actionable genotypes (genotypes where a prescribing change may be indicated) inform the potential value of pharmacogenetic implementation.

Objective

To assess potential opportunities for genotype-guided prescribing in pediatric populations among multiple health systems by examining the prevalence of prescriptions for each drug with the highest level of evidence (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium level A) and estimating the prevalence of potential actionable prescribing decisions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This serial cross-sectional study of prescribing prevalences in 16 health systems included electronic health records data from pediatric inpatient and outpatient encounters from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017. The health systems included academic medical centers with free-standing children's hospitals and community hospitals that were part of an adult health care system. Participants included approximately 2.9 million patients younger than 21 years observed per year. Data were analyzed from June 5, 2018, to April 14, 2020.

Exposures

Prescription of 38 level A medications based on electronic health records.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Annual prevalence of level A medication prescribing and estimated actionable exposures, calculated by combining estimated site-year prevalences across sites with each site weighted equally.

Results

Data from approximately 2.9 million pediatric patients (median age, 8 [interquartile range, 2–16] years; 50.7% female, 62.3% White) were analyzed for a typical calendar year. The annual prescribing prevalence of at least 1 level A drug ranged from 7987 to 10 629 per 100 000 patients with increasing trends from 2011 to 2014. The most prescribed level A drug was the antiemetic ondansetron (annual prevalence of exposure, 8107 [95% CI, 8077–8137] per 100 000 children). Among commonly prescribed opioids, annual prevalence per 100 000 patients was 295 (95% CI, 273–317) for tramadol, 571 (95% CI, 557–586) for codeine, and 2116 (95% CI, 2097–2135) for oxycodone. The antidepressants citalopram, escitalopram, and amitriptyline were also commonly prescribed (annual prevalence, approximately 250 per 100 000 patients for each). Estimated prevalences of actionable exposures were highest for oxycodone and ondansetron (> 300 per 100 000 patients annually). CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 substrates were more frequently prescribed than medications influenced by other genes.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that opportunities for pharmacogenetic implementation among pediatric patients in the US are abundant. As expected, the greatest opportunity exists with implementing CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 pharmacogenetic guidance for commonly prescribed antiemetics, analgesics, and antidepressants.

### Granisetron vs ondansetron: is it a question of duration of 5-HT ₃ receptor blockade? [^324b80e3]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Additionally, state that, 'there are no data to support the use of higher doses of the same 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists in patients failing the recommended dosage', citing. However, a dose-related response (P < 0.001) for oral dolasetron has been shown between doses of 25 and 200 mg (complete response rates 60.5 and 76.3% for 100 and 200 mg dolasetron, respectively;), despite a recommended dosage for the agent of 100 mg. Similar dose-related effects have also been reported with ondansetron. For example, a Phase I study comparing three doses of intravenous ondansetron t.d.s. (0.015, 0.15 and 0.3 mg kg⁻¹) indicated a trend towards increased efficacy with higher doses (complete response rates were 15, 46 and 58% respectively), though only the 0.015 mg kg⁻¹ dose was shown to be significantly different from the other dose levels. Further studies have reported significantly superior efficacy with a single dose on ondansetron, 32 mg, compared with a single 8 mg dose. Moreover, studies comparing granisetron, 40 and 160 μg kg⁻¹, show a trend towards increased efficacy at the higher dose; 24 h after administration of chemotherapeutic agents, 81% of granisetron, 160 mcg kg⁻¹, were emesis-free compared with 75% receiving granisetron 40 μg kg⁻¹. In addition, patients refractory to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists have been shown to respond well to granisetron, at doses that are higher than generally used, in subsequent chemotherapy cycles.

In conclusion, the effective 'switch' to granisetron in this study may, therefore, be due to a number of factors, but is likely to be attributable primarily to the longer duration of action of granisetron compared with ondansetron rather than the lack of cross resistance between 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists.

### Methotrexate-induced nausea in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^9b5295e9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Ondansetron has also been shown to be effective in treating MTX-induced nausea in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In an observational study, 9 adults with rheumatoid arthritis were given ondansetron because they had severe nausea that persisted despite receipt of the anti-emetic metoclopramide and switching MTX from oral to intramuscular administration. Following initiation of ondansetron, the intensity and duration of nausea declined dramatically in all patients, and this improvement continued throughout the 24 weeks of follow-up.

Some pediatric rheumatologists are using ondansetron in clinical practice. Among the 84 respondents to the UK provider survey, 21% always or often (> 50% of the time) start an anti-emetic concurrently when starting MTX for the first time. When prescribing an anti-emetic, ondansetron was the first choice for 88% of respondents.

Dosing recommendations for the use of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic medications are provided by the manufacturer. For children ages 4 to 11 years, the recommended dose is 4 mg orally given 30 min prior to emetogenic medication. For children age 12 years or older, the recommended dose is 8 mg orally given 30 min prior to emetogenic medication. Patients may take 1–2 additional doses of ondansetron every 8 h as needed for post-MTX nausea and vomiting.

Behavioral interventions for MTX-induced anticipatory nausea

Behavioral interventions may help increase tolerance to MTX and reduce the occurrence of associative and anticipatory nausea. In a retrospective chart review of children with JIA, investigators reported outcomes for 10 patients who were referred to a pediatric psychologist for behavioral therapy for anticipatory nausea (N = 6) and anxiety (N = 9) related to MTX. Behavioral therapy was adapted to age. Children less than 10 years old received the "Magic Box" method based on systemic desensitization by distraction, and older children received cognitive behavioral therapy. The behavioral therapy intervention was found to be fully effective in 5 children (50%), moderately effective in 2 children (20%), and not effective in 3 children (30%).

UNCERTAINTIES ON THE USE OF ONDANSETRON

There are no critical questions that remain unanswered.

Uncertainty

Malignant hyperthermia is reported in a single case study. However, a board member has serious doubts on the validity and directness of the diagnosis malignant hyperthermia. The authors of the case report suggest that malignant hyperthermia can be plausible based on animal studies. No clinical studies were found linking ondansetron to malignant hyperthermia. This is confirmed by a query among anesthesiologists.

Quality of evidence

Beneficial effect of ondansetron in gastroenteritis is confirmed by meta‐analyses. Dose is confirmed in PONV and CINV by SmPC, PK studies, and pediatric dose finding studies. The safety profile of ondansetron is well known based on use in PONV and CINV.

Regarding specific circumstances for cyclic vomiting syndrome, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (abortive treatment, pharmacotherapy), NASPGHAN 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering intravenous NK-1 receptor antagonists, such as fosaprepitant, or intravenous 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, for the treatment of acute CVS episodes in pediatric and adolescent patients not responding to outpatient abortive therapies.

### 2016 updated MASCC / ESMO consensus recommendations: prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children [^34f9c038]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 2009 recommendations for the prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced emesis in children.

Methods

We updated the original systematic literature search. Randomized studies were included in the evidence to support this guideline if they were primary studies fully published in full text in English or French; included only children less than 18 years old or, for mixed studies of adults and children, reported the pediatric results separately or the median or mean age was no more than 13 years; evaluated acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prophylaxis; provided sufficient information to permit determination of the emetogenicity of the antineoplastic therapy administered or the study investigators stated the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy administered; included an implicit or explicit definition of complete acute CINV response; described the antiemetic regimen in full; and reported the complete acute CINV response rate as a proportion.

Results

Twenty-five randomized studies, including eight published since 2009, met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. Prophylaxis with a 5-HT3 antagonist (granisetron or ondansetron or palonosetron or tropisetron) ± dexamethasone ± aprepitant is recommended for children receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. For children receiving chemotherapy of low emetogenicity, a 5-HT3 antagonist is recommended.

Conclusions

The findings of several randomized trials were used to update recommendations for the prevention of acute CINV. However, significant research gaps remain and must be addressed before CINV control in children can be optimized.

### Bimodal release ondansetron for acute gastroenteritis among adolescents and adults: a randomized clinical trial [^5dd20086]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

A total of 330 patients were randomized, and 321 were included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 29.0 [11.1] years; 195 [60.7%] women), with 192 patients randomized to the bimodal release ondansetron group and 129 patients randomized to the placebo group (Figure). Twenty-six patients (8%) were younger than 18 years. The bimodal release ondansetron and placebo groups appeared similar for age and sex at baseline (Table 1). Most patients had severe nausea at the time of drug administration, although the bimodal release ondansetron group had worse nausea at the time of randomization than the placebo group with 58 patients (30.2%) in the bimodal release ondansetron group and 27 patients (20.9%) in the placebo group reporting nausea was as bad as it could be. Other clinical variables were similar among the 2 treatment groups. All but 7 patients (5 in the bimodal release ondansetron group, 2 in the placebo group) had a final diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis.

CONSORT Flow Diagram

a A patient was assigned to receive placebo but erroneously received an unassigned study box that turned out to contain the active drug bimodal release ondansetron. All study boxes and content were of the same appearance and the blinding remained intact. Per intent-to-treat procedure, the data were analyzed by the assigned intervention (placebo group).

b Disqualifying information obtained after consent but before administration of the study drug included pregnancy, other abnormal blood test results, or abnormal electrocardiogram results.

Patient Demographic Characteristics

Primary Outcome

In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, a total of 126 treatment successes (65.6%) were observed in the bimodal release ondansetron group compared with 70 treatment successes (54.3%) in the placebo group. The absolute probability difference for treatment success between the 2 groups was 11.4% (95% CI, 0.3%-22.4%). The proportion of treatment success was 21% higher among patients who received bimodal release ondansetron compared with those who received the placebo (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00–1.46; P = 0.04) (Table 2).

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^f1eee50d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Ondansetron — Ondansetron was the first 5-HT3 RA on the market and commonly used as the preferred antiemetic for PONV prophylaxis; the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommended dose was 4 mg by slow IV injection or 16 mg of the oral formulation (oral disintegrating tablets, given 1 hour before induction). The IV drug has a mean elimination half-life of 3.1–5.8 hours in adults and is extensively metabolized by the liver, and CYP 2D6 ultrametabolizers are significantly more likely to develop PONV despite ondansetron prophylaxis. In a 2021 Cochrane network meta-analysis (NMA) on drugs for PONV prophylaxis in adults after general anesthesia, 585 randomized trials enrolling 97,516 patients were included to evaluate 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations, and ondansetron was the most investigated single drug followed by dexamethasone. Since the 2020 PONV Guideline, several studies have compared ondansetron 4 mg with dexamethasone 8 mg and concluded that ondansetron 4 mg is more effective for PONV prophylaxis; ondansetron 4 mg is comparable to prochlorperazine 10 mg for PONV prophylaxis, with a trend towards greater risk of side effects in the prochlorperazine group.
