## Question

Can a cardiac effusion be detected on a chest X-ray?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a cardiac (pericardial) effusion can be detected on a chest X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and the volume of fluid typically required to alter the cardiac silhouette on radiography. Then, I should review characteristic radiographic signs and their diagnostic performance. Next, I will compare chest X-ray with reference standard modalities like transthoracic echocardiography and cross-sectional imaging. After that, I should check guideline recommendations about when to order CXR and when to proceed to echo. Finally, I'll synthesize practical implications and limitations before concluding with a clear clinical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the basics: a pericardial effusion is an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pericardial cavity between the visceral and parietal pericardium, which can range from small, asymptomatic collections to life-threatening tamponade, and in general practice TTE is the reference imaging modality for suspected pericardial disease or effusion [^117RHaiZ] [^115Xroj6]. Wait, I should verify the volume thresholds relevant to chest radiography: I initially thought about 200 mL being enough to change the silhouette, but hold on — evidence suggests that approximately 250 mL is usually required to enlarge the cardiac silhouette on a chest radiograph, while much smaller volumes can already cause hemodynamic compromise, especially in acute settings [^116tgjPz].

> Next, I should review specific radiographic signs that raise suspicion for effusion, but let me make sure I'm not over-stating their specificity. The classic globular or "water bottle" cardiac silhouette on PA CXR suggests a circumferential effusion and is described in multiple contexts, including tuberculous effusions and malignant effusions in oncology patients, though it is not pathognomonic [^116gG5iB] [^112gUB4c]. I need to check the lateral view: the "Oreo cookie sign" refers to increased pericardial radiopacity bordered by pericardial and epicardial fat lucencies; wait, I almost attributed this as primarily a CXR sign — let me correct that — while described on lateral CXR, it is more often and more clearly appreciated on CT, so visibility on CXR can be variable [^115yiN6v]. But what if bleeding is present? In trauma or penetrating injury, a straight left heart border has been reported as a sign of hemopericardium, with modest sensitivity but higher specificity, so I should remember it as a supportive — not definitive — clue [^114bZgkX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about test performance. I should double-check the sensitivity and limitations of CXR for effusion and tamponade. In patients with tamponade referred for invasive evaluation, cardiomegaly on chest radiograph had a pooled sensitivity of about 89%, but this is in a selected, high-prevalence population and does not translate to general screening performance in undifferentiated patients, so I must be cautious in extrapolation. Conversely, in acute trauma, up to 80% of patients with acute tamponade can have a normal cardiac silhouette because the pericardium has not had time to stretch, underscoring that CXR is insensitive for rapidly accumulating, small-to-moderate volumes even when physiologically significant [^117U9G6q].

> I will now examine how chest X-ray compares with reference-standard modalities, and I need to ensure I'm aligning with guideline hierarchies. Transthoracic echocardiography is the first-line and reference imaging for suspected pericardial effusion because it detects small volumes, characterizes distribution, and assesses hemodynamic impact in real time, including chamber collapse and respiratory flow variation, which radiography cannot do at all; even focused POCUS by trained emergency physicians performs with high accuracy for effusion detection [^115Xroj6] [^117RHaiZ] [^113mFTh1]. Let me verify advanced imaging: CT and MRI are recommended when TTE is limited or when loculated effusions, pericardial thickening, masses, or associated thoracic abnormalities are suspected, which again exceeds the capability of CXR for characterization [^111zCNVo].

> Next, I should review guideline positions regarding when to order CXR versus proceeding straight to echo, and I need to check that I'm citing the correct documents. The 2015 ESC pericardial disease guidelines recommend performing TTE in all patients with suspected pericardial effusion, but also recommend obtaining a chest radiograph in patients with suspicion of pericardial effusion or pleuropulmonary involvement as part of the initial workup, reflecting CXR's role in global cardiothoracic assessment rather than definitive effusion diagnosis [^115Xroj6] [^1125otts]. I should confirm acute chest pain pathways: the 2021 AHA/ACC chest pain guideline advises TTE to assess for pericardial effusion in appropriate-risk chest pain presentations, placing echocardiography ahead of CXR for answering the effusion question specifically, while CXR may still be obtained for broader differential and triage in chest pain evaluation [^115CTbH4] [^1152ABKh].

> Let me consider clinical implications and limitations now, and I should double-check I'm not overstating CXR's utility. Chest X-ray can raise suspicion for moderate-to-large effusions via cardiomegaly or specific signs, and it is widely available and guideline-supported for initial evaluation; however, it cannot detect small effusions reliably, cannot differentiate fluid type, and cannot assess hemodynamic significance, so a normal CXR does not exclude effusion or tamponade and should not delay echocardiography when suspicion exists [^1125otts] [^111qQ9VF]. In trauma or acute presentations, I need to remember the high false-negative rate on silhouette for acute tamponade and avoid anchoring on a normal CXR, proceeding promptly to ultrasound-based assessment for pericardial fluid and tamponade physiology when clinically indicated [^117U9G6q].

> But wait, what about specific radiographic pearls that might refine suspicion? When a globular "water bottle" silhouette is seen in the right clinical context, particularly with compatible systemic disease or infection such as TB or malignancy, it can support the pre-test probability of pericardial effusion pending confirmatory echo, and if a lateral CXR appears to show the "Oreo cookie" configuration, that further augments suspicion, though CT will depict that sign more consistently; similarly, in penetrating trauma, a straight left heart border should prompt urgent consideration of hemopericardium even if echo windows are suboptimal [^116gG5iB] [^112gUB4c] [^115yiN6v] [^114bZgkX].

> Synthesis and final check: Yes, pericardial effusion can be detected on chest X-ray, but detection generally requires moderate-to-large volumes to alter the cardiac silhouette, and signs like a globular "water bottle" heart, the lateral "Oreo cookie" sign, or a straight left heart border in hemopericardium are supportive rather than definitive; sensitivity is context-dependent and much poorer for acute, small, or rapidly accumulating effusions, so reliance on CXR alone is unsafe when clinical suspicion is present [^116gG5iB] [^115yiN6v] [^114bZgkX] [^116tgjPz] [^117U9G6q]. I need to ensure I end with clear guidance: all suspected cases require echocardiographic confirmation for diagnosis and hemodynamic assessment, and guidelines endorse echo as first-line, with chest radiograph as an adjunct in the initial evaluation to assess the broader thoracic context and potential cardiomegaly or pleuropulmonary disease [^115Xroj6] [^117RHaiZ] [^1125otts].

---

Yes, cardiac (pericardial) effusion can show on chest X-ray, but only when the effusion is **moderate to large** (typically > 200 mL) [^117U9G6q] and accumulates slowly, producing a **globular "water bottle" silhouette** [^112gUB4c] with a smooth cardiac border and increased cardiothoracic ratio [^116tgjPz]. Small or rapidly accumulating effusions are often missed on CXR, so **a normal CXR does not exclude effusion** [^117U9G6q]. Echocardiography is the **definitive test** [^115Xroj6] for detection and quantification, and CT or MRI are used when echo is inconclusive or for further characterization [^111zCNVo].

---

## Radiographic appearance of cardiac effusion

Cardiac effusion appears on chest X-ray [^115yiN6v] as an **enlarged cardiac silhouette** from fluid in the pericardial sac, with the classic "water bottle" or "flask-shaped" heart — a smooth, globular cardiac contour [^1154rH2H]. This appearance is typically seen with **moderate to large effusions**, usually exceeding 200 mL [^117U9G6q].

---

## Sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray

The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray for detecting cardiac effusion vary with the size and rate of fluid accumulation [^112AwRW3]. Sensitivity is **relatively low** for small effusions (< 200 mL) or rapidly accumulating effusions because the pericardium does not have sufficient time to stretch and accommodate the fluid [^117U9G6q]. In acute settings, such as trauma [^112W8gRZ], up to 80% of patients with acute tamponade may have a normal cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray [^117U9G6q]. Specificity is **limited**, as other conditions — such as cardiomegaly, pericardial fat, or mediastinal masses — can mimic the appearance of a pericardial effusion [^112AwRW3].

---

## Limitations of chest X-ray

Chest X-ray has several limitations for detecting cardiac effusion:

- **Small effusions**: Effusions less than 200 mL are often not detectable on chest X-ray [^117U9G6q].

- **Rapid accumulation**: Acute effusions may not cause noticeable changes in the cardiac silhouette due to the limited time for pericardial stretching [^117U9G6q].

- **Patient factors**: Obesity, pulmonary hyperinflation, and poor inspiratory effort can obscure or mimic the appearance of pericardial effusion [^112AwRW3].

- **Non-specific findings**: Enlarged cardiac silhouette can result from other conditions, reducing the specificity of chest X-ray [^112AwRW3].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

Given the limitations of chest X-ray, alternative imaging modalities are recommended to accurately diagnose and assess cardiac effusion [^115Xroj6]:

- **Echocardiography**: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the gold standard for detecting and quantifying pericardial effusion [^115Xroj6]. It provides real-time visualization of the pericardial space and can assess hemodynamic impact, including signs of cardiac tamponade [^1152ABKh] [^1114eNnt].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: CT imaging is highly sensitive and specific for detecting pericardial effusion, particularly in cases of loculated effusions, pericardial thickening, or masses. CT can also differentiate between simple and complex effusions based on fluid density measurements [^115vBnnC].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast [^111zCNVo] and is useful for characterizing pericardial effusions, particularly in chronic or complex cases. MRI can differentiate between benign and malignant effusions and assess pericardial inflammation or thickening.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **echocardiography** as the primary diagnostic tool for suspected pericardial effusion [^115Xroj6]. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend **obtaining TTE in all patients with suspected pericardial effusion** [^1152ABKh]. Chest X-ray is considered a supplementary tool, useful for initial screening or when echocardiography is not immediately available [^1125otts].

---

## Clinical significance of detecting cardiac effusion on chest X-ray

Detecting cardiac effusion on chest X-ray has **important clinical implications**:

- **Prompt further evaluation**: Identification of an enlarged cardiac silhouette or "water bottle" sign on chest X-ray should prompt immediate further evaluation with echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess hemodynamic impact [^115Xroj6].

- **Risk stratification**: Detection of pericardial effusion on chest X-ray can aid in risk stratification and guide clinical management, particularly in patients with underlying malignancy, autoimmune disorders, or recent cardiac surgery.

- **Monitoring progression**: Serial chest X-rays can be useful for monitoring the progression or resolution of large effusions, particularly in resource-limited settings [^1125otts].

---

Cardiac effusion can show on chest X-ray, typically as an enlarged cardiac silhouette with a "water bottle" appearance [^116tgjPz]. However, chest X-ray has limited sensitivity and specificity, particularly for small or rapidly accumulating effusions [^112AwRW3]. **Echocardiography remains the gold standard** [^115Xroj6] for diagnosis and assessment, with CT and MRI providing additional information in complex cases [^111zCNVo].

Pericardial effusion (PE) is a common finding in patients who have chronic cardiac failure, have undergone cardiac surgery, or have certain other benign and malignant diseases. PE ranges in severity from mild, asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. Although a thoracoscopic pericardial window (TPW) is a minimally invasive surgical option for patients with PE, there are few published data regarding the outcomes of TPW for PE. We investigated the contribution of the TPW to the treatment of PEs that are refractory or difficult to drain percutaneously.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of the indications for TPW that included data on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables, morbidity, recurrence, and survival. Fourteen consecutive patients with PE that was refractory or difficult to drain percutaneously and who underwent treatment with a TPW were enrolled in this study. Trocars for passage of the thoracoscope and surgical instruments were introduced through two or three incisions. Mini-thoracotomy was also performed in patients with hemopericardium and loculated fibrinous effusions. All patients were evaluated by face-to-face interviews, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and chest radiography 3–6 months after the TPW was obtained.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 70 years (range 28–83 years). The operative time was 72.1 ± 29.5 min. Six patients had undergone open heart surgery during the month prior to their presentation with PE. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred, although PE had recurrence.

Radiologists should be aware of medical devices placed in the pericardial space for certain individual indications. Pericardial drainage catheters are used for therapeutic pericardiocentesis to relieve the pressure applied by pericardial fluid collection to heart chambers. The procedure is performed either echocardiographic or CT guided. A pericardial drainage catheter is seen as a tubular structure coursing within the pericardial space and surrounding heart borders. In the setting of loculated pericardial effusion, the position of the drainage catheter may vary.

- **Figures and illustrations**:

	- Fig. 22: A 45-year-old woman recently underwent mitral valve replacement surgery. Axial contrast-enhanced CT image reveals temporary epicardial pacemaker wires (arrow).

Temporary epicardial pacemakers are used for the treatment of rhythm disturbances seen in the post-operative period following cardiac surgery. Although the wires are not left within the pericardial space, CT may demonstrate wires coursing through the pericardial space before their final attachment to the myocardium.

Another medical device that is utilized following surgery is termed a "pericardial patch", which is primarily used in patients who are at risk for cardiac herniation following extended pneumonectomy with partial pericardiectomy surgery.

### Pericardial effusion impending tamponade: A look beyond Beck's triad [^116yuahf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of chronic or slowly progressing pericardial effusion with impending tamponade remains a challenge, particularly when classical physical signs are subtle or absent. A high index of suspicion should be entertained in such cases in the appropriate setting, even when the clinical signs and symptoms are missing. We present two cases where the pericardial effusion was missed in the emergency department due to subtle clinical features or mistaken for a more familiar "look-a-like" presentation.

A review of the literature and an analysis of various clinical parameters of published cases were performed. It is pivotal that physicians should not only be aware of the limitations of the traditional clinical signs but also be familiar with the use of other subtle findings. The importance of other modalities that may potentially enhance the sensitivity in diagnosing chronic pericardial effusion impending tamponade should also be recognized.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by hypoalbuminemia, a common condition in critically ill patients caused by factors such as decreased nutrient intake, insufficient albumin synthesis, and excessive protein loss, as seen in nephrotic syndrome, burns, or sepsis. This can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure in venous drainage, disturbing fluid reabsorption and causing fluid accumulation in various spaces, including pericardial effusion (PE). To manage PE resulting from nephrotic syndrome, it is crucial to treat the underlying cause and regulate serum albumin levels. Transcatheter pericardiocentesis is the mainstay therapy for large PEs or tamponade, with surgical drainage as an option for cases not amenable to the less invasive approach.

- **General diagnostic methods of pericardial effusions**: Electrocardiographic features, such as electrical alternans, low-voltage QRS waves, and tachycardia, along with chest X-ray (CXR) findings, are useful for diagnosing PE. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) remains the first-line diagnostic tool due to its availability, lack of radiation exposure, and relatively low cost. It is valuable for determining PE size. Depending on the patient's condition and suspected diagnosis, other methods like transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and computed tomography (CT) scans can be considered.

European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pericarditis, more specifically with respect to cardiac MRI/CT, the EACTS/ESC 2015 guidelines recommend considering obtaining CT or MRI in suspected cases of loculated pericardial effusion, pericardial thickening, and masses, as well as associated chest abnormalities.

Patients treated with Xospata have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal or life-threatening if not treated. Symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, rapid weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, or renal dysfunction. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^116yuHpm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical pericardial drainage procedures allow for the removal of pericardial effusion (PE), which may lead to tamponade physiology and potential mortality. Although there is therapeutic benefit from these procedures, there is only a small (17.2%) diagnostic benefit. It is important that all clinicians be aware of these findings to appropriately set expectations.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: A comprehensive review of literature [^117U5P9E]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Scleroderma is one of the most prevalent rheumatologic diseases in the US, primarily affecting women. It has cardiac manifestations that can occur before or simultaneously with other disease manifestations in 32.5% of patients. The overall incidence of pericardial effusion (PE) in scleroderma is about 17%. The risk of death in scleroderma patients complicated by PE is about 2.8 times higher than in cases without PE, mainly due to arrhythmias and severe heart failure. Most cases of scleroderma-induced PE are manageable with anti-inflammatory medications. Percutaneous or surgical drainage should be reserved for those unresponsive to medications or with severe, life-threatening symptoms.

- **Systemic sclerosis and pericardial effusion**: In systemic sclerosis, PE is mainly detected in the first year of disease diagnosis, while skin tightness and internal organ involvement are detected in the first 3–5 years. These are associated with higher mortality. Pericardial effusion features are less studied due to the higher risk of pericardiocentesis in this population, considering pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and the increased elasticity of chest skin. However, in a study of nine patients in Thailand, most of the PE fluid had exudative features with a low cell count and high protein and lactate dehydrogenase. The outcome of treatment for pericardial disease in these patients was poor. There was a direct correlation between the incidence of pericardial effusion and the rate of anti-SCL-70 positivity. Most of the PE detected were moderate, but large effusions often developed into tamponade.

### Unusual cause of pericardial effusion [^113sS5nE]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old Egyptian lady suffering from non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis was referred to our unit for evaluation of a massive pericardial effusion. A few weeks before presentation, she experienced progressive abdominal distention and dyspnea. She denied fever, rigors, or other cardiorespiratory symptoms. Examination revealed a shrunken liver, splenomegaly, and ascites. Her chest was clear to auscultation, and heart sounds were distant. A chest radiograph indicated cardiomegaly and clear lung fields. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the results of the abdominal examination. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a massive pericardial effusion (PEF) and rheumatic mitral stenosis. Chest tomography showed PEF and clear lung fields.

One liter of exudate was removed via TTE-guided needle pericardiocentesis. A pericardio-peritoneal shunt was suspected, which was confirmed via a radioisotopic study. This case is among the very few reported in the literature where PEF in a cirrhotic ascitic patient was secondary to a radio-isotopically confirmed pericardio-peritoneal shunt.

- **Oreo cookie sign**: Described in the title of a recent paper, the "Oreo cookie sign" refers to the aspect of the pericardial effusion which may be seen on the lateral chest radiograph (Fig. 24). Typically, the pericardial effusion causes an increased radiopacity of the pericardium, which appears to be anteriorly and posteriorly delimited by two radiolucent lines. These lines correspond respectively to the pericardial fat and the epicardial fat. It may be better and more often seen on CT images.

	- Fig. 24: Oreo cookie sign. On a lateral chest radiograph, the Oreo cookie sign is depicted: it consists of an increased radiopacity of the pericardium (black asterisk) — caused by pericardial effusion — which appears to be anteriorly and posteriorly delimited by two radiolucent lines (black arrows), caused by pericardial and epicardial fat. This radiographic pattern reproduces the so-called "Oreo cookie sign", similar to the famous biscuit.

- **Polo mint sign**: In the thoracic area, the "polo mint sign" refers to the typical aspect of acute pulmonary embolism, when the thrombosed vessel is seen on axial planes (Fig. 25). It has been described in a paper published in 2004 by Wittram et al. who described imaging findings of acute pulmonary embolism. The polo mint sign corresponds to the railway track sign, which instead describes the thrombosed vessel displayed according to a plane parallel to its major axis. It is found in contrast-enhanced CT examinations and is given by the presence of contrast material surrounding a central filling defect.

- **Figure 1**:
	- **A**: Chest X-ray reveals an enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette, levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine, and dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine.
	- **B**: CT pulmonary angiogram shows a dilated pulmonary trunk measuring at least 3.5 cm, with prominent peripheral pulmonary arteries.
	- **C**: Transthoracic echocardiogram in the parasternal short axis view reveals pericardial effusion.
	- **D**: Transthoracic echocardiogram in the apical view depicts pericardial effusion and right atrial wall compression. (LA: Left Atrium, LV: Left Ventricle, PE: Pericardial Effusion, RA: Right Atrium, RV: Right Ventricle)

The patient experienced a benign post-operative course and was observed during follow-up cardiac evaluation after discharge. A repeat echocardiogram at that time revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Fig. 2 A), normal left ventricular systolic function, and complete resolution of the previously noted pericardial effusion. However, her physical examination at that time showed mild-moderate bilateral lymphedema not previously noted on prior examinations. Given the constellation of cardiovascular findings — namely, the left ventricular hypertrophy of unknown etiology, large pericardial effusion, history of aorto-pulmonary collaterals, and new-onset lymphedema in a patient with non-specific dysmorphic features — a cardiomyopathy molecular studies panel was sent, identifying a pathogenic variant in the ABCC9 gene, confirming the molecular diagnosis of autosomal dominant Cantu syndrome. In light of the diagnosis of Cantu syndrome, the patient was referred for further genetic evaluation.

### Superior vena cava obstruction following pericardial effusion absorption in the presence of a pericardial teratoma: a case report [^114ihJwD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 4-month-old boy presented with 3 days of dry cough. The patient underwent chest radiography, which revealed cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.79 (Fig. 1). To determine the cause of the cardiomegaly, he underwent echocardiography, which confirmed the presence of massive pericardial effusion. Physical examination revealed no pedal edema, puffiness of the face, or indrawing of the chest cavity with inspiration. The liver and spleen were not palpable. Instead of pericardiocentesis, diuretic therapy was used to drain the pericardial effusion.

After 2 days of diuretic therapy, the patient's facial puffiness was noted. To determine the reason, the patient underwent echocardiography, which unexpectedly revealed a well-defined, multilocular, intrapericardial cystic mass with reduced pericardial effusion compared to earlier assessments. The mass, containing solid and lipid densities, compressed the superior vena cava (Fig. 2). Thoracic computed tomography angiography revealed that the mass originated from the anterolateral portion of the ascending aorta.

To alleviate the patient's condition and relieve the superior vena cava compression, surgical intervention was decided upon. A median sternotomy and pericardiotomy revealed a large encapsulated mass, measuring 6.0 × 5.5 × 4.0 cm, occupying a major portion of the pericardial space. The mass was primarily connected to the aorta, noticeably compressing the superior vena cava and displacing the right atrium posteriorly (Fig. 3). A portion of the adventitia of the aorta was resected along with the mass.

### Does this patient with a pericardial effusion have cardiac tamponade [^116tgjPz]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a state of hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac compression by fluid trapped in the pericardial space. The clinical examination may assist in the decision to perform pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade diagnosed by echocardiography.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the accuracy of the history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and 2006, reference lists of these articles, and reference lists of relevant textbooks.

- **Study selection**: We included articles that compared aspects of the clinical examination to a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade and excluded studies with fewer than 15 patients. Of 787 studies identified by our search strategy, 8 were included in our final analysis.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently reviewed articles for study results and quality. A third reviewer resolved disagreements.

- **Data synthesis**: All studies evaluated patients with known tamponade or those referred for pericardiocentesis with known effusion. Five features occur in the majority of patients with tamponade: dyspnea (sensitivity range, 87%-89%); tachycardia (pooled sensitivity, 77%; 95% confidence interval, 69%-85%); pulsus paradoxus (pooled sensitivity, 82%; 95% CI, 72%-92%); elevated jugular venous pressure (pooled sensitivity, 76%; 95% CI, 62%-90%); and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph (pooled sensitivity, 89%; 95% CI, 73%-100%).

### Tuberculosis revisited: Classic imaging findings in childhood [^116gG5iB]. Pediatric radiology (2023). Low credibility.

When pulmonary TB affects the pleura, pleural thickening, effusions (Fig. 7), and TB empyema can result as complications with or without pleural calcification. Pericardial effusion and pericarditis may also develop as complications of TB (Fig. 8). These complications can be further evaluated with US or cross-sectional imaging studies such as CT or MRI.

- **Fig. 7**: Posteroanterior chest radiograph in a 9-year-old girl with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis shows a large right-sided pleural effusion with minimum mediastinal shift due to underlying atelectasis.

- **Fig. 8**: Posteroanterior chest radiograph in a 6-year-old boy demonstrates a tuberculous pericardial effusion causing globular cardiomegaly.

On MRI, TB infection typically presents as consolidation with or without cavitation (low signal intensity on T2 and short tau inversion recovery sequences), ground-glass signal abnormality, pulmonary nodules, lymphadenopathy (low signal intensity on T2 and peripheral enhancement on T1 post-contrast sequences), and pleural effusion. A previously published study consisting of 40 consecutive paediatric patients with pulmonary TB showed that MRI with fast imaging sequences is comparable to CXR for evaluating underlying pulmonary consolidation, bronchiectasis, necrosis/abscess, and pleural effusion often associated with TB infection in children. It has been reported that MRI may be superior to CT for evaluating lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions, whereas ground-glass and small nodular, particularly tree-in-bud signal abnormalities, are better visualized on CT.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults [^111mD8Dn]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if the patient meets Light's criteria. The serum to pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients may help better categorize the occasional transudate misidentified as an exudate by these criteria.

If the patient has a transudative effusion, therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. If the patient has an exudative effusion, attempts should be made to define the etiology. Pneumonia, cancer, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism account for most exudative effusions. Many pleural fluid tests are useful in the differential diagnosis of exudative effusions. Other tests helpful for diagnosis include helical computed tomography and thoracoscopy.

### Point-of-care ultrasound evaluation of pericardial effusions: Does this patient have cardiac tamponade [^116FA3Yq]. Resuscitation (2011). Low credibility.

Detection of pericardial effusions using point-of-care focused echocardiography is becoming a common application for clinicians who care for critical patients. Identification of tamponade physiology is of great utility, as these patients require urgent evaluation and management. We describe techniques that the point-of-care clinician sonographer can use to determine the presence or absence of echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade.

### Diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases [^116Vc5ab]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The management of pericardial diseases is largely empirical due to the relative lack of randomized trials involving patients with these conditions. A first attempt to consolidate and organize knowledge resulted in the publication of the first guidelines on managing pericardial diseases. Nevertheless, several observational studies and initial randomized trials are advancing the management of pericardial diseases towards evidence-based medicine, particularly for pericarditis. Emerging data indicate that management can be tailored to the individual patient. Although the optimal duration of treatment is not clearly established, some recommendations can be formulated to guide management and follow-up.

Our data provide reassuring evidence that a small asymptomatic pericardial effusion (PE) coincidentally detected in an individual of the general population is not an unfavorable sign. Consequently, our results lend support to a more conservative approach to the diagnosis, treatment, and further monitoring of such individuals, particularly when incidental findings are encountered. Nevertheless, our results require confirmation in other cohorts.

One limitation of our study is the reliance on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as a technique that requires a good acoustic window and has limitations in imaging the entire pericardium. Thus, with TTE, we cannot determine with absolute certainty whether the observed substance is fluid, fat, or debris. In such cases, cardiac magnetic resonance would be the preferred method. However, cardiac magnetic resonance is not typically indicated for use in the general population; rather, it is considered a specialized diagnostic tool. Furthermore, our data set lacks sufficient information to offer further insights regarding moderate to large effusions.

The fact that 21% of the study participants did not attend the follow-up examination might have introduced attrition bias. However, nonparticipation in the follow-up examination was not associated with PE. Further, the resolution of PE from baseline to follow-up was nearly 3.5 times more frequent than the incidence of new cases. In a population without intervention, like ours, one would expect a steady state. This represents a typical situation where the measurement in a system (participants were told the results) inadvertently alters the system.

### Bedside echocardiography by emergency physicians [^113mFTh1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Timely diagnosis of a pericardial effusion is often critical in the emergency medicine setting, and echocardiography provides the only reliable method of diagnosis at the bedside. This study attempts to determine the accuracy of bedside echocardiography as performed by emergency physicians to detect pericardial effusions in a variety of high-risk populations.

- **Methods**: Emergency patients presenting with high-risk criteria for the diagnosis of pericardial effusion underwent emergency bedside 2-dimensional echocardiography by emergency physicians who were trained in ultrasonography. The presence or absence of a pericardial effusion was determined, and all images were captured on video or as thermal images. All emergency echocardiograms were subsequently reviewed by the Department of Cardiology for the presence of a pericardial effusion.

- **Results**: During the study period, a total of 515 patients at high risk were enrolled. Of these, 103 patients were ultimately deemed to have a pericardial effusion according to the comparative standard. Emergency physicians detected pericardial effusion with a sensitivity of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.4% to 98.9%), specificity of 98% (95% CI 95.8% to 99.1%), and overall accuracy of 97.5% (95% CI 95.7% to 98.7%).

- **Conclusion**: Echocardiography performed by emergency physicians is reliable in evaluating for pericardial effusions; this bedside diagnostic tool may be used to examine specific patients at high risk. Emergency departments incorporating bedside ultrasonography should teach focused echocardiography to evaluate the pericardial effusion effectively.

### Spontaneous secondary pneumothorax with concomitant malignant pericardial effusion in the context of metastatic synovial sarcoma [^111LxFEH]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A male ex-smoker in his 30s presented to a regional emergency department with worsening chest pain, presyncope, and dyspnoea on exertion on a background of treatment-resistant metastatic synovial sarcoma. The patient was undergoing palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine/docetaxel at the time of presentation.

His synovial sarcoma diagnosis was established 2 years prior following a biopsy of a slow-growing mass on the right abdominal wall. Histology revealed poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma, and a fluorescence in situ hybridisation assay confirmed the presence of the SS18-SSX rearrangement, a cytogenetic hallmark of synovial sarcoma. A whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan conducted 2 months later confirmed the abdominal mass as the primary location of the cancer, with no evidence of other avid mass lesions. The primary tumour was surgically resected 1 month after the PET scan, but computed tomography (CT) surveillance imaging revealed multiple lung metastases 6 months post-surgery.

CT imaging 1 month prior to presentation demonstrated progressive disease despite immunotherapeutic treatment with pazopanib (figure 1). Further, a CT pulmonary angiogram performed 2 weeks prior to presentation excluded a pulmonary embolus.

- **Figure 1**: Axial CT of the chest 1 month prior to presentation showing large bilateral lower lung metastatic lesions (arrows) and a small pericardial effusion (asterisk). Multiple small left lower lobe metastases are also visible.

On examination, dual heart sounds were present but were muffled.

### Misconceptions and facts about pericardial effusion and tamponade [^112yLtvs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Several common misconceptions can make the clinical diagnosis of subacute pericardial tamponade challenging. Widely known physical findings of pericardial tamponade lack sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation of echocardiographic signs requires a good understanding of pathophysiology. Over-reliance on echocardiography may result in the over-utilization of pericardial drainage procedures. Awareness of these misconceptions, coupled with an integrative approach to both clinical and imaging data, will help clinicians assess the hemodynamic impact of pericardial effusion and the necessity for drainage.

### A straight left heart border: A new radiological sign of a hemopericardium [^114bZgkX]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Detection of a cardiac injury in a stable patient following a penetrating chest injury can be difficult. Ultrasound of the pericardial sac may be associated with a false negative result in the presence of a hemothorax. A filling in of the left heart border inferior to the pulmonary artery, called the straight left heart border (SLHB), is a radiological sign on chest X-ray that we have found to be associated with the finding of a hemopericardium at surgery. The aim of the present study was to determine if this was a reliable and reproducible sign.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study of patients with a penetrating chest injury admitted between 1 October 2001 and 28 February 2009, who had no indication for immediate surgery, and were taken to the operating room for creation of a subxiphoid pericardial window (SPW). The chest X-ray was reviewed by a single trauma surgeon prior to surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 162 patients with a possible occult cardiac injury underwent creation of a SPW. Fifty-five of the 162 patients (34%) were noted to have a SLHB on chest X-ray and a hemopericardium confirmed at SPW. The sensitivity of the SLHB sign was 40%; specificity, 84%; and positive predictive value, 89%. (p = 0.005, Odds ratio 3.48, lower 1.41, upper 8.62).

- **Conclusions**: The straight left heart border is a newly described radiological sign that was highly significant in predicting the presence of a hemopericardium and should alert the clinician to a possible occult cardiac injury.

### Significant incidental cardiac disease on thoracic CT: What the general radiologist needs to know [^115vBnnC]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Hemopericardium: Pericardial effusion occurs when more than 60 mL of fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac. Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion is better characterized on unenhanced CT, measuring between 40 and 60 HU (Hounsfield units), compared to less than 10 HU for simple fluid/transudates and between 10 to 20 HU for exudates. Hemopericardium can occur following left ventricular free wall rupture in myocardial infarction, with ventricular or coronary aneurysmal rupture, in postsurgical patients, in the setting of trauma, and with malignancy.

Non-contrast axial image from a dedicated aortic CT through the lower chest shows hemopericardium in a 43-year-old male being evaluated for congestive heart failure and low ejection fraction, following aortic valve surgery.

Pericardial calcification: Pericardial calcification commonly results from trauma, infection, hemorrhage, or therapeutic radiation. Traumatic etiologies include surgical exploration during pericardiotomy for cardiac shunt surgery. Tuberculosis and histoplasmosis as infectious etiologies are now less commonly seen in the developed world. Calcification resulting from radiation will conform to the radiation port used. The calcification may be a focal plaque or a thin curvilinear focus following the cardiac contour. Lesions are usually 1 to 2 mm thick but can increase to 1 to 2 cm in thickness in chronic cases. Pericardial calcification is most commonly found in the atrioventricular (AV) groove and in the lower and diaphragmatic portions of the pericardium.

### Associated pleural and pericardial effusions: An extensive differential explored [^111URRzh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pleural and pericardial effusions are common findings; however, their differential diagnosis often remains uncertain. A Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and various other etiologies. Notably, a single retrospective study has specifically addressed this presentation. Several principles for a diagnostic workup are suggested, emphasizing that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and may remain classified as 'idiopathic'.

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112bpTYj]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a frequently encountered disorder. Increased venous or lymphatic pressure is the common etiology of simple pericardial effusion; however, rheumatologic diseases, infection, malignancy, and trauma may also cause pericardial effusion. Pericardial thickening could be associated with pericardial effusion. The differentiation of benign and malignant pericardial effusions by imaging could be challenging. Echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in the evaluation of pericardial effusions. However, there could be limitations in the detection of fluid due to acoustic windows and in cases of loculated fluid (Fig. 5). MRI is more sensitive than echocardiography in the detection of small collections, mostly in loculated fluid. CT may also demonstrate the extension of effusion. Post-contrast images, particularly fat-saturated T1-weighted MR images, may reveal the presence of pericardial thickening. The contents of pericardial effusion, either sampled or diagnosed by imaging (i.e. hemorrhagic, serous, or pyogenic), may give a clue for the etiology.

A 61-year-old man with right heart failure symptoms underwent a CT scan to rule out the presence of pulmonary artery embolism. The axial contrast-enhanced CT image shows a significantly compressed right ventricle (arrow) due to the loculated pericardial effusion (asterisk).

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^117ACVzX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A pericardial effusion (PE) is a common finding in patients with chronic cardiac failure, postoperative cardiac surgery patients, or those with certain infectious, benign, or malignant diseases. PEs are often diagnosed either as incidental findings or when related to systemic or cardiac disease. The clinical spectrum of patients with pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. Management is guided by the hemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (e.g. pericarditis), and etiology. Drainage of the PE is necessary for cardiac tamponade, symptomatic moderate to large effusions, and when a bacterial or neoplastic etiology is suspected.

Surgical pericardial drainage procedures, known as "pericardial windows", are often requested for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The perceived diagnostic benefit is that it allows for the determination of malignancy or infection in patients with PEs of unclear etiology through testing of the pericardial fluid and tissue. The purpose of the study was to determine the diagnostic yield of surgical drainage procedures.

### Rapid fire: Pericardial effusion and tamponade [^114rZ3tu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

One of the most common causes of pericardial effusion in the Western world is malignancy. Emergency physicians must maintain vigilance in suspecting pericardial effusion and tamponade in patients with known or suspected malignancy who present with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypotension. Diagnosis can be expedited by key physical examination, electrocardiogram, and sonographic findings. Unstable or crashing patients with tamponade must undergo emergent pericardiocentesis for removal of fluid and pressure to restore cardiac output.

### Management of pericardial effusion [^115p9D9k]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a common finding in clinical practice, either as an incidental finding or as a manifestation of a systemic or cardiac disease. The spectrum of pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. The etiology is varied, including infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, metabolic, and drug-related causes, with tuberculosis being the leading cause of pericardial effusions in developing countries and worldwide. Moreover, HIV infection may play an important promoting role in this setting.

Management is guided by the hemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), associated medical conditions, and etiology whenever possible. Pericardiocentesis is mandatory for cardiac tamponade and when a bacterial or neoplastic etiology is suspected. Pericardial biopsy is generally reserved for cases with recurrent cardiac tamponade or persistence without a defined etiology, especially when a bacterial or neoplastic etiology is suspected and cannot be assessed by other conventional and less invasive means.

A true isolated effusion may not require specific treatment if the patient is asymptomatic, but large effusions are at risk of progressing to cardiac tamponade (up to one-third of cases). Pericardiocentesis alone may be curative for large effusions, but recurrences are also common. Pericardiectomy or less invasive options (i.e. pericardial window) should be considered for recurrent cardiac tamponade or symptomatic pericardial effusion, whether circumferential or loculated. The aim of this paper was to summarize and critically evaluate the management of pericardial effusion.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion [^115xuVJx]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion affects more than 1.5 million people in the United States each year and often complicates the management of heart failure, pneumonia, and malignancy. Pleural effusion occurs when fluid collects between the parietal and visceral pleura. Processes causing a distortion in body fluid mechanics, such as in heart failure or nephrotic syndrome, tend to cause transudative effusions, whereas localized inflammatory or malignant processes are often associated with exudative effusions. Patients can be asymptomatic or can present with cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain. Dullness to percussion on physical examination suggests an effusion; chest radiography can confirm the diagnosis. Thoracentesis may be indicated to diagnose effusion and relieve symptoms. Ultrasound guidance is preferred when aspirating fluid. Routine assays for aspirated fluid include protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels, Gram staining, cytology, and pH measurement. Light's criteria should be used to differentiate exudative from transudative effusions. Additional laboratory assays, bronchoscopy, percutaneous pleural biopsy, or thoracoscopy may be required for diagnosis if the initial test results are inconclusive.

### Imaging of urgencies and emergencies in the lung cancer patient [^112gUB4c]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion in oncology patients may develop by four mechanisms: direct extension or metastatic spread, chemotherapeutic toxicity, radiation toxicity, or as an opportunistic infection. Primary lung cancer is the most common cause, accounting for over one-third of malignant pericardial effusions. Only a small percentage of patients with a malignant pericardial effusion develop cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency. Cardiac tamponade results from an accumulation of pericardial fluid leading to an impaired ventricular filling with decreased cardiac output and can occur with as little as 200 mL of pericardial fluid. Symptoms suggestive of cardiac tamponade are dyspnoea, non-specific chest pain, and fatigue.

Because of its high sensitivity for the detection of pericardial fluid, echocardiography is considered the primary imaging modality of choice to assess cardiac tamponade. A chest radiograph may show an enlarged cardiac silhouette with a characteristic "water bottle" appearance. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow for a functional evaluation of the heart as well as the characterization of the pericardial effusion. CT findings of a thickened, enhancing, or nodular pericardium and high-density fluid suggest a malignant pericardial effusion. Signs suggestive of right heart failure include hepatic congestion and contrast reflux in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. Other secondary findings indicative of a possible tamponade include enlargement of the superior vena cava (SVC) with a diameter greater than the aorta and enlargement of the inferior vena cava.

### The diagnostic value of chest X-ray scanning by the help of artificial intelligence in heart failure (ART-IN-HF) [^113m2uhH]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Typical signs of heart failure (HF), like increased cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and pleural effusion, can be seen on X-ray. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help in the early and quicker diagnosis of HF.

- **Objectives**: The study's goal was to demonstrate that the AI interpretation of chest X-rays can assist the clinician in diagnosing HF.

- **Methods**: Patients older than 45 years were included in the study. The study analyzed 10,100 deidentified outpatient chest X-rays by AI algorithm. The AI-generated report was later verified by an independent radiologist. Patients with CTR > 0.5 and pleural effusion were marked as potential HF. Flagged patients underwent confirmatory tests, and those labeled as negative also underwent further investigations to rule out HF.

- **Results**: Out of 10,100, the AI algorithm detected 183 (1.8%) patients with increased CTR and pleural effusion on chest X-rays. One hundred and six out of 183 underwent diagnostic tests. Eighty-two (77%) out of 106 were diagnosed with HF according to guidelines. From the remaining 9,917 patients, 106 patients were randomly selected. Nine (8%) out of them were diagnosed with HF. The positive predictive value of AI for diagnosing HF is 77%, and the negative predictive value is 91%. More than half (54.9%) of newly diagnosed patients had HF with preserved ejection fraction.

- **Conclusion**: HF is a risky condition with nonspecific symptoms that are difficult to diagnose, especially in the early stages. Using AI assistance for X-ray interpretation can be helpful for early diagnosis of HF, especially HF with preserved ejection fraction.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pericarditis, specifically with respect to transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining TTE to assess for pericardial effusion in intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain. Consider obtaining TTE to detect pericardial abnormalities in intermediate-high-risk patients with stable chest pain with Q waves, symptoms or signs suggestive of heart failure (HF), or a heart murmur with an unclear diagnosis.

### Computed tomography-guided pericardiocentesis: Utility in the management of malignant pericardial effusion [^113RVh5m]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography is an established means of diagnosing a pericardial effusion and has become the reference guidance modality for the drainage of symptomatic collections. However, echocardiographic drainage is not feasible in all patients due to a variety of technical and patient-related factors. Computed tomography (CT)-directed pericardiocentesis using a standard Seldinger technique is an alternative means of draining pericardial effusions and overcomes many of the limitations associated with echocardiography. We present a case in which a CT-guided approach was used to successfully drain a malignant pericardial effusion in the emergent setting. Clinicians should be aware of the potential role of CT in this context.

### Prognostic utility of pericardial effusion in the general population: Findings from the STAAB cohort study [^117RHaiZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical perspective**: Pericardial effusion (PE) is defined as an accumulation of fluid within the pericardial cavity. Virtually any process that affects the pericardium can lead to an effusion. PE often occurs as an epiphenomenon in patients with pericardial, malignant, or inflammatory disease. However, PE can also occur in healthy individuals. Most PEs are not hemodynamically relevant and remain asymptomatic. The incidental finding of PE, hence, challenges treating physicians as they must deal with the dilemma of ordering advanced diagnostics to avoid missing a potentially relevant diagnosis, as well as uncertainty and discomfort for the patient, and additional costs for the healthcare system.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American Society of Echocardiography guidelines recommend 2‐dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as the reference imaging modality for any suspected pericardial disease or effusion (Class of Level of Evidence, lC). TTE is a cost‐effective, widely available, and safe method that allows for a comprehensive assessment of the size, location, and hemodynamic relevance of PE. In TTE, PE appears as an echo‐free space between the two layers of the pericardium that persists throughout the cardiac cycle. It can be classified on the basis of various factors, including size, distribution, composition, hemodynamic impact, and time of onset. The size of PE can be categorized semiquantitatively by echocardiography into small (20 mm). Clinically, the spectrum ranges from small asymptomatic PE to…

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112y1wXU]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The pericardium can be involved in a variety of clinical disorders. The imaging findings are not specific for an individual pathology in most cases; however, the patient's clinical history may guide the radiologist to a definitive diagnosis. Congenital absence of the pericardium can be recognized with the imaging appearance of interposed lung tissue between the main pulmonary artery and aorta. Pericardial effusion is a non-specific condition that may occur due to inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disorders. Cardiac tamponade may occur in cases of massive or rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac.

Pericardial calcification is a common and easily identified entity on a computed tomography (CT) scan. The presence of calcification and/or fibrosis may result in pericardial constriction. Nevertheless, the pulsation of an adjacent coronary artery may prevent calcification formation in a focal area, consequently resulting in a pericardial diverticulum containing epicardial fat and the coronary artery. The imaging findings encountered in patients with pericardial hydatid disease and Erdheim-Chester disease may mimic those of pericardial neoplasia.

Pericardial adhesions and pedicled fat flaps may cause confusion on a CT scan in the post-surgical period following cardiac surgery. Pericardial fat necrosis can be diagnosed by CT in patients with chest pain. Radiologists should be familiar with the medical devices placed in the pericardial space for certain individual indications. A pericardial patch and temporary epicardial pacemaker wires can be identified on a CT scan.

### A pictorial review of traumatic pericardial injuries [^112W8gRZ]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a cardinal role in the diagnosis and triage of patients with pericardial injuries. FAST ultrasound with a pericardial window is the preferred initial examination due to its rapidity and high accuracy. Plain radiography has a very low sensitivity for cardiac and pericardial injuries but proves useful in evaluating associated injuries such as pneumothorax and haemothorax. CT is the modality of choice for stable patients, accurately diagnosing a range of traumatic pathologies of the heart and pericardium. It is particularly useful in identifying cardiac herniation.

### Immunotherapy related pericardial effusion on chest CT [^113Svtqh]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy has become a critical class of anticancer therapy in recent years, functioning by releasing brakes on the immune system that ultimately results in immune cell activation which eliminates cancer cells. Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) are a specific type of adverse event described in patients taking checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, resulting from unrestrained immune activation. Immune-related pericardial effusion has been described; however, it has not been comprehensively characterized. Here, we present the most extensive report at the time of writing detailing this adverse event.

- **Methods**: We queried our medical record system to retrospectively identify patients on checkpoint inhibitor therapy for lung cancer who subsequently developed pericardial effusion. We analyzed the clinical and radiographic characteristics, prior therapies, treatment for the effusion, and outcomes in patients with immune-related pericardial effusion and compared them to similar patients with pericardial effusion not attributable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

- **Results**: Our data demonstrate that most of these pericardial effusions were small and not clinically significant. The majority were successfully treated with steroids or resolved spontaneously. Anti-PD-1 inhibitors were the most common checkpoint inhibitor preceding pericardial effusion, and a significant number of patients who went on to develop IRAE pericardial effusion previously had treatment with carboplatin for their cancer.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that IRAE pericardial effusion is not a clinically significant condition.

### A 49-year-old with chest pain and collapse [^112Wf8Mg]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

The correct answer is left ventricular pseudoaneurysm. CT angiography demonstrates a large pericardial effusion with superior extension into the aortic and pulmonary recesses. The pericardium is not calcified, and the pericardial fluid has a CT number of 43 Hounsfield units, suggesting recent blood accumulation. There is discontinuity of the inferolateral wall with a filling defect containing iodinated contrast and no extravasation into the pericardial space. This is a contained rupture of the inferolateral left ventricular wall with thrombus formation preventing catastrophic exsanguination.

There is no intimal flap or aortic wall hematoma to indicate acute aortic syndrome. Left ventricular diverticula are outpouchings of myocardium usually found at the apex, which in combination with diaphragmatic and sternal defects, constitute Cantrell's syndrome. Blunt cardiac trauma often involves the right heart chambers due to their close proximity to the sternum in conjunction with deceleration injuries involving the great vessels. Malignant effusions are often blood-stained but not associated with myocardial wall rupture.

Surgical evacuation and patching of the pseudoaneurysm were performed to relieve cardiac tamponade (see Figure 2 and online supplementary movie). The infarcted tissue was mature, with macroscopic scarring. Contained rupture is rare following myocardial infarction and confers a poor prognosis (75% in-hospital mortality). It is typically a late complication of myocardial infarction, diagnosed within 6 months following episodes of chest pain.

### Pericardial effusions: Causes, diagnosis, and management [^111qQ9VF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The presentation of a patient with a pericardial effusion can range from an incidental finding to a life-threatening emergency. Accordingly, the causes of pericardial effusions are numerous and can generally be divided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory etiologies. For all patients with a suspected pericardial effusion, echocardiography is essential to define the location and size of an effusion.

In pericardial tamponade, the hemodynamics relate to decreased pericardial compliance, ventricular interdependence, and an inspiratory decrease in the pressure gradient for left ventricular filling. Echocardiography provides insight into the pathophysiologic alterations, primarily through an assessment of chamber collapse, inferior vena cava plethora, and marked respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow. Once diagnosed, pericardiocentesis is performed in patients with tamponade, preferably with echocardiographic guidance.

With a large effusion but no tamponade, pericardiocentesis is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes, though it is performed if there is concern for a bacterial infection. In patients with malignancy, a pericardial window is preferred given the risk for recurrence. Finally, large effusions can progress to tamponade but can generally be followed closely until the extent of the effusion facilitates safe pericardiocentesis.

### Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade as a cardiac manifestation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^114sYK5g]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease in children. It is an X-linked hereditary dystrophinopathy due to the absence of dystrophin. Its onset typically occurs in early childhood, presenting with proximal distribution of weakness and a progressive course. Cardiac involvement in DMD is common, usually beginning after the age of 10 years. The most prevalent cardiac manifestations include dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmia. However, pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade is a very rare cardiac complication of DMD.

We report a boy with DMD who initially presented with progressive dyspnea and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiography. He subsequently developed a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. Early recognition of pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade is crucial for instituting appropriate therapy.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: a pictorial review [^113WKQDs]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder and the most prevalent pericardial disease. It typically presents with sharp, pleuritic chest pain due to irritation of the pericardium. Any type of pericardial effusion, whether inflammatory or hemorrhagic, may eventually result in constrictive pericarditis. Causes include post-myocardial infarction (Dressler syndrome), post-surgical conditions, irradiation therapy, infectious agents, systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic disorders, malignancy, and idiopathic factors.

CT is well-accepted for evaluating pericarditis, though for assessing constriction, echocardiography and MRI are more reliable. Findings may include exudative or transudative loculated fluid in the pericardial sac, where differences in attenuation can be helpful. Thickening of the pericardial wall is often observed, and enhancement of the pericardial wall can be appreciated, especially in active inflammatory pericarditis. Calcifications are present in 50 percent of patients. Additional findings may include pleural effusions and ascites. It is crucial to recognize signs of constriction, such as those illustrated in Fig. 7.

- **Figure description**: A 44-year-old male patient with constrictive pericarditis.
	- (a-b) CT images in axial views show the thickened pericardium (arrows).
	- (a) The right atrium (RA) and left atrium (LA) are enlarged.
	- (b) Note the abnormal shape of the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV), as well as inferior vena cava (IVC) enlargement. The patient also had a pleural effusion (PL) as a sign of decompensated heart failure, which are among the signs of constriction.

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112AwRW3]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The pericardium can be involved in various benign and malignant disorders. Plain radiography has limited value since pericardial disorders may not be differentiated from various types of mediastinal and/or cardiac pathologies on roentgenograms. Nevertheless, in cases of pneumopericardium, plain radiography may provide a definite diagnosis yet may not reveal the underlying cause. Computed tomography (CT) is the most widely used modality for evaluating the pericardium; however, ultrasound can be easily and rapidly performed to reveal the presence of pericardial effusion, a crucial finding, particularly in trauma patients.

CT can reveal pericardial calcifications, extension of pericardial collections and tumors, pneumopericardium and its underlying cause, pericardial/epipericardial fat necrosis, foreign bodies, and medical devices placed in the pericardial space. However, soft tissue infiltration of the pericardium cannot be differentiated from accompanying pericardial effusion by CT in rare cases, such as in Erdheim-Chester disease or inflammatory constrictive pericarditis. In such cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can replace CT due to its superior soft tissue contrast resolution.

### Rare cause of pericardial effusion: 'Erdheim-Chester disease' [^116Ex897]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

This report details the case of a woman in her 50s who presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure and raised inflammatory biochemical markers. Her investigations included an echocardiogram, which revealed a large pericardial effusion, and a subsequent CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis showed extensive retroperitoneal, pericardial, and periaortic inflammation and soft-tissue infiltration. Genetic analysis of histopathological samples detected a V600E or V600Ec missense variant within codon 600 of the BRAF gene with BRAF variants, confirming the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD).

The patient's clinical management involved several treatments and interventions with input from a variety of clinical specialties. This included the cardiology team for pericardiocentesis, the cardiac surgical team for pericardiectomy due to recurrent pericardial effusions, and finally the hematology team for further specialist treatment with pegylated interferon and consideration of BRAF inhibitor therapy. The patient became stable following treatment with significant improvement in her heart failure symptoms and remains under regular joint cardiology and hematology team follow-up.

The case highlighted the importance of using a multidisciplinary approach to best manage the multisystem involvement of ECD.

### A contemporary look at pericardiocentesis [^112ba6Nz]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Percutaneous drainage is the default strategy for evacuating a pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis can be necessary or required in a wide variety of clinical settings, ranging from urgent tamponade relief to iatrogenic hemorrhagic effusions in the electrophysiology or catheterization room, to planned diagnostic procedures in patients with suspected or known malignancy or infections.

With the help of several procedural improvements over the past decades, echocardiography and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous pericardiocentesis has become the standard intervention for evacuating pericardial effusions. It is also an essential tool in the diagnostic work-up of an unexplained pericardial effusion. When performed by skilled physicians assisted by appropriate imaging, it is a very safe procedure. Provided that an indwelling catheter is placed, it is also very effective with an acceptably low risk of recurrences.

In this review, the indications and standard techniques for pericardiocentesis are discussed, as well as their consequences for patients with iatrogenic and malignant effusions.

### A pictorial review of traumatic pericardial injuries [^117U9G6q]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The chest radiograph has an established role in the initial trauma series; however, it is limited in its ability to identify pericardial and cardiac injuries. The main role of the chest radiograph is to identify other associated injuries, such as pneumothoraces, haemothoraces, and pulmonary contusions. Plain radiograph findings that may indicate a potential pericardial injury include an enlarged and/or globular cardiac outline (secondary to a pericardial effusion), pneumopericardium, and alteration of the cardiac axis.

Regarding a traumatic pericardial effusion, a normal cardiac silhouette occurs in up to 80% of trauma patients with acute tamponade, as the pericardium has not had time to stretch. The accumulation of approximately 250 mL of fluid is required to enlarge the cardiac silhouette on a chest radiograph. However, the accumulation of only 100–200 mL of fluid/blood within the pericardial space can result in physiological compromise and cardiac tamponade.

The finding of pneumopericardium should alert the radiologist to consider the loss of pericardial integrity. In severe cases, a tension pneumopericardium can develop, resulting in a 'small heart' sign. Furthermore, the combination of pneumopericardium with displacement of the heart should alert the reporting radiologist to the possibility of cardiac herniation secondary to a pericardial tear. In the absence of pneumopericardium, displacement of the heart to the right or left without an obvious cause, such as compressive pneumothorax, haemothorax, air trapping in the lung, or atelectasis, should be noted.

### Pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade in a 10-year-old male [^1154rH2H]. Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old male with a past medical history of premature pubarche, mild persistent asthma, and eczema presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. On examination, he was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic. A chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and scattered atelectasis. An echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU for pericardiocentesis and drain placement. As he later became hypertensive and febrile, we will discuss how our patient's hospital course guided our differential diagnosis and how we arrived at a definitive diagnosis using a multidisciplinary approach.

### Cardiac and pericardial calcifications on chest radiographs [^114ye1oA]. Clinical Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Many types of cardiac and pericardial calcifications identified on chest radiographs can be recognized and distinguished based on characteristic locations and appearances. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the importance of detecting cardiac and pericardial calcifications on chest radiographs and to illustrate and describe the various types of calcifications that may be encountered, as well as how they may be differentiated from one another. Each type of cardiac and pericardial calcification is discussed, its location and appearance described, and its significance explained. Recognizing and understanding these calcifications is important because they are often encountered in daily practice and play a significant role in patient care.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^113cpZjm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In the present patient cohort, the underlying diagnosis of effusion was established based on pericardial fluid characteristics obtained by pericardiocentesis, using routine tests including cytology, microbiology, serology, and biochemistry, as per clinical indication. The sensitivity of pericardial fluid cytology ranges from 66.7% to 92%, depending heavily on the gold standard used per study (e.g. follow-up, pericardial biopsy, postmortem autopsy) but is nevertheless considered a valid and useful diagnostic tool.

Variation also exists between series on what should be classified as a definite malignant effusion; some authors consider cytology-negative fluid as constituting a malignant effusion if the patient has a known malignancy. In contrast with these analyses, we chose to limit malignant effusion to those with a proven positive cytology, as determined by a pathologist, and to classify cytology-negative patients as idiopathic in the absence of another plausible cause, even when they had an underlying cancer. For this reason, and despite the context of a large tertiary care cohort, our number of malignant effusions is slightly lower than in other reports. Consequently, about 1 in 4 patients ultimately was categorized as having no definite underlying cause of effusion (i.e. the idiopathic group); however, almost half had a known malignancy and could not be distinguished from cytology-positive patients in terms of long-term outcome. If we take this into account, our data are consistent with previous studies in the sense that neoplasia was the most common.

### Pericardial involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Prevalence, associates, and clinical implications [^1111tTRe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In a large prospective cohort of consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 infection, which encompasses the entire spectrum of disease severity, pericardial effusion is common but rarely attributable to acute pericarditis or myocarditis. Nevertheless, it is associated with myocardial dysfunction and excess mortality. To achieve significant clinical value for risk stratification, a limited echocardiographic examination, including LVEF, TAPSE, and evaluation for the presence of pericardial effusion, is sufficient.

### A case of Meigs' syndrome with preceding pericardial effusion in advance of pleural effusion [^114gYwrn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

It is of great interest that in our case, pericardial effusion preceded pleural effusion. Not only did pleural effusion and ascites resolve, but pericardial effusion also disappeared without reaccumulation after the removal of the ovarian tumor. Any other possible causes of pericardial effusion, such as infectious pericarditis, malignancy, and connective tissue disease, were not plausible in our case, although long-term follow-up is necessary to detect signs of lung cancer recurrence. Therefore, we considered that the pericardial effusion was associated with the ovarian fibroma.

The presence of preceding pericardial effusion cannot be explained by a common hypothesis suggesting that hydrothorax is secondary to ascites in Meigs' syndrome, as it is difficult for ascites to move directly into the pericardial space via the peritoneal cavity. Preceding pericardial effusion may imply that substances such as inflammatory cytokines and hormonal stimulation caused by the tumor play an important role in the accumulation of fluid in Meigs' syndrome. Interestingly, Mertin et al. reported an atypical case of Meigs' syndrome with bilateral pleural effusion and without ascites in a granulosa cell tumor.

The most appropriate treatment for Meigs' syndrome is removal of the tumor. The pleural effusion and ascites resolve within a few weeks after tumor resection. A unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is commonly performed for the treatment of an ovarian tumor. For women who desire preservation of the ovary, an ovarian cystectomy may be performed with complete excision of the fibromatous tissue.

### A case of Meigs' syndrome with preceding pericardial effusion in advance of pleural effusion [^114SsEzR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Meigs' syndrome is defined as the presence of a benign ovarian tumor with pleural effusion and ascites that resolve after removal of the tumor. The pathogenesis of the production of ascites and pleural effusion in this syndrome remains unknown. Aside from pleural effusion and ascites, pericardial effusion is rarely observed in Meigs' syndrome. Here, we report the first case of Meigs' syndrome with preceding pericardial effusion in advance of pleural effusion.

- **Case presentation**: An 84-year-old Japanese non-smoking woman with a history of lung cancer, treated by surgery, was admitted due to gradual worsening of dyspnea that had occurred over the previous month. She had asymptomatic and unchanging pericardial effusion and a pelvic mass, which had been detected 3 and 11 years previously, respectively. The patient was radiologically followed-up without the need for treatment.

Two months before admission, the patient underwent a right upper lobectomy for localized lung adenocarcinoma, and intraoperative pericardial fenestration confirmed that the pericardial effusion was not malignant. However, she began to experience dyspnea on exertion leading to admission. A chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of right-sided pleural and pericardial effusion and ascites with a left ovarian mass. Repeated thoracentesis produced cultures that were negative for any microorganism, and no malignant cells were detected in the pleural effusions. Pleural fluid accumulation persisted despite a tube thoracostomy for pleural effusion drainage.

### What echocardiographic findings suggest a pericardial effusion is causing tamponade [^1114eNnt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pericardial tamponade is neither a clinical nor an echocardiographic diagnosis alone. The echocardiogram carries diagnostic value and should be performed when there is suspicion for tamponade based on the history and physical exam. A pericardial effusion uncovered on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be mistaken for tamponade and thereby lead to inappropriate and invasive management with pericardiocentesis.

- **Objective**: This narrative review will summarize the echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that support the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade. It will provide a succinct description of the core findings for which emergency physicians should evaluate at the bedside, along with potential pearls and pitfalls in this evaluation. Labeled images and video clips are included.

- **Discussion**: The core echocardiographic findings of pericardial tamponade consist of a pericardial effusion, diastolic right ventricular collapse (high specificity), systolic right atrial collapse (earliest sign), a plethoric inferior vena cava with minimal respiratory variation (high sensitivity), and exaggerated respiratory cycle changes in mitral and tricuspid valve inflow velocities as a surrogate for pulsus paradoxus.

- **Conclusion**: The emergency physician must recognize and understand the core echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that suggest pericardial tamponade. Together with the history and clinical exam, these findings can help make the overall diagnosis and determine management.

### Pleural and pericardial effusions as prognostic factors in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: A multicenter study [^1143RU38]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening cardiovascular disease with 30-day mortality rates ranging from 0.5% to over 20%, depending on clinical symptoms at presentation. However, there are also low-risk clinical presentations without serious complications. Therefore, immediate risk stratification of patients with acute PE at the time of presentation is crucial for patient care.

The CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been established as the diagnostic clinical gold standard for PE diagnosis, with a reported sensitivity and specificity of up to 100%. It is the first imaging performed in these patients, most commonly directly after admission to the hospital. Therefore, risk stratification based on CTPA is important.

Contrast reflux into the inferior vena cava and right ventricular strain have been described as important prognostic CT signs. However, there is a definite need to further utilize the CTPA images for prognostic stratification in PE.

Pleural effusions occur in 30–50% of patients with PE. Although frequently observed in patients with PE, the exact prevalence of pleural effusion is difficult to determine due to heterogeneous published results. However, PE is a common cause of pleural effusion, ranking fourth after congestive heart failure, cancer, and pneumonia. Although it is now clear that pleural effusion has a high incidence in patients with PE and is closely associated with the prognosis of PE, the results of recent studies investigating the prognostic relevance of pleural effusion are still inconclusive.

### A rare case of right atrial perforation and pericardial tamponade following leakage of bone cement [^114Hbyad]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

To identify leaks in patients following bone cement procedures, in addition to CT of the surgical site, chest X-ray or chest CT should be performed to rule out potential bone cement leaks leading to pulmonary embolism or cardiac foreign bodies. When cardiothoracic surgeons encounter symptoms such as chest pain, unexplained pericardial effusion, or even pulmonary embolism with no clear cause following recent vertebroplasty, it is essential to not only rule out underlying cardiac and pulmonary conditions but also to consider the possibility of cardiac perforation due to bone cement. This can often be identified by the appearance of a long, high-density shadow on chest CT scans. For critically ill or unstable patients, bedside echocardiography is crucial to detect pericardial effusion and guide appropriate intervention.

In patients with penetrating heart injuries, echocardiography is a critical diagnostic and assessment tool, offering a rapid and reliable method for evaluation. It is a non-invasive, radiation-free technique that can be easily performed at the bedside, making it highly convenient for repeated use in clinical settings. Research has demonstrated that echocardiography is highly accurate in detecting pericardial effusion, with sensitivity ranging from 96 to 97% and specificity approaching 100%. It is also valuable in further characterizing foreign bodies within the heart muscle and chambers. Echocardiography provides a visual and real-time representation of the cardiac structure, valve function, hemodynamic conditions within the chambers, and regional function.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder that has multiple causes and presents in various primary-care and secondary-care settings. New diagnostic techniques have improved the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid, allowing comprehensive characterization of cause. Despite these advances, pericarditis is most commonly idiopathic. Radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become important causes. Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases.

Integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains a clinical challenge, but is facilitated by tissue Doppler and color M-mode echocardiography. Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and provides symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might become a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112pAvHX]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The pericardium can be involved in a variety of clinical disorders. The imaging findings are not specific for an individual pathology in most cases; however, a patient's clinical history may guide the radiologist to a definitive diagnosis. Congenital absence of the pericardium can be recognized by the imaging appearance of interposed lung tissue between the main pulmonary artery and aorta. Pericardial effusion is a non-specific condition that may occur due to inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disorders. Cardiac tamponade may occur in the case of massive or rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac.

Pericardial calcification is a common and easily identified entity on a computed tomography (CT) scan. The presence of calcification and/or fibrosis may result in pericardial constriction. Nevertheless, the pulsation of an adjacent coronary artery may prevent calcification formation in a focal area and consequently result in a pericardial diverticulum containing epicardial fat and the coronary artery. Imaging findings encountered in patients with pericardial hydatid disease and Erdheim-Chester disease may mimic those of pericardial neoplasia.

- **Post-surgical period following cardiac surgery**: Pericardial adhesions and pedicled fat flaps may cause confusion on a CT scan. Pericardial fat necrosis can be diagnosed by CT in patients with chest pain. Radiologists should be familiar with the medical devices placed in the pericardial space for certain individual indications. A pericardial patch and temporary epicardial pacemaker wires can be identified on a CT scan.

European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pericardial effusion, more specifically with respect to chest radiographs, the EACTS/ESC 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a CXR in patients with a suspicion of pericardial effusion or pleuropulmonary involvement.
