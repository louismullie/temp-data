## Question

What causes high bilirubin levels and what are complications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes high bilirubin levels and what complications can result, covering bilirubin metabolism, hyperbilirubinemia classification, key differentiators, and complications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology of bilirubin and how labs report and interpret it. Then, I should classify etiologies by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic mechanisms. Next, I will consider population-specific causes in neonates and adults. After that, I should define key differentiators, including direct-to-total bilirubin ratios and when to image. Finally, I need to outline complications and link them to thresholds and settings, and close with pragmatic evaluation and management signals, all with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational physiology and thresholds before moving to causes. Bilirubin is the end-product of heme catabolism and circulates as water-insoluble unconjugated bilirubin bound to albumin until hepatocellular uptake and UGT1A1-mediated conjugation render it water soluble for biliary excretion; jaundice typically becomes visible when total bilirubin exceeds about 3 mg/dL, and most laboratories routinely report total bilirubin while diagnostic work requires fractionation into direct and indirect components for mechanistic clarity, along with a complete panel including AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, PT/INR, albumin, and CBC to contextualize liver function versus liver injury and hemolysis, respectively [^115Txxj6] [^113EquiN] [^112RBbyZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the prehepatic contributors and keep unconjugated physiology front of mind. Excess production can overwhelm hepatic conjugation and present as isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia, most classically from hemolysis, resorption of large hematomas, or ineffective erythropoiesis; impaired conjugation also does this, with common UGT1A1 variation in Gilbert syndrome and rare severe defects in Crigler–Najjar syndrome, so if anemia or reticulocytosis is present I need to check hemolysis labs and if unconjugated bilirubin is disproportionate and persistent I should consider genetic causes or precipitating stressors [^116MrcMJ] [^112XLmib].

> Next, I will examine intrahepatic mechanisms, but I need to ensure I separate hepatocellular injury from canalicular transport defects. Hepatocellular injury from viral hepatitis, alcohol-associated hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis, NAFLD, and drug-induced liver injury can produce mixed or conjugated-predominant hyperbilirubinemia, while inherited canalicular transport disorders such as Dubin–Johnson and Rotor syndromes produce predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia with otherwise preserved synthetic function; systemic illnesses including sepsis and COVID-19 are frequently associated with bilirubin elevation and mixed patterns, and in COVID-19 cohorts bilirubin rises in roughly 20–40% and correlates with severity and prognosis, suggesting both hepatocellular injury and cholestatic components that I should not miss [^113EquiN] [^112XLmib] [^116mvcWW].

> Let me now consider posthepatic or cholestatic causes and verify I am not skipping structural disease. Extrahepatic obstruction from choledocholithiasis, malignant biliary obstruction, or benign strictures drives conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, as do immune cholangiopathies like primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis; postoperative states, particularly after cardiac surgery and liver transplantation, are well described contexts for cholestasis and bilirubin elevation that portend worse outcomes and often reflect intrahepatic cholestasis or biliary complications, so I should keep a low threshold for imaging if obstruction is suspected and track bilirubin trajectories closely [^113EquiN] [^114dCFEU] [^112xdtZA] [^111yUcGB].

> I will now detail neonatal-specific considerations, but wait, I should first confirm screening recommendations. Physiologic neonatal jaundice is common due to immature conjugation, with additional risks from hemolysis, sepsis, prematurity, and biliary atresia; standardized risk assessment and universal screening with transcutaneous or total serum bilirubin at 24–48 hours or before discharge are recommended, and persistent jaundice triggers fractionation to detect cholestasis, while treatment escalation to intensive phototherapy or exchange transfusion is guided by hour-specific nomograms and clinical signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, which becomes a pressing concern at very high bilirubin levels and requires rapid action to prevent neurologic injury [^113GHdac] [^112Vxztf] [^112GAG71] [^114tSr2k] [^113LyEuH] [^114C1wUF].

> Turning to adult patterns, let me think through common etiologies and iatrogenic contributors and I should double-check formal DILI criteria. Alcohol-associated liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, NAFLD, malignancy, and ischemic hepatitis are frequent causes, and drug-induced liver injury must be considered using AASLD thresholds such as ALT or AST greater than five times ULN, ALP greater than two times ULN, bilirubin greater than 2.5 mg/dL with enzyme elevations, or INR greater than 1.5 with enzyme elevations; exemplar drug labels emphasize bilirubin-informed risk and dose modifications, including Mavyret-associated early transient bilirubin rises via transporter and UGT1A1 effects, cyclosporine-associated cholestasis and jaundice, doxorubicin dose reductions and contraindication at bilirubin above 5 mg/dL, chenodiol-related hepatotoxicity monitoring, and endothelin receptor antagonists and interferon products with instructions to interrupt if bilirubin exceeds two times ULN or liver tests worsen [^112Vcy3d] [^115V7sw9] [^116MpFfC] [^116xH5C6] [^114rdJo7] [^1159ubSN] [^115DgJZy] [^111zdnxb].

> Next, I should review key differentiators, and wait, let me verify the direct-to-total bilirubin ratio thresholds because I do not want to misstate them; I almost said more than 60%, but the commonly used cut points are less than 20% for unconjugated processes like hemolysis or impaired conjugation, 20–50% for mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury, and greater than 50% for cholestasis or obstruction, a pattern that also tracks outcomes after cardiac surgery; when cholestasis or obstruction is suspected, I should promptly obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound and follow with CT or MRCP depending on the pretest probability and need for delineation, and a urine bilirubin test can rapidly indicate conjugated hyperbilirubinemia at the bedside [^112ctTRD] [^113EquiN] [^115Txxj6] [^116MrcMJ].

> I will now examine complications by severity and context, but hold on, I need to separate neonatal neurotoxicity from adult decompensation. Mild elevations, for example around 1.5–3 mg/dL, are often asymptomatic, whereas higher conjugated bilirubin with cholestasis can cause pruritus, fat malabsorption, and indicates more advanced hepatobiliary disease; in adults, rising bilirubin with coagulopathy and encephalopathy raises urgent concern for acute liver failure and its systemic complications, and in perioperative and critical illness settings including burns, esophagectomy, transplantation, and allogeneic stem cell transplant, hyperbilirubinemia often flags complications, endothelial injury, or graft risk, while in neonates extreme hyperbilirubinemia risks acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus without rapid escalation of care [^116sBqrG] [^116quGBx] [^116nTVRm] [^111yUcGB] [^116tDKdA] [^113LyEuH].

> But wait, what about situational patterns like COVID-19 and cholangiopathy after severe infections; I should confirm these signals. In hospitalized COVID-19, bilirubin elevation is common and correlates with severity and mortality, and a subset develop a post-acute cholangiopathy with marked cholestatic enzyme elevations and bile duct injury on MRCP, reinforcing why bilirubin trends should be interpreted along with ALP, GGT, and imaging to avoid anchoring on hepatocellular injury alone in this context [^116mvcWW] [^116DPe9f].

> Finally, I need to ensure the evaluation pathway is explicit and aligns with guidelines. A careful history and examination, fractionated bilirubin, full liver panel, coagulation profile, albumin, and CBC are first-line, followed by targeted viral, autoimmune, and hemolysis testing as indicated; abdominal ultrasound is the initial imaging test for suspected obstruction with CT or MRCP when further definition is needed, and if the cause remains unclear, liver biopsy may be required; for DILI, adhere to AASLD thresholds and Hy's law to stratify risk, interrupt and monitor according to the specific product label, and for neonates follow AAP pathways for screening, phototherapy, and exchange transfusion thresholds while promptly checking a direct bilirubin if jaundice persists beyond the recommended age windows [^115Txxj6] [^113EquiN] [^112Vcy3d] [^113cTi3L] [^113GHdac] [^112Vxztf] [^114tSr2k].

---

High bilirubin levels are caused by **increased production** (hemolysis, hematoma resorption) [^115Txxj6], **impaired conjugation** (Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar, neonatal immaturity) [^112XLmib] [^112GAG71], and **reduced excretion** (hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, biliary obstruction, drug-induced liver injury) [^112Vcy3d] [^112RBbyZ] [^113EquiN]. Complications include **jaundice**, pruritus, and, in severe cases, bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) in neonates [^112GAG71], hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, renal dysfunction [^116sBqrG], and increased mortality in adults [^116mgxHL]. Prompt evaluation and management are essential to prevent these outcomes [^115Txxj6] [^114tSr2k].

---

## Causes of high bilirubin levels

Hyperbilirubinemia can be categorized into **three main mechanisms** [^112RBbyZ].

---

### Increased bilirubin production (pre-hepatic causes)

Pre-hepatic causes include **hemolytic anemia**, characterized by excessive red blood cell breakdown (e.g. sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, G6PD deficiency) [^115Txxj6], and **hematoma resorption**, in which large hematomas or internal bleeding increase bilirubin production [^116MrcMJ].

---

### Impaired bilirubin conjugation (hepatic causes)

- **Gilbert syndrome**: Mildly elevated unconjugated bilirubin due to reduced UGT1A1 activity [^112XLmib] [^112RBbyZ].
- **Crigler-Najjar syndrome**: Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to absent or severely reduced UGT1A1 activity [^111qxFqt].
- **Neonatal jaundice**: Immature hepatic conjugation mechanisms in newborns [^112GAG71].

---

### Reduced bilirubin excretion (post-hepatic causes)

- **Hepatocellular injury**: Viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^112Vcy3d].
- **Cholestasis**: Impaired bile flow due to intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstruction (e.g. gallstones, tumors, strictures) [^112RBbyZ] [^115Txxj6].
- **Biliary obstruction**: Gallstones, tumors, strictures causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^115Txxj6].
- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Medications causing hepatocellular injury or cholestasis (e.g. acetaminophen, antibiotics, antivirals) [^112Vcy3d] [^115V7sw9].

---

## Complications of high bilirubin levels

Hyperbilirubinemia can lead to **significant clinical complications** that depend on its severity and duration [^116sBqrG].

---

### Neonatal complications

Neonatal complications include **bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus)**, marked by severe neurological damage from bilirubin deposition in the brain [^112GAG71], and **acute bilirubin encephalopathy**, a potentially fatal neurological impairment if untreated [^113LyEuH].

---

### Adult complications

- **Jaundice**: Yellow discoloration of skin and sclera, indicating underlying liver or biliary disease [^115Txxj6].
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Neurological impairment due to severe liver dysfunction [^116sBqrG].
- **Coagulopathy**: Impaired blood clotting due to liver dysfunction [^116sBqrG].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Kidney impairment associated with severe liver disease [^116sBqrG].
- **Increased mortality**: Elevated bilirubin levels are associated with higher mortality rates in severe liver disease and critical illness [^116mgxHL].

---

## Clinical evaluation and management

Effective management of hyperbilirubinemia requires an **accurate diagnosis** and identification of the underlying cause using laboratory tests (total and fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes [ALT, AST, ALP, GGT], complete blood count, and coagulation profile), as well as imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI to detect biliary obstruction or liver pathology [^115Txxj6]. Treatment focuses on **addressing the underlying cause**, including phototherapy for neonatal jaundice [^112GAG71] [^114tSr2k], surgical intervention for biliary obstruction, and discontinuation of hepatotoxic drugs [^112Vcy3d].

---

High bilirubin levels result from increased production, impaired conjugation, or reduced excretion, and can lead to serious complications such as jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and increased mortality [^116sBqrG]. Prompt **evaluation and management** are essential to prevent these outcomes [^115Txxj6].

### Acute liver failure: A life-threatening disease [^116sBqrG]. Deutsches Arzteblatt International (2011). High credibility.

Acute liver failure is a severe condition that can manifest with a variety of symptoms and complications. It may present with:

- **Neurological symptoms**: somnolence, confusion, altered mental status, disorientation, tremor, asterixis
- **Physical symptoms**: jaundice, dark urine, vomiting, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fruity breath odor
- **Hematological and metabolic indicators**: decreased serum sodium, decreased blood glucose, decreased serum albumin, anemia, decreased platelet count, coagulopathy, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), decreased white blood cell (WBC) count
- **Biochemical and liver function tests**: elevated serum total bilirubin (TBIL), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), elevated liver enzymes, increased prothrombin time (PT), increased amylase levels, increased blood ammonia
- **Cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms**: shock, decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2), increased cardiac output
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: nausea, light stools, ascites
- **Neurologic complications**: increased intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral edema

Additional potential indicators include:

- **Recent exposures**: use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or herbal supplements, exposure to toxins
- **Underlying conditions**: viral hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, cancer
- **Other symptoms**: lactic acidosis, malaise, heat stroke, convulsions

These signs and symptoms, often in combination, are key to identifying acute liver failure and determining its underlying causes.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can indicate significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in either the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies heavily on the history and physical examination.

The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method.

- **More extensive evaluation**: May include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy.

- **Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: Occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome.

- **Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: Occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Acute bilirubin encephalopathy: Some lessons learned [^113LyEuH]. Seminars in Perinatology (2021). Low credibility.

Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) remains an insufficiently addressed cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This article highlights that delayed or incorrect medical advice, inaccurate bilirubin measurements, and ineffective phototherapy are some of the relevant causes that predispose jaundiced newborns to develop extreme hyperbilirubinemia [EHB, total serum/plasma bilirubin (TB) ≥ 25 mg/dL (428 µmol/L)] and subsequent ABE. Obstacles preventing the state-of-the-art management of such infants are also discussed.

Prevention of ABE requires a system-based approach tailored to suit the needs and available resources of each community. Clear set protocols, rigorous training, monitoring, and accurate documentation, together with simple, innovative, affordable technologies that can be locally produced, are essential to observe the desired change.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians can improve diagnosis of liver conditions through clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests. There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results to be aware of:

- **Isolated raised bilirubin**: Most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome, which affects 5–8% of the population. Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin. The total bilirubin should rise further due to the indirect component, with no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin tests. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L), rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome should be considered, and genetic testing should be undertaken.

- **Cholestatic**: Predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion, and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and may not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood. The presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically normal.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112GAG71]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). High credibility.

The majority of newborns are affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

### A novel kidney failure prediction model in individuals with CKD: Impact of serum bilirubin levels [^1146cR7s]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In addition, serum bilirubin is believed to act as a protective agent against oxidative stress–induced damage. In a prior study, we observed a lower prevalence of nephropathy and vascular complications, alongside reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, in individuals with diabetes and Gilbert syndrome, a congenital hyperbilirubinemia, compared to individuals with diabetes without the syndrome. We also found that oral administration of biliverdin, a precursor of bilirubin, to diabetic mice prevented kidney damage via inhibition of oxidative stress in diabetic db/db mice. These findings suggest a protective role of serum bilirubin against the progression of nephropathy in individuals with diabetes.

Several reports have also demonstrated its protective role against the development of CKD in the general population. Sakoh et al. suggested an inverse association between serum bilirubin levels and adverse kidney outcomes (the doubling of serum creatinine levels or ESKD requiring dialysis) in individuals with CKD stages 3–4. In individuals with diabetes, we recently reported that serum bilirubin levels are robust predictors for ESKD, alongside eGFR, proteinuria, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and serum albumin levels. Our findings further indicate that serum bilirubin levels are strong predictors for ESKD, along with eGFR and proteinuria, in individuals with CKD, independent of etiology.

Of interest, in the study, the observed probabilities in individuals with Gilbert syndrome (n = 187) were very low: 0.5% at 2 years and 1.2% at 5 years.

### Effect of bilirubin and Gilbert syndrome on health: Cohort analysis of observational, genetic, and Mendelian randomisation associations [^116eTuuz]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of haemoglobin and is widely measured as part of routine liver function testing. It is known to have antioxidant properties and can reduce cellular exposure to reactive oxygen species in various in vitro and model animal systems. Additionally, observational studies have identified protective effects of increasing bilirubin concentrations on a wide range of outcomes, particularly suggesting large protective associations; for instance, higher bilirubin concentrations were associated with lower odds of myocardial infarctions and strokes.

Despite these studies, the evidence that bilirubin is causal for these outcomes remains limited. Concentrations of bilirubin are known to be altered by overall health state, liver function, obesity, and lifestyle traits such as smoking and alcohol intake. In the context of decompensated cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinaemia reflects synthetic dysfunction and hepatic failure, and it can also be nephrotoxic. Due to these associations, measured bilirubin concentrations are highly likely to be confounded by health state. An association between health state (e.g. low body mass index) and both high bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest (e.g. cardiovascular disease) implies that reported observations might not be causal, with bilirubin merely reflecting a marker of health state.

### Ctexli [^1159ubSN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hepatotoxicity: Obtain baseline liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels in all patients and monitor yearly and as clinically indicated. Interrupt treatment until the levels have returned to baseline values. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Chenodiol, including CTEXLI, has been associated with hepatotoxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In Trial 1, one CTEXLI-treated patient (7%) had increased ALT levels > 3 times ULN, which led to treatment interruption. Patients with pre-existing liver disease or bile duct abnormalities may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity during treatment with CTEXLI. Published reports suggest patients who are poor sulfators of lithocholic acid are more likely to develop chenodiol-induced serum aminotransferase elevations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain baseline liver transaminase (ALT, AST) and total bilirubin levels in all patients prior to treatment initiation with CTEXLI. If liver transaminase levels are elevated > 3 times ULN or total bilirubin level is > 2 times ULN, interrupt treatment with CTEXLI until the levels have returned to baseline values. Monitor liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels yearly and as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI.

Inform the patient of the symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g. abdominal pain, bruising, dark-colored urine, fatigue, bleeding, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus).

### Doxorubicin hydrochloride [^114rdJo7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Use in patients with hepatic impairment**: The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin, with an increased risk of toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Doxorubicin hydrochloride for injection is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg/dL) [see Contraindications (4)]. Reduce the dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride for injection in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2 to 5 mg/dL [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Obtain liver tests, including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, prior to and during therapy.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Doxorubicin hydrochloride can induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome.

- **Potentiation of radiation toxicity and radiation recall**: Doxorubicin hydrochloride can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin hydrochloride after prior radiation therapy.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, doxorubicin hydrochloride for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals.

### Serum bilirubin level as a potential marker for the hearing outcome in severe-profound bilateral sudden deafness [^112wpKWG]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Low credibility.

To investigate the association of serum bilirubin level with hearing outcomes in bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (BSSHL) patients, one hundred thirteen in-patient BSSHL patients were consecutively enrolled between July 2008 and December 2015 in a tertiary center.

- **Main outcome measures**: Multivariable linear regression, generalized estimating equations (GEE), and stratified analyses were applied to examine the association between serum bilirubin level and hearing outcome measures such as final hearing threshold and absolute and relative hearing gains in BSSHL.

- **Results**: After full adjustment for potential confounders, total bilirubin levels (TBIL) were observed to be positively and independently associated with hearing outcomes as measured by final hearing (β [95% confidence interval {CI}]: -1.5 [-2.7, -0.2] dB HL per 1μmol/L increase in TBIL) and absolute and relative hearing gains (β [95% CI]: 1.4 [0.2, 2.7] dB and 1.6 [0.2, 3.1] dB, respectively) in the severe to profound hearing loss subpopulation.

- **Conclusions**: Higher TBIL levels, within the normal or mildly elevated ranges, were independently and significantly associated with better hearing outcomes in BSSHL patients with severe to profound hearing loss. Given bilirubin elevation treatments exist, our finding suggests a novel pharmacological strategy for this specific subpopulation.

### Risk factors analysis of hyperbilirubinemia after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: a retrospective observational study [^112xdtZA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

This study holds significant relevance for clinical practice. Firstly, for patients with elevated serum total bilirubin levels before undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB), potential causes should be investigated, and early therapy for the primary disease should be administered. Secondly, improving the experience level of the surgical team can reduce the iatrogenic complications of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) implantation, decrease intraoperative bleeding, and shorten operation time, thereby reducing the likelihood of perioperative hyperbilirubinemia caused by iatrogenic factors. Thirdly, there is a need to enhance the management ability of blood products. For patients with a high risk of bleeding and transfusion, autologous blood transfusion and a restrictive transfusion strategy should be adopted.

Moreover, regular measurement of postoperative serum total bilirubin levels is necessary. For patients with mild elevations of serum total bilirubin, choleretic drugs such as ursodeoxycholic acid and transmetil could be effective. Meanwhile, hepatoprotective medicines such as glutathione, polyene phosphatidylcholine, and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate should be administered. For those with severe elevations of serum total bilirubin and acute liver failure, the artificial liver support system (ALSS), including plasma bilirubin adsorption (PBA), plasma exchange (PE), hemofiltration (HF), hemodialysis (HD), and their combination strategies, should be applied according to the indications. If the progression of hyperbilirubinemia cannot be controlled by the aforementioned methods, liver transplantation may be the last resort.

This study had some limitations. First…

### Establishment of predictive models for postoperative delirium in elderly patients after knee/hip surgery based on total bilirubin concentration: machine learning algorithms [^117NadLN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Delirium represents a neurocognitive disorder marked by a sudden and brief disruption in attention, awareness, and cognitive function. It is frequently observed as a complication in older adults, typically arising within a week following surgical procedures. The incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) varied according to surgery type, ranging from 10 to 47%. In addition, POD is associated with long-term cognitive decline in patients and has been shown to strongly impact both short-term and long-term patient outcomes. It not only reduces life quality and prolongs the postoperative hospital stay but also increases the likelihood of postoperative complications and death. Consequently, recognizing a high risk for POD in clinical assessment and treatment is crucial.

Bilirubin, the main byproduct of heme metabolism in the body, is often regarded as potentially harmful to cells, with the capacity to inflict lasting harm on the brain and nervous system. Conversely, it also exhibits antioxidant capabilities effective in inhibiting linoleic acid and phospholipid oxidation. Studies examining the relationship between bilirubin levels and postoperative delirium have yielded inconsistent results. Recent research suggests that the difference in total bilirubin levels between patients who experience delirium and those who do not is not statistically significant. Previous studies have shown that elevated serum bilirubin levels, even within the normal range, can provide a protective effect against neurological injuries resultant from oxidative stress.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113GHdac]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically concerning bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend measuring transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin between 24 and 48 hours after birth, or before discharge if it occurs earlier.

### Outcomes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and associated factors at a tertiary hospital in Ghana [^11161rW4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) is one of the most common clinical presentations in the first week of life. Approximately 60% of term infants and 80% of preterm infants present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia during the neonatal period. This condition results from the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood due to an imbalance between bilirubin conjugation and excretion. Rapid accumulation of bilirubin poses a unique problem since an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin is potentially toxic to the developing central nervous system, resulting in severe and irreversible long-term consequences or even death.

NH is estimated to be highest in the African region, with rates of 667.8 per 10,000 live births reported in two systematic reviews, compared to incidences of 3.2 per 10,000 and 4.4 per 10,000 live births in Europe and the Americas, respectively. Higher prevalence rates have been reported in some countries, with one teaching hospital in Ghana reporting a rate of 32.9%.

NH is one of the leading causes of admissions in the first week of life worldwide. Delays in presentation or initiation of treatment could result in bilirubin encephalopathy-related complications and mortality. Despite the presence of risk factors at birth in most cases, the condition also tends to be one of the major causes of readmissions during the neonatal period. This emphasizes the need for health professionals to promptly identify and monitor such neonates before discharging them home too early.

### Plasma bilirubin and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity are inversely related in dyslipidemic patients with metabolic syndrome: Relevance to oxidative stress [^114aA1Sc]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Subnormal levels of plasma bilirubin are associated with premature coronary artery disease and cardiovascular morbidity. Plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity is linked to bilirubin levels in hepatic disease, and elevated GGT is equally associated with hepatic steatosis, a frequent feature of metabolic syndrome (MS). To assess the potential relationship between GGT activity and bilirubin levels in subjects exhibiting features of metabolic syndrome, we determined circulating bilirubin levels and GGT activity in a cohort of dyslipidemic patients.

- **Methods and results**: This cross-sectional study involved 1,433 patients displaying atherogenic dyslipidemia in primary prevention, referred to our Prevention Center. Among these patients, 25% presented with MS as defined by recent NCEP ATP III criteria. Circulating levels of transaminases, as well as GGT activity, were elevated in MS patients; by contrast, bilirubin concentrations were significantly lower in such patients compared to those lacking this syndrome (p < 10⁻⁴ for all comparisons). Comparisons of patient groups based on the number of MS criteria concomitantly present revealed a progressive decrease in mean bilirubin levels. This reduction paralleled a progressive increase in mean GGT activity as a function of the number of MS components in the overall population (p-value for trend < 10⁻⁴).

### Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia and graft outcome in living donor liver transplantation [^111yUcGB]. Liver Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Little information is available on the characteristics and clinical significance of serum bilirubin level early after liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to clarify the risk factors for early graft loss and to assess the significance of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia as a predictor of graft outcome in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). We retrospectively analyzed perioperative parameters in 68 patients who underwent LDLT. Graft loss within 1 year post-LDLT was confirmed in 9 patients (13.4%).

Univariate analysis of risk factors showed that preoperative Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, donor age, postoperative peak serum bilirubin level (p-BIL) within 28 days after LDLT, and surgical complications were significant determinants of early graft loss (< 1 year post-transplant). Multivariate analysis identified p-BIL (odds ratio = 1.170, 95% confidence interval = 1.030–1.329, P = 0.016) as the only independent predictor of early graft loss. The incidence of such loss was high in patients with p-BIL over 27.0 mg/dL (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.988).

In conclusion, serum bilirubin level is a useful predictor of short-term (< 1 year) graft outcome and for considering retransplantation in a timely fashion.

### Does bilirubin protect against developing diabetes mellitus [^113u8dfM]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

After 25 years of evaluating bilirubin as a possible protective agent in neonatal and cardiovascular disease, interest has moved on to exploring a possible protective role in diabetes mellitus (DM). This review finds conflicting prospective data for a protective relationship, though there are retrospective, case-controlled data that can only show association, which is not causality. Only prospective studies can show causality.

Additionally, it appears that the underlying biochemical assumptions do not readily translate from the animal to the human setting. Given that many factors impact circulating bilirubin levels, it is not surprising that a clear-cut answer is not available; the jury is still out. Any relationship between DM and bilirubin might relate to intermediates in bilirubin metabolism, including relationships involving the genes for the enzymes participating in those steps.

Nevertheless, the pursuit of bilirubin in disease causation is opening new avenues for research, and if it is established that serum bilirubin can predict risks, much will have been achieved. The answer may have to come from molecular genetic analyses.

### Is cord blood bilirubin level a reliable predictor for developing significant hyperbilirubinemia [^116ujAxQ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

We aimed to investigate whether cord blood bilirubin (CBB) level could be used to identify newborns at a high risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia.

- **Study design**: Total and direct serum bilirubin levels were evaluated from the umbilical cord blood of newborns. We checked the blood groups and Rh status of all mothers and determined the blood groups and direct Coombs test (DC) of newborns born to mothers whose blood group was O type or Rh-negative to determine maternal-fetal blood group or Rh incompatibility.

- **Results**: A total of 418 newborns were included, and phototherapy (PT) was required in 17 newborns. The cutoff value of CBB for predicting the occurrence of significant hyperbilirubinemia requiring PT was 1.67 mg/dL, with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 99%. The mean CBB level in babies receiving PT was 2.4 ± 0.9 mg/dL. When blood group, CBB level, DC, gender, and mode of delivery were assigned as possible risk factors, multivariate analysis showed ABO, Rh incompatibility, and CBB level increased the risk of PT requirement.

- **Conclusion**: CBB could be useful to determine newborns at risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia and prevent severe complications due to delays in diagnosis.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the 2000s: What should we do next [^113T214o]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in healthcare policy mandating early discharge of healthy, full-term infants and the higher prevalence of breastfeeding among newborns have contributed to an increased number of term infants being readmitted to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia. At high levels, total serum bilirubin causes kernicterus, which is associated with severe neurological sequelae. This article provides a review of prior studies that have examined whether and at what levels total serum bilirubin affects neurodevelopmental outcomes in term infants. In addition, the article reviews some approaches in the literature that suggest means of preventing high levels of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.

### Positive association between serum bilirubin within the physiological range and serum testosterone levels [^117352pq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, mildly elevated bilirubin is beneficial to the human body. Individuals with Gilbert's Syndrome (GS), characterized by mild bilirubin elevation due to UGT1A1 gene abnormalities, exhibit lower body weight and reduced rates of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The role of bilirubin in reducing inflammation and metabolic complications may account for its anti-aging benefits, especially in overweight individuals. Our subgroup analysis revealed a protective effect of serum total bilirubin (STB) in preventing testosterone deficiency (TD) among obese males over 60 years old. This finding suggests that bilirubin may play a crucial role in maintaining healthier total testosterone (TT) levels by mitigating chronic inflammation and oxidative stress linked to obesity and aging.

Furthermore, our findings revealed a significant negative correlation between STB and TD among non-smokers and non-drinkers. The reported effects of smoking on TT levels are inconsistent and contradictory. Some studies have identified a positive correlation between smoking and TT levels, while others have observed a non-significant association between the two. Another study found that the positive correlation between smoking and TT weakened in individuals over 60 years old. Our study found that among former smokers, subgroup analysis did not reveal a significant inverse correlation between STB and TD, suggesting that smoking may interfere with bilirubin's protective influence on TT secretion. Additionally, evidence suggests that chronic excessive alcohol consumption could increase the risk of TD.

### Hyperammonemia in review: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115wwYSi]. Pediatric Nephrology (2012). High credibility.

Increased blood ammonia can be caused by several conditions, including liver cirrhosis, hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome, acute liver failure, and organic aciduria. Other causes include complications from transurethral resection of the prostate, portosystemic shunt, citrullinemia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, and arginosuccinic aciduria. Additionally, fatty acid oxidation defects, complications of ureterosigmoidostomy, and post-bariatric surgery complications may lead to increased blood ammonia levels.

Urea cycle disorders, Reye's syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, total parenteral nutrition, dehydration, inborn errors of metabolism, and hemodialysis are also notable causes. Moreover, certain medications can elevate blood ammonia levels: valproic acid, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide, acetazolamide, furosemide, chlorthalidone, sunitinib, and fluorouracil. Additional medications include regorafenib, asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant), haloperidol, topiramate XR, divalproex ER, ribavirin, topiramate, zonisamide, rabeprazole DR, oxaliplatin, divalproex DR, and cannabidiol.

### Associations between different bilirubin subtypes and diabetic microvascular complications in middle-aged and elderly individuals [^116XBeu9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Some studies have reported associations between bilirubin and diabetic microvascular complications. However, these studies focused only on total bilirubin (TBIL) without distinguishing different bilirubin subtypes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations of TBIL, direct bilirubin (DBIL), and indirect bilirubin (IBIL) levels with albuminuria/creatinine ratio (ACR) and the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) among diabetic adults.

We analyzed 4,368 individuals out of 4,813 diabetic participants enrolled from seven communities in 2018 in a cross-sectional study. Participants underwent several checkups, including the measurement of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glucose, lipid profile, TBIL, DBIL, IBIL, and ACR. DR was detected by high-quality fundus photographs and was remotely read by ophthalmologists.

- **Results**: Compared with the first quartile of DBIL, participants in the fourth quartile had a lower prevalence of high ACR (odds ratio (OR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59, 0.99) (p for trend < 0.05). Neither TBIL nor IBIL was associated with the prevalence of high ACR. In DR, higher DBIL and TBIL by one standard deviation was associated with a 19% (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69, 0.94) and a 12% (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78, 0.99) lower frequency of DR, respectively (both p for trend < 0.05). However, IBIL was not associated with the prevalence of DR. These associations were adjusted for potential confounding factors.

DBIL had a stronger association with high ACR and DR than TBIL or IBIL did in diabetic adults.

### Juxtapid [^114z5zPT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Risk of hepatotoxicity**: Juxtapid can cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic steatosis, as described below [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. To what extent Juxtapid-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. Although cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated transaminases with an increase in bilirubin or INR) or hepatic failure have not been reported, there is concern that Juxtapid could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of Juxtapid in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Elevation of transaminases**: Elevations in transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are associated with Juxtapid. In the clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients with HoFH had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3× ULN, and 4 (14%) of the patients had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 5× ULN. There were no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful elevations in bilirubin, INR, or alkaline phosphatase [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

During the 78-week HoFH clinical trial, no patients discontinued prematurely because of elevated transaminases. Among the 19 patients who subsequently enrolled in the HoFH extension study, one discontinued because of increased transaminases that persisted despite several dose reductions, and one temporarily discontinued because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24× ULN, AST 13× ULN).

### Neonatal cholestasis [^114C1wUF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is common and usually not concerning when it is secondary to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, below the neurotoxic level, and resolves early. Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses the diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): A systematic review [^111cQhJw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Higher serum bilirubin within the normal range may be associated with lower mortality and risk of COPD exacerbations, a reduced incidence in COPD diagnosis, and improved lung function. Interventional trials are needed to test if medications that raise serum bilirubin levels can safely improve COPD outcomes.

### Mavyret [^115V7sw9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory abnormalities: Serum bilirubin elevations

Elevations of total bilirubin, at least two times the upper limit of normal, occurred in 3.5% of adult subjects treated with Mavyret versus 0% in the placebo group. These elevations were observed in 1.2% of adult subjects across the Phase 2 and 3 trials. In adult subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), 17% experienced early, transient post-baseline elevations of bilirubin above the upper limit of normal. These bilirubin elevations were typically less than two times the upper limit of normal, generally occurring within the first two weeks of treatment, and resolved with continued treatment. The subjects with compensated cirrhosis and bilirubin elevations did not have concurrent increases in ALT or AST, nor signs of liver decompensation or failure, and these laboratory events did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Mavyret inhibits OATP1B1/3 and is a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1, which may impact bilirubin transport and metabolism, including direct and indirect bilirubin. Few subjects experienced jaundice or ocular icterus, and total bilirubin levels decreased after completing Mavyret.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Mavyret. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

	- **Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders**: Angioedema
	- **Hepatobiliary disorders**: Hepatic decompensation, hepatic

### Livmarli [^114HTgqA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage modification for management of adverse events**: Establish the baseline pattern of variability of liver tests prior to starting Livmarli, so that potential signs of liver injury can be identified. Monitor liver tests (e.g. ALT [alanine aminotransferase], AST [aspartate aminotransferase], TB [total bilirubin], DB [direct bilirubin], and International Normalized Ratio [INR]) during treatment with Livmarli. Reduce the dosage or interrupt Livmarli if new onset liver test abnormalities occur. Once the liver test abnormalities either return to baseline values or stabilize at a new baseline value, consider restarting Livmarli at the last tolerated dose and increase the dose as tolerated. Consider discontinuing Livmarli permanently if liver test abnormalities recur or symptoms consistent with clinical hepatitis are observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	- Livmarli has not been studied in patients with hepatic decompensation. Discontinue Livmarli permanently if a patient experiences a hepatic decompensation event (e.g. variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy).

- **Administration modification for drug interaction**: Administer Livmarli at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after administering the bile acid binding resins [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] when used concomitantly.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114tSr2k]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, specifically concerning exchange transfusion, the AAP 2022 guidelines recommend performing an urgent exchange transfusion in infants with a total serum bilirubin level at or above the exchange transfusion threshold.

Consider deferring the exchange transfusion while continuing intensive phototherapy if, while preparing for but before starting the exchange transfusion, a total serum bilirubin concentration is below the exchange transfusion threshold and the infant does not show signs of intermediate or advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. It is recommended to follow the total serum bilirubin every 2 hours until it is below the escalation-of-care threshold.

### Contributing factors and outcomes of burn-associated cholestasis [^116quGBx]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cholestasis often occurs after burn injuries. However, the prevalence of cholestasis and its effect on outcomes in patients with severe burn injuries are unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the course and the burden of cholestasis in a cohort of severely burned adult patients.

- **Methods**: We investigated the relationship between burn-associated cholestasis (BAC) and clinical outcomes in a retrospective cohort of patients admitted to our unit for severe burn injuries between 2012 and 2015. BAC was defined as an increased level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with an increased level of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) ≥ 3 times ULN, or as an increased level of total bilirubin ≥ 2 times ULN.

- **Results**: A total of 214 patients were included: 111 (52%) patients developed BAC following a median (IQR) stay of 9 (5–16) days. At 90 days, the mortality rate was 20%, including 34 and 9 patients with and without BAC (p < 0.001), respectively, which corresponded to a 2.5-fold higher (95% CI 1.2–5.2, p = 0.012) risk of 90-day mortality for patients with BAC. After being adjusted for severity of illness, patients with BAC, hyperbilirubinemia, and without elevated ALP and GGT levels had a hazard ratio of 4.51 (95% CI 1.87–10.87) for 90-day mortality. BAC was associated with the severity of the burn injury, shock, and bacteraemia. BAC was present in 38 (51%) patients at discharge, and 7 (18%) patients had secondary sclerosing cholangitis. These patients maintained elevated levels of ALP and GGT that were 5.8 times (1.7–15) the ULN and 11 times the ULN.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: A systematic review [^116mvcWW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Elevation in aminotransferase levels.

The most common liver test abnormalities reported are mild to moderate elevations in ALT and AST levels, observed in 14–53% of cases. Significant elevations of ALT and AST are more common in those with other digestive symptoms. Raised liver aminotransferases are associated with significantly longer hospital stays. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 5,771 adult COVID-19 patients found AST levels to increase initially, followed by ALT. Aspartate transaminase abnormalities were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Although ALT is more specific to the liver, higher AST levels may indicate injury to other organs or mitochondrial injury and should thus be interpreted with caution.

Elevations in bilirubin levels.

Elevated bilirubin levels are observed in 20–40% of patients, with 10% exhibiting very high levels. Bilirubin levels are significantly higher in those with severe disease and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Most studies do not specify if the hyperbilirubinemia is direct or indirect. A study from Spain found a biphasic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia, initially hepatocellular and later cholestatic. This suggests that bilirubin elevation may result from both direct hepatic injury and cholestasis. In addition to the increase in serum total bilirubin levels, raised conjugated bilirubin levels and conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratios were observed in COVID-19 patients. The high bilirubin levels may also be related to hemolysis. Further studies would delineate the predominant causes of these elevations.

### Risk factors analysis of hyperbilirubinemia after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: a retrospective observational study [^112ctTRD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Regarding the categories of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia, most patients (71.88%) exhibited elevated direct bilirubin levels, which is consistent with previous reports. Nishi et al. reported that patients with elevated direct bilirubin levels were more likely to have higher mortality rates and worse prognostic outcomes than patients with elevated indirect bilirubin levels. This difference was also found in this study (17.39% for direct bilirubin vs. 0% for indirect bilirubin, P = 0.303), although the difference was not significant. In contrast, Mastoraki et al. reported that patients with elevated indirect bilirubin levels had worse outcomes.

In the hyperbilirubinemia patients of this study, 19 patients (59.38%) had a direct bilirubin/total bilirubin ratio > 50%, 10 patients (31.25%) had a direct bilirubin/total bilirubin ratio between 20 and 50%, and 3 patients (9.38%) had a direct bilirubin/total bilirubin ratio < 20%, while 5 patients (15.63%) had elevated liver enzyme levels. This demonstrated that the main cause of hyperbilirubinemia after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) was intrahepatic cholestasis, followed by hepatocyte damage, and hemolysis in a few patients, which is in agreement with the conclusion of Mastoraki et al.

Most studies were positive about the correlation between hyperbilirubinemia and postoperative complications as well as with adverse events, which embodied the importance of this study. Hyperbilirubinemia after cardiac surgery, especially after cardiopulmonary bypass, is a risk factor for postoperative respiratory, circulatory, urinary, and gastrointestinal complications.

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^112GFrQG]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other nonenzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (e.g. bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult.

This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk and, where associations are robust, we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

### Sandimmune [^116MpFfC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Cases of hepatotoxicity and liver injury, including cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, and liver failure, have been reported in patients treated with cyclosporine. Most reports included patients with significant co-morbidities, underlying conditions, and other confounding factors, including infectious complications and comedications with hepatotoxic potential. In some cases, mainly in transplant patients, fatal outcomes have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience).

Hepatotoxicity, usually manifested by elevations in hepatic enzymes and bilirubin, was reported in patients treated with cyclosporine in clinical trials: 4% in renal transplantation, 7% in cardiac transplantation, and 4% in liver transplantation. This was usually noted during the first month of therapy when high doses of Sandimmune (cyclosporine) were used. The chemistry elevations usually decreased with a reduction in dosage.

- **Malignancies**: As in patients receiving other immunosuppressants, those receiving Sandimmune (cyclosporine) are at increased risk for the development of lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. The increased risk appears related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of specific agents. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system, which can also increase susceptibility to infection, Sandimmune (cyclosporine) should not be administered with other immunosuppressive agents except adrenal corticosteroids.

### Neoral [^116xH5C6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cases of hepatotoxicity and liver injury, including cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, and liver failure, have been reported in patients treated with cyclosporine. Most reports included patients with significant co-morbidities, underlying conditions, and other confounding factors, including infectious complications and co-medications with hepatotoxic potential. In some cases, mainly in transplant patients, fatal outcomes have been reported.

Hepatotoxicity, usually manifested by elevations in hepatic enzymes and bilirubin, was reported in patients treated with cyclosporine in clinical trials: 4% in renal transplantation, 7% in cardiac transplantation, and 4% in liver transplantation. This was usually noted during the first month of therapy when high doses of cyclosporine were used. The chemistry elevations usually decreased with a reduction in dosage.

- **Malignancies**: Patients receiving cyclosporine, like those on other immunosuppressants, are at increased risk for developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. Patients should be advised to avoid excessive ultraviolet light exposure. The increased risk appears related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than the specific agents used. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system resulting in an increased risk of infection or malignancy, a treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants should be used with caution.

### Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia suggests the occurrence of complications after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer [^116nTVRm]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Serum bilirubin levels frequently increase after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, and several studies have reported hyperbilirubinemia in patients with postoperative complications. We aimed to perform a detailed large-scale analysis to clarify this association.

- **Methods**: We compared postoperative serum bilirubin levels of 200 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy, with and without postoperative complications, from January 2008 to July 2013 at Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. We also analyzed other risk factors for postoperative hyperbilirubinemia by univariate and multivariate analyses in an attempt to determine the mechanism of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia.

- **Results**: Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL) occurred in 71 patients (35.5%). The mean total bilirubin peak level was 1.5 mg/dL in patients without complications, 2.0 mg/dL in those with at least one complication, 2.1 mg/dL in those with pneumonia, and 2.3 mg/dL in those with anastomotic leakage. Bilirubin levels were significantly higher in each complication group than in the non-complication group (p < 0.05 for all). Risk factors of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia by univariate analysis included preoperative bilirubin level, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, three-field lymph node dissection, thoracic duct resection, prolonged surgical duration, severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 3), and severe anastomotic leakage (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 3). In contrast, the pT factor and postoperative enteral nutrition were negatively associated with postoperative hyperbilirubinemia.

### Model-based characterization of total serum bilirubin dynamics in preterm infants [^116iS4VM]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

By formulating a patient-specific function that describes postnatal age-based TSB levels as an exponential decay model, this study provides a more comprehensive description of the postnatal bilirubin decline in preterm infants with a gestational age of 24–32 weeks. The patient-specific model and its associated parameters reflect the similarities and variations of the natural development of bilirubin metabolism among the considered population. Additionally, we demonstrated the predictive ability of the proposed model by monitoring deviations of actual bilirubin levels from the fitted natural bilirubin trends, with RMSE serving as one indicator to quantify these deviations. We illustrated this by annotating elevated CRP levels on the fitted models as shown in Figures 4 and 5. The discrepancies between measured TSB levels and the expected TSB trend identified by the proposed model could offer a valuable tool for disease detection, phenotyping, and prediction in the NICU. If a newly measured TSB level deviates from the expected decay, it could alert caregivers and prompt them to check for possible comorbidities such as infections, NEC, or other complications in the infant. A potential application could be a clinical decision support system based on explainable models for optimizing NICU monitoring and detecting high-risk events. Additionally, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, the lack of TSB measurements around elevated CRP levels exposes us to the risk of overlooking critical information. Therefore, it may be necessary to increase both the frequency and the duration of monitoring.

### Associations between different bilirubin subtypes and diabetic microvascular complications in middle-aged and elderly individuals [^11136adc]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The association of bilirubin level quartiles with high ACR and eGFR was evaluated. Higher DBIL levels, rather than TBIL or IBIL, were significantly associated with a lower prevalence of high ACR. However, higher TBIL, DBIL, and IBIL levels were all significantly associated with higher eGFR. It is noteworthy that higher DBIL by one standard deviation (SD) had the highest β associated with eGFR (β 1.12, 95% CI 0.64, 1.60), compared to TBIL (β 0.99, 95% CI 0.52, 1.46) and IBIL (β 0.93, 95% CI 0.47, 1.40), indicating that DBIL had a stronger association with eGFR than either TBIL or IBIL.

In addition, participants in the fourth DBIL quartile had a significantly lower prevalence of high ACR (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59, 0.99) (p for trend < 0.05). Higher DBIL by one SD was significantly associated with a 14% lower frequency of high ACR events (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.78, 0.95). A non-linear inverse association between DBIL and the prevalence of high ACR was detected (p for non-linearity < 0.01). However, neither DBIL nor IBIL was significantly associated with high ACR. These associations were adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, education, smoking, BMI, HbA1c, ALT, AST, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and the usage of insulin, ACEI or ARB, and statins.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying diseases of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis.

Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for the determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs. However, the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason, this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs, as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation, convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is emerging literature suggesting that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms: unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises both unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Associations between different bilirubin subtypes and diabetic microvascular complications in middle-aged and elderly individuals [^113PQY2d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Our study found that in type 2 diabetic adults, a higher DBIL level, rather than TBIL or IBIL, was associated with a decreased prevalence of high ACR, although TBIL, DBIL, and IBIL were all positively associated with eGFR. In fact, the association between TBIL and ACR has been reported in several studies, but the results are inconsistent.

- **Cross-sectional study**: In a cross-sectional study with 93,909 subjects (aged 18–96 years, 53.0% male), the association between high serum bilirubin and decreased prevalence of diabetic kidney disease was not found in men. Another cohort study with normal serum bilirubin subjects showed no significant association between serum bilirubin levels and the progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria. Inversely, two cohort studies found low TBIL concentration could be a risk factor for the development of albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Studies on DBIL and albuminuria**: However, no studies have reported the association between DBIL and albuminuria. It is noteworthy that studies about the association between bilirubin and eGFR have resulted in similar conclusions, but not all reports concur.

- **Cohort study findings**: One cohort study showed that not only baseline TBIL but also follow-up changes were negatively associated with eGFR in male diabetic patients; however, in another cohort study, recruiting subjects with normal serum bilirubin, no association between TBIL and eGFR was found. Our study found that TBIL, DBIL, and IBIL were all positively associated with eGFR.

As the mechanism involved is poorly understood, possible explanations for these inconsistent findings might be discrepancies in the considered variables and methodologies across studies.

### Longitudinal blood pressure control, long-term mortality, and predictive utility of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin in hypertensive patients [^115NCifu]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The effect of bilirubin and ALT on longitudinal SBP seems to be more prominent in older age, in the overweight, and in those who consume alcohol, whereas both ALP and GGT show a consistent effect on BP change in all subgroups in the opposite direction. It is possible that the variation in SBP seen with ALT and bilirubin may be due to alterations in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters that are reflected in ALT and bilirubin levels. The results for DBP indicate that both ALT and bilirubin have no effect, whereas there is a clear positive effect of ALP and GGT.

There are two explanations for these findings: (1) the annual reduction in DBP is much lower than the annual reduction in SBP, so we may not be powered to find any additional BP-lowering effect of bilirubin or ALT; (2) bilirubin and ALT do not have a truly causal effect on DBP change, and their effects on outcomes are unrelated to their effect on BP. Nevertheless, these are interesting findings showing the heterogeneity in liver biochemistry effects on BP and require validation in independent controlled studies.

The strengths of the study include a large cohort of nearly 12,000 hypertensive adults, 35 years of follow-up, high event rates, and inclusion of the entire circulating range of liver enzymes (except levels suggestive of significant hepatocyte damage or obstructive liver disease). The generalizability of our findings is limited to middle-aged hypertensive patients of European ancestry. We acknowledge the exclusion of individuals without liver enzyme assessments at baseline from our analysis.

### Association between elevated serum bilirubin levels with preserved lung function under conditions of exposure to air pollution [^117GF75F]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

High serum bilirubin levels have been shown to be associated with improved pulmonary function test results. Their potential ability to similarly benefit pulmonary function in an environment of polluted air has not been tested. We retrospectively analyzed data of 15,605 apparently healthy individuals in order to evaluate the effect of serum bilirubin levels on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1).

- **Methods**: Individuals attended the Tel-Aviv Medical Center Inflammatory Survey for a routine annual health check between February 2002 and June 2009. They were divided into low, medium, and high serum bilirubin levels. Their FEV1 results were compared under various levels of air pollution. Air pollution and weather data were obtained from air-pollution monitoring stations of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection.

- **Results**: The effect of elevated serum bilirubin concentrations on FEV1 was evaluated under moderate and high pollution levels. FEV1 was significantly higher in participants with high blood bilirubin levels compared to those with medium or low levels (p < 0.001 and p = 0.018, respectively). Participants with high levels of bilirubin had preserved FEV1 under exposure to high and medium pollution levels of both Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) pollutants (p = 0.003 and p = 0.022, respectively). The multivariate regression analysis revealed that the influence of bilirubin under conditions of air pollution remained significant even after adjustment for FEV1 confounders, but the interaction was not significant.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated serum bilirubin concentrations were associated with preserved lung function in environments with high and medium levels of air pollution.

### On-site monitoring of postoperative bile leakage using bilirubin-inducible fluorescent protein [^111DEMNt]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

One of the major complications after hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery has been postoperative bile leakage, the incidences of which are reportedly 3–12% after hepatectomy and 2–10% after pancreatoduodenectomy. While more liver surgeons have recently advocated a "no drain" policy to decrease the risk of infection and postoperative hospital stay, prophylactic abdominal drains are still used for the diagnosis and management of postoperative bile leak, especially in patients at high risk of complications after liver resection or transplantation. Even when no prophylactic drains are used during surgery, additional drainage tubes may be placed postoperatively to manage symptomatic intra-abdominal fluid collections associated with bile leakage. Thus, it remains important to evaluate the presence and severity of bile leaks from hepatic raw surfaces and/or biliary anastomoses intraoperatively and postoperatively by studying the characteristics of the leaked abdominal fluids.

During the management of patients with abdominal drains after hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery, bilirubin levels are usually measured in the drained abdominal fluids to directly monitor the patient for postoperative bile leakage. A treatment policy has established the acceptable upper limit of the total bilirubin (TB) level in the fluid at 3 mg/dL or three times the serum TB level. When the TB level decreases to values below either of these limits, the clinicians may decide to remove the drainage tube. It requires time and additional work for the medical staff to collect and send samples.

### Longitudinal blood pressure control, long-term mortality, and predictive utility of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin in hypertensive patients [^1161nV8k]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Our finding of a negative relationship between ALT and mortality is independent of all other concomitant liver tests. Previous studies, including a large systematic review, have shown variable associations. The reason for the increased risk seen with lower ALT is not clear. A recent study in the elderly (> 70 years) showed that the increased risk associated with low ALT disappeared after adjustment for frailty, indicating that ALT may be a marker of aging and frailty. ALT levels are known to reduce with increasing age, suggesting that ALT may be a marker of functioning hepatocyte (and muscle mass) because ALT is primarily produced by the liver (with a small proportion from skeletal muscle). If this is true, then we speculate that the observed greater reduction in BP in this cohort with higher ALT levels may indicate better antihypertensive efficacy because the commonly used antihypertensive drugs, ACEI and ARBs, are prodrugs which require hepatic activation. Despite a strong correlation between AST and ALT, the pattern of risk is U-shaped with AST in contrast to ALT. However, we are limited by our data to dissect this further.

Both ALP and GGT are associated with increased mortality risk, which is significant only at the higher end of the distribution. The novel finding in our study is the consistent association of both GGT and ALP with higher longitudinal BP. The magnitude of BP increase is higher with ALP than GGT, and this increase is over and above the 4 mm Hg annual decline in SBP seen in this cohort, which is related to antihypertensive treatment.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary biliary cholangitis, specifically with respect to follow-up, the BSG 2018 guidelines recommend classifying patients treated with UDCA who have an ALP > 1.67× ULN and/or elevated bilirubin < 2× ULN as a group of high-risk patients needing the addition of second-line therapy.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^113cTi3L]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Zimmerman observed that drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice potentially predicted serious and even fatal outcomes. Subsequently, "Hy's law" was coined and defined as serum ALT levels > 3× ULN combined with total bilirubin levels > 2× ULN, after the exclusion of other underlying causes, to help identify patients most likely to progress to serious liver injury. Elevated ALT levels are sensitive for liver injury and, although not entirely specific, are viewed as being more predictive than AST levels. Healthy liver tissue has excess bilirubin-excreting capacity; therefore, hepatic injury sufficient to cause hyperbilirubinemia (i.e. > 2× ULN) represents a degree of hepatocyte loss that may become irreversible.

Hy's law criteria have been historically useful for predicting serious drug-induced hepatocellular liver injury, with approximately 1 in 10 Hy's law cases leading to death from liver-related causes or the need for liver transplant. Failure to detect a Hy's law case in clinical trials does not imply an acceptable hepatocellular safety profile because large clinical trials (> 3000 patients) are needed for a high probability of detection, trials sizes that are rare in oncology. However, the detection of ≥ 2 Hy's law cases in clinical trials is a strong predictor of significant risk and may prevent further development.

Even when Hy's law cases are detected during clinical evaluation, the risk-benefit to the population must be considered before determining whether clinical trials should continue. In oncology, some degree of hepatotoxicity may be acceptable depending on the situation.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): A systematic review [^114hHtjY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant, and higher serum bilirubin levels have been associated with improved COPD outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the association between serum bilirubin levels and lung function (FEV1), prevalence/incidence of COPD, acute exacerbations of COPD, respiratory health status, and mortality.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE® and Embase were searched using Ovid® with the search updated as of October 1, 2019. We included studies that measured serum bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest in adults with or without underlying lung disease. We excluded studies of those with liver disease or drug-induced elevations in bilirubin. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess individual study risk of bias (ROB), and the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality — Evidence Based Practice tool was used to assess the overall strength of evidence (SOE). Two authors independently determined eligibility, performed data abstraction, assessed ROB, and determined SOE.

- **Results**: Thirteen studies (5 low risk of bias, 3 moderate, and 5 high risk) were included. We found low strength of evidence for the association between higher bilirubin levels and lower risk of acute exacerbations of COPD (2 studies), mortality (3 studies), COPD diagnosis (4 studies), and lung function (FEV1) (8 studies). There was insufficient evidence on the relationship between serum bilirubin and respiratory health status/exercise capacity (1 study) and airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio) (4 studies).

- **Conclusion**: Higher bilirubin levels may be associated with lower mortality and improved COPD outcomes.

### Cholangiopathy after severe COVID-19: Clinical features and prognostic implications [^116DPe9f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is a predominantly respiratory tract infection with the capacity to affect multiple organ systems. Abnormal liver tests, mainly transaminase elevations, have been reported in hospitalized patients. We describe a syndrome of cholangiopathy in patients recovering from severe COVID-19, characterized by marked elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) accompanied by evidence of bile duct injury on imaging.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020, on whom the hepatology service was consulted for abnormal liver tests. Bile duct injury was identified by abnormal liver tests with serum ALP > 3× upper limit of normal and abnormal findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological findings were recorded in a Research Electronic Data Capture database.

- **Results**: Twelve patients were identified, 11 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 58 years. Mean time from COVID-19 diagnosis to diagnosis of cholangiopathy was 118 days. Peak median serum alanine aminotransferase was 661 U/L and peak median serum ALP was 1855 U/L. Marked elevations of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers were common. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography findings included beading of intrahepatic ducts (11/12, 92%), bile duct wall thickening with enhancement (7/12, 58%), and peribiliary diffusion high signal (10/12, 83%).

### Early bilirubinemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation - an endothelial complication [^116tDKdA]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

This study identifies early bilirubinemia (EB) as an independent risk factor for non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Our results align with previous reports about the association between high posttransplant bilirubin levels and NRM. However, prior studies did not address whether hyperbilirubinemia occurred due to defined endothelial complications, such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) or transplant-associated microangiopathy (TAM). The association of EB with pretransplant markers of endothelial distress and vulnerability (but not with markers of liver damage) suggests an endothelial contribution to the pathogenesis of EB. Notably, EB retained its adverse impact on NRM even after excluding patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for TAM or SOS.

Endothelial cell dysfunction plays a major role in complications and mortality following alloSCT. However, due to the heterogeneity of the endothelial system, clearly defining endothelial cell dysfunction is challenging. Endothelial cells may be functionally understood as input-output devices, with their responses differing over space and time, comparable to input signals. It is reasonable to assume that endothelial cell complications are more multifaceted than currently assumed in conditions such as TAM or VOD. The diagnostic criteria for both complications are based on expert consensus rather than biology, and early intervention is not possible if strict diagnostic criteria need to be met.

One tool that aids in advancing the diagnosis of endothelial complications along the time axis is EASIX, a set of three lab markers that can be monitored continuously.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable.

- **Prehepatic causes**: These include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin.

- **Intrahepatic disorders**: These can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated due to alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders.

- **Posthepatic disorders**: These can also cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process causing jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies.

The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging via ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### Filspare [^115DgJZy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevations in ALT or AST of at least three-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) have been observed in up to 3.5% of Filspare-treated patients, including cases confirmed with rechallenge [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. While no elevations in bilirubin greater than two times ULN or cases of liver failure were observed in Filspare-treated patients during clinical trials, some endothelin receptor antagonists have caused elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. To reduce the risk of potential serious hepatotoxicity, it is advised to measure serum aminotransferase levels and total bilirubin before initiating treatment, monthly for the first 12 months, and every three months thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Advise patients to promptly discontinue Filspare and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity, such as nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, fever, or itching. If aminotransferase levels are abnormal at any time during treatment, interrupt Filspare and follow the recommended monitoring guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Re-initiation of Filspare should be considered only when hepatic enzyme levels and bilirubin return to pretreatment values and exclusively in patients without clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)].

It is recommended to avoid the initiation of Filspare in patients with aminotransferase levels greater than three times ULN before beginning treatment, as monitoring hepatotoxicity in these patients may be more challenging and they may be at higher risk.

### The liver in COVID-19: Prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^116mgxHL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with approximately 35 million cases and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest.

- **Objective**: To define the prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 18, 2020. The association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and biochemical predictors, was examined.

- **Results**: Data were available on 551 patients. The prevalence of any transaminase elevation or ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal on admission was 61.2% and 9.4%, and at peak was 72.1% and 22.4%. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4% and 12.6%, respectively) and at peak (17.7% and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impacts on mortality, with AST positively and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, the AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

- **Conclusion**: LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 were significant and associated with various outcomes, necessitating comprehensive evaluation for prognosis.

### Associations between different bilirubin subtypes and diabetic microvascular complications in middle-aged and elderly individuals [^116LwYKj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Some studies have reported associations between bilirubin and diabetic microvascular complications. However, these studies focused only on total bilirubin (TBIL) without distinguishing different bilirubin subtypes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations of TBIL, direct bilirubin (DBIL), and indirect bilirubin (IBIL) levels with the albuminuria/creatinine ratio (ACR) and the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) among diabetic adults.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 4,368 individuals out of 4,813 diabetic participants enrolled from seven communities in 2018 in a cross-sectional study. Participants underwent several checkups, including the measurement of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glucose, lipid profile, TBIL, DBIL, IBIL, and ACR. DR was detected by high-quality fundus photographs and was remotely read by ophthalmologists.

- **Results**: Compared with the first quartile of DBIL, participants in the fourth quartile had a lower prevalence of high ACR (odds ratio (OR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59, 0.99) (p for trend < 0.05). Neither TBIL nor IBIL was associated with the prevalence of high ACR. In DR, higher DBIL and TBIL by one standard deviation was associated with a 19% (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69, 0.94) and a 12% (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78, 0.99) lower frequency of DR, respectively (both p for trend < 0.05). However, IBIL was not associated with the prevalence of DR. These associations were adjusted for potential confounding factors.

DBIL had a stronger association with high ACR and DR than TBIL or IBIL did in diabetic adults.

### Besremi [^111zdnxb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hepatotoxicity has occurred in patients receiving interferon alfa products, including Besremi. These toxicities may include increases in serum ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin [see Contraindications (4)].

Increases in serum ALT ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), AST ≥ 3 times the ULN, GGT ≥ 3 times the ULN, and bilirubin > 2 times the ULN have been observed in patients treated with Besremi.

In the clinical development program of Besremi, 36 patients (20%) experienced liver enzyme elevations, 33 of whom had elevations of 1.25–5× ULN. Patients were able to resume Besremi upon resolution of liver enzyme elevations. Liver enzyme elevations have also been reported in patients after long-term Besremi therapy.

- **Monitoring and dosage adjustments**: Monitor liver enzymes and hepatic function at baseline and during Besremi treatment. Reduce Besremi dosage by 50 mcg for increased AST/ALT/GGT, then monitor AST/ALT/GGT weekly until the values return to baseline or grade 1 (ALT and AST < 3× ULN). Consider permanent discontinuation if increased liver enzyme levels persist after four dose reductions. Discontinue Besremi in patients who develop evidence of liver failure or decompensated liver function.
