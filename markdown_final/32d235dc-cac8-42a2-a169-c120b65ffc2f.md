## Question

Absolute monocytopenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage absolute monocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should categorize etiologies into acquired, drug-induced, infectious, hematologic, and genetic. Next, I will assess clinical significance and prognostic implications. After that, I need to outline a targeted diagnostic workup. Finally, I will consider management strategies, including when to use growth factors and when to refer for transplant, and close with special scenarios and a concise algorithmic summary.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and rule out artifacts before labeling someone as monocytopenic; I should verify the absolute monocyte count from a CBC with differential, ensure the lab's reference range is appropriate, and repeat the test to confirm persistence, because transient fluctuations and pre-analytical errors are common and monocytopenia is relatively uncommon in general practice, with a reported prevalence of about 0.0002785 per 100,000 in a rare disease context, which underscores the need to verify persistence and exclude artifactual causes [^116A8DaQ]. Wait, let me verify the normal range; most laboratories cite 0.3–0.9 × 10⁹/L, but I should double-check the local lab's range and the patient's baseline before concluding true monocytopenia [^115jwtrh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for spurious causes that can mimic monocytopenia or obscure the true count, including analyzer misclassification, pseudoneutropenia from myeloperoxidase deficiency where neutrophils are miscounted as monocytes, and pre-analytical delays, and I should review the smear manually if the automated differential is discordant or the clinical context is suspicious [^115KgrE3] [^112EP3h1]. I should confirm that the differential was performed correctly and that monocyte morphology is appropriate before proceeding further [^112EP3h1].

> Next, I should review the medication history carefully because drug-induced marrow suppression is a frequent culprit; corticosteroids can acutely demarginate and later suppress monocytes, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation impair hematopoiesis, and targeted agents like filgotinib can cause a transient monocyte decrease, so I need to correlate timing and dose with the onset of monocytopenia and consider dechallenge if feasible [^116imq3g]. But wait, what if the drug is clozapine; in clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, monocytopenia can track with neutropenia due to CFU-GM injury, and switching from G-CSF to GM-CSF can restore both lineages, which I should keep in mind if neutrophils and monocytes fail to recover with G-CSF alone [^112oDWte].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies, especially severe viral infections; in COVID-19, critical illness is associated with decreased total monocytes and CD16− subsets alongside suppressed HLA-DR expression, reflecting both numeric loss and functional deactivation, and sepsis more broadly can cause profound immunoparalysis with low monocyte counts and impaired antigen presentation, so I should correlate with clinical severity and inflammatory markers before attributing causality [^1174pb1R] [^114uCaEy] [^112QMLn8]. Let me consider HIV as well; persistent immune activation and gut microbial translocation can alter monocyte homeostasis, and although monocytopenia is not a hallmark, relative shifts and functional impairment are common, so I should integrate HIV status and treatment into the differential [^112sCzwp] [^11549uvE].

> Now, I need to evaluate hematologic malignancies and marrow failure syndromes; hairy cell leukemia classically causes monocytopenia and predisposes to mycobacterial infection, myelodysplastic syndromes can present with monocytopenia as part of cytopenia patterns and carry prognostic implications, and acute leukemias or marrow infiltration can suppress monopoiesis, so a bone marrow evaluation is warranted if cytopenias are persistent, unexplained, or accompanied by dysplasia or blasts on smear. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing oligomonocytic CMML, which presents with lower monocyte thresholds and clonal mutations; if monocytosis ever emerges later, I must reconsider clonal myeloid neoplasia and order molecular testing [^116uZG5D].

> Let me consider genetic and primary immunodeficiencies if monocytopenia is chronic, severe, or accompanied by other lineage defects; GATA2 deficiency causes monocytopenia with NK and B-cell lymphopenia and confers susceptibility to viral and mycobacterial infections, and IRF8 mutations can also deplete monocytes and dendritic cells, so I should look for syndromic features, family history, and consider targeted gene testing when clinical suspicion is high [^116sqkHP] [^114zLaZh]. I should double-check for subtle syndromic stigmata such as lymphedema, hearing loss, or endocrine abnormalities that might guide genetic testing [^116sqkHP].

> Next, I should review the clinical significance and prognostic implications rather than treating a number in isolation; in MDS, monocytopenia correlates with worse outcomes and may refine risk beyond traditional indices, in multiple myeloma both low and high AMC predict inferior survival suggesting distinct biology, and in Alzheimer's disease, low monocyte counts associate with increased risk in observational and Mendelian randomization analyses, so I need to interpret monocytopenia in disease-specific contexts rather than as a universal risk marker [^115Pkv34] [^112br61j] [^112n5yJG] [^117KcQbK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overgeneralized prognostic value; I should confirm that the prognostic directionality differs by disease and that absolute counts are more informative than percentages in many malignancy settings [^112br61j].

> I will now outline a targeted diagnostic workup; first, confirm persistence with repeat CBC and a manual differential, then obtain a comprehensive history including infections, drugs, and family history, followed by directed labs such as HIV testing, hepatitis serologies, autoimmune screening, and inflammatory markers, and if cytopenias persist or are unexplained, proceed to bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics and, increasingly, next-generation sequencing to assess for clonal hematopoiesis or germline mutations, with flow cytometry to quantify monocyte subsets when the phenotype will change management or prognosis [^115uhbga] [^114GYZTF]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing copper deficiency masquerading as MDS; checking serum copper and ceruloplasmin is a simple step that can prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary therapy [^116rnwiH].

> For management, I need to ensure I treat the underlying cause first; stop offending drugs when safe, treat active infections with appropriate antimicrobials, and address hematologic malignancies or marrow failure per disease-specific protocols, while avoiding reflexive use of growth factors without a clear indication [^115V1sDg]. Let me reconsider supportive care; in profound, persistent monocytopenia with recurrent infections, particularly in hairy cell leukemia or GATA2 deficiency, GM-CSF can expand monocytes and improve innate immunity, and in select high-risk hematologic contexts, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be curative, so early hematology referral is prudent when monocytopenia is severe and unexplained [^116sqkHP] [^115V1sDg]. I should confirm that vaccination strategies and infection prophylaxis are individualized based on the underlying defect and exposure risk [^116sqkHP].

> But wait, what about special scenarios that require nuanced interpretation; in neonates and preterm infants, an acute drop in monocytes can help differentiate necrotizing enterocolitis from other causes of feeding intolerance, so I should monitor trends rather than a single value and integrate with clinical signs before acting [^111coRTP]. In critical illness and sepsis, monocytopenia may reflect both margination and functional deactivation, so I should avoid overinterpreting a low count as purely numeric loss and instead assess HLA-DR expression and cytokine production when available to guide immunomodulatory strategies [^112QMLn8]. In fibrotic lung disease, while monocytosis portends worse outcomes, the converse does not automatically imply protection, so I should not infer benefit from monocytopenia in that context without disease-specific data [^112KCiJm].

> To synthesize, I should double-check that my approach remains methodical: confirm true monocytopenia and exclude artifacts, categorize likely etiologies with emphasis on drugs, infections, hematologic disease, and genetics, assess prognostic significance in the specific clinical context, pursue a tiered diagnostic workup anchored by marrow evaluation when indicated, and manage by treating the cause while reserving growth factors and transplant for selected refractory or high-risk cases, documenting persistence and integrating multidisciplinary input to avoid premature closure [^115uhbga] [^115Pkv34] [^116sqkHP]. Hold on, I should verify that I have aligned the plan with the patient's goals and comorbidities before finalizing recommendations, as the clinical impact of monocytopenia is highly context dependent [^114GYZTF].

Absolute monocytopenia is defined as an **absolute monocyte count < 0.2 × 10⁹/L** [^115NiYyv] and is rare, often signaling serious disease. It is most strongly linked to **bone marrow failure syndromes** (aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute leukemia) [^115uhbga] [^115Pkv34], **clozapine-induced agranulocytosis** [^112oDWte], and **GATA2 deficiency** [^116sqkHP]. Other causes include severe infections (sepsis, COVID-19) [^1174pb1R], chemotherapy, and radiation. Evaluation should include CBC with differential, peripheral smear, bone marrow biopsy, and targeted molecular testing (e.g. GATA2) [^114GYZTF]. Management focuses on treating the underlying cause, infection prophylaxis, and hematology referral; **GM-CSF may help in clozapine-related cases** [^112oDWte].

---

## Definition and normal range

Absolute monocytopenia is an **absolute monocyte count (AMC) < 0.2 × 10⁹/L** [^115NiYyv]; the normal AMC in adults is 0.2–0.8 × 10⁹/L (200–800/μL).

---

## Clinical significance

Monocytopenia is rare and often indicates **significant underlying pathology**, including:

- **Bone marrow failure syndromes**: Aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute leukemia [^115uhbga] [^115Pkv34].
- **Drug-induced**: Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^112oDWte].
- **Genetic disorders**: GATA2 deficiency [^116sqkHP].
- **Severe infections**: Sepsis, COVID-19 [^1174pb1R].
- **Chemotherapy/radiation**: Suppression of hematopoiesis.

---

## Etiological classification

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Bone marrow failure syndromes | - Aplastic anemia <br/> - MDS <br/> - Acute leukemia [^115uhbga] [^115Pkv34] |
| Drug-induced | - Clozapine [^112oDWte] |
| Genetic disorders | - GATA2 deficiency [^116sqkHP] |
| Severe infections | - Sepsis <br/> - COVID-19 [^112QMLn8] [^1174pb1R] |
| Chemotherapy/radiation | - Cytotoxic therapy [^114zLaZh] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential:

- **Confirm monocytopenia**: Repeat CBC with differential to exclude lab error.
- **Peripheral smear**: Assess morphology and other lineages.
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Evaluate marrow failure, dysplasia, or infiltration [^116rnwiH].
- **Molecular testing**: GATA2 sequencing, clonal hematopoiesis assessment [^116sqkHP].
- **Infection screening**: HIV, hepatitis, COVID-19, as indicated [^115uhbga].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Monocytopenia impairs innate immunity, increasing susceptibility to **infections** — particularly mycobacterial and viral — and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in severe infections and malignancies [^116sqkHP] [^113H5Veo].

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on treating the **underlying cause**:

- **Treat underlying disease**: Stop offending drugs, treat infections, manage marrow failure [^112oDWte].
- **Infection prophylaxis**: Antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals as indicated.
- **Growth factors**: GM-CSF for clozapine-induced monocytopenia [^112oDWte].
- **Hematology referral**: For marrow failure or clonal disorders [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause and response**. Persistent monocytopenia from marrow failure or clonal disorders carries significant risk of infection, progression, and mortality, whereas drug-induced monocytopenia often resolves with cessation and supportive care [^112br61j] [^112oDWte].

---

Absolute monocytopenia is rare and clinically significant; **prompt recognition and targeted evaluation** are essential to identify and treat the underlying cause, reduce infection risk, and improve outcomes.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^113H5Veo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection damages host tissues and organs, imposes a substantial global pathological burden. Recent estimates suggest that sepsis affects nearly 50 million people worldwide each year, leading to high mortality rates and huge healthcare costs. Despite substantial advances in medical science, sepsis continues to represent a significant public health challenge, necessitating innovative strategies to mitigate its global impact.

Lymphopenia, alternatively termed lymphocytopenia, delineates a pathological state characterized by a diminished concentration of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The etiology of lymphopenia encompasses a range of factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, pharmacological interventions, and exposure to radiation therapy. The relationship between lymphopenia and sepsis has been extensively studied, and in particular, sepsis-induced lymphopenia is gradually being recognized as an essential factor in the prognosis of sepsis. Sepsis-induced lymphopenia is usually defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of less than 1,000 cells/µL. Several studies have also provided individualized threshold data, e.g. the persistence with the lymphopenia cut-off value (< 760 cells/µL) > 3 days in non-viral infection-related sepsis indicates a higher 28-day mortality rate, and severe lymphopenia in sepsis was previously defined as an ALC of less than 500/µL. However, despite the significant progress in this field, numerous unresolved issues still require urgent attention (Table 1). In addition, altering myeloid cell numbers during sepsis is a relatively complex and diverse process. This issue has been discussed by others and is beyond the scope of this review.

Table 1
Established knowledge and unanswered questions about sepsis-induced lymphopenia

Notably, sepsis-induced lymphopenia has been associated with worse outcomes, including increased risk of secondary infections, multiple organ failure, and death. Given the widespread role of lymphopenia in sepsis, there is a growing recognition of the potential practical significance of treatments that address lymphopenia. The main controversies and challenges faced by the medical community in addressing these questions include the complexity of the immune response in sepsis, the difficulty of distinguishing cause and effect in observational studies, and the lack of specific treatments. Moreover, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the scenario, resulting in an increased incidence of sepsis cases. This rise is coupled with the pandemic's tendency to cause lymphopenia, which merits additional investigation to unravel the intricate pathophysiological pathways in sepsis.

### Acute drop in blood monocyte count differentiates NEC from other causes of feeding intolerance [^111coRTP]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is characterized by macrophage infiltration into affected tissues. Because intestinal macrophages are derived from recruitment and in situ differentiation of blood monocytes in the gut mucosa, we hypothesized that increased recruitment of monocytes to the intestine during NEC reduces the blood monocyte concentration and that this fall in blood monocytes can be a useful biomarker for NEC.

Study Design

We reviewed medical records of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants treated for NEC and compared them with a matched control group comprised of infants with feeding intolerance but no signs of NEC. Clinical characteristics and absolute monocyte counts (AMCs) were recorded. Diagnostic accuracy of AMC values was tested using receiver-operator characteristics (ROC).

Result

We compared 69 cases and 257 controls (median 27 weeks, range 26 to 29 in both the groups). In stage II NEC, AMCs decreased from median 1.7 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ (interquartile range (IQR) 0.98 to 2.4) to 0.8 (IQR 0.62 to 2.1); P < 0.05. In stage III NEC, monocyte counts decreased from median 2.1 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ (IQR 0.1.5 to 3.2) to 0.8 (IQR 0.6 to 1.9); P < 0.05. There was no change in AMCs in control infants. ROC of AMC values showed a diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve) of 0.76. In a given infant with feeding intolerance, a drop in AMCs of > 20% indicated NEC with sensitivity of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.81) and specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.77).

Conclusion

We have identified a fall in blood monocyte concentration as a novel biomarker for NEC in VLBW infants.

### Blood leukocyte counts in Alzheimer disease [^112n5yJG]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the relevance of types of blood leukocytes in Alzheimer disease (AD)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 101 582 individuals in the Danish general population, low baseline blood monocyte counts were associated with increased AD risk. In a mendelian randomization framework using the most powerful genomic data sets, genetically determined low monocyte counts were also associated with increased AD risk, an association independent of other types of blood leukocytes.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that the observational and genetic association observed between low monocyte counts and increased risk of AD highlights a possible role of the innate immune system in AD pathogenesis.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115jwtrh]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Monocytes are part of the myeloid lineage that expands with age and represent key players in inflammatory and immune reactions. Normal monocyte values range between 0.3 and 0.9 × 10⁹/L, constituting 2% to 8% of the total white blood cell (WBC) population in peripheral blood (PB). Abnormal production and accumulation of monocytes may occur in numerous conditions. Monocytosis may be explained by inflammatory conditions ("reactive monocytosis"), as present in acute stress, myocardial infarction, chronic infection, systemic inflammation, and autoimmune disorders. Besides secondary causes, PB monocytosis is the defining phenotypic hallmark of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a chronic myeloid neoplasm with both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features that occurs almost exclusively in older individuals. In addition, monocytosis may accompany other myeloid malignancies. Current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for CMML define monocytosis as a persistent (≥ 3 months) increase in PB monocyte counts ≥ 1 × 10⁹/L in combination with a relative excess of monocytes comprising ≥ 10% of the WBC count that cannot be explained by secondary causes. Driver gene mutations are detected in the majority of patients with CMML and most frequently involve SRSF2, TET2, and ASXL1 genes, although none of these are CMML-specific. In current WHO criteria, clonal genetic lesions in the presence of unexplained, persistent monocytosis can support a diagnosis of CMML, even in the absence of typical myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative features.

### Ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes in peripheral blood identifies adults at risk of incident tuberculosis among HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy [^1162wNHs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

ML Ratios Are Stable in HIV-Uninfected Women but Are Increased by HIV Infection and Disease Progression and Normalized by HIV or Tuberculosis Treatment

We assessed how the ML ratio is affected by changes in clinical condition. Intuitively, the ML ratio is expected to vary following HIV acquisition, tuberculosis, cART initiation, or tuberculosis therapy because of changes in lymphocyte counts (C and D). Since the index takes into account lymphocyte and monocyte values, and since the latter may be independently regulated, variation of the ML ratio is of interest.

The stability of the ML ratio was assessed among 790 healthy, HIV-uninfected South African women who underwent routine safety monitoring over 2 years while enrolled in a topical microbicide gel trial. The ML ratio at visits 0 (enrollment), 3, 12, and 24 months were positively correlated (Spearman rho, 0.35–0.47; P < 5 × 10⁻⁷ for all comparisons; Figure 2 A), and there was no difference in the distribution of the ML ratio between any 2 visits (Figure 2 B). Even when monocyte and/or lymphocyte counts were outside of their respective 5th–95th percentiles, the majority (65.7%) of individuals had an ML ratio between the 5th and 95th percentiles (both cell types increased or decreased). Conversely, at 4.3% of visits the monocyte and lymphocyte counts were between the 5th and 95th percentiles, but the ML ratio was not (Figure 2 C). These data demonstrate that although the ML ratio is stable among healthy individuals, about two thirds of individuals with altered numbers (< 5th or > 95th percentile) of either cell type retain apparently normal ML ratios, and conversely about 1 in 20 individuals with normal cell numbers may still have altered ML ratios. The ML ratio captures information not adequately captured in the monocyte or lymphocyte counts alone.

### Decoding the inflammatory signature of the major depressive episode: insights from peripheral immunophenotyping in active and remitted condition, a case-control study [^114UwCbF]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

We have been one of the first groups to describe changes in the percentage and activation status of the three circulating monocyte subtypes in patients with severe MDD. Herein, we reinforced and expanded the findings mentioned above in independent and distinct patient groups, ensuring sex and age matching and employing a simplified approach of directly measuring immune parameters in a small blood sample. This technical approach holds promise for potential translation into clinical practice, as it offers a convenient and feasible screening method.

Dysregulation of the adaptive immune system in MDE patients has been suggested, with decreased numbers of circulating T cells, an increase in the ratio of CD4 + relative to CD8 + T cells, and some immunosuppression features. Our finding also suggests a dysregulation of the T-cell compartment in patients with mood disorders during MDE. While there were no significant differences in the absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD4 T cells, or the ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells between MDE patients and HC, a notable increment in the activation status of CD4 + CD69 +, and exhausted CD4 + PD1 + and CD4 + LAG3 + T lymphocytes were observed in patients with active MDE compared to HC. These results indicate that CD4 lymphocyte activation is an ongoing process in patients with MDE, associated with potential exhaustion of this compartment in depression. Considering the no-identified specific antigens for mood disorders, it has recently been demonstrated the presence of naïve and memory CD4 + T cells which can be bystander-activated, independent of a specific antigen. In this sense, the increased markers of cellular activation and exhaustion in CD4 T cells among patients with MDE represent a novel concept that may explain the high comorbidity of these patients with non-psychiatric medical conditions, particularly autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, this concept aligns with recent studies that have demonstrated a higher degree of premature T-cell aging.

### Therapeutic efficacy of dimethyl fumarate in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis associates with ROS pathway in monocytes [^112SsvUi]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Changes in the adaptive immune cell profile were further verified with a standardized flow cytometry approach. DMF responders significantly increased their proportion of naïve T cells compared to non-responders. The absolute numbers of naïve T cells did decrease in both groups, suggesting that absolute number of naïve T cells is insufficient to predict beneficial treatment outcome. Lowering of T CM and T EM in RRMS patients with ongoing disease has been described before. Our data further impliy that reduction of T CM could be relevant for beneficial DMF response. The significant difference in T CM numbers between responders and non-responders could further be supported by the differentially methylated genes involved in T cell differentiation, clonal expansion (Hippo) and T cell apoptosis (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, these pathways were also highly influenced by oxidative stress. Pathways involved in lymphocyte trafficking and migration are also changed over time and between responders and non-responders (Figs. 5c, 6g). These pathways could be of importance in e.g. T H 17 and T reg migrating to the CNS, leaving the blood. Since also T CM and T EM in the CNS are associated with disease progression, and are decreasing in blood of responders, CNS migratory pathways are likely not of relevance in T CM and T EM in our cohort. Decreased migration would more likely cause an accumulation in the blood.

In conclusion, we here demonstrate that monocytes undergo functional, numeric and DNA methylation changes early after initiation of DMF. This is, at least in part, related to their oxidative capacity and occur prior to immunomodulatory changes to pathways in CD4 + T cells associated with MS pathogenic mechanisms. A direct link between DMF-mediated modulation of monocytes and the clinical effect of DMF is suggested both by an association between the early monocyte phenotype and clinical outcomes, as well as by the identification of a genetic locus influencing both oxidative capacity in monocytes and clinical outcome of DMF treatment. Although the action of DMF on the exceedingly complex regulation of redox state is likely to involve both anti-oxidant and oxidant effects, the fact that patients starting DMF display increased levels of non-enzymatically produced isoprostanes strongly supports a net increase in oxidative state, at least in the peripheral blood. Collectively, these findings challenge the widespread belief on oxidants and anti-oxidants as categorically detrimental or beneficial in conditions of autoimmunity. On the contrary, this discovery may pave the way for work aiming to modulate and increase ROS generation in monocytes as a therapeutic strategy to control dysregulated autoimmune responses.

### Blood leukocyte counts in Alzheimer disease [^117KcQbK]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest that low blood monocyte counts are associated with an increased risk of AD in the general population as noted both observationally and genetically. These findings highlight a potential role of the innate immune system in AD pathogenesis.

### Altered monocyte subsets in patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia [^114DYTyi]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Consistent with our previous observations, CIN patients displayed lower PB absolute monocyte counts (419 ± 215/μL) compared to healthy individuals (476 ± 122/μL; P = 0.0138) corroborating further the hypothesis for a BM defect in CIN. Indeed, we have previously shown, using BM clonogenic progenitor cell assays, that the BM mononuclear cell fraction of CIN patients consists of lower number of granulocyte-monocyte colony forming units (GM-CFU) compared to healthy controls.

As regards to the PB monocyte subsets, we found decreased proportion of classical CD14 bright /CD16 − cells in CIN patients (77.05% ± 12.88%) compared to the controls (87.68% ± 4.38%; P < 0.0001). On the contrary, a significant increase was observed in the proportion of the intermediate CD14 bright /CD16 + and the non-classical CD14 dim /CD16 + monocyte subsets in CIN patients (15.03% ± 9.04% and 4.84% ± 2.90%, respectively) compared to the controls (7.80% ± 3.99% and 2.76% ± 1.50%, respectively; P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0007, respectively) (Fig. 1b). We then calculated the absolute numbers of the above monocyte subsets by multiplying the percentage of each cell subpopulation obtained by flow cytometric analysis with the absolute number of monocytes in the complete blood counts at the time of sampling. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the absolute number of the classical CD14 bright /CD16 − monocytes in CIN patients (328 ± 182/μL) compared to the controls (418 ± 114/μL; P = 0.0015) that was associated with a significant increase in the absolute number of the intermediate CD14 bright /CD16 + and the non-classical CD14 dim /CD16 + monocytes in the patients (60 ± 50/μL and 18 ± 12/μL, respectively) compared to the controls (37 ± 19 and 13 ± 8, respectively; P = 0.0272 and P = 0.0293, respectively). An inverse correlation was found between the absolute neutrophil and the absolute classical monocyte counts in CIN patients (r = − 0.336, P = 0.0045) indicating possibly a compensatory effort of the BM in response to neutropenia (Fig. 1c). Given that the classical monocytes are the prominent cell subsets among total monocytes, an inverse correlation was also found between patients' absolute neutrophil and absolute total monocyte counts (r = − 0.293, P = 0.0138) (Fig. 1c). No correlation was identified between the absolute neutrophil and the intermediate or the non-classical monocyte counts suggesting that any involvement of these cell populations in the pathophysiology of CIN represents a contributory but not the main mechanism of neutropenia.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Increased M1 / decreased M2 signature and signs of Th1 / Th2 shift in chronic patients with bipolar disorder, but not in those with schizophrenia [^112F1EaK]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We interrogated blood samples from a relatively small but very selected and homogenous cohort of patients affected by major psychoses, either BD or SCZ, to identify an immune-signature in comparison with age and gender-matched healthy individuals. We found a number of myeloid cell markers to be modulated in patients affected by BD as compared with SCZ patients and HCs. Myeloid cells have been recently in the spotlight of innate immunity studies because of their newly discovered ability to have different functional phenotypes. In macrophages, this plasticity has been simplified in two main polarization types: M1 macrophages, regarded as pro-inflammatory, phagocytic, potentially tissue damaging; and M2 macrophages, considered immunomodulatory, tissue remodeling and pro-reparative. Macrophages derive from circulating monocytes, and it is not completely clear whether circulating macrophages can be polarized. Nevertheless, we, as many authors in other diseases, found a coherent M1 signature, implying also the decrease of M2 markers, in the peripheral blood of bipolar patients. This is not new: myeloid cell alteration has been already reported in bipolar and psychotic patients. It is interesting that also the first reports on monocyte modulation in depressed patients describe the decrease in beta-2 adrenoceptors, and increased phagocytosis, phenomena associated today to M1 skewing. No doubt, however, that the field has been pioneered by Drexhage et al. describing a raised number of pro-inflammatory (M1) monocytes in bipolar patients, by several technical means. Thus, our study is the first independent confirmation of an M1 signature in monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of bipolar patients without medical comorbidities and strengthens the case for the identification of a subgroup of BD patients who may benefit by anti-inflammatory therapies. Altered monocyte cytokine profile can be the result of an immune or inflammatory process occurring in the central nervous system. For example, substance P release has been linked to major depressionand is also well known to activate monocytes. On the other hand, a large literature has shown how peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines induce depression behavior on both experimental conditions and human patients. Available data do not indicate whether the M1 shift in monocytes from bipolar patients is cause or consequence of the disease. In the latter case, anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies would be less relevant. If, however, this monocyte modulation precedes disease onset, it is most likely connected to its etiology, and its therapeutic targeting may be extremely efficacious.

### Dynamic changes in monocytes subsets in COVID-19 patients [^1174pb1R]. Human Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting the whole world and threatening human health. We aim to investigate the immunological characteristics of monocytes in critical patients with COVID-19.

Methods

The number and immune status of monocytes were detected by flow cytometry in 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 healthy individuals.

Results

In critical patients with COVID-19, the absolute number of total monocytes and CD16 - monocytes was significantly decreased but CD16 + pro-inflammatory monocytes was increased compared to healthy controls. Antigen presentation potential of monocytes, as measured by HLA-DR expression, was suppressed, while their inflammatory phenotype (CD38 expression) was enhanced. Cytokine levels showed sustained increases in critical patients. And the levels of IL-6 were positively correlated with CD16 + monocytes number. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were negatively correlated with HLA-DR expression of monocytes. During the recovery of COVID-19 patients, the count and immune status of monocyte subsets were restored by degrees. HLA-DR + monocytes possessed good sensitivity and specificity for predicting the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions

In critical patients with COVID-19, decline in number and HLA-DR expression of monocytes might lead to decreased antigen presentation potential and thus immunosuppression, while increased CD16 + pro-inflammatory monocytes might mediate hyperinflammation. HLA-DR + monocytes might be a meaningful assisted indicator to predict the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19.

Among other possible causes, decreased blood monocytes can be caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection, HIV-associated malignancies, Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and aplastic anemia. In addition, decreased blood monocytes can be caused by medications such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate, methylprednisolone, methylprednisolone acetate, cortisone and sarilumab.

### Increased monocyte count as a cellular biomarker for poor outcomes in fibrotic diseases: a retrospective, multicentre cohort study [^112KCiJm]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

We identified classical monocytes as a prognostic marker in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Increased monocyte count at the time of diagnosis continued to be associated with poor outcomes in pulmonary fibrosis after adjusting for FVC and GAP, and was also associated with increased mortality in non-pulmonary fibrotic diseases. Most importantly, we showed that a single threshold value of absolute monocyte counts of 0.95 K/μL could be used to identify high-risk patients with a fibrotic disease. Our study addresses a clinical need for a prognostic biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which would enable more conscientious allocation of scarce resources, including lung transplantations and at-risk patient monitoring. Although there has been much effort to identify prognostic biomarkers for individual fibrotic diseases, many of the published biomarkers are gene panels and multicytokine signatures that are expensive and labour intensive. By contrast, absolute monocyte count is routinely measured as part of a complete blood count, an inexpensive test used in clinical practice worldwide. Finally, the findings from our study suggest a strategy to combine existing molecular data with EHR data to improve clinical practice.

Monocytes are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The robust association of high monocyte count with mortality in other fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and myelofibrosis suggests they might contribute to pathogenesis of these diseases as well. Recruitment of monocytes to damaged tissue to aid in repair — typically a beneficial response — becomes detrimental when an organ undergoes continuous, pathogenic wound healing. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, monocytes migrate to the lung and become profibrotic inflammatory alveolar macrophages. Consistent with this model of lung fibrosis, depletion of monocytes has been shown to strikingly reduce the degree of fibrosis following lung injury in the bleomycin treatment-induced lung fibrosis mouse model. There are no clinically approved drugs that reduce monocyte count without causing neutropenia, and depletion of monocytes could perhaps lead to increased risk of infection. However, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with monocyte counts in the normal range have significantly longer survival, suggesting that reducing monocyte counts of patients to normal range could increase survival without increasing the risk of infection. Hence, selective depletion of monocytes might represent a new avenue of therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### Respiratory and systemic monocytes, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in COVID-19: implications for disease severity [^114uCaEy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, researchers worldwide have made efforts to understand the mechanisms behind the varying range of COVID-19 disease severity. Since the respiratory tract is the site of infection, and immune cells differ depending on their anatomical location, studying blood is not sufficient to understand the full immunopathogenesis in patients with COVID-19. It is becoming increasingly clear that monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) are involved in the immunopathology of COVID-19 and may play important roles in determining disease severity. Patients with mild COVID-19 display an early antiviral (interferon) response in the nasopharynx, expansion of activated intermediate monocytes, and low levels of M-MDSCs in blood. In contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 seem to lack an early efficient induction of interferons, and skew towards a more suppressive response in blood. This is characterized by downregulation of activation markers and decreased functional capacity of blood monocytes and DCs, reduced circulating DCs, and increased levels of HLA-DR lo CD14 + M-MDSCs. These suppressive characteristics could potentially contribute to delayed T-cell responses in severe COVID-19 cases. In contrast, airways of patients with severe COVID-19 display hyperinflammation with elevated levels of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, and reduced levels of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. These monocyte-derived cells contribute to excess inflammation by producing cytokines and chemokines. Here, we review the current knowledge on the role of monocytes, DCs, and M-MDSCs in COVID-19 and how alterations and the anatomical distribution of these cell populations may relate to disease severity.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^114fCcLX]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias (CMML) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by a sustained increase in monocyte counts in the peripheral blood, accompanied by dysplasia, abnormal proliferation, chromosomal anomalies and somatic mutations of haematopoietic cells. More than 95% of CMML patients harbour somatic mutations. CMML must be separated from other myeloid neoplasms and reactive monocytosis. The clinical presentation of CMML varies, but most frequently shows signs and symptoms of haematopoietic insufficiency or myeloproliferation. Robust instruments are available for assessing the prognosis of patients with CMML, such as the CMML-specific prognostic scoring system molecular. Treatment options for patients with CMML are still inadequate and generally less effective than those for other myeloid neoplasms. The only curative approach is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This article explains essential aspects of CMML pathophysiology and provides an overview of diagnostic considerations, prognostic assessment and therapeutic options.

Blood cell dynamics following FIL treatment

The reduction in the number of differentially expressed genes over time with FIL treatment was somewhat unexpected, as FIL previously displayed sustained clinical response over 16 weeks of treatment. However, gene expression in blood may be severely affected by changing leukocyte cell fractions.

Cell count data showed FIL treatment caused an increase in the absolute number of B-cells, a decrease in total white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil counts up to week 4, as well as a transient decrease in absolute monocyte count (figure 3A). Similar changes were seen in lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils when normalised to total leukocytes (figure 3B). Thus, the transient effect of FIL on lymphocyte cell fraction, monocyte fraction and neutrophil fraction can be expected to contribute towards the observed decline in the number of differentially expressed genes over time and particularly at week 16 as RNAseq signal is normalised to the total amount of mRNA. To investigate, we further analysed the effect of FIL on blood cell dynamics and successfully integrated information from both gene expression and cell count data (see the Treatment effects of FIL on gene expression factors section).

### Peripheral blood cellular immunophenotype in depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115zc1Gr]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meta-analyses implicate immune dysfunction in depression confirming increased levels of circulating immune proteins (e.g., cytokines) in depression cases compared to controls. White blood cells (WBC) both produce and are influenced by cytokines, and play key roles in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses, but their role in depression remains unclear. Therefore, a systematic review of studies of various WBC subsets in depression is required for a greater understanding of the nature of immune dysfunction in this illness.

Methods

We searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases (inception to 5 th April 2022) and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of identified studies comparing absolute count and/or relative percentage of flow cytometry-derived WBC subsets between depression cases and controls. Selected studies were quality assessed. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Thirty-three studies were included and 27 studies (n = 2277) were meta-analysed. We report an increase in mean absolute counts of WBC (seven studies; standardised mean difference [SMD] = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.61–1.53; P < 0.01; I² = 64%), granulocytes (two studies; SMD = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.45–2.68; P < 0.01; I² = 0%), neutrophils (four studies; SMD = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.23–1.58; P < 0.01; I² = 82%), monocytes (seven studies; SMD = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.19–1.01; P < 0.01; I² = 66%), CD4 + helper T cells (11 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15–0.45; P < 0.01; I² = 0%), natural killer cells (11 studies; SMD = 1.23; 95% CI, 0.38–2.08; P < 0.01; I² = 95%), B cells (10 studies; SMD = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.03–0.57; P = 0.03; I² = 56%), and activated T cells (eight studies; SMD = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24–0.66; P < 0.01; I² = 0%) in depression, compared to controls. Fewer studies reported relative percentage, indicating increased neutrophils and decreased total lymphocytes, Th1, and Th2 cells in depression.

Conclusions

Depression is characterised by widespread alterations in circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells, consistent with dysfunction in both innate and adaptive immunity. Immune cells could be useful biomarkers for illness subtyping and patient stratification in future immunotherapy trials of depression, along with cytokines, other biomarkers, and clinical measures.

### A new molecular classification to drive precision treatment strategies in primary Sjögren's syndrome [^115uEJtq]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Flow cytometry analysis

As significant alterations in patterns of peripheral blood leukocytes have been previously described, we then investigated the composition of leukocyte subsets in the various clusters. (Fig. 6a, b, Supplementary Fig. 7). In C2, the frequency and absolute numbers were similar to HV in all the different subsets analyzed. An increase in the frequency of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized C3, in association with a marked increase in the frequency of B cells. At the same time, a lymphopenia affecting mainly T cells was found in C1. Finally, the most distinguishable cluster in terms of distribution and absolute number of cells is C4. Specifically, C4 was characterized by higher percentages and absolute numbers of PMN (especially neutrophils) in peripheral blood in comparison with those in other clusters and HV. Conversely, the percentages of lymphocytes (B and T cells) and monocytes were markedly decreased in C4 compared to either the controls or the other clusters. Finally, lower frequencies and absolute numbers of basophils and DCs were also found in this cluster.

### Role of monocytes in heart failure and atrial fibrillation [^111ogzdK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

What Do Monocytes Do?

Monocytes are a type of white blood cell present in the peripheral circulation. The primary roles of monocytes are in the participation of innate immunity and to maintain or replenish different types of macrophages and dendritic cells, which aid in phagocytosis of pathogens. 25 Monocytes make up to 8% of the peripheral blood white cells and play a central role in the host response to exogenous and endogenous pathogen species, such as bacteria and viruses. Additionally, they modulate the inflammatory processes, producing both pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory cytokines and developing macrophages with pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory phenotype. 26

Monocytes are derived from macrophage dendritic cell precursors that originate from the bone marrow under normal homeostatic conditions. Common myeloid progenitor cells, derived from the bone marrow, are responsible for differentiation of precursor progenitor cells into monocytes. 26 Macrophage dendritic cell precursors mature to form either dendritic cells or macrophages. This process is dependent upon stimulation by cytokines and/or microbial molecules. 27 Evidence to date suggests that both monocytes and dendritic cells diverge at a very early multipotent progenitor stage. 26 Common myeloid progenitor cells give rise to the granulocyte‐macrophage lineage, which, in turn, give rise to macrophage dendritic cell precursors and subsequently, the committed monocyte precursor. 28 Control of monocyte/macrophage differentiation is guided by a multitude of transcription factors, the complexity of which is beyond the scope of this review article. 29

In the 1970s, studies highlighted the increase in monocyte proliferation within the bone marrow in response to inflammatory stimuli, allowing for monocytosis. 30 During steady state, circulating monocytes have a half‐life of ≈3 days. 31 Monocytes are mobilized from the bone marrow at times of tissue injury and differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells while mounting an immune response. However, they are also implicated in diseases with proinflammatory shift such as heart failure and atherosclerosis. 32, 33 Multiple animal studies have shown a diverse and complex function of monocytes depending upon the inflammatory environment, central to which is the ability of monocytes to be mobilized to site of injury. 34

With regard to atherosclerosis, monocyte‐derived "foam cell" macrophages act as a substrate and thus facilitate the progress to MI. Monocyte counts are further highly increased in other forms of acute cardiovascular pathology. 2, 33, 35

Overall, monocytes have been used as indicators of prognosis in humans, with their high numbers being associated with increased risk of recurrent MI, hospitalization, and cardiac death. Available data indicate that monocyte mobilization in acute cardiac disease does not simply reflect response to cardiac damage, but its active involvement in the pathological process. 5, 36

### Comparing malignant monocytosis across the updated WHO and ICC classifications of 2022 [^116uZG5D]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past half century, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was defined as a myelodysplastic (MD)/myeloproliferative (MP) neoplasm with the hallmark characteristic of peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10⁹/L, in conjunction with MD and/or MP bone marrow (BM) features.

Because of constant technological advancement and a rapidly evolving knowledge base, preexisting conceptions are being challenged, making the continuous adaptation of disease definitions necessary. In this regard, the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and the International Consensus Classification (ICC) introduced major common changes to the diagnostic criteria of CMML. First, in the presence of additional CMML features, the cutoff for absolute monocytosis was lowered to ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/L absolute monocyte count in both classifications, thereby incorporating cases formerly referred to as oligomonocytic (OM)-CMML into the diagnosis of CMML. Second, the CMML-0 subgroup was eliminated because of its limited clinical relevance. Finally, in the current classifications, the diagnostic focus is shifted onto recurrent molecular aberrations, thus replacing solely clinical criteria such as persisting monocytosis for ≥ 3 months in the absence of alternative diagnoses.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115thbrj]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Age-related changes in monocyte count and the emergence of monocytosis in older individuals

PB monocyte counts were available for 144 676 Lifelines participants. This population included 60 088 men and 84 588 women, with a median follow-up of 8.6 years (range, 0–13.8 years). Higher monocyte counts were observed for male participants across all ages compared with females. Upon aging, an increase in absolute monocyte count was observed in the cohort of individuals ≥ 60 years (Figure 1A). The prevalence of monocytosis, defined as a PB monocyte count ≥ 1 × 10⁹/L and ≥ 10% of total WBC count, increased with advancing age. In total, 167 out of 21 729 (0.8%) evaluable Lifelines participants ≥ 60 years had monocytosis at the study inclusion visit. Consistent with the observed sex differences in monocyte count, there was male predominance in monocytosis prevalence (Figure 1B). PB counts for community-dwelling individuals ≥ 60 years with and without monocytosis are presented in Table 1. Platelet count (P = 0.004) and hemoglobin levels (P < .001) were higher for individuals with monocytosis. Individuals with monocytosis had higher levels of mean corpuscular volume (P = 0.001). Monocytosis further associated with a concomitant increase of total WBC count (P < .001), neutrophil count (P < .001), and also lymphocyte count (P < .001). Finally, monocytosis associated with higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (concentrations (P < .001). Recently, alternative criteria were proposed to define a persistent monocytosis that is suggestive of pre-CMML conditions, including a lower absolute monocyte count or the presence of an absolute but not relative increase in monocytes. When these criteria were applied to our crosssectional community-based cohort, almost half of all individuals (41%) were meeting the proposed cutoff criteria for absolute monocytosis (monocyte count ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/L), with a substantial percentage (12%) also having a relative increase in monocyte count ≥ 10% of the total WBC count (Figure 1C).

### Fingolimod lauryl sulfate (Tascenso odt) [^116nPHtP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects on Immune Cell Numbers in the Blood

In a study in which 12 adult subjects received fingolimod 0.5 mg capsules daily, the lymphocyte count decreased to approximately 60% of baseline within 4 to 6 hours after the first dose. With continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte count continued to decrease over a 2-week period, reaching a nadir count of approximately 500 cells/mcL or approximately 30% of baseline. In a placebo-controlled study in 1272 MS patients (of whom 425 received fingolimod 0.5 mg capsules daily and 418 received placebo), 18% (N = 78) of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg reached a nadir of < 200 cells/mcL on at least 1 occasion. No patient on placebo reached a nadir of < 200 cells/mcL. Low lymphocyte counts are maintained with chronic daily dosing of fingolimod 0.5 mg daily.

Chronic fingolimod dosing leads to a mild decrease in the neutrophil count to approximately 80% of baseline. Monocytes are unaffected by fingolimod.

Peripheral lymphocyte count increases are evident within days of stopping fingolimod treatment and typically normal counts are reached within 1 to 2 months.

Results

We compared 18 NTZ-treated patients with MS with 17 UNT controls with MS (Table). The median NTZ therapy duration was 3.4 years (0.3–9 years). Five NTZ-treated patients with MS were analyzed longitudinally at 2 different time points with an interval of > 0.5 years.

NTZ Does Not Change the Absolute Number of Peripheral Blood Monocytes

At first, we determined the impact of NTZ on the frequency of peripheral blood B cells and monocytes. NTZ treatment resulted in increased CD19 + B-cell frequencies, while CD14 + monocyte frequencies were diminished (Figure 1A). To determine whether the frequency change of monocytes results from the relative increase in B cells, we measured absolute monocyte numbers as cells per microliter of blood and revealed no difference between NTZ-treated patients with MS and UNT controls with MS (Figure 1B).

### Altered monocyte subsets in patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia [^1148RART]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

To the editor,

Chronic idiopathic neutropenia (CIN) of adults is a neutrophil disorder characterized by the persistent and unexplained reduction in the number of peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils below the lower limit of the normal range in a given ethnic population, for a prolonged period (more than 3 months). The diagnosis of CIN is based on exclusion criteria, namely the absence of clinical and laboratory evidence of any underlying disease that might be associated with neutropenia, absence of history of exposure to irradiation, absence of use of chemical compounds or intake of drugs that might cause neutropenia, negative antineutrophil antibody testing to exclude antibody-mediated immune neutropenia, and normal bone marrow (BM) morphology and karyotype to exclude cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presenting as isolated neutropenia. The inclusion in the diagnostic algorithm of a detailed flow cytometric analysis of the BM progenitor cells and next generation sequencing of genes related to myeloid malignancies largely contributes to the recognition of pre-MDS neutropenic patients.

The etiology of CIN is not entirely known. However, there is evidence suggesting that the pathophysiology of CIN is related to an inflammatory BM microenvironment consisting of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ and interleukin-1β, proapoptotic mediators such as Fas-ligand, and activated oligoclonal or monoclonal T lymphocytes with myelosuppressive properties that collectively induce the accelerated apoptotic death of the granulocytic progenitor cells. Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines are also found in the PB of CIN patients. The cellular origin of these cytokines in the BM and PB of CIN patients remains largely unknown.

The possible involvement of the monocytic lineage in the pathophysiology of CIN has not been studied so far. Normally, circulating monocytes consist of phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous subpopulations, namely the classical (CD14 bright /CD16 −) monocytes which represent the majority of PB monocytes displaying mainly phagocytic and tissue repair capacity, the intermediate (CD14 bright /CD16 +) monocytes producing inflammatory cytokines in response to inflammatory stimuli, and the non-classical (CD14 dim /CD16 +) monocytes displaying proinflammatory properties in association with patrolling and antimicrobial functions. Increased number of CD16 + (intermediate and non-classical) monocytes have been reported in infectious and inflammatory conditions such as cardiovascular, chronic kidney, and autoimmune diseases.

### Peripheral blood monocyte count at onset may affect the prognosis in multiple sclerosis [^113F45vd]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating neurological disease with unknown causes. In this study, we comprehensively studied blood cell counts in the early phase of MS and compared their values with eventual prognostic variables. We found that the blood monocyte count in the early phase of MS was robustly associated with the clinical severity of MS (rho = 0.64; p = 0.0002) but that the counts of the other blood cells were not associated with severity. This correlation between monocyte count and severity was not observed in neuromyelitis optica. In conclusion, blood monocytes could be a candidate for the prognostic prediction of MS.

### Increases in inflammatory and CD14 / CD16 / CD45patrolling monocytes in sepsis: correlation with final outcome [^112uJd1V]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study shows that circulating counts of inflammatory and patrolling monocytes are greatly increased in Gram-negative sepsis. Low absolute counts of CD14 dim /CD16 pos /CD45 pos patrolling monocytes on day 3 are associated with unfavorable outcome. The presence of acute intra-abdominal infection at baseline can predict the low absolute count of patrolling monocytes on day 3. In addition, an association with unfavorable outcome is also provided by low absolute counts of CD14 pos /HLA-DR pos /CD45 pos on day 1. The present findings cannot support the use of the defined cutoffs of CD14 pos /HLA-DR pos /CD45 pos and of CD14 dim /CD16 pos /CD45 pos cells as biomarkers for sepsis since validation by another independent cohort is warranted. However, they strongly provide evidence for the independent role of CD14 pos /HLA-DR pos /CD45 pos cells at baseline and of the CD14 dim /CD16 pos /CD45 pos cells during progression of sepsis as determinants of the outcome of the septic host.

### Prognostic relevance of lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio in primary myelodysplastic syndromes: a single center experience in 889 patients [^115Pkv34]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of heterogeneous clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with an inherent tendency for leukemic transformation.MDS is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, manifested by morphological dysplasia in the bone marrow and by peripheral blood cytopenia(s). The pathophysiology of the disease remains largely elusive. In order to have accurate risk stratification of patients with primary MDS, formal prognostic models have been developed over the years. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was introduced in 1997 followed by the World Health Organization Prognostic Scoring System in 2007, the global MD Anderson score in 2008 and the most recent Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) in 2012. These prognostic models for MDS consider the number and severity of cytopenias, including anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, need for red blood cell transfusions, karyotype, bone marrow and peripheral blood blast percentage, leukocytosis, morphological subtypes, age and performance status.,

Dysregulation of host immunity is considered to be critical in the pathogenesis and progression of primary MDS. In general, early lymphocyte recovery after chemotherapy or after stem cell transplant has been shown to be associated with superior survival in various hematological and non-hematological malignancies. In the context of primary MDS, prior studies have shown that the French–American–British morphological classification, neutrophil count and CD8+ T-lymphocyte count had the best discriminatory capacity for predicting survival < 1 year and French–American–British classification, neutrophil count and serum tumor necrosis factor levels best predicted conversion to acute leukemia. Our previous studies have shown absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at the time of diagnosis to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with both del (5q)and non-del (5q) MDS. The IPSS-R, although a useful prognostic tool, does not consider the prognostic role of lymphocytopenia or monocytopenia. It is possible that these surrogates of host immunity may partly account for disease progression and poor survival; the current study examines the possibility by studying the prognostic significance of ALC, absolute monocyte count (AMC) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) at the time of diagnosis in primary MDS, in terms of both overall and leukemia-free survival.

### A comparison of monocyte counts and ex vivo and in vitro monocyte cytokine production after major surgical trauma [^117Gztfe]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Impaired function of cluster of differentiation 14-positive (CD14+) monocytes (MOs) after major surgical trauma is believed to predispose to infectious complications. Postoperative decreases in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production and interleukin (IL)-12 synthesis have been reported. There are no studies comparing absolute MO counts and MO cytokine synthesis in peripheral blood and stimulated cultures.

Methods

The study group included 10 low-risk patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Preoperatively (d0) and on the first (d1) and third (d3) postoperative d, we analyzed leukocyte counts, CD14+ MO absolute counts, HLA-DR expression, and stimulated IL-12 and TNF-alpha synthesis using flow cytometry. In addition, IL-12 and TNF-alpha release in stimulated whole blood cultures was assayed.

Results

Whereas the absolute numbers of leukocytes and CD14+ MOs were significantly elevated, HLA-DR expression was suppressed postoperatively. The proportion of TNF-alpha- and IL-12-producing MOs was reduced after surgery. This, however, led to a significant postoperative decrease only in the absolute numbers of peripheral blood IL-12+ MOs. IL-12 secretion was postoperatively reduced in whole blood cultures. The IL-12-synthesizing capacity of IL-12+ MOs was significantly reduced only on d1.

Conclusions

The immediate postoperative period is associated with an increase in the absolute MO numbers and an impairment of MO function, which is reflected in a reduced capacity to synthesize IL-12 and TNF-alpha and a decreased ability to express HLA-DR and present antigens. Whereas the cytokine-producing capacity returns to normal levels on d3, the suppression of HLA-DR expression persists.

### Enhancing clinical and immunological effects of anti-PD-1 with belapectin, a galectin-3 inhibitor [^11343RLQ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Preclinical models demonstrated that Gal-3 expression affects the polarization, programming, and function of myeloid cells, including monocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which consist of polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSC) and monocytic (M-MDSC) subsets. Therefore, we investigated the influence of belapectin+pembrolizumab therapy on monocyte and MDSC subsets in the peripheral blood and compared these subsets in responding and non-responding patients. The absolute number (figure 3A) and percent (figure 3B) of M-MDSCs trended lower at day 85 as compared with baseline in responding patients. In contrast, non-responding patients were characterized by a significant increase in the %M-MDSCs at day 85 as compared with baseline (figure 3B). When we compared the total number and frequency of M-MDSCs at day 85 between responders and non-responders, we found significantly fewer M-MDSCs in responders (figure 3A, B, left panels). Further analysis revealed that six out of nine patients who achieved an objective response showed no change or a decrease in the %M-MDSC (day 85) compared with baseline, while only two out of nine patients with disease progression showed decreased %M-MDSC over the same time interval (figure 3B, right panels). In contrast, no differences were observed in the proportion of total monocytes or PMN-MDSCs in these patients (data not shown). These data suggest that the majority of responding patients exhibited stabilization or a declining frequency of M-MDSCs as compared with expansion in non-responders, implicating M-MDSCs as a possible biomarker of response and provides insight into the potential mechanism of action of belapectin+pembrolizumab.

### The injured monocyte: the link to chronic critical illness and mortality following injury [^1121Po61]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to understand the altered innate immune response in severely injured patients leading to chronic critical illness (CCI). Specifically, it focused on characterizing the monocyte populations and their correlation with CCI development and long-term complications.

Methods

Over a 3-year period, we monitored patients with severe injuries for up to 1-year postinjury. Chronic critical illness was defined as an ICU stay exceeding 14 days with persistent organ failure. Blood samples were collected on Days 1 and 5 for monocyte phenotypic expression analysis using cytometry by time flight. The monocyte subpopulations studied were classical (CL), intermediate (INT), and nonclassical (NC), along with cell surface receptor expression and activation.

Results

Out of 80 enrolled patients, 26 (32.5%) developed CCI. Patients with CCI had more severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, 32.4 + 5.2 vs. 29.6 + 4.1, p = 0.01) and received a higher number of red blood cells (8.9 + 4.1 vs. 4.7 + 3.8 units, p < 0.01) compared with those without CCI. In patients with CCI, the NC monocytes were significantly reduced by over twofold early, and significantly increased later, compared with those without CCI. Moreover, significant changes in intracellular cytokine expression and cell receptors were observed within each monocyte subpopulation in patients with CCI, indicating an increased proinflammatory phenotype but decreased phagocytic capacity and antigen presentation. The development of CCI and the presence of this unique monocyte phenotype were associated with a significantly increased risk of infection, discharge to a long-term care facility, and 1-year mortality of 27%.

Conclusion

Development of CCI following severe injury is associated with significant long-term morbidity and unacceptably high mortality. The altered NC phenotype with reduced phagocytic capacity and antigen presentation in patients developing CCI after severe injury is appears partially responsible. Early identification of this unique phenotype may help predict and treat patients at risk for CCI, leading to improved outcomes.

### Alterations in peripheral blood monocyte and dendritic cell subset homeostasis in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients [^117EJGfN]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Antigen-presenting cells participate and are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. In our study we assessed the frequency of plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid (mDC) dendritic cells and the classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes subsets, as well as their phenotypic and functional profile. We evaluated peripheral blood from relapsing-remitting patients treated with IFN-β in remission and relapse phases and from healthy subjects. In remission, we observed a decrease of mDC/pDC ratio and a return to normal values in relapse. In both phases the frequency of non-classical monocytes decreases. Concerning the phenotypic characterization, an increased HLA-DR expression was observed in remission and a decrease in relapse, revealing alterations in monocytes and dendritic cells homeostasis.

### Peripheral blood monocyte count is a dynamic prognostic biomarker in multiple myeloma [^115NiYyv]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

With the growing knowledge of multiple myeloma (MM) pathobiology and the introduction of novel therapies, risk stratification continues to evolve. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages, derived from peripheral blood monocytes, support malignant plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow. Because peripheral blood absolute monocyte count (AMC) is thought to reflect the bone marrow microenvironment, we sought to evaluate the prognostic significance of AMC in MM. We retrospectively analyzed 10 822 patients newly diagnosed with MM between 2000 and 2019 at Veteran's Administration hospitals. We obtained AMC closest to diagnosis and every 3 months thereafter up to 2.5 years. Patients were stratified into 4 groups: low, normal, elevated, and severely elevated AMC (< 0.2, 0.2- < 0.8, 0.8- < 1.25, and ≥ 1.25 × 10³/mm³, respectively). Abnormal AMC at diagnosis was observed in 25.3% of the patients and was associated with an inferior overall survival (OS). In patients with low, severely elevated, elevated, and normal AMC, respectively, median OS at diagnosis was 2.3, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.6 years (P < .001) and at 2.5 years was 2.0, 2.6, 3.4, and 3.9 years (P < .001). Patients with normal AMC at diagnosis who developed an abnormal AMC > 1 year after diagnosis also had an inferior OS relative to patients who maintained a normal AMC. Abnormal AMC was also associated with inferior OS independent of validated prognostic markers, including the international staging system and lactate dehydrogenase. Our findings provide novel clues for future prospective studies on the functional role of monocytes in MM, which could be a readily available metric for risk stratification.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^114GYZTF]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

CMML was first described in the early 1970sand has been reported as a preleukaemic state. The model of leukaemic transformation corresponds to that of myelodysplastic syndromes. However, CMML differs from myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) in the obligatory monocyte population that is detectable in the blood at diagnosis. Due to the similarity of CMML and MDS, the French American British classification (FAB) proposalsclassified CMML and MDS as close relatives, thus creating a problem because many people now believe that CMML is just a variant of MDS. However, it has become clear that CMML is more than MDS plus monocytosis, not only based on its clinical presentation but also with regard to genetic alterations and therapeutic problems. The FAB classification proposed an obligatory monocytosis of more than 1000/μL, which was retained over the years until the threshold was lowered to 500/μL in both the WHO classification of 2022and the International Consensus Classification (ICC) classification. In addition, signs of dysplasia in blood and marrow have always been included as characterizing features of CMML. Inspired by the concept of 'oligomonocytic leukaemia', the threshold of 500 monocytes/μL is now used as a defining event in CMML, together with evidence of clonality by the means of detection of somatic mutations or chromosomal aberrations. This proposal solves, at least in part, another problem in the diagnosis of CMML, namely the differentiation against various non‐myeloid diseases with reactive monocytosis, as well as distinction between CMML and some other myeloid malignancies. Table 1 presents a list of differential diagnoses that need to be excluded, especially in those rare cases without proof of clonality. The increasing availability and decreasing cost of DNA sequencing promote investigations of clonality, which either confirm the suspected diagnosis of CMML or, in case of negative findings, point to reactive monocytosis. There is evidence that molecular screening can be performed on peripheral blood cells.

### Relationship of blood monocytes with chronic lymphocytic leukemia aggressiveness and outcomes: a multi-institutional study [^112Qd2Rb]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Monocyte-derived cells, constituents of the cancer microenvironment, support chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell survival in vitro via direct cell-cell interaction and secreted factors. We hypothesized that circulating absolute monocyte count (AMC) reflects the monocyte-derived cells in the microenvironment, and that higher AMC is associated with increased CLL cell survival in vivo and thus inferior CLL patient outcomes. We assessed the extent to which AMC at diagnosis of CLL is correlated with clinical outcomes, and whether this information adds to currently used prognostic markers. We evaluated AMC, clinically used prognostic markers, and time to event data from 1,168 CLL patients followed at the Mayo Clinic, the Duke University Medical Center, and the Durham VA Medical Center. Elevated AMC was significantly associated with inferior clinical outcomes, including time to first therapy (TTT) and overall survival (OS). AMC combined with established clinical and molecular prognostic markers significantly improved risk-stratification of CLL patients for TTT. As an elevated AMC at diagnosis is associated with accelerated disease progression, and monocyte-derived cells in the CLL microenvironment promote CLL cell survival and proliferation, these findings suggest that monocytes and monocyte-derived cells are rational therapeutic targets in CLL.

### Impaired functions of peripheral blood monocyte subpopulations in aged humans [^112FUmdN]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Four subsets of monocytes in healthy young and aged subjects

Monocyte subsets were analyzed in whole blood samples with FITC-anti-CD14 and Alexa687-anti-CD16 monoclonal antibodies and isotype controls using FACSCalibur. Figure 1a shows a representative cytoflourograph for the analysis of four subsets of monocytes. The order of frequency was CD14 ++(high) CD16 − (major subset) > CD14 ++(high) CD16 + > CD14 +(low) CD16 − > CD14 +(low) CD16 +. Figures 1b and c show the cumulative data for the proportions and absolute numbers, respectively, for all four subsets of monocytes from 17 young subjects and 17 aged subjects. A significant increase in the proportions (< 0.03) and number (P < 0.03) of CD14 ++(high) CD16 +, and CD14 +(low) CD16 + monocytes, and a significant decrease in the proportions (P < 0.001) and numbers (P < 0.04) of CD14 +(low) CD16 − was observed in aged subjects. No significant difference was observed between young and aged subjects in the proportions or numbers of CD14 ++(high) CD16 − subset.

### Peripheral blood monocyte count is a dynamic prognostic biomarker in multiple myeloma [^112br61j]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Our observations raise questions about the mechanism driving the impact of increased AMC on the outcome. This is especially intriguing because both high and low AMC have similar adverse effects on the outcome. Peripheral blood monocyte–derived TAMs are cellular components of the bone marrow niche that promote MM cell survival and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis by complex interactions. High AMC at diagnosis or its occurrence later in follow-up could potentially reflect their direct or indirect effects on MM cells through various cell surface receptors or soluble factors. Importantly, we also found that low AMCs at diagnosis and follow-up were predictive of poor survival. The mechanism driving this effect is unlikely to be the same as that described for patients with increased AMCs. Monocytopenia has been reported in the context of leukemia, lymphoma, and MM as an immune system biomarker. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, studies suggest that there could be defective hematopoiesis because of high tumor burden within the bone marrow. Functional impairment of hematopoietic stem cells results in immunosuppression and evasion of the immune system by MM cells, which could possibly lead to more aggressive disease, susceptibility to infections, and poorer clinical outcomes. We have also investigated whether the impact of abnormal AMC is still observed with the use of novel agents. Inferior outcomes in patients with abnormal AMC diagnosed after 2012 when the use of novel agents became universal suggests a broader significance of abnormal AMC in myeloma pathobiology. Overall, our findings emphasize the need to study the role of macrophage-monocyte interactions in MM pathobiology.

### Bariatric surgery reverses morbid obesity-induced changes in the composition of circulating immune cells-a prospective cohort study [^116CBk6D]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Morbid obesity is associated with aging of the immune system, a phenomenon known as "inflammaging", characterized by increased numbers of various immune cell subsets.

Objectives

To evaluate the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on immune cell subsets in patients with obesity and to determine the impact of metabolic syndrome on these changes.

Setting

High-volume bariatric center, Netherlands.

Methods

This prospective cohort study included patients with obesity, with and without metabolic syndrome, as well as lean controls. Peripheral blood samples were collected preoperatively (T0) and at various time points up to 18 months postoperatively (T18). Flow cytometry was used to measure absolute numbers of T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocyte subsets, with adjustments for age and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus.

Results

At T0, patients with obesity had elevated numbers of CD4+ CD31 naïve T cells, CD8+ terminally differentiated effector memory RA T cells, double-negative B cells, plasmablasts, NK cells, and monocytes compared with lean controls. CD8+ central memory T cells were decreased in patients with obesity. While most immune cell subsets gradually normalized by T18, some subsets, including T cells, B cells, and NK cells, that were initially elevated, decreased during follow-up and ultimately ended up lower than those in lean controls at T12 or T18. Metabolic syndrome did not affect these outcomes. COVID-19-related disruptions reduced the number of patients assessed over time.

Conclusions

Bariatric surgery restores the harmful effects of morbid obesity on the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the long-term for patients with obesity, both with and without metabolic syndrome.

### Prognostic relevance of lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio in primary myelodysplastic syndromes: a single center experience in 889 patients [^1163fKVd]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

At the minimum, the findings from the current study warrant prospective monitoring of ALC and AMC during MDS clinical trials in order to determine their value as prognostic biomarkers and in providing insight into mechanism of drug action. It is possible that prognostic relevance of ALC is more or less pronounced depending on which specific lymphocyte subsets are studied and this too needs to be examined in future studies. Finally, it is important to recognize the limiting effect of multiple confounders, such as concurrent infections and use of drugs including corticosteroids, in the accurate assessment of both ALC and AMC.

### Impact of cholesterol on proinflammatory monocyte production by the bone marrow [^115nMAac]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, despite improved preventive strategies and survival. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the key driver of atherosclerotic CVD, making cholesterol-lowering treatment the cornerstone of CVD prevention. Although a substantial proportion of cardiovascular (CV) events is prevented by cholesterol-lowering treatment, residual CV risk is considerable, even in patients who reach very low plasma LDL-C levels. One of the contributors to residual CV risk is inflammation, which is suggested to be partly driven by enhanced monocyte activation. Targeting the proinflammatory monocyte response is therefore considered a potential strategy to reduce inflammatory risk with minimal systemic immunosuppression.

Mechanistically, atherosclerosis is the result of an unresolved inflammatory response of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to cholesterol retention in the arterial wall. Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that hypercholesterolaemia aggravates this inflammatory process by enhancing the production of proinflammatory monocytes in the bone marrow (BM) compartment. This is of clinical interest since epidemiological studies have identified monocyte count as an important CV risk factor, whereas translational research has confirmed the association of a proinflammatory monocyte phenotype with increased inflammatory activity in the arterial wall.

In steady state, all types of mature blood cells — including monocytes — are produced in the BM compartment via a process called haematopoiesis. Following specific stimuli, multipotent haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo lineage commitment steps while proliferating and differentiating into leukocytes, erythrocytes or thrombocytes. Animal studies have shown that hypercholesterolaemia influences this process by promoting HSPC proliferation and myeloid commitment, ultimately leading to monocytosis and accelerated atherosclerosis. Also, alterations in lipid metabolism in HSPCs themselves following, for example, activation of cholesterol synthesisor blocking of cholesterol efflux, enhances HSPC expansion and myeloid skewing. Together, these studies substantiate that plasma cholesterol levels and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis have impact on HSPC proliferation and differentiation. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced monocyte response in hypercholesterolemic patientscould be traced back to LDL-C-mediated disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in HSPCs and subsequent altered haematopoiesis.

### Peripheral blood immunophenotyping in a large cohort of patients with shwachman-diamond syndrome [^115RE16G]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is one of the more common inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, characterized by neutropenia, occasional thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Bone marrow evaluation reveals an increased number of monocytes and mature B cells along with decreased granulocytes. However, little is known about the subpopulations of peripheral blood cells, and few previous publications have been based on a small number of patients. Here, we report a comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis from a cohort of 37 SDS patients who display impairment mostly in the myeloid compartment with a deficiency also in the number of B cells and CD4/CD8 double-negative T cells.

### Human dermal CD14 ⁺ cells are a transient population of monocyte-derived macrophages [^114zLaZh]. Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Skin CD14 + Cells Are Derived from CD14 + Blood Monocytes

Human tissue DCs are depleted in patients lacking circulating DCs and monocytes as shown by patients with genetic deficiency of monocytes and DCs due to GATA2 or IRF8 mutation, but the exact precursor-progeny relationships are difficult to demonstrate conclusively in humans. We previously showed that skin CD14 + cells are derived from donor bone marrow within 40 days of HSCT, but the kinetics of this relationship have not been resolved in detail. In this study, we followed the course of blood and skin monocytes, macrophages, and DCs during preparative cytotoxic therapy for transplantation and for up to 2 weeks after HSCT (clinical data in Table S1). Cytotoxic therapy induced bone-marrow suppression and absolute monocytopenia by the day of transplantation (day 0) (Figure 2 A). This was mirrored by a rapid loss of CD14 + cells from the skin within 6 days. After a delay of 6 days, macrophage numbers also declined to approximately 50%, where they remained stable. In the early recovery phase after HSCT, there was a rapid rise in CD14 + blood monocytes, which coincided with a rapid reconstitution of skin CD14 + cells (Figure 2 B). The kinetics of DC recovery were slower in the blood and skin and did not attain the same frequency as healthy controls (Figures 2 A and 2B). The temporal relationship between blood CD14 + monocytes and skin CD14 + cells is consistent with a precursor-progeny relationship in which CD14 + monocytes give rise to CD14 + cells within a short timeframe. In support of the rapid differentiation step of CD14 + monocytes into skin CD14 + cells suggested by our in vivo findings, we showed that purified CD14 + monocytes upregulated antigens and adopted morphological changes characteristic of CD14 + tissue cells upon culture with primary endothelial cells over 3 days (Figure 2 C).

### Brown adipose tissue monocytes support tissue expansion [^112cQTey]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Monocytes are part of the mononuclear phagocytic system. Monocytes play a central role during inflammatory conditions and a better understanding of their dynamics might open therapeutic opportunities. In the present study, we focused on the characterization and impact of monocytes on brown adipose tissue (BAT) functions during tissue remodeling. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of BAT immune cells uncovered a large diversity in monocyte and macrophage populations. Fate-mapping experiments demonstrated that the BAT macrophage pool requires constant replenishment from monocytes. Using a genetic model of BAT expansion, we found that brown fat monocyte numbers were selectively increased in this scenario. This observation was confirmed using a CCR2-binding radiotracer and positron emission tomography. Importantly, in line with their tissue recruitment, blood monocyte counts were decreased while bone marrow hematopoiesis was not affected. Monocyte depletion prevented brown adipose tissue expansion and altered its architecture. Podoplanin engagement is strictly required for BAT expansion. Together, these data redefine the diversity of immune cells in the BAT and emphasize the role of monocyte recruitment for tissue remodeling.

### Phenotype changes and impaired function of dendritic cell subsets in patients with sepsis: a prospective observational analysis [^112QMLn8]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with sepsis often demonstrate severely impaired immune responses. The hallmark of this state of immunoparalysis is monocytic deactivation characterized by decreased human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, diminished numbers of dendritic cells (DCs) were reported in patients with sepsis. However, little is known about DC phenotype and function in human sepsis. We therefore compared phenotypic and functional changes in monocyte and DC subsets in patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis.

Methods

In a prospective observational analysis, 16 consecutive patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (age 59.2 ± 9.7 years, 13 male, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 6.1 ± 2.7) and immunoparalysis (monocytic HLA-DR expression < 5,000 antibodies/cell) and 16 healthy volunteers were included. Peripheral blood DC counts, HLA-DR expression and ex vivo cytokine production were evaluated in comparison with monocyte subsets over time.

Results

At baseline, a profound reduction in the numbers of myeloid DCs (MDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs), and CD14dimCD16positive monocytes was observed in sepsis whereas CD14brightCD16negative and CD14brightCD16positive monocyte numbers were increased. HLA-DR expression was reduced on all monocyte and DC subsets. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and intracellular cytokine staining in response to lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid was impaired in monocyte subsets and MDCs, whereas IL-10 secretion was increased. IFNalpha response by stimulated PDCs was significantly decreased compared with controls. At day 28, HLA-DR expression and cytokine production of DC and monocyte subsets remained lower in septic patients compared with controls.

Conclusions

In sepsis, long-lasting functional deactivation is common to all circulating monocyte and DC subsets. In addition to decreased peripheral blood DC counts, functional impairment of antigen-presenting cells may contribute to an impaired antimicrobial defense in sepsis.

### Low lymphocyte count and high monocyte count predicts poor prognosis of gastric cancer [^111rwUCu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Up to date, the prognosis and treatment of gastric cancer patients after radical gastrectomy mainly depends on TNM stage system. However, the prognosis of gastric cancer patients could be various even with the same tumor stage. Thus, additional parameters need to be defined to better evaluate the prognosis of patients.

Over the past decades, prognostic value of blood test parameters in gastric cancer patients has been investigated by numerous studies. Because blood test is simple, convenient, reproducible and cost-effective. However, the most common parameters been investigated in the previous reports were neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). As NLR and PLR could effectively reflect the inflammation and immune status in vivo, which have been demonstrated to be associated with the progression and prognosis of tumors. However, the prognostic value of absolute count of blood cells, which was more convenient, has rarely been investigated in gastric cancer patients.

Given this situation, the present study aims to investigate the prognostic value of absolute count of WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet in gastric cancer patients.

### Monocytopenia in clozapine-induced agranulocytosis: insights into pathophysiology and treatment [^112oDWte]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 26-year-old man with history of schizophrenia was admitted for neutropaenia. He was started on clozapine 3months prior to admission. As a result he had weekly monitoring of his blood counts and on day of admission was noted to have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 450 cells/μL. He was admitted for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Clozapine was held and the patient was started on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) filgrastim and received two doses without any signs of ANC recovery. On further review, it was noted that the absolute monocyte count (AMC) was also low and tracked with the trend of ANC. We then theorised that the impact of clozapine was on a haematopoietic precursor (colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage, CFU-GM) which gives rise to both monocytic and myeloid lineages. Therefore, sargramostim GM-CSF was started. After two doses, the ANC and AMC started trending up and by the third dose, both counts had fully recovered. He was discharged from the hospital and there are no plans to rechallenge with clozapine. Thus, we demonstrate a case of monocytopenia accompanying clozapine-induced agranulocytosis with successful use of GM-CSF. At least in this case, the target of the clozapine injury appears to be the CFU-GM, explaining the rapid and full response to GM-CSF after lack of response to G-CSF.

### Peripheral blood lymphocyte / monocyte ratio at diagnosis and survival in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma [^1112jGCj]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphopenia and tumor-associated macrophages are negative prognostic factors for survival in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. We, therefore, studied whether the peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis affects survival in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Design and Methods

We studied 476 consecutive patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma followed at the Mayo Clinic from 1974 to 2010. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve were used to determine cut-off values for the absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis, while proportional hazards models were used to compare survival based on the absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis.

Results

The median follow-up period was 5.6 years (range, 0.1–33.7 years). An absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis of 1.1 or more was the best cut-off value for survival with an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.96), a sensitivity of 90% (95% confidence interval, 85% to 96%) and specificity of 79% (95% confidence interval, 73% to 88%). Absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count ratio at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.38, P < 0.0001); lymphoma-specific survival (hazard ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.25, P < 0.0001); progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.66, P < 0.002) and time to progression (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.57, P < 0.0006).

Conclusions

The ratio of absolute lymphocyte count/absolute monocyte count at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor for survival and provides a single biomarker to predict clinical outcomes in patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

### Clinical and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals requiring hospitalization [^114Wg2nK]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune Cell Landscape Reveals Marked Alterations in Unvaccinated Patients

Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has a profound impact on the cells of the immune system. With the aim of producing a general characterization of the immunological profile of vaccinated and unvaccinated hospitalized individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, we evaluated leukocyte subsets' distribution and features at hospital admission. Despite the two groups were found similar in terms of absolute numbers of white blood cells (WBC), specific subsets displayed significant differences. While neutrophils and basophils presented similar levels in both cohorts, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes' absolute numbers were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the unvaccinated with respect to the vaccinated group (Fig. 2A). Following the same trend, the unvaccinated patients showed decreased absolute numbers of both circulating CD141 + dendritic cells (cDC1 DCs) and CD1c + (cDC2) DCs, as well as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (Fig. 2B). Neutrophil activation markers such as CD11b, CD64, and CD66b were also found to be expressed at similar levels in both groups (Fig. 2C). The monocyte compartment was further characterized: CD64 and CD11b expression levels resulted similar between the two groups, while HLA-DR showed a trend towards reduced expression in the unvaccinated cohort (Fig. 2C). In addition, we dissected the proportions of classical, intermediate, and non-classical subsets. Interestingly, we found significantly lower frequencies (p < 0.05) of CD14+ /CD16++ (non-classical, M3) monocytes in the unvaccinated patients than in vaccinated subjects, while the opposite trend applied for CD14++ /CD16- (classical, M1) monocytes, which presented significantly higher frequencies (p < 0.05) in the unvaccinated group. On the contrary, the CD14++ /CD16+ (intermediate, M2) monocyte subset's frequencies were comparable between the two cohorts (Fig. 2D).

### Changes in the molecular and functional phenotype of bovine monocytes duringInfection [^111FkB1e]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Expansion of intermediate monocytes is associated with progression of lethal T. parva infection.

After characterizing the three subsets of bovine monocytes and demonstrating that T. parva infection induces alterations in their relative proportions at 12 dpi, we next compared lethally and nonlethally infected cattle over time to investigate changes in the kinetics of surface expression of CD14 and CD16 on the monocyte subsets. Infected cattle were examined at 3, 7, 9, and 12 dpi. Complete blood cell counts showed a dramatic decrease in the absolute numbers of leukocytes (Fig. 2A), including lymphocytes (Fig. 2B), in whole blood during both lethal and nonlethal infection. However, no significant changes in the absolute number of total monocytes were observed (Fig. 2C). Changes in the kinetics of monocyte subset proportions were evaluated by flow cytometry, as described above (Fig. 2D to F). Analysis revealed a marked decrease in nonclassical monocytes and simultaneous increase in the intermediate subset at 9 and 12 dpi in lethally infected cattle compared to those in nonlethally infected animals (Fig. 2E and F). Interestingly, after day 7 postinfection, the percentage of nonclassical monocytes continued to decrease in lethally infected, but not nonlethally infected, animals (Fig. 2F). Also, after 7 dpi, the percentage of intermediate monocytes continued to increase in lethal, but not nonlethal, T. parva infection (Fig. 2E). These changes corresponded to a rapid clinical decline of lethally infected animals from 7 dpi onward, with all lethally infected cattle requiring euthanasia due to respiratory distress by day 14 postinfection.

### Ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes in peripheral blood identifies adults at risk of incident tuberculosis among HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy [^116VaNET]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Next, ML ratios were compared before and after HIV acquisition in a cohort of 160 high-risk women prospectively followed for HIV acquisition in several studies. ML ratios were similar between enrollment (median, 258 days before infection; interquartile range [IQR], 126–432 days before infection) and the last time point before infection acquisition (median, 97 days before infection; IQR, 43–180 days before infection; Figure 3 A). In contrast, ML ratios were significantly increased following HIV acquisition (median time of sampling, 29 days after infection; IQR, 15–54 days after infection; median ML ratio, 0.193 before infection vs 0.256 after infection; P = 8.2 × 10⁻⁶; Figure 3 A), consistent with postinfection lymphopenia. Moreover, the distribution of ML ratios broadened with HIV infection (Figure 3 B). The ML ratio increased significantly over the course of HIV disease progression (Figure 3 C and 3 D; rho for linear correlation with time after infection, 0.17; P < 5 × 10⁻¹²). The ML ratio was not associated with the rate of HIV disease progression, defined as the time to achievement of a CD4 + T-cell count of < 350 cells/mL, death, or the need for cART (data not shown).

### Monocyte subpopulations and cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease [^113riXGv]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Chronic microinflammation and its cellular hallmark, monocyte activation, contribute substantially to the tremendous burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Monocyte heterogeneity is widely acknowledged. Cell-surface expression of CD14 and CD16 defines three functionally and phenotypically distinct subsets of monocytes: classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)) monocytes, intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)) monocytes, and nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) monocytes. A growing body of circumstantial evidence suggests that intermediate monocytes, in particular, contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in the general population as well as in patients with CKD. Intermediate monocytes express a unique pattern of chemokine receptors that have been implicated in atherogenesis. Moreover, this subset of monocytes is predisposed to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Findings from epidemiological studies indicate that numbers of intermediate monocytes increase with worsening renal function, and that high cell counts predict adverse outcomes in patients undergoing dialysis as well as in patients at early stages of CKD. Based on laboratory and clinical data, intermediate monocytes are a promising therapeutic target for CVD in patients with CKD.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^111VP6oW]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study assessing the occurrence of monocytosis in an unbiased and prospective cohort of community-dwelling individuals. To investigate the potential presence of pre-CMML conditions among older individuals with clonal monocytosis, we studied the relation between monocytosis and clonal hematopoiesis in a nested case-control design. Our results help to distinguish mutational spectra of importance in the context of monocytosis and show that the presence of CH in individuals with monocytosis is not sufficient to diagnose (prephases of) CMML in asymptomatic or community-dwelling individuals.

Monocytosis was detected in a substantial proportion of older individuals, and its prevalence increased with age. CMML is characterized by a strong male predominance, especially with aging. In this population-based cohort, we also observed higher monocyte counts and a higher prevalence of monocytosis in males. The definition of monocytosis was in accordance with current cutoffs used in WHO criteria to define monocytosis in CMML, except for the evaluation of 3-month persistence of monocytosis, the evaluation of which was hampered by the large time interval for follow-up blood counts. When applying less stringent proposed criteria that have been proposed in the literature (eg, monocytosis ≥ 10% of WBC count and ≥ 0.5 × 10⁹/L) to define mild but relevant monocytosis, we identified a much higher proportion of individuals with monocytosis (up to 12%). The high prevalence of monocytosis according to these criteria indicates that these may not be clinically useful to define prestages of CMML in the absence of other cocriteria.

### Myeloperoxidase deficiency manifesting as pseudoneutropenia with low mean peroxidase index and high monocyte count in 4 adult patients [^115KgrE3]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency, one of the most common inherited phagocyte defects, and may exist as a transient phenomenon in combination with some clinical condition. Hematological analyzer ADVIA 2120i is used to identify the different types of leukocytes based on their size and staining properties, and by mean peroxidase index (MPXI). When MPO deficiency is present, neutrophils may be incorrectly counted as monocytes with lower MPXI values. We encountered a few cases of MPO deficiency with abnormally high monocytes counts resulting in pseudoneutropenia. These abnormal reports could lead to a mistaken diagnosis of severe neutropenia, which could result in unnecessary therapy. Manual differential count exhibited the normal differential count in every case. Every case yielded a markedly low MPXI value below -20. In conclusion, we suggest that MPO deficiency must be considered in patients especially when abnormally high monocyte counts combined with low MPXI values are observed.

### Increased monocyte count and red cell distribution width as prognostic biomarkers in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1111hTEk]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This real-life retrospective study demonstrated that peripheral blood monocyte count was predictive of all-cause mortality in the derivation cohort and in a pooled collective of highly characterized patients with IPF. We also showed that patients with elevated levels of monocyte count and RDW exhibited more advanced disease at initial assessment compared to patients with low levels. There was no association of high monocyte count or RDW with 1-year disease progression, as assessed by functional decline. No effects of anti-fibrotic treatment on monocyte count or RDW were observed over 1-year of follow-up. Differences in baseline monocyte count, RDW, DLCO% pred and LTOT use between the two cohorts might be partially attributed to divergent endotypes across the world and/or different baseline functional status.

Our findings are consistent with those of previous reports evaluating a possible link between monocyte count and prognosis in patients with IPF. A previous retrospective, multicenter cohort study showed that monocyte count ≥ 0.95 K/μL was significantly associated with all-cause mortality compared to monocyte count < 0.95 K/μL in 7459 patients with IPF. Nonetheless, IPF diagnosis in this study was based on ICD-10 medical records posing limitations to the findings. Analysis of 231 patients with IPF from the Australian registry corroborated evidence that elevated monocyte count were associated with worse clinical outcomes. Most recently, pooled retrospective analysis of 2067 highly characterized patients with IPF derived from the pirfenidone trials (ASCEND, CAPACITY and INSPIRE) showed that patients with IPF and monocyte count in the range of 0.60–0.95 K/μL or ≥ 0.95 K/μL had a higher 1-year risk of IPF progression, all-cause hospitalization and all-cause mortality compared to patients with monocyte count of < 0.60 K/μL. Given the results from pirfenidone clinical trials and our real-life study, monocyte count ≥ 0.60 K/μL, appears to be a highly robust and reproducible cut-off threshold which could potentially enrich the population of clinical trials, as a marker associated with greater risk of mortality and/or disease progression. In addition, it may alert clinicians in the context of risk stratification for timely interventions. In our study, monocyte count was predictive of all-cause mortality in the derivation but not the validation cohort. This might be partially attributed to the worse baseline functional status of the validation cohort, as indicated by the lower DLCO%pred and increased use of LTOT at baseline.

### Increased percentage of IL-12 + monocytes in the blood correlates with the presence of active MRI lesions in MS [^113CXbRZ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2001). Low credibility.

Interleukin (IL)-12 is a cytokine thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). We have previously shown that patients with progressive MS have a high percentage of IL-12-producing monocytes in the blood compared to normal individuals. We analyzed 269 blood samples from 189 MS patients for the percentage of IL-12-producing monocytes. We found that the increased IL-12 expression correlates with disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and with disease activity, measured by the presence of gadolinium-enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions.

### Monocyte count as a prognostic biomarker in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1156Qg9a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are a number of limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results of this analysis, including the relatively small number of patients included in the ≥ 0.95 × 10⁹ cells/L monocyte count group versus the 0.60 to < 0.95 × 10⁹ cells/L and < 0.60 × 10⁹ cells/L groups. The low mortality rate across subgroups defined by change in monocyte count (and corresponding low statistical power) is another limitation. Furthermore, the effect of comorbidities (such as CAD, which may also result in high monocyte concentrations) on the observed association between monocyte count and study outcomes is not known. In addition, steroid use can lead to reduced monocyte counts and possible shifts in monocyte phenotype, and although chronic steroid use was not found to considerably affect monocyte counts in this analysis, no data were available on the duration or timing of nonchronic steroid use, and, as such, their effect on monocyte counts could not be fully determined. We also considered that treatment group (placebo, pirfenidone, or IFNγ-1b) may also have affected monocyte count; this possible effect could not be adequately assessed because classification and identification of patients who were responders to therapy was not possible in a robust manner with the current data set. In a descriptive analysis, although some differences in mean change from baseline in monocyte count over 1 year were observed for pirfenidone and IFNγ-1b compared with placebo, these changes were not clinically meaningful. This was a retrospective, pooled analysis restricted to patients with IPF from clinical trials; therefore, the analysis population included more patients with greater short-term survival than real-world cohorts because patients with severe disease were excluded. This analysis may also underestimate the longer-term prognostic value of monocyte counts because relatively limited outcome data were available beyond the end of the trials. It should also be noted that the relationship between monocyte count and study outcomes did not appear to be linear, and thus a categorical (rather than continuous) measure for monocyte count was employed in most of these analyses.

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis of pooled data from ASCEND, CAPACITY, and INSPIRE, elevated monocyte count was associated with increased risks of IPF progression, hospitalization, and mortality. Monocyte count may provide a novel, simple, and inexpensive prognostic biomarker in patients with IPF and should be investigated further in future prospective clinical studies.

### Haematopoietic and immune defects associated with GATA2 mutation [^116sqkHP]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Life without DCs

Lack of DCs was highlighted in the description of DCML deficiency (Bigley et al,) but was also previously recorded in at least one case report (Witzke et al). The lack of DCs may impair recognition of viruses and intracellular pathogens contributing to disseminated herpes virus infection and mycobacterial susceptibility. In earlier case reports, defects in antigen-presenting cell-dependent mitogen responses (concanavalin A), responses to immunization, recall antigens and delayed type hypersensitivity are all documented (Kaur et al; Witzke et al). A systematic study of vaccine responses has not been performed. Interestingly, patients with undetectable blood (and probably also tissue DCs) still experience graft- versus -host disease when transplanted (Cuellar-Rodriguez et al). The persistence of tissue macrophages and epidermal Langerhans Cells may offer an alternative route of antigen presentation when DCs are profoundly depleted (Bigley et al).

Monocytes and mycobacterial infection

Excluding generalized BMF, GATA2 mutation and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) are two conditions notable for monocytopenia. Monocytopenia in HCL is less severe than GATA2 deficiency but also known to confer a risk of mycobacterial infection of 4–9% (Thaker et al). Monocytopenia leads to a profound impairment of whole blood cytokine responses in tests used to screen for genetic susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. Both IL12 and γ-interferon (IFNγ) responses are blunted (Bigley et al). This might be a trivial result given the absence of monocytes, but can be argued that it is a useful reflection of the in vivo defect and how its magnitude compares with established molecular causes of mycobacterial susceptibility, such as IFNγ receptor mutations (Fischer). Resistance to mycobacterial infection is complex and the well-described IFNγ-IL12 axis is multiply compromised by the absence of NK cells and DCs, in addition to monocytes. Although tissue macrophages are present at sites of infection, organized granulomatous inflammation is deficient.

### Monocytosis and a low lymphocyte to monocyte ratio are effective biomarkers of ulcerative colitis disease activity [^114DGqyU]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current biomarkers in ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited by their performance, cost, and limited availability in daily practice. This study examined alterations in the leukocyte profiles as biomarkers of UC activity, including the effects of age, gender, and medications.

Methods

Case-control study that included 110 UC subjects, 75 subjects with Clostridium difficile infection, and 75 non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects, randomly selected from a single-institution IBD database. Mean values of neutrophils (N), lymphocytes (L), monocytes (M) and their ratios were compared between groups. Receiver operator curve analyses assessed the performance of each biomarker in discriminating disease states. Subgroup analyses examined leukocytes profiles with endoscopic activity.

Results

Elevated monocyte counts and decreased L/M values significantly differed between subjects with active UC and UC in remission and performed better than the other leukocyte profiles. A monocyte count of 483 and L/M ratio of 3.1 were 60% sensitive and had a specificity of 61% and 53%, respectively for active UC. Monocyte count > 860 and L/M value < 1.6 had a 75% positive predictive value for UC activity. Those markers also correlated with endoscopically active disease. L/M and N/L values performed best at differentiating active UC from non-IBD controls, whereas N/L and N values performed best at differentiating from C. difficile controls.

Conclusions

Monocytosis and a low L/M ratio might be effective, readily available, and low-cost biomarkers to identify disease activity in UC patients. N/L values were more effective in distinguishing active UC patients from patients without IBD and those with C. difficile infection.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^114tG3kn]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by sustained peripheral blood monocytosis (absolute monocyte count ≥ 1 × 10⁹/L, with monocytes accounting for ≥ 10% of the white blood cells), predominantly arising in the context of age-related clonal hematopoiesis, with overlapping features of myelodys-plastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The exact incidence and prevalence rates for CMML are hard to define, with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data demonstrating an incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000, with most studies showing a clear male preponderance. The median age of presentation for CMML patients is between 70–75 years, with "young CMML" patients being operationally defined as those who present at < 65 years of age.

At the genome level CMML is relatively homogeneous, demonstrating approximately 10–12 somatic variants per kilobase of coding region, with most pathogenic variants involving TET2 (60%), ASXL1 (40%), SRSF2 (50%) and RAS pathway (30%) genes. However, clinically the disease is very heterogenous in presentation and outcomes, making diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic decision-making challenging. Broadly, CMML can be classified into dys-plastic CMML (dCMML), presenting with cytopenias and clinical signs and symptoms related to the same (fatigue, bruising and transfusion dependence) and proliferative CMML (pCMML), presenting with significant myeloproliferation, extramedullary hematopoiesis and associated constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats, anorexia, pruritus, bone pain and cachexia). From a classification perspective, for several years CMML was classified as a subtype of MDS, with the World Health Organization (WHO) rightfully and formally classifying CMML as an MDS/MPN overlap neoplasm, from 2002 onwards. In 2015, the International Working Group for MDS/MPN overlap neoplasms proposed CMML-specific disease response criteria, providing support for the recognition of CMML as a specific disease entity and providing impetus for CMML-specific clinical trials. These changes have clearly incentivized the development of disease-specific diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies for patients with CMML. In this review, I discuss my approach to the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of patients with CMML.

### Axatilimab-csfr (Niktimvo) [^113BkcQL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Axatilimab-csfr is a monoclonal antibody that binds to colony stimulating factor-1 receptors (CSF-1R) expressed on monocytes and macrophages. Blocking CSF-1R with axatilimab-csfr reduces the levels of these circulating proinflammatory and profibrotic monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, as demonstrated by a reduction of nonclassical monocyte counts in nonclinical studies with axatilimab-csfr, and inhibits the activity of pathogenic macrophages in tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

CSF-1 and Interleukin (IL)-34

Axatilimab-csfr caused a dose-dependent increase from 0.15 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg (0.5 to 20 times the approved recommended dosage) in CSF-1 and interleukin (IL)-34 concentrations and a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of nonclassical monocytes in peripheral blood.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Activation and polarization of circulating monocytes in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112HeSzi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ability of circulating monocytes to develop into lung macrophages and promote lung tissue damage depends upon their phenotypic pattern of differentiation and activation. Whether this phenotypic pattern varies with COPD severity is unknown. Here we characterize the activation and differentiation status of circulating monocytes in patients with moderate vs. severe COPD.

Methods

Blood monocytes were isolated from normal non-smokers (14), current smokers (13), patients with moderate (9), and severe COPD (11). These cells were subjected to analysis by flow cytometry to characterize the expression of activation markers, chemoattractant receptors, and surface markers characteristic of either M1- or M2-type macrophages.

Results

Patients with severe COPD had increased numbers of total circulating monocytes and non-classical patrolling monocytes, compared to normal subjects and patients with moderate COPD. In addition, while the percentage of circulating monocytes that expressed an M2-like phenotype was reduced in patients with either moderate or severe disease, the levels of expression of M2 markers on this subpopulation of monocytes in severe COPD was significantly elevated. This was particularly evident for the expression of the chemoattractant receptor CCR5.

Conclusions

Blood monocytes in severe COPD patients undergo unexpected pre-differentiation that is largely characteristic of M2-macrophage polarization, leading to the emergence of an unusual M2-like monocyte population with very high levels of CCR5. These results show that circulating monocytes in patients with severe COPD possess a cellular phenotype which may permit greater mobilization to the lung, with a pre-existing bias toward a potentially destructive inflammatory phenotype.

### Monocyte distribution width: a novel indicator of sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 in high-risk emergency department patients [^1176XjaD]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Most septic patients are initially encountered in the emergency department where sepsis recognition is often delayed, in part due to the lack of effective biomarkers. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of peripheral blood monocyte distribution width alone and in combination with WBC count for early sepsis detection in the emergency department.

Design

An Institutional Review Board approved, blinded, observational, prospective cohort study conducted between April 2017 and January 2018.

Setting

Subjects were enrolled from emergency departments at three U.S. academic centers.

Patients

Adult patients, 18–89 years, with complete blood count performed upon presentation to the emergency department, and who remained hospitalized for at least 12 hours. A total of 2,212 patients were screened, of whom 2,158 subjects were enrolled and categorized per Sepsis-2 criteria, such as controls (n = 1,088), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (n = 441), infection (n = 244), and sepsis (n = 385), and Sepsis-3 criteria, such as control (n = 1,529), infection (n = 386), and sepsis (n = 243).

Interventions

The primary outcome determined whether an monocyte distribution width of greater than 20.0 U, alone or in combination with WBC, improves early sepsis detection by Sepsis-2 criteria. Secondary endpoints determined monocyte distribution width performance for Sepsis-3 detection.

Measurements and Main Results

Monocyte distribution width greater than 20.0 U distinguished sepsis from all other conditions based on either Sepsis-2 criteria (area under the curve, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76–0.82) or Sepsis-3 criteria (area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69–0.76). The negative predictive values for monocyte distribution width less than or equal to 20 U for Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 were 93% and 94%, respectively. Monocyte distribution width greater than 20.0 U combined with an abnormal WBC further improved Sepsis-2 detection (area under the curve, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83–0.88) and as reflected by likelihood ratio and added value analyses. Normal WBC and monocyte distribution width inferred a six-fold lower sepsis probability.

Conclusions

An monocyte distribution width value of greater than 20.0 U is effective for sepsis detection, based on either Sepsis-2 criteria or Sepsis-3 criteria, during the initial emergency department encounter. In tandem with WBC, monocyte distribution width is further predicted to enhance medical decision making during early sepsis management in the emergency department.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^11345bTJ]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Individuals with persistence of monocytosis have a higher prevalence of CH and biased mutational profile

WHO criteria for CMML require the persistence of peripheral monocytosis over a 3-month period. A follow-up for Lifelines participants was available after a median period of 3.8 years and included monocyte counts for n = 102 668. Studying the persistence of monocytosis and its relation to CH was thus limited by the loss to follow-up of potential high-risk cases during this latency period (supplemental Table 2). Among 167 individuals with monocytosis at the study inclusion visit, 102 could be evaluated for long-term persistence of monocytosis (eg, detection of monocytosis at baseline and follow-up visit). In total, 30 out of 102 (29%) evaluable individuals ≥ 60 years had persistence of monocytosis over this period (Figure 3G). We grouped individuals and their respective 1:3 control subjects based on the persistence of monocytosis over time. Prevalence of CH was highest in those with persistent monocytosis over time: 19 (63%) of individuals with persistent monocytosis carried CH, as compared with 28% of matched control subjects (P = 0.001) (Figure 3H and supplemental Figure 4). When following current WHO diagnostic criteria, this would translate into an estimated prevalence of 1.85 in 10.000 for (undiagnosed) CMML in community-dwelling individuals. The highest absolute monocyte counts at baseline visits were found among individuals with persistent monocytosis, although this was not statistically significant (Figure 3I).

### How I treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^1157YxAQ]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic malignancy that may deserve specific management. Defined by a persistent peripheral blood monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10⁹/L and monocytes accounting for ≥ 10% of the white blood cells, this aging-associated disease combines cell proliferation as a consequence of myeloid progenitor hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with myeloid cell dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis. The only curative option for CMML remains allogeneic stem cell transplantation. When transplantation is excluded, CMML is stratified into myelodysplastic (white blood cell count < 13 × 10⁹/L) and proliferative (white blood cell count ≥ 13 × 10⁹/L) CMML. In the absence of poor prognostic factors, the management of myelodysplastic CMML is largely inspired from myelodysplastic syndromes, relying on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to cope with anemia, and careful monitoring and supportive care, whereas the management of proliferative CMML usually relies on cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea, although ongoing studies will help delineate the role of hypomethylating agents in this patient population. In the presence of excessive blasts and other poor prognostic factors, hypomethylating agents are the preferred option, even though their impact on leukemic transformation and survival has not been proved. The therapeutic choice is illustrated by 4 clinical situations among the most commonly seen. Although current therapeutic options can improve patient's quality of life, they barely modify disease evolution. Improved understanding of CMML pathophysiology will hopefully lead to the exploration of novel targets that potentially would be curative.

### Morphological evaluation of monocytes and their precursors [^112EP3h1]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

The monocyte is still the most difficult cell to identify with confidence in the peripheral blood or in the bone marrow in healthy individuals as well as in patients with infections, and in those with leukemic proliferations. The goal of this study was to establish morphological definitions so that monocytes, including immature monocytes, could be separated from the spectrum of monocyte precursors. Cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow were selected to provide a large panel of normal and leukemic cells at different maturational stages and were submitted to 5 experts, who had previously reached a consensus, on the basis of microscopy, in defining 4 subtypes: monoblast, promonocyte, immature monocyte, mature, monocyte. They achieved a good concordance rate of 76.6% and a high kappa rate confirming that the criteria for defining the 4 subtypes could be applied consistently. It has now to be established whether these monocyte subtypes correlate with immunological or molecular markers and are clinically relevant.

### Colony-stimulating factors in the prevention and management of infectious diseases [^115V1sDg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are attractive adjunctive anti-infective therapies. Used to enhance innate host defenses against microbial pathogens, the myeloid CSFs increase absolute numbers of circulating innate immune effector cells by accelerating bone marrow production and maturation, or augment the function of those cells through diverse effects on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and microbicidal functions. This article summarizes the evidence supporting the accepted clinical uses of the myeloid CSFs in patients with congenital or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and presents an overview of proposed and emerging uses of the CSFs for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in other immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patient populations.

### How I diagnose and treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^116KHFLR]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Reactive monocytosis is very common in practice and while viral infections and recovering bone marrow (from injury, drugs or chemotherapy) are frequent causes, sustained reactive monocytosis is more common in chronic infections such as subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, leishmaniasis and leprosy and in autoimmune/inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and mixed connective tissue disorder. Reactive monocytosis can also be seen in the context of metastatic visceral neoplasms, either due to enhanced mobilization of monocytes from the bone marrow, or due to increased monopoiesis mediated by CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2).

### ACKR2 in hematopoietic precursors as a checkpoint of neutrophil release and anti-metastatic activity [^115KDXxy]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Increased number of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils, but not alveolar or interstitial macrophages, were also detected in the lungs of NeuT/Ackr2 −/− as compared to NeuT/Ackr2 +/+ mice (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2b for the gating strategy), while in basal conditions no difference was found between leukocyte infiltrate in the lung of WT and Ackr2 −/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 2c). A higher number of Ly6G + neutrophils in the parenchyma of NeuT/Ackr2 −/− lungs compared to NeuT/Ackr2 +/+ mice was also found by immunohistochemistry, confirming the flow cytometry data (Fig. 2d, e). Similar results were obtained analyzing blood and lungs of WT and Ackr2 −/− mice orthotopically injected with 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e, respectively). In these mice, analysis of myeloid cells in the BM 14 days after tumor injection showed a reduced number of monocytes and neutrophils in Ackr2 −/− compared to WT mice (Fig. 2f). These results indicate that in tumor conditions, Ackr2 −/− mice show enhanced release of myeloid cells from BM, which then accumulate in the blood and lungs.

Increased chemokine-induced mobilization in Ackr2 −/− mice

To investigate the role of ACKR2 in myeloid cells egress from the BM, we performed leukocyte mobilization experiments. As previously reported and as shown in Fig. 3a, under homeostatic conditions, ACKR2-deficient mice have increased frequency and absolute number of circulating Ly6C high monocytes compared to WT and a concomitant decrease in the frequency of the same cells in the BM (Fig. 3c), whereas they showed similar number of circulating and BM neutrophils(Fig. 3b, d). After injection of CCL3L1, an ACKR2 ligand known to induce rapid mobilization of both neutrophils and monocytes, Ackr2 −/− mice showed a significant higher number of circulating monocytes and neutrophils compared to WT littermates (Fig. 3a, b, respectively). Concomitantly, the decrease in monocytes and neutrophils in the BM caused by CCL3L1 injection was more pronounced in Ackr2 −/− animals (Fig. 3c, d, respectively).

### Blockade of alpha4 integrin signaling ameliorates the metabolic consequences of high-fat diet-induced obesity [^111D66ZP]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

WAT monocyte/macrophages derive in part from peripheral blood monocytes, which in turn are derived from the bone marrow. To investigate the cause of the reduced monocyte/macrophage accumulation in WAT of α4(Y991A) mice, we quantified monocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow of wild-type and α4(Y991A) mice. In the high-fat diet–fed mice, there was a reduction in the percentage (1.4 ± 0.28 vs. 2.9 ± 0.38% for Y991A and wild type, respectively) and absolute number of monocytes in the peripheral blood of α4(Y991A) mice (Fig. 4 A and B). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the percentage of pure or mixed monocyte populations in the bone marrow of high-fat diet–fed wild-type and α4(Y991A) mice (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, a slight monocytopenia was observed in the peripheral blood of normal chow–fed α4(Y991A) mice (1.71 ± 0.13 vs. 2.39 ± 0.12% for Y991A and wild type, respectively), and there was no significant difference in abundance of 7/4 hi Ly-6G neg and 7/4 dim Ly-6G neg cells in the bone marrow (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data suggest that the α4(Y991A) mutation does not impair monocyte development. Rather, they suggest that the mutation reduces mobilization of these cells. These data do not define the relative contributions of reduced egress from the bone marrow and entry into the adipose tissue in high-fat diet–fed mice in the observed reduced macrophage accumulation in α4(Y991A) WAT.

### Low lymphocyte count and high monocyte count predicts poor prognosis of gastric cancer [^114feUoV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Absolute count of blood cells was more convenient in predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. High absolute count of neutrophil, monocyte and platelet, and low absolute count of lymphocyte were associated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer. However, only lymphocyte and monocyte count were independent prognostic predictors. Combination of lymphocyte and monocyte count could further increase the predictive value for gastric cancer.

### Immune modulation effects of concomitant temozolomide and radiation therapy on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with glioblastoma multiforme [^112E3jwe]. Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Concomitant radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy after surgery is the standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Radiation and chemotherapy can affect the immune system with implications on subsequent immune therapy. Therefore, we examined the phenotype and function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 25 patients with GBM prior to and 4 weeks after treatment with RT-TMZ using multicolor flow cytometry, as well as in vitro CD4(+) regulatory T cell (T(reg)) suppressor and dendritic cell maturation assays. RT-TMZ induced significant lymphopenia, with a decrease in total CD4(+) T cells, but did not significantly change monocyte counts. The proportion of functional T(reg) cells increased after treatment, whereas their absolute numbers remained stable. There was also a measurable decrease in the proportion of CD8(+)CD56(+) and absolute number of CD3(-)CD56(+) effector cells. Posttherapy monocytes retained the ability to mature into dendritic cells. Treatment with RT-TMZ is associated with changes in regulatory and effector peripheral blood mononuclear cells that tilt the balance towards an immune suppressive state. This shift can affect the outcome of immune therapy following RT-TMZ treatment and should be considered in the design of future combination therapy regimens.

### Acute leukaemoid reaction following cardiac surgery [^1153vzrC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is an atypical myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an absolute peripheral blood monocyte count of greater than 1.0 × 10⁹/L, with evidence of both effective and ineffective haematopoiesis. The aetiology of CMML is complex and incompletely understood. It is twice as common in men, usually presenting in the seventh or eighth decades. Late clinical features include fatigue, weight loss, fever and night sweats, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, although it may present as a chance finding on blood analysis. The bone marrow is usually hypercellular with granulocytic proliferation and it can be differentiated from classical chronic myeloid leukaemia by the high monocyte count and absence of a Philadelphia chromosome. Despite best medical therapy, the outcome remains poor with median survival less than two years from the time of diagnosis. Individual prognosis is difficult to predict, although approximately 20% of patients progress to acute myeloid leukaemia.

Cardiac surgery has been reported in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, myelodysplasia and other malignant haematological disorders but data on CMML are limited. We present a case of previously undiagnosed CMML who developed fatal complications following cardiac surgery.

### Low lymphocyte count and high monocyte count predicts poor prognosis of gastric cancer [^111KAoxv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Existing data about the prognostic value of absolute count of blood cells in gastric cancer was limited. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the prognostic value of absolute count of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet in gastric cancer patients.

Methods

From September 2008 to March 2015, 3243 patients treated with radical gastrectomy were enrolled in the present study. Clinicopathological characteristics were recorded. The prognostic value of blood test in gastric cancer patients were analyzed.

Results

There were 2538 male and 705 female. The median age was 58 years (range 20–90). The median follow-up time was 24.9 months (range 1–75). The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rate was 88.9%, 65.8% and 57.2%, respectively. The optimal cut off value was 6.19 × 10⁹/L for WBC (P = 0.146), 4.19 × 10⁹/L for neutrophil (P = 0.004), 1.72 × 10⁹/L for lymphocyte (P = 0.000), 0.51 × 10⁹/L for monocyte (P = 0.019) and 260.0 × 10⁹/L for platelet (P = 0.002), respectively. Neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet were risk factors for the prognosis of gastric cancer (all P < 0.05). However, only lymphocyte and monocyte were independent risk factors (both P < 0.05). Combination of lymphocyte and monocyte could increase the prognostic value for gastric cancer patients, especially in stage II/III gastric cancer patients.

Conclusions

High absolute count of neutrophil, monocyte and platelet, and low absolute count of lymphocyte were associated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer. However, only lymphocyte and monocyte count were independent prognostic predictors. Combination of lymphocyte and monocyte count could further increase the predictive value for gastric cancer.

### Monocytosis is a biomarker of severity in inflammatory bowel disease: analysis of a 6-year prospective natural history registry [^116QrMf7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with alterations of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Monocytes respond to inflammation and infection, yet the relationship between monocytosis and IBD severity is not fully understood. We aimed to characterize the prevalence of monocytosis in IBD and the association between monocytosis and disease severity and IBD-related health care utilization.

Methods

We used a multiyear, prospectively collected natural history registry to compare patients with IBD with monocytosis to those without monocytosis, among all patients and by disease type.

Results

A total of 1290 patients with IBD (64.1% with Crohn disease; 35.9% with ulcerative colitis) were included (mean age 46.4 years; 52.6% female). Monocytosis was found in 399 (30.9%) of patients with IBD (29.3% with Crohn disease; 33.9% with ulcerative colitis). Monocytosis was significantly associated with abnormal C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, worse quality of life, active disease, and increased exposure to biologics (all P < 0.001). Compared with patients without monocytosis, patients with monocytosis had a 3-fold increase in annual financial health care charges (median: $127,013 vs. $32,925, P < 0.001) and an increased likelihood of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.5; P < 0.001), IBD-related surgery (AOR, 1.9; P = 0.002), and emergency department (ED) use (AOR, 2.8; P < 0.001). Patients with monocytosis had a shorter time to surgery, hospitalization, and ED visit after stratifying by disease activity (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Patients with IBD with monocytosis, regardless of disease type, are at increased risk for worse clinical outcomes, hospitalization, surgery, and ED use. Peripheral monocytosis may represent a routinely available biomarker of a distinct subgroup with severe disease.

### Impaired functions of peripheral blood monocyte subpopulations in aged humans [^113iuN6x]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

In summary, human aging is associated with alterations in the numbers of certain subpopulations of monocytes, and impaired secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α, which appear to be due to an impaired expression of TLR1 and signaling via ERK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, in aged subjects, greater and more significant changes were observed in CD16+ (independent of level of CD14 expression, CD14 ++high or CD14 +low) monocytes as compared to CD16 − monocyte subsets (regardless of levels of CD14 expression). Therefore, it is important to analyze monocytes into four subsets. These defects in monocytes may play a role in increased susceptibility to microbial pathogens and poor response to vaccines in aged humans.

### IL-10 induces the development of immunosuppressive CD14 (+) HLA-DR (low /-) monocytes in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^111xGXZ5]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

One of the findings in the present study was that the absolute number of total CD14 + monocytes was increased in this cohort, which is different to our previous publication in which we reported that there was no difference in the percentage of monocytes between lymphoma patients and controls. This discrepancy may be due to differing results when the absolute monocyte count and monocyte percentage are used as readouts. Supporting this, other studies from our group have shown that there were different changes in the absolute monocyte count and not in the percentage of monocytes and vice versa for blood phenotype. Hence, measuring absolute numbers of this cell population might be better than percentages in the context of whole blood.

Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of HLA-DR on monocytes leading to increased numbers of CD14 + HLA-DR low/− cells in cancer, especially in lymphoma. In the present study, we have shown that IL-10 is involved in the development of CD14 + HLA-DR low/− monocytes. We found that IL-10 treatment in vitro downregulates HLA-DR expression on CD14 + monocytes. Similarly, endogenous IL-10 secreted by lymphoma cells also downregulates HLA-DR expression on CD14 + monocytes. Furthermore, we also found that serum IL-10 levels are elevated in patients with B-cell NHL and serum levels correlate with the absolute number of peripheral monocytes. These findings strongly suggest that IL-10 contributes to increased numbers of CD14 + HLA-DR low/− monocytes in B-cell NHL. We also found that IL-10 regulates the function of CD14 + HLA-DR low/− monocytes. Supporting the role of IL-10 in facilitating CD14 + HLA-DR low/− cells in B-cell NHL, we observed that IL-10 pretreated monocytes exhibited suppressive properties by inhibiting activation and proliferation of T cells. This is consistent with our previous finding that CD14 + HLA-DR low/− cells are the suppressive monocyte phenotype in NHL.

### Mutations in GATA2 cause human NK cell deficiency with specific loss of the CD56 (bright) subset [^114wPVQw]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Mutations in the transcription factor GATA2 underlie the syndrome of monocytopenia and B- and natural killer (NK)-cell lymphopenia associated with opportunistic infections and cancers. In addition, patients have recurrent and severe viral infections. NK cells play a critical role in mediating antiviral immunity. Human NK cells are thought to mature in a linear fashion, with the CD56(bright) stage preceding terminal maturation to the CD56(dim) stage, considered the most enabled for cytotoxicity. Here we report an NK cell functional defect in GATA2-deficient patients and extend this genetic lesion to what is considered to be the original NK cell-deficient patient. In most cases, GATA2 deficiency is accompanied by a severe reduction in peripheral blood NK cells and marked functional impairment. The NK cells detected in peripheral blood of some GATA2-deficient patients are exclusively of the CD56(dim) subset, which is recapitulated on in vitro NK cell differentiation. In vivo, interferon α treatment increased NK cell number and partially restored function but did not correct the paucity of CD56(bright) cells. Thus, GATA2 is required for the maturation of human NK cells and the maintenance of the CD56(bright) pool in the periphery. Defects in GATA2 are a novel cause of profound NK cell dysfunction.

### Effect of initial absolute monocyte count on survival outcome of patients with de novo non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia [^112Q4gE7]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

Increased absolute monocyte count (AMC) at presentation has recently been associated with clinical outcome in different types of hematological malignancies. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of AMC on survival in 193 adult patients with de novo non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The median AMC for all patients at diagnosis was 0.26×10⁹/L, with 41.4, 31.1 and 27.5% of patients showed low (< 0.12×10⁹/L), normal (0.12–0.80×10⁹/L), and high AMC (> 0.80×10(9)/L), respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that high AMC appeared as a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0055), but not for disease free survival (DFS) (p = 0.1195). On multivariate analysis, initial high AMC remained an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio 2.01, p = 0.017). Our results suggest that AMC at diagnosis, which provides additional prognostic information independently from conventional factors related to patient clinical characteristics or tumor biological features, could be a novel prognostic marker for AML.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112sCzwp]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Excess microbial translocation in HIV — early "depletion of CD4 cells from gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a signature feature of HIV infection", and "GALT constitutes the largest immune compartment in the body". This depletion "causes profound changes in the gut mucosal integrity, facilitating bacterial translocation, augmenting trafficking of inflammatory cells to the gastrointestinal tract, and promoting chronic systemic immune activation". Consequently, "activation of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system ensues and a state of chronic inflammation and immune activation is created", with "elevated inflammatory biomarkers" measurable, including markers of microbial translocation, monocyte and neutrophil activation, adhesion molecules, coagulation markers, and "fibrin degradation products (e.g. D-dimer)". Thus, "changes in the GALT have profound ramifications for end-organ disease in the setting of HIV infection".

### Inflammatory dysregulation of blood monocytes in Parkinson's disease patients [^116q2Zsp]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

Despite extensive effort on studying inflammatory processes in the CNS of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, implications of peripheral monocytes are still poorly understood. Here, we set out to obtain a comprehensive picture of circulating myeloid cells in PD patients. We applied a human primary monocyte culture system and flow cytometry-based techniques to determine the state of monocytes from PD patients during disease. We found that the classical monocytes are enriched in the blood of PD patients along with an increase in the monocyte-recruiting chemoattractant protein CCL2. Moreover, we found that monocytes from PD patients display a pathological hyperactivity in response to LPS stimulation that correlates with disease severity. Inflammatory pre-conditioning was also reflected on the transcriptome in PD monocytes using next-generation sequencing. Further, we identified the CD95/CD95L as a key regulator for the PD-associated alteration of circulating monocytes. Pharmacological neutralization of CD95L reverses the dysregulation of monocytic subpopulations in favor of non-classical monocytes. Our results suggest that PD monocytes are in an inflammatory predisposition responding with hyperactivation to a "second hit". These results provide the first direct evidence that circulating human peripheral blood monocytes are altered in terms of their function and composition in PD patients. This study provides insights into monocyte biology in PD and establishes a basis for future studies on peripheral inflammation.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^11549uvE]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Cellular activation in HIV and atherosclerosis — following CD4 depletion, HIV-infected persons experience "immune dysregulation" with "low numbers of naïve T cells", more terminally differentiated effector T cells, "excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines", and altered T cell function. The "chronically activated immune system generates excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with end-organ disease", and "even with suppressive ART, T cell activation remains elevated". Evidence also suggests the "innate immune system" may play a larger role than the adaptive in persistent inflammation. Monocyte shifts contribute to atheroma: in HIV-negative ASCVD there is "a greater proportion of pro-inflammatory monocytes", and in HIV, "even with ART and viral suppression", these subsets are "overrepresented" and contribute to "atherosclerosis". Neutrophils have "emerged as important contributors" and in HIV their "activation and degranulation is increased and remains elevated even with suppressive ART", with dysregulated neutrophils "likely another immune mechanism driving accelerated atherosclerosis". Coagulation and platelet processes are "dysregulated with HIV infection" and "even with suppressive ART, markers of coagulation (e.g. D-dimer) remain elevated and are associated with end-organ disease".

### Prognostic significance of peripheral blood monocyte and neutrophil counts in rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease [^1154Vz9f]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common pulmonary manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated with clinical heterogeneity and high mortality. This study aimed to determine whether non-invasive biomarkers, especially monocyte count in peripheral blood, would be useful for predicting outcomes in patients with RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 72 patients with RA-ILD. We assessed clinical characteristics, laboratory findings at the time of diagnosis. We used Cox proportional hazard analyses to determine significant variables associated with outcomes. Cumulative survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

The median age was 68.6 years (58% male). The 5-year survival rate was 78.4%. Cox proportional hazard analyses adjusted by age and sex showed that increased monocyte count and neutrophil count were significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with RA-ILD. According to optimal cutoff levels, patients with high monocyte counts (≥ 458/μl) had significantly lower survival rates than those with low monocyte counts (< 458/μl). Similarly, patients with high neutrophil counts (≥ 9394/μl) had significantly lower survival rates than those with low neutrophil counts (< 9394/μl). Combinatorial assessments with peripheral monocyte and neutrophil counts revealed that the patients with both high monocyte and neutrophil counts had the lowest survival.

Conclusions

Increased monocyte and neutrophil counts might be potential cellular biomarkers to predict poor outcomes in patients with RA-ILD.

### A practical approach to neutrophil disorders [^116Kjkt6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This review discusses disorders of altered neutrophil number and function and provide a basic framework for patient evaluation and management. The sections begin with neutropenia, neutrophilia and neutrophil dysfunction with a general screening approach to differentiate common, more benign syndromes from rare, often more serious disorders. Also included is a detailed discussion of some specific primary neutrophil syndromes at the end of each section. Focus is placed on specific disorders that are clinically common or particularly instructive.

### Hypoxia shapes the immune landscape in lung injury and promotes the persistence of inflammation [^114c6Vpy]. Nature Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we showed that monocyte recruitment and conversion into lung macrophages are required to drive inflammation resolution in hypoxic ALI. Hypoxemic mice with ALI demonstrated an increase in erythropoiesis, with an associated reduction in monopoiesis, monocytopenia and failure to expand the MDM and non-AM CD64 hi SiglecF − macrophage compartment in the lung. In the context of prioritizing the preservation of tissue oxygen delivery, increased erythropoiesis makes physiological sense, such as in adaptation to altitude, where monocytopenia had been reported as early as 1969. However, when engagement of an effective innate immune response is also required, our data demonstrated that hypoxia-induced immune changes observed in early disease have long-term consequences for inflammation resolution, such as persistence of neutrophilic inflammation, a well-known poor prognostic feature of ARDS.

### Circulating monocytes are predictive and responsive in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis subjects treated with apremilast [^114yi6TY]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Monocytes play a critical role in the inflammation associated with psoriasis, and their abnormalities have been reported as biomarkers of cardiovascular event risk, a psoriasis comorbidity. Monocytic cells in chronic inflammatory disorders express elevated levels of cAMP phosphodiesterase. Restoring cAMP levels using the oral cAMP phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, apremilast, improves clinical outcomes for a subset of patients with psoriasis. We asked whether aberrant monocyte subsets or transcriptomic pathways can function as biomarkers of psoriasis endotypes that can predict enhanced clinical responses to cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibition. A 16-week open-label study of 22 patients with monocyte flow cytometric and transcriptomic analysis was performed. Subjects with elevated hyperadhesive monocyte doublets at baseline were more likely to be responders to apremilast (P < .0001); 82% of subjects with elevated hyperadhesive monocyte doublets achieved 50% reduction in PASI compared with 46% in those without elevated doublets. We observed a significant reduction in hyperadhesive monocyte-containing doublets and monocyte-platelet aggregates, suggesting an effect of apremilast on the adhesiveness of blood monocytes during chronic inflammation. Monocyte differentially expressed gene transcripts predictive of clinical response uncovered pharmacoendotypes with distinct patterns of nucleotide metabolism, energetics, and differentiation. Further study to understand the basis of drug responsiveness and to develop an apremilast psoriasis treatment algorithm using monocyte-refined gene expression is required to validate and become practical in clinical use, offering patients a test that personalizes their likelihood of clinical response.

### Mild renal dysfunction and metabolites tied to low HDL cholesterol are associated with monocytosis and atherosclerosis [^111YVXwE]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The number of circulating blood monocytes impacts atherosclerotic lesion size, and in mouse models, elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol suppress blood monocyte counts and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that individuals with mild renal dysfunction at increased cardiovascular risk would have reduced high-density lipoprotein levels, high blood monocyte counts, and accelerated atherosclerosis.

Methods and Results

To test whether mild renal dysfunction is associated with an increase in a leukocyte subpopulation rich in monocytes that has a known association with future coronary events, we divided individuals from the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDC) into baseline cystatin C quintiles (n = 4757). Lower levels of renal function were accompanied by higher monocyte counts, and monocytes were independently associated with carotid bulb intima-media thickness cross-sectionally (P = 0.02). Cystatin C levels were positively and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels negatively associated with monocyte counts at baseline, after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Several amino acid metabolites tied to low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and insulin resistance measured in a subset of individuals (n = 752) by use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were independently associated with a 22% to 34% increased risk of being in the top quartile of monocytes (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

A low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin resistance phenotype occurs in subjects with mild renal dysfunction and is associated with elevated monocytes and atherosclerosis. High blood monocyte counts may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying the strong relationship between cystatin C and cardiovascular risk.

### Clinical significance of CBC and WBC morphology in the diagnosis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection [^111FVEMz]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients.

Methods

The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists.

Results

All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils.

Conclusions

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should undergo a comprehensive daily CBC with manual WBC differential to monitor for numerical and morphologic changes predictive of poor outcome and signs of disease progression.

### Transient increase of monocyte adhesion after a single dose of simvastatin [^115dxU95]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Beneficial effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as simvastatin have been attributed to lipid lowering and cholesterol-independent mechanisms, for example a reduction of monocyte adhesion to endothelium. However, little is known about acute effects of statin intake. In an attempt to test for short-term effects of drug intake, we found that the adhesion of blood monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers or mildly hypercholesterolemic patients was increased after intake of simvastatin but not placebo at 0.5 h and declined to baseline levels at 3 h. Blood cholesterol levels were unaltered and the observed effects did not correlate with systemic concentrations of the pro-drug nor the active drug concentration in the peripheral circulation. In conclusion, the transient increase in adhesiveness of monocytes may be due to direct and/or enterohepatic metabolites of simvastatin, demonstrating the necessity of drug metabolism for exerting the beneficial effects of long-term treatment.

### Absolute granulocyte, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts… [^111wkDvD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Pretreatment absolute granulocyte, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts are three independent indicators of good prognosis for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. These tests improve the prediction of survival significantly compared with estimates based on ambulatory status alone. If the patient is completely ambulatory, median survival is 27. 6 weeks, and it improves further to
37. 6 weeks if results of two hematology tests indicate a good prognosis. If the patient is partially ambulatory, MS is 16. 2 weeks; however, if results of two blood tests indicate a good prognosis, MS is
25. 7 weeks, and if two tests indicate a poor prognosis, MS is only 11. 1 weeks. The model corrected a false assessment of a poor prognosis for 56% of all patients. Bruckner HW, Lavin PT, Plaxe SC, Storch JA, Livstone EM.

### A 54-year-old man with pancytopenia… [^116rnwiH]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 1. 7 × 10³/μL with an absolute neutrophil count of
0. 17 × 10³/μL; hemoglobin level, 7 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume of 103 fL; and platelet count, 116 × 10³/μL. Results of a complete blood cell count from 8 months prior were normal. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, as were levels of lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed no lymphadenopathy, masses, or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood smear showed occasional pseudo Pelger-Huet cells and rare teardrop cells. Histopathologic examination of bone marrow aspirate revealed a normocellular marrow and dyserythropoiesis with vacuolized and dysplastic erythroid precursors, left-shifted granulocytic maturation with vacuolized granulocytic precursors, ring sideroblasts, and no increase in blasts.

Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc. Bone marrow histopathology can show ringed sideroblasts, hypocellular marrow, and vacuolized erythroid and granulocytic precursors. 7 Such dysplastic changes may be interpreted as manifestations of MDS; however, the diagnosis of MDS requires persistent cytopenias in addition to at least 1. of 3 histopathologic criteria from bone marrow aspirate, biopsy, or both: dysplasia in at least 10% of cells from erythroid, granulocytic, or megakaryocytic lineages; 5% to 19% blast cells; or MDS-specific cytogenetic abnormalities such as 5q deletion and monosomy
7.

8 Diagnosis of MDS also requires exclusion of other potential etiologies of marrow dysplasia, including HIV infection, acquired sideroblastic anemia, and deficiencies in vitamin B12 or copper.

### Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), and ALC / AMC ratio to predict outcome in aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) [^117PpDpZ]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Abstract e18547 Background: Prognostic factors in NHL have been well studied in the pre-rituximab era. More recently, tumor infiltrating macrophages were found to confer an adverse prognosis. Porrata et al. at Mayo Clinic have described the ALC, AMC, and ALC/AMC ratio as important prognostic factors. We have evaluated pts with aNHL treated in the rituximab era to identify prognostic factors. Methods: From January 2006 and April 2011, 89 pts with aNHL treated at our center were accrued. Initial treatment was R-CHOP based. 59 were entered on R-CHOP + GM-CSF protocol and the remainder were identified from our database. Results: Median age was 59, 44% were male; histologies included DLBCL, high grade follicular lymphoma, and other. Median follow up = 27 mo. 3 year FFS and OS for the entire group: 78% and 83% respectively. On univariate analysis, FFS was superior for low IPI, normal B2 microglobulin, females, ALC > 865, ALC/AMC ratio of > 1. 43 but contrary to Porrata's findings, there was no difference by AMC. In pts with low IPI, there was a significant difference in FFS and OS for those with an ALC > 865. In females ALC had no prognostic value, but males with low ALC had a significantly worse FFS and OS. Females with high AMC had superior FFS but the opposite trend was seen in males. On multivariate analysis, gender, B2-microglobulin, and combined IPI with ALC/AMC ratio > 1. 43 remained as independent prognostic factors with gender being the most significant factor in the model.
