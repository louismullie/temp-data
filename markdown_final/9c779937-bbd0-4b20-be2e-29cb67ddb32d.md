## Question

Can oral allergy syndrome present with stomach pain to mango, cherry and broccoli?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether stomach pain after eating mango, cherry, and broccoli could be explained by oral allergy syndrome, and what mechanisms and next steps should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and usual symptom pattern of oral allergy syndrome or pollen-food allergy syndrome. Then, I should verify whether gastrointestinal involvement, especially stomach pain, is expected or atypical in classic PFAS. Next, I will consider plausible alternative mechanisms such as lipid transfer protein sensitization, primary food allergy, or non–IgE-mediated entities like FPIES. After that, I should review which specific proteins in mango, cherry, and broccoli map to birch PR-10, profilins, or LTPs. Finally, I will synthesize the risk and provide practical management and testing guidance with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its usual presentation. PFAS/OAS is typically a localized IgE-mediated reaction in patients with pollen sensitization, causing immediate pruritus, tingling, or mild angioedema of the lips, tongue, palate, and throat after eating raw plant foods, with symptoms usually confined to the oropharynx and resolving spontaneously within minutes to an hour, and with well-cooked forms generally tolerated because the cross-reactive proteins are heat-labile PR-10 or profilins, although LTPs are more stable and exceptions exist [^111QgSmA] [^1161zJzA] [^117U3nim] [^112NeWqv].

> Wait, let me verify the expectation about gastrointestinal involvement. By definition and guideline summaries, PFAS is "mostly benign and limited to the oropharynx", and the standard teaching is that systemic symptoms, including GI involvement, are uncommon though not impossible. Some consensus and reviews note that about 8–10% may develop systemic symptoms and rare anaphylaxis has been described, so stomach pain alone is not classic for PFAS but can occur in a minority of cases depending on the protein family involved and cofactors [^114GumA1] [^113RDYxp] [^116ERW33] [^117U3nim].

> Hold on, I should verify which plant foods we're dealing with here. Mango, cherry, and broccoli are all recognized birch-related triggers for PFAS; mango and cherry are common stone fruits implicated in PR-10–mediated cross-reactivity, and broccoli has been specifically reported in LTP-related food contact hypersensitivity, which behaves differently than classic Bet v 1–mediated PFAS in terms of stability and severity potential [^116pJK2b] [^113rVhvv] [^111mBdwE].

> I will now examine mechanisms that could plausibly link these foods to stomach pain. If symptoms remain limited to oropharyngeal pruritus and resolve quickly, PR-10 cross-reactivity is most likely, but if there is isolated stomach pain without oral symptoms, I need to consider nonclassic PFAS, LTP syndrome with systemic involvement, primary IgE-mediated food allergy, or non–IgE-mediated entities such as FPIES; LTPs are heat-stable and can provoke generalized reactions including abdominal pain, and FPIES typically presents with delayed severe abdominal pain and vomiting without classic IgE skin or respiratory symptoms, so timing and associated features matter greatly [^116ERW33] [^111mBdwE] [^113qvLkx] [^112EjK2i].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "stomach pain is not a recognized symptom of PFAS", but I should double-check that because it sounds too absolute. Let me reconsider: while PFAS is classically oropharyngeal, GI symptoms can occur in a subset, and abdominal pain is listed among possible IgE-mediated food allergy symptoms, so isolated stomach pain is atypical but not impossible, particularly with LTP sensitization or cofactors like exercise, alcohol, NSAIDs, or large ingested loads. Thus, my earlier blanket statement was too strong and needs correction [^115dx2ez] [^116ERW33] [^112TVrqq].

> Next, I should review how to differentiate PFAS from look-alikes. Classic PFAS has immediate onset of oral symptoms to raw forms with tolerance to cooked forms, whereas LTP reactions can occur to raw or cooked foods and may include abdominal pain and systemic symptoms. Primary IgE-mediated food allergy may also cause immediate GI pain with other organ involvement. FPIES presents with delayed, repetitive vomiting and abdominal pain 1–4 hours after ingestion and negative routine IgE testing. And alpha-gal syndrome causes delayed abdominal pain 2–6 hours after mammalian meat, which is mechanistically unrelated to plant PFAS and should be considered if the dietary history fits [^116ERW33] [^113qvLkx] [^116QMv3A].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach matches the suspected mechanism. For suspected PFAS, a careful history aligned with pollen sensitization is often sufficient, and if testing is pursued, fresh food skin prick testing or prick-to-prick is more sensitive than commercial extracts. Component testing can help distinguish PR-10/profilin patterns from LTP or storage proteins, which carry different risk profiles. For FPIES, diagnosis relies on history, elimination, and controlled oral food challenge. For alpha-gal, targeted alpha-gal IgE testing is appropriate when the history suggests delayed reactions to mammalian products [^113Cpx8n] [^112mcMwq] [^1123GGqd] [^113qvLkx] [^114jC7FT].

> Let me think about risk stratification and management implications. If symptoms are limited to the oropharynx, counseling on avoidance of raw triggers, the option to try well-cooked forms, and use of nonsedating antihistamines for mild symptoms is standard; if there has been a systemic reaction, including GI symptoms beyond the oropharynx, strict avoidance of culprit foods and epinephrine autoinjector prescription are recommended; cofactors that increase severity such as PPIs, NSAIDs, exercise, alcohol, and large or liquid ingestions should be reviewed and mitigated when possible [^112NeWqv] [^1171kwuz] [^112TVrqq].

> But wait, what if the patient reports only stomach pain with mango, cherry, and broccoli and no oral symptoms at all. I should confirm the timing relative to ingestion, the form of the food (raw versus cooked), the presence of cofactors, and any prior pollen allergy history; if the pain is delayed and repetitive with negative IgE testing, FPIES becomes more likely; if immediate and accompanied by other organ symptoms, primary IgE-mediated allergy or LTP syndrome is more plausible; if truly isolated and immediate with clear pollen sensitization, nonclassic PFAS remains possible but less likely than the alternatives, and component-resolved diagnostics may help clarify the allergen pattern and risk [^113qvLkx] [^116ERW33] [^1123GGqd].

> In summary, I should confirm that classic PFAS is oropharyngeal and usually benign, so isolated stomach pain is atypical. However, GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, can occur in a minority of PFAS cases, particularly with LTP sensitization or cofactors, and the differential includes primary IgE-mediated allergy and FPIES, so a careful history, selective testing, and mechanism-based counseling are essential to guide avoidance, risk mitigation, and whether an epinephrine autoinjector is indicated [^113RDYxp] [^116ERW33] [^113qvLkx].

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is typically limited to oropharyngeal symptoms, but **stomach pain can occur** when large amounts of raw fruits/vegetables are ingested or when heat-stable allergens are involved [^116ERW33]. Mango, cherry, and broccoli are recognized triggers of OAS [^notfound]; stomach pain is **not the primary symptom** but may occur as a secondary or systemic manifestation in some cases [^117U3nim]. If stomach pain is prominent or persistent, evaluate for coexisting IgE-mediated food allergy, FPIES, or other gastrointestinal disorders [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features of oral allergy syndrome

OAS is characterized by **immediate, mild, localized symptoms** — pruritus, tingling, or swelling of the lips, tongue, palate, or throat — typically resolving within minutes to an hour [^111QgSmA]. Systemic symptoms, including gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach pain, are **uncommon but possible**, particularly with ingestion of large quantities of raw fruits or vegetables or when heat-stable allergens are involved [^116ERW33].

---

## Mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal symptoms in OAS

Gastrointestinal symptoms in OAS are thought to result from **direct irritation or inflammation** of the gastrointestinal mucosa caused by allergenic proteins that survive gastric digestion. Heat-labile proteins (e.g. PR-10 proteins, profilins) are usually degraded by cooking, explaining why cooked forms of fruits and vegetables are generally well tolerated [^114orG5E]. However, heat-stable allergens, such as lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), can persist after cooking and may provoke more severe reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms [^111mBdwE].

## Specific foods and their allergenic proteins

| **Food** | **Allergenic proteins** | **Heat stability** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mango | - Profilin <br/> - LTPs | - Labile <br/> - Stable | - Typically mild oropharyngeal symptoms <br/> - Gastrointestinal symptoms possible with LTPs |
| Cherry | - PR-10 proteins <br/> - LTPs | - Labile <br/> - Stable | - Typically mild oropharyngeal symptoms <br/> - Gastrointestinal symptoms possible with LTPs |
| Broccoli | - LTPs | Stable | - Gastrointestinal symptoms possible <br/> - Rarely systemic reactions |

---

## Evidence of gastrointestinal involvement in OAS

Although gastrointestinal symptoms are not the primary manifestation of OAS, several studies and case reports document their occurrence:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Approximately 8.7% of patients with OAS experience systemic symptoms, including gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea [^117U3nim].
- **Anaphylaxis**: Rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported in patients with OAS, often associated with ingestion of large quantities of raw fruits or vegetables or with specific allergenic proteins [^117U3nim] [^114DKAFv].
- **Cofactors**: Factors such as exercise, alcohol consumption, and ingestion of large quantities of raw foods may increase the risk of systemic reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms [^112TVrqq].

---

## Clinical implications and management

When patients with suspected OAS report gastrointestinal symptoms, such as stomach pain, clinicians should:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Confirm the diagnosis of OAS through clinical history, skin prick testing, and, if necessary, oral food challenges [^112mcMwq] [^111m4kEi].
- **Assess severity**: Evaluate the severity of symptoms and identify potential cofactors that may increase the risk of systemic reactions [^112NeWqv].
- **Provide dietary counseling**: Advise patients to avoid raw forms of the offending foods and consider cooking or processing methods that may reduce allergenicity [^112brFak].
- **Consider epinephrine**: Prescribe epinephrine auto-injectors for patients with a history of systemic reactions or those at increased risk of severe reactions [^1171kwuz].
- **Rule out other conditions**: Evaluate for coexisting gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) [^113qvLkx].

---

## Conclusion

Stomach pain is not a typical symptom of **oral allergy syndrome**, but it can occur, particularly with ingestion of large quantities of raw fruits or vegetables or when **heat-stable allergens** are involved. Mango, cherry, and broccoli are recognized triggers of OAS, and **gastrointestinal symptoms** may occur as secondary or systemic manifestations in some cases. Clinicians should carefully evaluate patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms in the context of OAS and provide appropriate dietary counseling and management strategies [^112NeWqv].

- typical birch-related triggers include raw apples, stone fruits, kiwi fruit, carrot, celery, soya milk, raw peanuts, and raw tree nuts (usually hazelnuts, almonds, and walnuts)

- symptoms can also occur when peeling potatoes or other root vegetables

- freshly prepared fruit/vegetable juices or smoothies, celery, soya milk, raw nuts, large quantities of roasted nuts, and concentrated nut products, can provoke more severe reactions.

### "Pine mouth" syndrome: cacogeusia following ingestion of pine nuts (genus: pinus). An emerging problem? [^114pFekY]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

We report a case of cacogeusia, specifically metallogeusia (a perceived metallic or bitter taste) following pine nut ingestion. A 36-year-old male presented with cacogeusia one day following ingestion of 10–15 roasted pine nuts (genus: Pinus). Symptoms became worst on post-exposure day 2 and progressively improved without treatment over 5 days. There were no other symptoms and physical examination was unrevealing. All symptoms resolved without sequalae. We contemporaneously report a rise in pine nut-associated cacogeusia reported online during the first quarter of 2009, and a significant rise in online searches related to pine nut-associated cacogeusia (or what the online public has termed "pine mouth") during this time. Most online contributors note a similar cacogeusia 1–3 days following pine nut ingestion lasting for up to 2 weeks. All cases seem self-limited. Patients occasionally describe abdominal cramping and nausea after eating the nuts. Raw, cooked, and processed nuts (in pesto, for example) are implicated. While there appears to be an association between pine nut ingestion and cacogeusia, little is known about this condition, nor can any specific mechanism of specific cause be identified. It is not known if a specific species of pine nut can be implicated. "Pine mouth" appears to be an emerging problem.

### Approach to patients with symptoms of food allergy [^113LHjjg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

"Allergy" is a term often used by patients to describe symptoms that arise after eating. The term "adverse reaction to food" is preferred unless the event has an immunologic basis. True food allergy, primarily mediated by immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies to food proteins, is present in 3% to 4% of US adults. Symptoms range from mild mouth itching ("oral allergy syndrome") to anaphylaxis. The diagnosis is established by history and appropriately performed skin testing or in vitro assays for specific IgE antibodies to the suspected food. Because food-allergic reactions can be fatal, it is important to identify and avoid the causative food. Food-allergic reactions are treated by prompt use of intramuscular epinephrine. Patients may be referred to an allergy/immunology specialist when the diagnosis is uncertain or if avoidance measures are not successful. Investigational therapies may ultimately be preventative or curative.

Future research on gastrointestinal (GI) alpha-gal syndrome emphasizes current knowledge gaps and study priorities: Prospective studies that focus on patients with GI alpha-gal syndrome do not exist currently, and blinded oral food challenges with alpha-gal-free or wild-type pork should help clarify symptom course and immune response after alpha-gal ingestion in sensitized patients with GI symptoms; additionally, future prospective studies should define GI alpha-gal syndrome's clinical characteristics, time to symptom response after adopting an alpha-gal-avoidance diet, and predictors of improvement on the diet, and large database studies could clarify possible health consequences of asymptomatic sensitization.

### Food allergy [^116nhCQP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on food allergy:

- **Definition**: Food allergy is an adverse food-stimulated immune response initiated on exposure to a given food.
- **Pathophysiology**: Food allergy is mostly caused by IgE-mediated antibodies (type 1 or early; 48%) and IgE-independent immune response including type IV (18%), type III (10%), and type II (6%) to specific foods (milk, eggs, wheat, fish, soy, peanuts, fish, shellfish, cherries, peaches, plums, apricots, nuts, and seeds) influenced by genetic and environmental (improved hygiene, lifestyle, diet and nutrition) factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the US is estimated at 10,000 in 100,000 adults.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of an immediate reaction include anaphylactic shock, urticaria, and angioedema. Late reaction food reaction symptoms include fatigue, irritability, depression, hyperactivity, insomnia, headache, poor concentration, paleness, itching limbs, involuntary bedwetting, asthma, colds, indigestion, colic, diarrhea, bloating, and skin lesions. The disease impairs QoL necessitating lifelong prevention of the specific food.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality risk associated with fatal anaphylaxis is < 1%.

### Food-induced anaphylaxis and oral allergy syndrome… [^114rwnPs]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: A 16-year-old boy presents to the allergy clinic with complaints of perioral itching and tingling after handling apples at his father's fruit stall. He had experienced such symptoms on previous occasions, but this time he has developed mild lip swelling and tongue itching, as well. He has a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis that is controlled by nasal steroid spray. His father is concerned that the reaction might be due to pesticides. A skin prick test with fresh apples gives a positive response that confirms the clinical diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome. Food allergies are an increasingly common problem faced by pediatricians. Food allergy is defined as an immune-mediated adverse reaction to foods causing symptoms affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory system. The reactions can be immune globulin E -mediated and nonIgE-mediated processes. Currently, food allergies affect 2%.

### How does dose impact on the severity of food-induced allergic reactions, and can this improve risk assessment for allergenic foods? report from an ILSI Europe food allergy task force expert group and workshop [^113M11qq]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

4 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SEVERITY OF ALLERGIC REACTIONS

Fatal reactions are rare but also unpredictable. Turner et al 3 recently reviewed our ability (or inability) to reliably predict severity. Several factors, acting together, are likely to contribute to the outcome of a reaction and its severity (Figure 2):

Figure 2
The "Swiss cheese" model. Adapted from reference 28

Allergen‐related factors: The nature and circumstances of allergen exposure are likely to impact upon reaction severity. Peanut and tree nuts, seafood and cow's milk are the most common causes of fatal food‐induced anaphylaxis in the UK, the USA and Australia. 18, 19, 20 In contrast, soya appears less likely to trigger severe reactions. 18 The food matrix in which the allergen is presented can affect severity: high fat (eg chocolate) and heavily spiced foods may affect the kinetics of allergen bioavailability, potentially delaying symptom onset, minimizing initial mild oral symptoms and by confounding "early warning signs" failing to limit the amount of allergen consumed. 21, 22 Heat‐processing can alter the structure of proteins and therefore their recognition by specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) and, ultimately, the nature of any reaction. 23 The relationship between dose (exposure) and reaction severity is less clear (see next section), although some (but not all) data suggest that severe reactions to very low doses are uncommon. 24
Host factors: These include factors which might affect the ability of an allergen to stimulate a host effector cell response (ie an allergic reaction) as well as factors which may modulate the response. Perhaps the most studied factor is the level of allergen‐specific IgE, which, however, shows a poor correlation with reaction severity (either historical, or that occurring at in‐hospital food challenge), as do "components" or IgE against specific epitopes. 3 "Extrinsic" factors (also referred to as cofactors or augmentation factors) such as exercise, stress, medication and alcohol can impact upon severity, as reviewed elsewhere. 3, 25, 26 Some individuals are also able to compensate physiologically for an allergic reaction, to the extent of recovering spontaneously from food‐induced anaphylaxis. 27 All these complicate evaluation of the relationship between dose and severity.
Factors affecting reaction outcome: Severity, and the subsequent outcome, depend not only on the nature of the reaction, but any subsequent intervention to control the reaction. Delays in seeking medical attention and/or administration of adrenaline (epinephrine) are common factors reported in fatal anaphylaxis. Many severe reactions can have a good outcome if appropriately treated with epinephrine. Contact or inhaled exposures are less likely to trigger severe reactions. If dose affects the rate of symptom progression, then a higher dose might limit the time available to administer rescue medication. The ultimate outcome of an allergic reaction expressed as a severity score will thus require great care to integrate into a QRA. Smith et al 28 proposed the "Swiss cheese" model to illustrate how these factors might interact to result in reactions of different severity. Essentially, this approach postulates that a severe reaction results from alignment of a whole set of circumstances, of which ingested dose is only one factor, as illustrated in Figure 2.

### Development of sensitization to peanut and storage proteins and relation to markers of airway and systemic inflammation: a 24-year follow-up [^114rt4aQ]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Peanut allergy symptoms at 24 years were defined as having specified avoidance of peanut at 24 years and reported specified symptoms at 16 years and/or 24 years, such as unconsciousness, asthma, hoarseness, swelling of face, lips, and eyes, general urticaria, partial urticaria, GI‐symptoms (vomiting, stomach pain), rhino conjunctivitis, oral symptoms consistent with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or other.

Asthma at 24 years was defined as ever having a doctor's diagnosis of asthma together with symptoms of breathing difficulties in the last 12 months prior to the date of questionnaire at 24 years of age or used asthma medicine occasionally or regularly last 12 months.

Severe asthma at 24 years was defined as fulfilling the asthma at 24 years definition above in combination with at least 2 months usage of both inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled long acting beta2 agonist in the last 12 months and either of the following in the last 12 months due to asthma symptoms: Use of oral cortisone tablets or acute visits to emergency room or perceived impaired daily life or more than 12 episodes of breathing difficulties.

Atopic dermatitis at 24 years was based on clinical examination fulfilling UK Working Party criteria, also called William's criteria, and defined as reporting an itchy rash in the last 12 months prior to the questionnaire at 24 years of age in combination with 3 out of 4 of the following criteria
dry skin last 12 months prior to questionnaire 24
atopic dermatitis onset below age 2 years (based on questionnaire data)
History of flexural atopic dermatitis (at any BAMSE follow‐up)
Personal history of asthma and/or rhinitis (at any BAMSE follow‐up from age 4 years).

Rhinitis at 24 years was defined as prolonged sneezing or a runny or blocked nose without common cold in the last 12 months prior to the date of questionnaire at 24 years of age.

### Pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS): a review of current available literature [^114DKAFv]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS) is a complex syndrome posing a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Our objective was to summarize the available literature regarding its prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was performed to include English language articles with the following search terms: pollen food syndrome, pollen food allergy syndrome, PFAS, oral allergy syndrome, OAS, food anaphylaxis, food components.

Study Selections

Human articles discussing PFAS.

Results

Varying reports have been made of the prevalence of PFAS, ranging from 4.7% to greater than 20% in children and 13% to 58% in adults. Prevalence varies widely by geographic region. PFAS is typically the results of class II food allergens (e.g. sensitized to anaeroallergen, but reaction occurs due to cross reactivity from a food allergen). Commonly these reactions are limited to the oropharynx due to the lability of the proteins causing the reaction. As multiple families of proteins with varying stability cause PFAS, severe systemic reactions are also possible, as anaphylactic shock has been documented in up to 1.7% of reactions.

Conclusion

Pollen food allergy syndrome therefore cannot be dismissed as a benign food allergy, but it needs to be approached individually based on known risk factors.

### An update on oral anaphylaxis from mite ingestion [^113KLG17]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review systemic reactions due to the oral ingestion of mites.

Data Sources

We performed a MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed research articles published between 1993 and 2004 relevant to the subject of anaphylactic reactions to mite-contaminated foods.

Study Selection

Recent studies that emphasized the potentially life-threatening nature of anaphylactic reactions, responsible foodstuffs and mites, populations at risk, and pathogenesis were selected for inclusion in this review.

Results

Although relatively few new cases of oral mite anaphylaxis are reported in the literature, we speculate that this clinical condition is occurring more frequently than realized in many geographic locations, and only the suspicion of an informed physician can contribute to its diagnosis and prevention. Oral anaphylaxis from mite-contaminated foods may be lethal if not promptly recognized and treated, and some preventive measures may be helpful for individuals at risk. Frequent cross-reactions among domestic, storage, and phytophagous mites explain the increased risk of oral mite anaphylaxis in sensitive patients living in both urban and rural areas. The enzymatic activity of some mite allergens contributes to the pathogenesis of this syndrome by means of mucosal damage and enhanced allergen absorption through the oral route.

Conclusions

Oral mite anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially lethal allergic condition that occurs in many countries and is frequently undiagnosed. Early recognition may lead to the implementation of simple prophylactic measures in at-risk populations of allergic patients.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^113wkkUo]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Birch‐pollen sensitization is associated with less severe reactions in people allergic to peanutor hazelnut, probably because this is indicative of Bet v 1‐mediated PFAS, rather than primary sensitization to a food allergen. Importantly, patients with only oral symptoms (often referred to as oral allergy syndrome, OAS) to low levels of allergen exposure must not be assumed to have PFAS on that basis alone: indeed, in the first description of OAS in the literature, almost half of patients with OAS to peanut went on to experience systemic symptoms and anaphylaxis with subsequent exposure.OAS is therefore not synonymous with PFAS; the latter requires evidence of IgE‐sensitization to cross‐reactive pollens and/or the presence of OAS alone at higher doses of allergen ingestion.

While LTP‐mediated allergy can be associated with very severe reactions, LTP‐sensitization without clinical reactivity is common, although there is significant geographical variation. Data are emerging that polysensitization to pollen panallergens (particularly to Bet v 1 homologues and profilins) in LTP‐sensitized individuals can moderate severity. Conversely, mono‐sensitization to a single LTP (without other IgE‐sensitization) may be associated with a greater risk of severe reactions in some regions.

### An international Delphi consensus on the management of pollen-food allergy syndrome: a Work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to foods committee [^113RDYxp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

AAAAI pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) management — Round 2 Delphi appropriateness: Individuals with PFAS may benefit from education about the mechanistic basis of their PFAS (Appropriateness, median 9; DI 0). Reactions in PFAS are mostly benign and limited to the oropharynx, although, rarely, more severe symptoms may occur (9; DI 0.050). Certain foods associated with PFAS (nuts, soy milk, smoothies/fresh juices), especially if consumed rapidly or in large amounts, might rarely trigger systemic symptoms (9; DI 0.132). Individuals with PFAS limited to oral symptoms may choose to avoid only the raw forms of the responsible fruit/vegetable (9; DI 0.132), and may choose to continue to ingest the responsible fruit and vegetable if well-cooked but are cautioned that roasting may not eliminate the risk of reaction with nuts (9; DI 0.132). Lighter cooking methods (eg, steaming or stir-frying) may be insufficient to fully denature the allergens relevant to PFAS (8; DI 0.132), and patients should be educated on the higher allergen contents in the peels and seeds of fruits but are cautioned peeling and removing the seeds is usually insufficient to prevent symptoms of PFAS (9; DI 0.132). Patients with PFAS characterized by systemic reactions (ie, symptoms extending beyond the oropharynx) should strictly avoid the responsible fruits and vegetables (9; DI 0.132). Mild symptoms of PFAS limited to oropharynx often resolve without treatment; a nonsedating antihistamine can be used for uncomfortable symptoms (9; DI 0). PFAS with a history of systemic reaction may be at a higher risk for future severe reactions, and an emergency treatment plan and a prescription of EAI should be offered (9; DI 0).

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) — dietary avoidance and food-processing recommendations (Statements 5–9) specify that individuals with PFAS limited to oral symptoms may choose to avoid only the raw forms of the responsible fruit/vegetable, and patients with PFAS limited to oral symptoms may choose to continue to ingest the responsible fruit and vegetable if well-cooked but are cautioned that roasting may not eliminate the risk of reaction with nuts. Lighter cooking methods (eg, steaming or stir-frying) may be insufficient to fully denature the allergens relevant to PFAS, and patients should be educated on the higher allergen content in the peels and seeds of fruits but cautioned that peeling and removing the seeds are usually insufficient means for preventing symptoms of PFAS. Patients with PFAS characterized by systemic reactions (ie, symptoms extending beyond the oropharynx) should strictly avoid the responsible fruits and vegetables.

Primary IgE-Mediated Food Allergy vs Pollen Food Allergy Syndrome

Primary food allergy results from primary sensitization to a food allergen. In contrast, secondary food allergy, also known as pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS), refers to where the primary sensitization is to aeroallergens, with symptoms occurring because of exposure to cross-reactive allergens in food. Patients with PFAS experience oropharyngeal symptoms of itching or tingling with or without mild lip swelling after ingestion of specific fresh fruit or vegetable. The term oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is often used interchangeably with PFAS, but is a more general term describing any oropharyngeal symptoms that occur as part of an allergic reactionand will often progress to systemic symptoms, including anaphylaxis (ie, OAS occurs in both PFAS and primary food allergy). Indeed, more than 50% of patients described by Amlot et alin the first case series of OAS later experienced systemic symptoms and anaphylaxis.

Drawing a distinction between primary and secondary food allergy is vital in both risk stratification and management advicebut may be tricky because patients will often have a mix of both primary food allergy and PFAS to different allergens, whereas others may even demonstrate a pattern of sensitization consistent with primary allergy and PFAS to the same allergen (eg, IgE positivity to both Ara h 2 and Ara h 8 for peanut or Cor a 1 and Cor a 8 for hazelnut). PFAS is usually considered to be a relatively benign condition in which systemic symptoms are rare because of lability of the causative allergens, such as Bet v 1 homologues and profilins. However, approximately 10% of PFAS presentations are associated with systemic symptoms and 1% to 2% with anaphylaxis. It is not clear why some patients experience more significant symptoms and whether this is due to polysensitization to more stable allergens, such as lipid transfer proteinsor diagnostic misclassification. Component resolved diagnostics have improved our ability to discriminate between PFAS and primary food allergy but are only of limited use in identifying patients with PFAS at risk of severe systemic reactions. Whether prescription of epinephrine autoinjector devices is indicated in patients with PFAS remains unclear.

### Lipid transfer protein syndrome due to wild grape juice and various vegetables: a life-threatening food allergen [^111mBdwE]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

We report a 16-year-old Japanese male with mugwort pollinosis in whom ingestion of wild grape juice and various vegetables caused recurrent general urticaria, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and loss of consciousness. A skin prick test demonstrated positive reactions to a wide variety of both non-heated and heated vegetables and fruits such as wild grape, bell pepper, onion, Chinese cabbage, tomato, eggplant, and broccoli. The serum immunoglobulin E levels (ImmunoCAP ISAC ®) for Art v 3, Pla a 3, Pru p 3, and Jug r 3, which are lipid transfer protein (LTP) homologs, were positive but those for Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 were negative. We diagnosed the patient as having LTP syndrome, a condition in which additional factors such as exercise, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or alcohol may trigger an allergic reaction. Wild grapes contain a large amount of salicylic acid, and in our patient ingestion of wild grape juice led to immediate loss of consciousness in the absence of exercise. This suggests that salicylic acid contained in fruits and vegetables may act as an important cofactor in LTP syndrome. Although sensitization to LTP is rarely reported in Asia, LTP are considered to be potentially life-threatening food allergens, and therefore warrant attention.

### Oral immunotherapy for multiple foods in a pediatric allergy clinic setting [^111zipUu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Some nuts, such as cashew/pistachio and walnut/pecan, are cross-reactive and may be cross-desensitizing. We elected to include all nuts indicated by each patient's sensitization and reaction history because complete cross-desensitization is not guaranteed.

Most of the allergic reactions experienced by our patients were enteric local reactions (oral itching, perioral rashes, or transient abdominal pain). Systemic allergic reactions were rare, and none were severe. Only 1 episode of wheezing occurred among our patients; however, our patients' asthma was mostly mild (Table 1), and their asthma was well controlled. Mild local reactions usually responded well to administration of H₁ antihistamines for oral or skin symptoms, and/or H₂ antihistamines for stomach symptoms. None of our patients reported ongoing problems with allergic reactions after the first 3 months of daily maintenance dosing. Other studies have also noted that reactions to OIT are more common during up-dosing than during maintenance.– In our cohort, frequency of ED visits during OIT was not significantly different than the frequency of ED visits for unintentional food allergen ingestion in a similar cohort of patients on the waiting list to start OIT during a similar timeframe. High positive sIgE levels or large SPT reactions do not preclude a patient participating in OIT, although patients with higher baseline allergy test results might have lower reaction thresholds and take longer to reach maintenance dosing than patients with lower test results.

There are several limitations to this study. These data were collected from a clinical practice not a controlled clinical trial. There was less rigorous standardization compared with a research trial. There was no blinding or control group. Our results cannot be directly compared with those of published research trials of OIT.

OFCs were not done for all the foods included in the OIT mixes, so we do not know the baseline reaction threshold for each food. Every patient had a positive OFC result or a convincing clinical reaction history for at least some of the foods, although in some cases the clinical reaction was up to 12 years before the onset of OIT; it is possible that some of these food allergies had resolved spontaneously. Multiple OFCs are expensive and time consuming, so some families preferred to include additional foods in the OIT without OFC confirmation of all food allergens.

### Boletus edulis: a digestion-resistant allergen may be relevant for food allergy [^117JyMty]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal components can cause allergic symptoms either through inhalation, ingestion or contact. Whereas respiratory allergy is thought to be induced by spores, allergic reactions following ingestion are attributed to other parts of the mushroom. Reports of food-related allergic reactions due to the edible mushroom Boletus edulis have occasionally been reported.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate whether separate allergens may be detected in alimentary allergy to Boletus edulis.

Methods

Sera of two subjects, one with recurrent anaphylaxis and the other with a predominantly oral allergy syndrome following ingestion of Boletus edulis, have been analysed by a time-course digestion assay using simulated gastric fluid and by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting. Sera of four Boletus edulis skin prick test-negative subjects and all without clinical symptoms to ingested Boletus edulis served as controls.

Results

In lyophilized Boletus edulis extract, at least four water-soluble proteins were detected, the most reactive at 55 kDa and at 80 kDa. Following the time-course digestion assay, IgE binding was found to a 75-kDa protein, but only if the sera of the subject with recurrent anaphylaxis was used.

Conclusion

The data indicate that Boletus edulis can cause an IgE-mediated food allergy due to a digestion-stabile protein at 75 kDa. No IgE immune response to this protein was detected in the serum of a subject with respiratory allergy and oral allergy syndrome to Boletus edulis nor in control sera.

### Food allergy from infancy through adulthood [^116CT22X]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Food allergies are the result of immune responses that cause adverse reactions to foods. Immune responses to foods may produce a spectrum of symptoms and disorders, including acute allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome). Food-allergic responses also contribute to chronic inflammatory disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis and atopic dermatitis. Although food allergy affects people from infancy through adulthood, there are allergic features that differ according to age (ie, presentation, triggers, and natural course) and have important implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and management. New food allergies can develop at any age, and we propose similarities in the etiology of de novo food allergy whether in infancy or adulthood. The approach to managing food allergy changes dramatically over the life course, and physicians and patients must respond accordingly to optimize care. Food allergy therapies are emerging, and the efficacy and safety of these interventions could differ by age group of those treated. In this review, we highlight interesting observations on the etiology and characteristics of food allergy presenting at different ages and discuss clinical management as it relates to life stage.

### The functional connection between oral allergy syndrome and United airways disease assessed by oral challenge [^11327rNK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The airways and the upper digestive tract have a common embryonic origin. In sensitized subjects they can respond to allergens with an immediate reaction (asthma, rhinitis, or oral allergy syndrome [OAS]).

Objective

To investigate the possible functional connection between respiratory and upper digestive tract by means of specific oral allergen challenges.

Methods

Patients sensitized to birch and apple were subdivided into group A (n = 12; asthma + rhinitis caused by birch and OAS caused by apple); group B (n = 10; OAS caused by apple without asthma/rhinitis); group C (n = 8; asthma and rhinitis caused by birch without OAS). Healthy subjects represented the control group D (n = 6). Oral provocation test with apple was performed out of the pollen season. Visual analog scale for eye, nose, and mouth symptoms, spirometry, nasal eosinophil count, and exhaled nitric oxide were assessed before and 6 hours after challenge.

Results

No change occurred in nasal and ocular symptoms before versus after challenge in all groups. On the contrary, in groups A and B the oral scores significantly increased after challenge (P < .001), whereas no change was seen in groups C and D. Exhaled nitric oxide and nasal eosinophils showed no change before versus after challenge in all groups. Nitric oxide was higher before and after challenge in groups A and C vs groups B and D. No change was seen in either forced vital capacity or forced expiratory volume in 1 second.

Conclusion

In the case of birch-apple syndrome, eating apple does not functionally or clinically affect the respiratory tract.

### Food allergies: the basics [^1124Ukfz]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Induction of atopic dermatitis by food allergens has been shown to require not only Th2 cells (and Th2 cytokines such as IL4, IL13, and IL5 — a cytokine that activates eosinophils), but also Th1 cells, which mediated delayed allergic inflammation. Interferon-γ, secreted by allergen-specific Th1 cells, was shown to induce epithelial damage in a model of respiratory allergy.

The immediate- and delayed-type allergic inflammation that occurs during IgE-associated food allergy has been studied extensively in patients with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) (Supplementary Table 1). OAS is caused by sensitization to respiratory allergens that structurally are similar to allergens in foods, leading to a cross-reactive immune response. The most common form of OAS develops with sensitization to the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. In patients with this form of OAS, the immune response cross-reacts with allergens in plant-derived food such as apples, nuts, carrots, and celery. This leads to local allergy symptoms of the immediate type (local itching and swelling of the lips or tongue), caused by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. However, Bet v 1–related plant food allergens are digested by the gastrointestinal tract, therefore systemic reactions occur only in exceptional cases (such as after consumption of large amounts of the plant food allergens during exercise), and anaphylactic shock does not occur. Likewise, cooking destroys IgEs, but leaves peptides recognized by allergen-specific T cells intact. Ingestion of Bet v 1–related plant food allergens therefore can activate allergen-specific T cells by IgE-independent mechanisms, and induce late-phase and chronic allergic inflammation to cause disorders such as atopic dermatitis in sensitized patients.

Information on the time until onset of allergic reactions after food allergen intake (minutes–hours vs hours–days) and allergy phenotype (eg, urticaria vs atopic dermatitis) can help to determine whether the symptoms involve immediate IgE-mediated mast cell or basophil activation, or late-phase or chronic allergic inflammation caused by T-cell or eosinophil activation. Then, it is possible to select the most appropriate therapy. For example, immediate reactions would be treated with antihistamines, antileukotrienes, epinephrine, mast cell stabilizers, or anti-IgE, whereas late-phase chronic inflammation would be treated with steroids or anti-IL5.

### Food intolerance… [^114kQYFP]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

A mother brought her two-year-old child to the office for examination of a rash that had appeared rapidly on the child's face. The rash was itching intensely and getting progressively worse. Early that morning, the child had eaten a banana, a slice of wheat bread, minced lamb and one boiled egg white. He played actively through the morning and napped for two hours. At 2 p. m., he ate a fresh apple, lettuce and part of a slice of roast beef. Ten minutes later, the mother noticed the rash. The child had no vomiting, abdominal pain, blood in the stool or respiratory symptoms. He did have a history of atopic dermatitis and of urticarial reactions to milk, yogurt, catfish and bananas. He had developed a tolerance to bananas over the past year. Question Discussion The answer is C: roast beef. Preserved foods are a frequent cause of food hypersensitivity.

The fact that the child ate only a portion of the slice of the roast beef is a clue that he was already starting to feel the intense pruritus typical of a classic allergic reaction. The patient had an immediate hypersensitivity reaction that usually occurs within two hours of contact with the food antigen and consists of pruritus, erythema and edema. If left untreated, the pruritus can reoccur after six to eight hours. 1 The foods that were eaten in the morning were less likely to have been the provoking agents because of the time factor. A late-phase reaction does not occur without a preceding immediate hypersensitivity reaction. 1 Note that the child by history had developed a tolerance to his banana allergy. The roast beef in this case contained sodium benzoate, flavorings and food coloring, all of which are known to cause allergic symptoms. Other frequently implicated food dyes, flavorings and preservatives that can cause allergic reactions include tartrazine, nitrites and nitrates, monosodium glutamate and sulfiting agents. 2 Various fruits and raw vegetables are known to cause oral allergy syndrome. In this symptom complex, the patient first develops pruritus and edema of the lips, tongue, palate and throat. Since the patient in this case did not develop these symptoms, the apple was less likely to be the offending agent. 3 IgE-mediated food allergy has been shown to be involved in approximately 60 percent of cutaneous flares in patients with severe atopic reactions.

### Clinical presentations of food allergy [^1145zwnR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Food allergies are immune-mediated responses to food proteins. Because of differences in the underlying immunologic mechanisms, there are varying clinical presentations of food allergy. This article discusses the manifestations of IgE-mediated disorders, including urticaria and angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, gastrointestinal anaphylaxis, generalized anaphylaxis, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome. It also reviews the presentations of mixed IgE- and cell-mediated disorders, including atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, the manifestations of cell-mediated food allergies are discussed, including dietary protein-induced proctitis and proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, celiac disease, and food-induced pulmonary hemosiderosis.

### An international Delphi consensus on the management of pollen-food allergy syndrome: a Work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to foods committee [^112TVrqq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) — risk factor counseling and systemic reaction cofactors are outlined as follows: The panel agreed to counsel patients with PFAS that certain foods and factors may be associated with increased severity of PFAS reactions and to educate patients that avoiding these factors, when possible, might serve as an opportunity to mitigate their rare risk of more severe reactions. Patients should be educated that there is a rare chance of systemic reaction including anaphylaxis and that severe reactions are more likely during the corresponding peak pollen season. Reported cofactors include that the use of PPIs was more prevalent among patients with PFAS who experienced systemic reactions; NSAID use was similarly more prevalent among patients with systemic reactions (3% vs 0%), but this was not statistically significant, and a subset of patients with history of PFAS limited to the oropharynx experienced systemic reactions related to exposure to NSAIDs and had no reaction during oral challenge to the culprit NSAID without ingesting the food. Additional associated factors include ingestion of peanuts, tree nuts, fasting, and excessive ingestion such as with liquid forms. Bariatric surgery has been linked to progression in case series, including 9 patients with systemic reactions after surgery that were previously tolerated or mild, and in another study 2 of 18 transitioned from mild oropharyngeal symptoms to generalized reactions after gastric bypass surgery. Alcohol consumption, exercise, and uncontrolled asthma are recognized cofactors for food-induced anaphylaxis and might increase PFAS severity.

Patient education items include: "Statement 1. Individuals with PFAS may benefit from education about the mechanistic basis of their PFAS". "Statement 2. Reactions in PFAS are mostly benign and limited to the oropharynx, although, rarely, more severe symptoms may occur". "Statement 3. Certain foods associated with PFAS (nuts, soy beverages, smoothies/fresh juices), especially if consumed rapidly or in large amounts, might rarely trigger systemic symptoms". "Statement 4. Certain factors have been reported to increase the severity of PFAS symptoms including medications (eg, proton pump inhibitors [PPIs], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), bariatric surgery, uncontrolled asthma, fasting, and exercise)". Reported rates noted on the page include "1.7% of patients with PFAS" affected by anaphylaxis in early reports, "8.9% experienced anaphylaxis" in a Korean nationwide study, and an Italian study where "5% of patients with PFAS experienced systemic symptoms".

### AGA clinical practice update on alpha-gal syndrome for the GI clinician: commentary [^111vhwUL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

Alpha-gal syndrome is an emerging allergy first described in the early 2000s. The allergy can cause anaphylaxis, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and skin changes one to several hours after ingestion of mammalian products. A GI phenotype that is increasingly recognized manifests with nonspecific symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting without predominant skin, respiratory or circulatory symptoms. Though the syndrome has been reported on all continents except Antarctica, in the United States most reports are within the range of the Lone Star tick, extending from New York and Iowa to Texas and Florida. The purpose of this AGA Clinical Practice Update (CPU) Commentary is to increase awareness among gastroenterologists about the presentation and management of alpha-gal syndrome.

Methods

This CPU commentary was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. This expert commentary incorporates important as well as recently published studies in this field, and it reflects the experiences of the authors. Formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations were not included since systematic reviews were not performed.

### AGA clinical practice update on alpha-gal syndrome for the GI clinician: commentary [^115J2uyi]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Alpha-gal syndrome — differential diagnosis and testing guidance for gastroenterology clinicians advises considering alpha-gal syndrome in patients with unexplained gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in alpha-gal–prevalent areas, performing serum alpha-gal IgE testing in such patients, avoiding testing when red flag features are present, and recognizing that skin findings may be absent. Clinicians should consider alpha-gal syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained GI symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, particularly those who live or have lived in an alpha-gal–prevalent area, and such patients should undergo serum testing for alpha-gal IgE antibodies. Clinicians should consider not testing those with red flag symptoms such as anemia, GI bleeding, or weight loss because the allergy does not cause these symptoms, and skin symptoms such as urticaria and angioedema may or may not be present.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as: generalized skin erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, rhinitis, wheezing, laryngeal edema, itching of nose and throat, breathlessness, dyspnea, coughing, hypotension and marked perspiration. Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions may occur. Severe reactions may cause anaphylaxis or shock and loss of consciousness and rarely death.

The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is dependent upon the system complex. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent. (See Overdose section)

Local Reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at the injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and prolonged local reactions the use of antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medications may be dictated. Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report can be filed to: MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852–9787, call 1–800-FDA-1088.

Alpha-gal syndrome diagnosis — clinical diagnosis with laboratory support emphasizes that a positive alpha-gal IgE alone is insufficient; a diagnosis may be made in patients with consistent symptoms and increased alpha-gal IgE whose symptoms resolve or improve after an alpha-gal-avoidance diet, and clinicians should inform such patients to adopt a diet eliminating mammalian meat and related products for at least a month with re-evaluation after the trial; oral food challenge is typically used for allergies but is impractical for routine care in alpha-gal syndrome due to delayed and inconsistent reactions.

### Characteristics and associated morbidities of young adults with misconceived food allergy: a cross-sectional study [^113siZxx]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Overall, 12,592 recruits, aged seventeen years (46.5% males) were included in this study. Food avoidance due to an allergy was reported by 148 recruits and the diagnosis of food allergy was excluded in 64 (43.2% of them). The characteristics of individuals with and without reported food allergy, are detailed in Table 1.

Table 1
Comparison of patients who did and did not report food allergy.

Most excluded food allergies (n = 42, 65.6%) were to fruits, vegetables seeds, legumes and spices, which are not common regional allergenic foods (Table 2). For 10 recruits, allergies were excluded for more than a single food. Thirty-nine of the recruits with excluded food allergy (Table 2, Groups B + C) had acute symptoms that could reflect typical allergic reactions to the suspected foods (skin rash with or without angioedema, gastro-intestinal symptoms or acute dyspnea) but had not been evaluated by an allergist previously. Seven additional recruits (Group D) had symptoms that were unlikely a result of food allergy (atypical symptoms or too long interval from exposure). These recruits had no previous allergy evaluation as well. Thirteen recruits (Group A) reported symptoms that were limited to the oral cavity but only four of them underwent a formal allergy evaluation. All 13 were non-allergic at study entry. Six of these individuals had positive SPTs and might represent oral allergy syndrome. Three recruits (Group E) were diagnosed with milk/egg allergy in infancy but were not followed by an allergist since, and the timing of resolution of their allergy is not clear. Finally, two recruits (Group F) were diagnosed as food allergic by an allergist but review of their symptoms suggest that they were probably not allergic (one had symptoms suggestive of chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other experienced acute urticaria which was attributed to a fruit that was previously consumed regularly and uneventfully). Only 10 of the 64 recruits had evidence of sensitization (positive SPT) to the suspected foods during their current evaluation.

Alpha-gal syndrome — delayed allergic reactions after mammalian meat ingestion typically occur hours after eating, can include hypotension consistent with anaphylaxis, often involve abdominal pain, and generally improve with dietary avoidance. These patients generally have hives 3 to 5 hours after eating mammalian meat and many of them have a decrease in blood pressure consistent with anaphylaxis, a significant proportion of these cases also have abdominal symptoms, particularly pain, and almost all of those patients' symptoms resolve or improve with careful avoidance of mammalian meat and mammalian-derived products.

If multiple food allergies were reported, each reported food allergy was evaluated separately using the food allergy categorization flowchart. For example, if a respondent reported a nut allergy with a reaction history limited to oral symptoms indicative of oral allergy syndrome as well as a shellfish allergy with a reaction history that included throat tightening, vomiting, and hives, the respondent would be considered to have only a single, severe shellfish allergy and the nut allergy would be excluded. Lifetime physician-diagnosed atopic comorbidities were also assessed using the question, "Have you ever been diagnosed by a doctor with any of the following chronic conditions? Please select all that apply". Response options included asthma, eczema/atopic dermatitis, hay fever/allergic rhinitis/seasonal allergies, insect sting allergy, latex allergy, medication allergy, and urticaria/chronic hives.

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) management algorithm (OAS, Oral allergy syndrome) outlines an approach beginning with "History suggestive of PFAS and supported by diagnostic testing", then branching to "Limited to oropharynx" or systemic involvement. For limited oropharyngeal symptoms, the steps are: "Counsel patients about the mechanistic basis of PFAS, the usual benign self-limited nature of OAS, and the option of treating mild symptoms with oral nonsedating antihistamines"; "Counsel patients to avoid the culprit raw fruit or vegetable"; "Counsel patients about the rare chance of systemic reaction and its recognition and treatment"; "Counsel patients that less thorough cooking techniques (e.g., stir-frying), and that roasting may not completely denature the allergenic proteins"; "Counsel patients that excessive ingestion as with soy milk or fresh smoothies may result in a more severe reaction"; and "Counsel patients about risk factors associated with more severe reactions and consider EAI prescription for these patients after shared decision-making". For systemic reactions, the algorithm directs "Strict avoidance of the culprit food", to "offer EAI prescription", and to "Identify and mitigate risk factors for systemic reactions".

### Food contact hypersensitivity syndrome: the mucosal contact urticaria paradigm [^11628ScT]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or pollen-fruit allergy syndrome represents a mucosal allergic contact urticaria in people sensitized to common pollens, due to IgE cross-reactivity between homologous pollen allergens and various plant foods. It is the most prevalent food allergy, affecting millions of people with respiratory allergies. Usually, symptoms are mild, self-limiting and localized to the oropharyngeal mucosa, although they may sometimes become generalized and life-threatening. Although patients usually recognize the offending foods, diagnosis may sometimes be complicated. Several clinical syndromes and association between pollens and plant-derived foods have been described. Crossreactivity on the basis of stringent immunological and allergological criteria can also occur in people without pollen sensitization or concomitant respiratory allergies, as in latex-fruit syndrome. The term 'food contact hypersensitivity syndrome' (FCHS) is proposed in this paper for the first time, to include all mucosal hypersensitivity reactions presenting with contact to food (both immunological and nonimmunological), whether due to crossreactivity with homologous plant-derived allergens or not. At this time, prophylaxis and treatment can only be attained by avoidance, even when symptoms are mild, with consequent impairment in quality of life. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of FCHS and food allergy in general is essential for deeper insights and future emergence of effective therapies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alpha‐gal syndrome (AGS) is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)‐mediated allergy to non‐primate mammalian meat products (e.g. 'red meat' such as beef, pork, or lamb) and other mammalian‐derived products including dairy. The condition was first recognized in 2007 among patients with pre‐existing serum IgE antibodies to galactose‐alpha‐1,3‐galactose (alpha‐gal) who experienced immediate‐onset life‐threatening hypersensitivity reactions following intravenous administration of the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, which contains numerous alpha‐gal moieties.

Unlike other food allergies, AGS is most often characterized by delayed onset (2–6 h) allergic reactions after ingestion of red meat, dairy, or other mammalian‐derived products. Symptom onset is more rapid with intramuscular or intravenous exposures. Clinical presentation is broad, ranging from urticaria and gastrointestinal distress to angioedema and life‐threatening anaphylaxis; other factors such as alcohol consumption and exercise can also potentiate the response. A subset of patients report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) without mucocutaneous, respiratory, or cardiovascular symptoms. Diagnosis is typically based on the history of allergic reactions upon exposure to alpha‐gal containing products coupled with elevated serum IgE antibodies to alpha‐gal (≥ 0.1 IU/ml). Onset is most common during adulthood and management of AGS requires a multifaceted, patient‐centered approach, including prevention of tick bites, an avoidance diet, antihistamine use, and awareness of alpha‐gal presence in many food and non‐food products.

### Food allergy and hypersensitivity reactions in children and adults – A review [^11349trv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Adverse reactions after food intake are commonly reported and a cause of concern and anxiety that can lead to a very strict diet. The severity of the reaction can vary depending on the type of food and mechanism, and it is not always easy to disentangle different hypersensitivity diagnoses, which sometimes can exist simultaneously. After a carefully taken medical history, hypersensitivity to food can often be ruled out or suspected. The most common type of allergic reaction is immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy (prevalence 5–10%). Symptoms vary from mild itching, stomach pain, and rash to severe anaphylaxis. The definition of IgE-mediated food allergy is allergic symptoms combined with specific IgE-antibodies, and therefore only IgE-antibodies to suspected allergens should be analyzed. Nowadays, methods of molecular allergology can help with the diagnostic process. The most common allergens are milk and egg in infants, peanut and tree nuts in children, and fish and shellfish in adults. In young children, milk/egg allergy has a good chance to remit, making it important to follow up and reintroduce the food when possible. Other diseases triggered by food are non-IgE-mediated food allergy, for example, eosinophilic esophagitis, celiac disease, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, and hypersensitivity to milk and biogenic amines. Some of the food hypersensitivities dominate in childhood, others are more common in adults. Interesting studies are ongoing regarding the possibilities of treating food hypersensitivity, such as through oral immunotherapy. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the most common types of food hypersensitivity reactions.

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) — Round 1 Delphi acute symptom self-management and epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) guidance indicates that "individuals with PFAS limited to oral symptoms (OAS) should be advised to self-treat with a nonsedating antihistamine", that "individuals with a history of systemic symptoms (defined as having symptoms that extend beyond the oropharynx) should be supplied and educated on how to use epinephrine autoinjector (EAI)", that "individuals with PFAS and irrespective of the severity of their reported reaction and who have risk factors for systemic reactions (using gastric acid suppressive medications, gastric bypass surgery, narrow oropharyngeal anatomy) should be supplied and educated on how to use the EAI", and that "individuals with PFAS should be educated to use EAI if they had accidental ingestion of the culprit fruit/vegetable and experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, lightheadedness, or hives in addition to oral pruritus".

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^113c57Wv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

In children, rhinitis may present via associated comorbidities (table 1) depending on the child's age. Nasal obstruction with chronic mouth breathing can sometimes be the only presenting symptom in small children: adenoidal hypertrophy and recurrent viral colds are frequent misdiagnoses. Adenoidal hypertrophy with or without sleep apnoea can, in fact, be associated with AR, and in some studies, a response to AR treatment has been noted with an improvement in sleep or hypoxia. Adenoidectomy has not been reported as improving AR, although it may have a role in treating chronic paediatric rhinosinusitis. Otitis media with effusion and Eustachian tube dysfunction can be detected in children with AR. In recent years, oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also known as pollen fruit syndrome, has more often been reported by patients suffering with pollen-induced AR, although the paediatric prevalence of this problem is uncertain. The history of oral pruritus and/or local angioedema in response to fresh fruits and vegetables, for example, apples, hazelnuts, carrots, celery and peanuts, in children with seasonal AR can be misdiagnosed as a primary food allergy (FA). In fact, the initial sensitisation is to pollen, with subsequent cross-reactivity to identical molecules in fruits and vegetables. In doubtful cases, molecular allergy diagnosis may help to distinguish OAS from FA.

Table I
Patient characteristics

The most common FPIES food trigger was shellfish (affecting 67% of patients [12 of 19]), followed by milk (affecting 11% [2 of 19]) and avocado (affecting 11% [2 of 19]) [Fig 1, A]. The other foods comprising the minority of food triggers included pistachio, almond, and peanut. One patient reported reactions to multiple fruits, including banana, mango, pineapple, papaya, and blueberry. The median difference between ASO and AD was 10 years; this difference was deemed statistically significant according to a paired t test (P = 0.003) [Fig 1, B]. There was a negative correlation of –0.99 between year of symptom onset and latency between ASO and AD (P < .0001) [Fig 1, C]. Those patients with previously diagnosed GI conditions had a higher mean latency between ASO and AD than those without did, although this difference was not statistically significant according to ANOVA analysis (P = 0.124) [Fig 1, D]. Those patients who had been seen by an allergist for other atopic conditions before their FPIES diagnosis had a mean latency between ASO and AD of 8.8 years (n = 5), whereas those who had not been previously seen by an allergist had a mean latency of 11.4 years (n = 11), although this difference was not significant [Fig 1, E].

### Clinical and laboratory features of patients diagnosed with α-gal syndrome-2010–2019 [^111EJNQ6]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

The relative paucity of cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms in AGS patients represents a clinical deviation from other food allergies. In a recent update of our understanding of shellfish allergy, one of the most common food allergies in adults, approximately 53% of patients reported respiratory symptoms and 33% reported cardiovascular symptoms. Instead, our study found that AGS is characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations without significant respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms, which is consistent with recent studies showing that AGS can cause gastrointestinal distress (e.g. episodic abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea) in the absence of symptoms commonly seen in allergic reactions to food products, including anaphylaxis. Cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms were almost exclusively reported by those who objectively qualified as having a more severe outcome (anaphylaxis). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also commonly reported, which is notable as patients and providers may overlook abdominal pain and cramping as a feature of an allergic reaction, underappreciating the systemic response to alpha‐gal. While we did note an increase in the number of patients presenting to care with onset in more recent years, increased education among patients and clinicians around both AGS and anaphylaxis is nonetheless important to help detect this condition early and guide appropriate management.

OAS, oral allergy syndrome; sAR, seasonal allergic rhinitis.

In the 2021 survey, kiwi, peach, apple, cherry, and melon were the most common OAS triggers (Table S2). OAS‐causing foods that significantly increased in 2021 compared with 2013 were apple, cherry, plum, kiwi, pineapple, watermelon, and orange. Peach remained prevalent but did not show a significant increase. Patients reported multiple OAS‐causative fruits, with an average of 3.9 foods for those with oral symptoms and 2.9 for those with only systemic symptoms (p < 0.001). Sites of OAS symptoms were characterized through the survey in 2021 (Figure S2A, B), revealing an increase in the percentage of sAR patients who experienced systemic symptoms after fruit ingestion (Table S3).

Our surveys demonstrated a growing trend of OAS co‐incidence among sAR patients in Yamanashi Prefecture — a region with the highest prevalence of pollen allergy in Japan — the earlier the onset and more severe the sAR symptoms, the higher the OAS prevalence. Although sensitization to Japanese cedar pollen has little association with OAS prevalence compared with sensitization to birch and alder pollens, the presence of gibberellin‐regulated proteins in Japanese cedar and cypress pollens can cause severe fruit allergy. Increased multisensitization to other allergens closely related to OAS (birch, alder, and grass pollen) may also contribute to increased OAS prevalence in sAR patients.

A longer AR duration was significantly associated with moderate‐to‐severe AR symptoms and OAS comorbidities in Italian children; earlier sensitization to various pollens, followed by longer duration since sAR onset could be a risk for OAS development among younger patients. Furthermore, a nationwide epidemiological survey of anaphylaxis in Japan reported fruits as the triggers for anaphylaxis.

Oral Food Challenges in IGE and Non-IGE–MEDIATED Food Allergy: Similarities and Differences

The design of OFCs differs when assessing for possible non-IgE–mediated food allergies. Unlike IgE-mediated food allergies, for food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome there is no broad consensus regarding the framework for dosing. Often, the design of the OFC reflects the timing of reaction ascertained through the clinical history. Given the length of observation periods in some food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome challenges, a shift toward multiple-step food challenges in which part of the assessment occurs in the home setting has been proposed, although the safety of this approach has yet to be fully assessed.

In other suspected non-IgE–mediated food allergies such as to cow's milk, the diagnosis is generally based on elimination of the allergen and its reintroduction over longer periods (typically at least 2–6 weeks). The food of interest is usually administered at home, with support of dietitians when needed, and the patient or family is responsible for observing any time relation between food exposure and symptoms.

Because of the longer interval between exposure and symptoms, the practice is to allow sequential food challenges to occur at home (using food ladders). However, there has recently been an expansion toward using the ladder approach to sequential food challenges in the home setting for some IgE-mediated food allergies in low-risk patients, although it is acknowledged that a robust safety framework (including for patient selection) is needed for this approach, and that it is arguably more akin to slow oral desensitization in its mechanism and often in its clinical intent than it is to an OFC.

### A survey on the management of pollen-food allergy syndrome in allergy practices [^112oa12b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus on the diagnosis and therapy of oral allergy syndrome (OAS; also known as pollen-food allergy syndrome), a disorder caused by IgE antibody-mediated reactions to homologous proteins in pollens and fruits and vegetables.

Objective

We sought to determine how practicing allergists define and treat OAS.

Methods

A questionnaire was mailed to 226 randomly selected US allergists from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology directory.

Results

One hundred twenty-two (54%) returned surveys were analyzed. Median estimates of the prevalence of OAS among the patients with pollen allergy were 5% among children and 8% among adults. Twenty percent of allergists reported that some patients progressed to systemic symptoms. Fifty-three percent of allergists recommended complete avoidance of causal foods to all patients, whereas 9% did not advocate any restrictions. Thirty percent never prescribed epinephrine for OAS, 3% always did, and the remainder did so on the basis of symptoms. When presented with clinical cases, 20% diagnosed systemic reactions to peach as OAS, 13% believed peanut could cause OAS, and 25% did not prescribe epinephrine for peanut allergy manifested by oral symptoms.

Conclusion

Allergists' estimates of the prevalence of OAS in patients with pollen allergy (5%-8%) are lower than the prevalence reported (approximately 50%) in the published studies of these patients, perhaps reflecting a low index of suspicion, underdiagnosis, or both. The wide range of responses regarding diagnosis and management indicates the need for a better definition for the disorder and standard therapeutic guidelines. Discrepancies might be related to the term OAS, and therefore use of the more specific term "pollen-food allergy syndrome" is suggested.

### Diagnosis and management of pollen food allergy syndrome to nuts [^111onA8X]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral allergy syndrome or pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS) represents a common clinical conundrum when the reported trigger food is a tree nut (usually almond or hazelnut) or peanut. The PFAS may give rise to uncertainty about the potential severity of the future reactions, indications for prescribing epinephrine, and the extent of the necessary dietary avoidance. As a food allergy, secondary to cross-reactivity with airborne pollen, PFAS usually manifests toward the end of the first decade of life as contact urticaria of the oropharyngeal mucous membranes. Molecular allergology facilitates diagnosis and risk stratification by establishing the profile of sensitization. Exclusive sensitization to pathogenesis-related proteins family 10 (PR10) and profilins indicates that signs and symptoms are due to PFAS, whereas sensitization to seed storage proteins with or without sensitization to PR10 and profilins may indicate a more severe primary nut allergy phenotype. Management relies on avoidance of the specific nut trigger, advice on the likelihood of more severe local or systemic symptoms, and treatment of reactions according to the severity. Future studies are needed to better delineate the risk of systemic reactions in individuals with nut PFAS and to establish the role of food or pollen allergen immunotherapy for the prevention or moderation of this condition.

### Hard to digest: the adult food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome experience [^112EjK2i]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy that is increasingly recognized in adults. Adult FPIES is characterized by severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and possibly vomiting. Pathophysiology and management between adults and children appear to be similar. However, with the evolving literature, distinguishing characteristics from pediatric populations have been identified including gastrointestinal symptom profile, symptom severity, common food triggers, and female demographic predominance. Despite the growing body of data on adult FPIES, there remains significant challenges related to diagnosis due to the broad differential diagnosis, poor awareness and lack of confirmatory testing aside from oral food challenges. There is significant heterogeneity in the literature regarding the best protocol for oral food challenges in adult FPIES. There also remain limitations in understanding prognosis, natural history, and factors affecting tolerance. These limitations have been reflected in reported unmet needs, with consequences on quality of life for adults diagnosed with FPIES. This review focuses on the most recent literature regarding clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, management, and unmet needs for adult FPIES, with discussion of areas requiring further investigation.

### Oral allergy syndrome: a clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenge [^117U3nim]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide a review of the literature and discuss the clinical, pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges of oral allergy syndrome (OAS).

Data Sources

English-language publications on OAS (and pollen-food allergy syndrome) were identified through MEDLINE and through the reference lists of each identified article and review.

Study Selection

Articles pertaining to OAS with respect to its varied clinical presentation, underlying pathophysiology, available and investigational diagnostic testing, and evidence-based treatment options were selected.

Results

OAS occurs in patients with a prior cross-reactive aeroallergen sensitization and clinically presents with initial oralpharyngeal symptoms after ingestion of a triggering fruit or vegetable. Although controversial, these symptoms may progress to systemic symptoms outside the gastrointestinal tract in 8.7% of patients and anaphylactic shock in 1.7%. OAS's underlying pathophysiology may play a role in clinical presentation and outcome, depending on whether the cross-reactive protein is a heat-labile PR-10 protein, a partially labile profilin, or a relatively heat-stable lipid transfer protein. Diagnostic testing is variable based on the underlying food tested, but fresh food skin prick test typically has the highest sensitivity. Treatment centers on avoidance and the consideration of self-injectable epinephrine. Because of its relationship with a cross-reactive aeroallergen sensitization, subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy have also been therapeutically tried with mixed results.

Conclusion

OAS is a challenging diagnosis to the practicing allergist because of its many clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations. Understanding these challenges and their underlying mechanisms can facilitate a knowledgeable approach to treating an oral allergy patient.

Regarding specific circumstances for peanut allergy, more specifically with respect to patients with pollen-food syndrome, AAAAI/ACAAI 2014 guidelines recommend to consider diagnosing oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy) and obtaining specific IgE testing to pollens in patients experiencing limited oropharyngeal symptoms after ingestion of food antigens that cross-react with pollen antigens.

There was also no significant difference between the FPIES and NA groups with atopic stature and history of atopic diseases. FPIES is defined as a non–IgE-mediated food allergy. In contrast, "atypical FPIES" has long been known and defined on the basis of the international guidelines; it leads to food-specific IgE positivity but presents only delayed gastrointestinal symptoms for specific food without immediate-type symptoms of allergy. A population-based study revealed that the rate of comorbid IgE-mediated food allergy was higher in patients with FPIES than in those without FPIES. Of the patients tested in our study, 3 of 20 (15%) were positive for specific IgE, but none showed IgE-mediated symptoms of allergy on OFC. The sensitized patients in the NA group also showed no IgE-mediated symptoms on OFC. There were no clinical differences due to the sensitization. Our data suggest that IgE sensitization and atopic background do not have predictive value for the diagnosis of FPIES.

### Anaphylactic shock due to kiwifruit [^113wi8gw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old male patient was admitted to our emergency department (ED) with an episode of severe anaphylaxis displaying generalized urticaria and dyspnea 1 hour after consuming a kiwifruit. Initially, the patient reported discrete itching of his abdominal skin and was in moderate respiratory distress. The patient's wheal response and itch were attenuated 30 minutes after emergency treatment with intravenous antianaphylaxis drugs. However, he had symptoms of the chest distress, dizzy, and dysphoria. His vital signs exacerbated. After sufficient antianaphylaxis treatment, the patient's anaphylaxis shock symptoms had not been significantly improved. We reviewed the history. The patient had eaten a full fresh kiwifruit, so there may be some kiwifruit pulp left in the patient's stomach. After self-induced vomiting, the patient's clinical condition gradually improved without any changes in dosage of dopamine. After another 10 hours of observation and preventive therapy training, the patient was discharged. Cases of patients with anaphylactic reaction to kiwifruit and dragon fruit have not been reported yet. In the ED, it is easy to overlook the prolonged exposure to allergen in patients with oral allergy syndrome. If the patient has consumed much food or drugs to cause the allergic reaction, self-induced vomiting or gastric lavage to clean allergen may be useful.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular IgE test methods have substantially advanced allergy diagnostics. Continuous evaluation of patients' sensitization profiles contribute to our mechanistic understanding of allergies and the characterization of major allergens. Molecular IgE tests are an essential support for decision making of allergy immunotherapy (AIT) for IgE‐mediated allergies and for choosing the right AIT preparation. In food allergy, identification of specific IgE (sIgE)‐sensitization pattern combined with the interpretation of the patients' history is essential for the management and guidance of patients. This information allows tailored recommendations regarding symptom severity based on the recognized allergen molecule.

As commonly recommended, determination of sIgE is performed after detailed recording of clinical history and skin prick test (SPT) with culprit food. If SPT is not possible, for example in patients with active atopic dermatitis, the "from molecules to clinic"‐concept is preferable. In multiplex testing, various allergens are tested simultaneously to provide clear sensitization profiles, which can predict potential reactions to foods, as well as possible cross‐reactivity to homolog molecules. Food allergy is associated with a multitude of different symptoms, including anaphylaxis. Especially patients with anaphylactic reactions experience a substantial health burden, due to the severity of reactions. These patients might particularly benefit from early diagnosis and correct recommendations regarding restrictive diet. Besides primary food allergy toward, for example, peanuts, tree nuts, and seafood, the pollen food syndrome (PFS) affects a large number of patients suffering from food adverse reactions due to cross‐reactivity with airborne allergens. The estimated worldwide prevalence of PFS is 9.4%–35%. The main clinical presentation is limited to local reactions in the oral cavity, such as itching and swelling of lips, oral mucosa, and tongue, in total known as the oral allergy syndrome (OAS), but reactions might also involve the gastrointestinal tract, and systemic symptoms may develop on skin, in the respiratory system, and in rare cases, the cardiovascular system, up to anaphylactic shock reactions. Thus, a comprehensive diagnostic work‐up of PFS patients is essential.PFS‐triggering allergens are mainly pan‐allergens. These molecules are characterized by recognition of cross‐reactive IgE due to amino‐acid overlaps and similarities of the three‐dimensional protein structure. Among the allergens found in a large variety of different allergen sources, pathogenesis related (PR)‐10 proteins and profilins found in most plants play a special role in PFS. Bet v 1 from birch is one of the best studied PR‐10 proteins and homologous proteins, such as Mal d 1 from apple are termed Bet v 1‐homologs. Ten to twenty percent of patients with pollen allergy show reactivity to profilins. The profilin in latex (Hev b 8) shows high homology to many other plant profilin proteins, such as Bet v 2 in birch and Cuc m 2 in melon. Thus, testing of Hev b 8‐sIgE can be used for diagnosis of profilin sensitization. Due to the high variability in the patients' sIgE repertoire, it is not possible to predict the cross‐reactivity pattern with food allergens from pollen allergy diagnosis. Therefore, multiplex testing might be specifically of benefit to PFS patients. Moreover, multiplex testing might also implement precision medicine in AIT, as the AIT preparation can be specifically chosen based on the allergen patterns recognized by the patient as tested by multiplex molecular IgE tests, given that information regarding the specific AIT composition is available. ImmunoCAP ISAC (ISAC) and Allergy Explorer, version 2 (ALEX 2), are two molecular tests used for determining sIgE levels. ISAC has been licensed for medical diagnostics in 2011. Most of the allergens are produced recombinantly and 38% of the allergens are purified, natural allergens. For control purpose, cross‐reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs)‐containing proteins are spotted on the chip. The ALEX 2 multiplex test was licensed in 2018. ALEX 2 not only determines total IgE reactivity, but also sIgE reactivity to allergen components and to allergen extracts. In regards to the source of allergen molecules, 77% of the allergens are recombinantly produced and 23% are natural allergens. During the sample preparation, IgE antibodies specific for CCDs are removed from the serum. The presence of whole food extracts and the high number of food proteins are an advantage of ALEX 2 when it comes to food allergy diagnosis.

### Outcomes of apple oral immunotherapy in pollen food allergy syndrome [^1119PXtv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Table I
Baseline characteristics of the apple OIT participants

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a study in which all participants tolerated a whole apple after OIT. On average, the end point was reached after 39 days, which is considerably sooner than the previously reported time of 140 to 240 days. This fact may be related to shorter intervals, as we doubled the quantity of apple every 3 to 7 days instead of every 2 to 3 weeks. Moreover, the patients were allowed to continue OIT if they experienced tingling sensations only; this more liberal approach may have prevented needless delay. In the case of 2 patients, it may be possible that their concurrent subcutaneous immunotherapy for birch pollen facilitated the OIT; however, 1 of the 2 had previously tried a different OIT regimen and aborted it when subcutaneous immunotherapy actually worsened her symptoms. Lastly, we speculate that the addition of yogurt facilitated OIT, presumably by reducing direct contact between the apple and oral mucosa. Alternatively, fermented dairy may positively influence the gut microbiome, although this is not likely to occur directly or at the study dosages. The a priori risk of anaphylaxis in PFAS is very low; we therefore consider it safe to perform OIT apple at home, provided that patients are selected carefully, clear instructions are given, and the dosage of apple is increased gradually. Our results are limited by the small patient numbers, the absence of a control group, the subjectivity of symptoms that is inherent to PFAS, and difficulties in standardizing the allergen dosage. Nonetheless, for all of the participants, there was an obvious increase in the tolerable amount of apple versus at baseline, reflecting a relevant clinical outcome for daily practice. Provided that apple was consumed regularly (we advised ≥ 3 apples per week), the induced tolerance was sustained and appeared to extend to other apple varieties and stone fruit. These findings suggest that tolerance could be extended to multiple Bet v1 homologues, and it is tempting to speculate that reintroduction of various fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts is feasible. Previous findings by Nothegger et al support this hypothesis. Because the majority of patients experience PFAS symptoms in response to multiple products and many of them experience considerable dietary restrictions affecting their quality of life, OIT may have the potential to improve the diet of patients with PFAS beyond apple reintroduction. Increasing variety in the daily diet by reintroducing various fruit and vegetables could facilitate maintaining tolerance to Bet v1 products in the long term.

Results

Food allergies

Nearly all patients (32/35; 91%) reported allergic reactions to plant foods, primarily to apple (30/35; 86%), stone fruits (26/35; 74%), hazelnut (25/35; 71%) and kiwifruit (16/35; 46%; Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). All 32 patients reported OAS, while 15 patients had experienced additional symptoms affecting the respiratory system in eight patients, the gastrointestinal tract in six, the eyes in four and the skin in four patients. Three patients reported anaphylaxis to walnut, soya milk and carrot, respectively. The nine patients who had undergone birch IT showed a similar spectrum of food allergies as the untreated patients (data not shown).

### Prevalence and severity of food allergies among US adults [^115TSdYM]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measures for the study were the prevalence and severity of overall and food-specific convincing adult food allergy. Food allergies were considered to be convincing if the most severe reaction reported to that food included at least 1 symptom on the stringent symptom list developed by our expert panel (eFigure in the Supplement). Reported allergies with reaction symptoms characteristic of oral allergy syndrome or food intolerances were excluded and not considered to be convincing according to the food allergy categorization flowchart summarized in Figure 1, even if such allergies were reported as diagnosed by a physician. Only convincing food allergies for which a physician's diagnosis was reported were considered to be physician diagnosed for the purposes of our study. For each convincing allergy, a severe reaction history was indicated by reporting 1 or more stringent symptoms across 2 or more of the following organ systems: skin or oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular, and respiratory tract.

Figure 1.
Convincing, Physician-Diagnosed, and Severe Food Allergy (FA) Categorization Flow Diagram

Stringent symptoms by organ system include skin or oral mucosa (hives, swelling [except lip or tongue], lip or tongue swelling, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening), respiratory tract (chest tightening, trouble breathing, wheezing), gastrointestinal tract (vomiting), and cardiovascular (chest pain, rapid heartbeat, fainting, low blood pressure). Gastrointestinal symptoms commonly associated with intolerance (eg, diarrhea, cramps) were not considered to be stringent symptoms. The following allergies were considered for exclusion as probable oral allergy syndrome (OAS) based on symptom report: fruit, vegetable, peanut, tree nut, wheat, soy, barley, rice, seed, spice, shellfish, and fin fish.
