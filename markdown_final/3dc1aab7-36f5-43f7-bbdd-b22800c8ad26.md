## Question

is culture and sensitivity mandatory for HAP?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether culture and sensitivity testing is mandatory for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and how to reconcile this with guideline language and clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between HAP and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) because recommendations differ. Then, I should verify what the 2016 IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guidelines actually say about obtaining cultures. Next, I will examine whether "mandatory" is the right word or if the guidance is a strong recommendation. After that, I should review the rationale for obtaining cultures, including stewardship and de-escalation. Finally, I will consider practical nuances, specimen types, and how to phrase the answer clinically and accurately.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. HAP is pneumonia occurring 48 hours or more after hospital admission in non-ventilated patients, whereas VAP is a subset of HAP occurring in mechanically ventilated patients; the diagnostic and microbiologic strategies overlap but are not identical, and guidelines often address them together while noting differences in sampling approaches and thresholds [^115jfefU] [^1127Gthz].

> Wait, let me verify the exact language in the guidelines before concluding anything about "mandatory". The 2016 IDSA/ATS guideline states that because of multidrug-resistant (MDR) risk and the consequences of ineffective initial therapy, experts believe that cultures of respiratory secretions should be obtained from virtually all patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the panel agreed; subsequent sections of the guideline presume cultures are obtained for all suspected VAP, which signals a strong standard of care for VAP but does not use the word "mandatory" [^111KWGxs]. For HAP specifically, the same guideline emphasizes early, appropriate empiric therapy and de-escalation based on culture results, again implying that cultures are expected to guide definitive therapy, though not explicitly labeled as "mandatory" in regulatory terms [^112yzFRx] [^116e7UWk].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any authoritative source uses "mandatory" language. I do not find a guideline that legally mandates cultures for HAP/VAP; instead, the guidance is framed as a strong recommendation for VAP and as a core stewardship principle for HAP, with explicit statements that definitive therapy for organisms like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ESBL-producing gram-negatives, and Acinetobacter should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, which functionally requires culture or equivalent testing to obtain susceptibilities [^112qicQZ] [^114S51Lq] [^114yRBon]. So, "mandatory" overstates the regulatory status, but "standard of care" and "strongly recommended" are accurate descriptors in guideline language and practice patterns [^111KWGxs].

> I need to check the rationale to ensure I'm not missing a counterargument. The main reasons to obtain cultures are threefold: first, to enable timely de-escalation from broad-spectrum empiric therapy and reduce adverse effects, C. difficile, and resistance; second, to identify MDR pathogens that alter initial coverage; and third, to support antimicrobial stewardship programs that rely on local antibiograms and culture-directed therapy adjustments [^112yzFRx] [^113rCWPj] [^111DxKKa]. Let me consider whether delaying empiric therapy to wait for cultures is acceptable; the answer is no — early appropriate therapy improves outcomes, so cultures should be obtained promptly but treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results, with subsequent narrowing once susceptibilities return [^112uWJRh] [^112yzFRx].

> Next, I should review specimen strategy and thresholds so I don't overgeneralize. For VAP, noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative endotracheal aspirate cultures is preferred over invasive quantitative cultures in most settings, though invasive quantitative BAL or PSB can be used where available; if invasive quantitative cultures are below diagnostic thresholds, guidelines suggest withholding antibiotics when clinically safe, underscoring how culture results directly inform stewardship decisions [^115jfefU] [^1127Gthz] [^114v6zoX]. For HAP in non-ventilated patients, expectorated sputum or induced specimens are commonly obtained; preanalytical quality matters, and samples should be processed promptly to preserve yield, ideally within 2 hours at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated [^1126tFJn] [^114UnHqG].

> But wait, what if cultures are unobtainable or the patient is too unstable for invasive sampling? I should double-check the guidance on that. Even when cultures are unobtainable, empiric therapy is still indicated based on local epidemiology and risk factors, with efforts to obtain microbiologic data as soon as feasible; importantly, definitive therapy for confirmed HAP/VAP due to high-risk organisms should still be tailored to susceptibilities once available, reinforcing that culture and susceptibility testing are integral to best practice even if not literally "mandated" by law [^112qicQZ] [^116e7UWk].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Culture and sensitivity testing are not legally mandatory for HAP, but they are strongly recommended as standard of care, particularly for VAP where the guideline panel states cultures should be obtained from virtually all suspected cases; for HAP, cultures are expected to guide de-escalation and definitive therapy, and definitive treatment for key pathogens should be based on susceptibility results, which functionally necessitates culture or equivalent testing in routine practice [^111KWGxs] [^112qicQZ] [^114S51Lq]. Therefore, the clinically accurate answer is that cultures are not "mandatory" in a regulatory sense, but they are a core component of evidence-based care and antimicrobial stewardship for HAP and VAP, and clinicians should obtain them whenever feasible without delaying empiric therapy [^111KWGxs] [^112uWJRh].

Culture and sensitivity testing is **not universally mandatory** for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [^111oWdP5] [^111KWGxs], but it is **strongly recommended** in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and in HAP with risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens or severe disease. Early empiric therapy should **not be delayed** while awaiting cultures; obtain samples promptly and tailor therapy to culture results to enable de-escalation and improve outcomes [^1119yGN8] [^113suXPU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) provide clear recommendations on the role of culture and sensitivity testing in HAP:

- **Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)**: The IDSA/ATS guidelines strongly recommend obtaining respiratory secretions for culture and sensitivity testing in all patients with suspected VAP [^111KWGxs]. This is because VAP is associated with high mortality and significant morbidity, and early identification of causative pathogens is critical for effective management [^116BgErf].

- **Non-ventilator HAP**: For patients with non-ventilator HAP, the guidelines recommend obtaining respiratory secretions for culture and sensitivity testing, particularly in cases with severe disease, immunocompromised hosts, or when there is a high suspicion of MDR pathogens [^notfound].

- **Empiric therapy**: The guidelines emphasize that empiric antibiotic therapy should not be delayed while awaiting culture results. Early initiation of appropriate empiric therapy is crucial to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with HAP [^1119yGN8].

---

## Clinical scenarios where culture and sensitivity testing is essential

While culture and sensitivity testing is not universally mandatory for all HAP cases, certain clinical scenarios **warrant its essential use**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for culture and sensitivity testing** |
|-|-|
| Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) | - High mortality and morbidity <br/> - Need for early pathogen identification and targeted therapy [^111KWGxs] |
| Severe HAP (e.g. ICU admission, septic shock) | - High risk of MDR pathogens <br/> - Need for accurate pathogen identification and susceptibility testing [^1119yGN8] |
| Immunocompromised patients | - Increased risk of unusual pathogens <br/> - Need for targeted therapy [^113LDDPj] |
| Failure of initial empiric therapy | - Need to identify causative pathogen and adjust therapy accordingly [^116NYTVY] |
| Outbreaks or clusters of HAP cases | - Need to identify causative pathogens and implement infection control measures [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where culture and sensitivity testing may be deferred

In certain clinical scenarios, culture and sensitivity testing may be deferred or considered optional:

- **Mild cases of HAP**: In patients with mild disease, no risk factors for MDR pathogens, and a stable clinical condition, routine culture and sensitivity testing may be deferred [^notfound].

- **Resource-limited settings**: In settings with limited laboratory resources, clinical judgment and local epidemiology may guide empiric therapy without routine culture and sensitivity testing [^notfound].

---

## Impact of culture and sensitivity testing on clinical outcomes

Culture and sensitivity testing significantly impacts clinical outcomes in HAP:

- **Targeted therapy**: Enables de-escalation of antibiotics, reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions, and healthcare costs [^1119yGN8].

- **Improved outcomes**: Early identification of causative pathogens and targeted therapy have been associated with improved clinical outcomes, including reduced mortality and shorter hospital stay [^116GR8Qb].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Facilitates appropriate antibiotic use, reducing the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms [^111a5rf5].

---

## Limitations and challenges of culture and sensitivity testing

Despite its benefits, culture and sensitivity testing has several limitations and challenges:

- **Delay in results**: Culture results typically take 48–72 hours, which may delay definitive therapy adjustments [^111KDRCU].

- **False negatives**: Prior antibiotic exposure or inadequate sampling may result in false-negative cultures [^113suXPU].

- **Resource-intensive**: Requires laboratory infrastructure, trained personnel, and appropriate specimen collection methods [^114UnHqG].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

Recent advances have introduced alternative diagnostic methods, such as molecular testing and rapid syndromic panels, which offer faster pathogen identification and susceptibility testing. However, these methods are **not yet universally available** or standardized and should be used in conjunction with traditional culture methods [^113LDDPj] [^111KDRCU].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Culture and sensitivity testing is **not universally mandatory** for all HAP cases, but it is strongly recommended in specific clinical scenarios — particularly in VAP, severe HAP, immunocompromised patients, and cases of treatment failure. Early empiric therapy should not be delayed while awaiting culture results; obtain samples promptly and tailor therapy to culture findings to enable de-escalation and improve outcomes.

### Development and assessment of objective surveillance definitions for nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia [^113egK87]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The inclusion of antibiotic prescription criteria in the candidate definitions is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength because it gives credence to clinicians' impressions and limits detection to events that clinicians deemed serious and certain enough to warrant a sustained course of antibiotics. It is a weakness because clinicians vary in their predilection to diagnose and treat pneumonia, antibiotics may be administered for something other than pneumonia, overuse of antibiotics to treat possible pneumonia is common, and previous studies suggest that clinical impressions correlate poorly with biopsy or autopsy. The worsening oxygenation requirement, in contrast, likely adds some specificity to the definition, given that pulmonary impairment is a sine qua non for clinically meaningful pneumonia.,

This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted in 4 hospitals from a single region in the United States. Although the findings were similar across all study hospitals and matched independent estimates by other investigators, the results may differ in other clinical settings with distinct patient populations and clinical practice patterns. Second, the estimates of potential excess time to discharge and mortality rate may be biased by residual confounding, despite adjusting for a wide array of demographic and clinical factors. Third, we assessed only the association between surveillance definitions and clinically diagnosed pneumonia in patients with worsening oxygenation. This approach may have led to an overestimation of sensitivity. The accuracy and meaningfulness of clinically diagnosed pneumonia are questionable, however, in patients on ambient air with oxygen saturations consistently above 95%. Similarly, we reviewed only a small number of medical records, and thus the estimates of clinical correlates have wide confidence intervals. Fourth, the proposed candidate surveillance definitions are amenable for implementation only in hospital systems with comprehensive EHRs that include vital signs, demographics, antibiotic administrations, radiographic procedures, clinical cultures, and laboratory values as well as analytic support to extract and analyze these data. Disseminating this surveillance strategy will likely require sharing common data specifications and analytic code with hospitals and/or incorporating these definitions into commercial infection surveillance software systems.

### The importance of cultural sensitivity in providing effective care for… [^116CqVD3]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The enhanced CLAS standards list the following elements of culture, acknowledging that culture is not limited to the following: Cultural sensitivity is an essential element for patient safety and adherence. The National Center for Culture Competence provides six reasons for the implementation of cultural sensitivity: These six reasons touch upon two overarching and intertwined themes: social justice and good business practice. Cultural sensitivity, with its expected outcome, health equity, is not simply the "right thing to do. " In today's era of accountable care and emphasis on improving care and controlling cost, cultural proficiency is a "must do. " Cultural sensitivity potentially can save both lives and money.

The AAFP endorses the document, National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Heath Care: A Blueprint for Advancing and Sustaining CLAS Policy and Practice, from the Office of Minority Health, US Department of Health and Human Services, April 2013. The Blueprint. describes 15 distinct standards that are organized around 3 themes: Theme 1: Governance, Leadership and Workforce Theme 2: Communication and Language Assistance Theme 3: Engagement, Continuous Improvement and Accountability The Principal Standard of the Blueprint is, "To provide effective, equitable, understandable and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy and other communication needs. " This standard frames the essential goal of the remaining 14 standards and aligns with AAFP's vision "to transform healthcare to achieve optimal health for everyone".

Organizations must comply with requirements such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and other relevant federal, state and local requirements. Written materials and signage should be easy to understand and translatable. Engagement, Continuous Improvement and Accountability With its vision "to transform health care to achieve optimal health for everyone", AAFP integrates cultural sensitivity in advocacy, policy-making and governance. AAFP promotes cultural sensitivity training of its members and their staff by providing enduring, updated materials and resources in multiple venues. Summary AAFP supports the broad adoption of cultural sensitivity standards by government, payers, health care organizations, practices and individuals. When cultural sensitivity is an expected standard in health care delivery, "optimal health for everyone" means every one.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with invasive quantitative cultures below diagnostic thresholds — The evidence indicates that patients whose antibiotics are withheld on the basis of an invasive quantitative culture below the diagnostic threshold for VAP have similar clinical outcomes, less antibiotic use, and better microbiologic outcomes compared to those whose antibiotics are continued, but the panel's confidence in these effects was very low due to observational study design, imprecision, and high risk of bias. Antibiotic discontinuation in patients with suspected VAP whose invasive quantitative culture results are below the diagnostic threshold for VAP may be beneficial because it decreases unnecessary antibiotic use and improves microbiological outcomes; while there is no evidence that this approach worsens clinical outcomes, in theory it could result in withdrawal of antibiotics from some patients if quantitative culture results are misleadingly low due to sampling error or prior antibiotic exposure.

### Blood cultures for community-acquired pneumonia: are they worthy of two quality measures? A systematic review [^112VADfJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Obtaining blood cultures (BCs) for patients hospitalized with community-acquired-pneumonia (CAP) has been recommended by experts and used as a measure of quality of care. However, BCs are infrequently positive in these patients and their effect on clinical management has been questioned.

Purpose

We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the impact of BCs on clinical management in CAP requiring hospitalization and thus its appropriateness as a quality measure.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and the Cochrane databases for English-language studies that reported the effect of BCs on management of adults hospitalized with CAP. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and background articles and asked experts to review our list for completeness.

Study Selection

Studies were chosen if they included adults admitted to the hospital with CAP, BCs were obtained at admission, and BC-directed management changes were reported.

Data Extraction

We abstracted study design, BC positivity, and frequency of BC-directed management changes.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies, all with observational cohort design, were identified and reviewed. Two included only patients with BCs positive for pneumococcus, yielding 13 studies for the primary analysis. BCs were true-positive in 0% to 14% of cases. They led to antibiotic narrowing in 0% to 3% of patients and to antibiotic broadening ultimately associated with a resistant organism in 0% to 1% of patients.

Conclusions

BCs have very limited utility in immunocompetent patients hospitalized with CAP. Pneumonia quality measures that include BCs should be reassessed.

### Diagnostic test for etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia [^112M6oGH]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests for the detection of the etiologic agent of pneumonia are neither recommended nor done for most outpatients with CAP (Table 4). Most of these patients have no clear diagnosis but seem to do well with empiric antibiotic treatment, which often costs less than the diagnostic tests. For hospitalized patients, a pre-treatment blood culture and an expectorated sputum gram stain and culture should be done. Testing for Legionella spp is appropriate in hospitalized patients, especially those who are seriously ill. New tests that merit use in selected patients are the urinary antigen assay for S pneumoniae and the PCR test for L pneumophila. Anticipated developments in the near future are PCR tests for detection of C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae.

Determining etiology of HAP and VAP — Because of MDR risk and consequences of ineffective initial therapy, experts believe that cultures of respiratory secretions should be obtained from virtually all patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a practice with which the panel agreed; subsequent sections presume cultures are obtained for all suspected VAP. Evidence supporting blood cultures in VAP is limited, but approximately 15% of VAP patients are bacteremic and bacteremic VAP has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality than nonbacteremic VAP.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^114b2STY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric Staphylococcus aureus coverage and MRSA risk factors: The panel recommend that all empiric regimens include an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus, and the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Although 10% (95% CI 6%–14%) of HAP cases are attributable to MRSA, this was insufficient justification to target MRSA in all HAP patients. Factors that probably increase MRSA risk include prior known MRSA colonization detected via nasal or respiratory cultures or nonculture screening, a high-quality Gram stain showing numerous and predominant gram-positive cocci in clusters, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant or the prevalence is not known (with the 20% threshold arbitrarily chosen), and intravenous antibiotic treatment during the prior 90 days. When MRSA coverage is chosen, the guideline panel prefers vancomycin or linezolid, noting similar clinical outcomes and that final choice rests on blood cell counts, concurrent prescriptions for serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, renal function, and cost.

Infection of the lower respiratory tract is a potentially severe or life-threatening illness. Taking the right steps to recognize, identify, and treat pneumonia is critical to improving patient outcomes. An awareness of the diversity of potential infectious causes, the local endemic flora and resistance patterns, as well as testing strategies to differentiate causes of pneumonia is essential to providing the best patient outcomes. Understanding surveillance definitions allow intensivists to become partners in reducing hospital-associated infections and improving quality of care.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric regimen selection — local resistance data: We recommend that all hospitals regularly generate and disseminate a local antibiogram, ideally tailored to their HAP population, and we recommend basing empiric antibiotic regimens on the local distribution of HAP pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities; the frequency of updating should be determined by the institution considering rate of change, resources, and available data.

Respiratory specimen handling for suspected pneumonia — timeliness and sampling method: Lower respiratory (eg, BAL, mini-BAL, brush, wash, ETA) and sputum samples should be processed within 2 hours if kept at room temperature and within 24 hours if kept at 4 degrees Celsius, and for these reasons, noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures is the microbiological sampling technique recommended by the panel.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115WEwym]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

### Diagnostics for community-acquired and atypical pneumonia [^113qj48h]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

After decades of neglect, the importance of establishing an aetiological diagnosis for community-acquired and atypical pneumonias has increased dramatically in recent years — driven by the movement towards more rational use of antibiotics, the further spread of antimicrobial resistance, and advances in point-of-care assays that circumvent the diagnostic delays that result from the centralization of laboratories.

Recent Findings

There have been very few developments in patient sampling, or the direct visualization, culture, and serological detection of respiratory pathogens. There has, however, been significant interest in the development of improved and more clinically useful assays for the detection of pathogen nucleic acids and proteins, and also in the potential utility of the assessment of host response for tailoring therapy.

Summary

The majority of patients have yet to benefit from any advances. However, nucleic acid, newer protein, and possibly host-response assays have significant potential to influence patient care in the near future.

### Are quantitative cultures useful in the diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia? [^113suXPU]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Noninvasive and invasive tests have been developed and studied for their utility in diagnosing and guiding the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, a condition with an inherently high mortality. Early empiric antibiotic treatment has been shown to reduce mortality, so delaying this treatment until test results are available is not justifiable. Furthermore, tailoring therapy based on results of either noninvasive or invasive tests has not been clearly shown to affect morbidity and mortality. This may be related to quantitative limitations of these tests or possibly to a high false-negative rate in patients who receive early antibiotic treatment and may therefore have suppressed bacterial counts. Results of these tests, however, do influence treatment. It is therefore hoped that they may ultimately provide a rational basis for making therapeutic decisions. In the future, outcomes research should be a part of large-scale clinical trials, and noninvasive and invasive tests should be incorporated into the design in an attempt to provide a better understanding of the value of such tests.

Acinetobacter species HAP/VAP — treatment recommendations are: "In patients with HAP/VAP caused by Acinetobacter species, we suggest treatment with either a carbapenem or ampicillin/sulbactam if the isolate is susceptible to these agents (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)". For isolates "that is sensitive only to polymyxins, we recommend intravenous polymyxin (colistin or polymyxin B) (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we suggest adjunctive inhaled colistin (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)". For isolates "that is sensitive only to colistin, we suggest NOT using adjunctive rifampicin (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)". Additionally, "we recommend against the use of tigecycline (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)". Values and preferences: "These recommendations place a relatively higher value on avoiding potential adverse effects due to the use of combination therapy with rifampicin and colistin, over achieving an increased microbial eradication rate, as eradication rate was not associated with improved clinical outcome". Remarks: "Selection of an appropriate antibiotic for definitive (nonempiric) therapy requires antimicrobial susceptibility testing".

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of a urine-based pneumococcal antigen test for diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [^112dGRcf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Standard culture methods for diagnosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia take at least 24 h. The BinaxNOW urine-based test for S. pneumoniae (BinaxNOW-SP) takes only 15 min to conduct, potentially enabling earlier diagnosis and targeted treatment. This study was conducted to assess whether the use of BinaxNOW-SP at the time of hospital admission would provide adequate sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE/OVID, Cochrane Collaboration, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, INAHTA, and CADTH for diagnostic or etiologic studies of hospitalized predominately adult patients with clinically defined CAP that reported the diagnostic performance of BinaxNOW-SP versus cultures. Two authors independently extracted study details and diagnostic two-by-two tables. We found that 27 studies met our inclusion criteria, and three different reference standards were used between them. A bivariate meta-analysis of 12 studies using a composite of culture tests as the reference standard estimated the sensitivity of BinaxNOW-SP as 68.5% (95% credibility interval [CrI], 62.6% to 74.2%) and specificity as 84.2% (95% CrI, 77.5% to 89.3%). A meta-analysis of all 27 studies, adjusting for the imperfect and variable nature of the reference standard, gave a higher sensitivity of 74.0% (CrI, 66.6% to 82·3%) and specificity of 97.2% (CrI, 92.7% to 99.8%). The analysis showed substantial heterogeneity across studies, which did not decrease with adjustment for covariates. We concluded that the higher pooled sensitivity (compared to culture) and high specificity of BinaxNOW-SP suggest it would be a useful addition to the diagnostic workup for community-acquired pneumonia. More research is needed regarding the impact of BinaxNOW-SP on clinical practice.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) adults — Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions at diagnosis: We recommend not obtaining sputum Gram stain and culture routinely in adults with CAP managed in the outpatient setting (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend obtaining pretreatment Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting who are classified as severe CAP, especially if they are intubated (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); are being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); were previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially those with prior respiratory tract infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence); or were hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples to reduce antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised trial [^112qnVB9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and one of the leading drivers of antibiotic use in hospitalised patients. However, in many cases, the causative agent is not identified and patients are overtreated with antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics is a major cause of antimicrobial resistance and increases the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection and other antibiotic-related adverse events. Antibacterial resistance is accelerating at an alarming pace and is raising morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. In this scenario, antimicrobial stewardship is recognised as a crucial component in strategies to deal with the threat of antibiotic resistance.

The development of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in automated platforms currently allows rapid screening of non-invasive respiratory specimens, such as sputum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs, for a wide array of respiratory pathogens. Several observational studies have found that comprehensive molecular testing significantly improved pathogen detection in CAP, particularly in antimicrobial-exposed patients. Two recent studies investigating the efficacy of multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples for antimicrobial stewardship in CAP have yielded conflicting findings.

Current guidelines for CAP do not incorporate multiplex PCR pneumonia panels into their recommendations for initial microbiological diagnostic testing. Furthermore, the guidance regarding conventional microbiological testing methods like sputum culture, blood cultures, and urinary antigen tests lacks consistency and is predominantly grounded in low or very low-quality evidence.

We conducted a randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that multiplex real-time PCR in non-invasive respiratory samples plus conventional microbiological testing is safe and more effective than conventional microbiological testing alone for reducing antibiotic use in hospitalised patients with CAP.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia — laboratory diagnosis (immunocompetent host) details specimen types and transport conditions by pathogen group. For Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA, optimum specimens include blood cultures and sputum with transport described as "Routine blood culture bottles, RT < 24 h" and "Sterile cup or tube RT, 2 h; 4°C, > 2–24 h". Mixed anaerobes (aspiration) use protected specimen brush samples or lung tissue with transport "Sterile tube with 1 mL of thioglycolate (for brush samples); Sterile container for tissue; RT, 2 h; 4°C, > 2–24 h", and a footnote cautions that "Anaerobic culture should only be done if the specimen has been obtained via a protected specimen brush or catheter and transported in an anaerobic transport container or by placing the brush in 1 mL of pre-reduced broth prior to transport". Streptococcus pneumoniae includes "As above plus urine antigen" with urine as the specimen and footnote performance of the urinary antigen test stating "Sensitivity in non-bacteremic patients with pneumococcal pneumonia is 64%–78%; sensitivity in bacteremic cases of pneumococcal pneumonia is 80%–86%; specificity in adults is > 90%". Legionella spp. testing lists "Culture on BCYE media", "NAAT", and "Urine antigen (L. pneumophila serogroup 1 only)", with urine transport "Sterile container RT, < 24 h; 4°C > 24 h–14 d". Fungal testing for Aspergillus spp. includes "Galactomannan", and serum transport is "Clot tube 4°C, ≤ 5 d; −70°C".

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) microbiology testing scope and evidence gaps after lung transplantation — There is no current consensus or data regarding the appropriate microbiologic studies to perform on BAL collected routinely after LTx. Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines support quantitative cultures of invasively obtained samples in the setting of suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, but although quantitative culture of BAL in other settings and populations may be reasonable, the culture thresholds defining pneumonia and/or necessity to treat are not established. PCR-based detection methods are becoming increasingly available, and further studies will be needed to establish their use for infection assessment in LTx patients; endemic infections and pandemic or local epidemic outbreaks of respiratory pathogens may warrant additional specific testing.

### What is ventilator-associated pneumonia and why is it important? [^116BgErf]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common infections acquired among hospitalized patients. HAP is associated with excess mortality and increased medical care costs. The rise in HAP due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria has resulted in more common administration of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, with an associated increased risk of hospital mortality. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) refers to HAP occurring in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. VAP is the most common nosocomial infection among patients with acute respiratory failure. Physicians treating patients with HAP and VAP should be aware of the predominant local pathogens associated with these infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. This will allow more appropriate initial antibiotic selection in order to optimize treatment regimens and clinical outcomes. Additionally, clinical strategies aimed at the prevention of HAP and VAP should be employed in all hospital settings caring for patients at risk for these infections.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bxj19]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for skin and soft tissue infections… [^114Tc8zL]. publications.aap.org (2015). Low credibility.

These guidelines were developed to update the 2005 guidelines and to agree with the 2011 IDSA clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children. 2 The focus is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of SSTIs ranging from minor superficial to deep life-threatening infections. Two management algorithms and a table of antimicrobials for staphylococcal and streptococcal SSTIs are provided. 3 The results of a small study suggest that the practice of packing the wound with gauze caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to a sterile gauze covering.

4 Culture and sensitivity and empiric systemic antibiotics directed against S aureus are added when purulent SSTIs are associated with systemic signs of infection, including temperature > 38°C or < 36°C, tachycardia, tachypnea, or white blood cell count > 12, 000 or < 400 cells/μL. Systemic antibiotics should also be considered in the settings of multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to I & D alone. An antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for immunocompromised hosts and those with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Once C & S results return, antibiotics should be tailored to the identified bacteria and sensitivity patterns. Algorithm 2 illustrates the management and treatment of surgical site infections. During the first 48 hours after surgery, SSIs are rare, and those that occur are almost always due to Streptococcus pyogenes or Clostridium species. Beyond 48 hours, fever may be due to wound infection or other causes.

Other sources of fever should be sought if the wound appears normal. Superficial incisional SSIs are managed with drainage alone. Deep SSIs associated with systemic signs of infection require I & D and systemic antibiotics based on the site of surgery and C & S results. Familiarity with these clinical practice guidelines is important for all physicians who care for children because of the increased frequency and severity of SSTIs, as well as emerging resistance to microbial agents. 1 A link.

### Management of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis… [^113ErsKJ]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Testing Throat culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Under ideal conditions, the sensitivity of throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci is 90 percent; in office settings, the sensitivity ranges from 29 to 90 percent. The specificity of throat culture is 99 percent under ideal conditions and can be anywhere from 76 to 99 percent in office settings. 5 According to the American Academy of Pediatrics 4 and the American Heart Association, 7 a positive rapid antigen detection test may be considered definitive evidence for treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. A confirmatory throat culture should follow a negative rapid antigen detection test when the diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection is strongly suspected. 4, 7.

Investigators in one recent study 8 recommended that cost-conscious physicians use well-validated prediction rules to help them make better use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures. Clinical prediction rules take into account key elements of a patient's history and physical examination and allow physicians to predict the probability of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. 9 most likely because of changes in nutrition, decreased crowding, alterations in the pathogen's immune-stimulating potential, improved access to medical care and the introduction of effective antibiotics. However, important outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever in the late 1980s raised concern that virulent serotypes were on the rise. 9, 10 The reported annual incidence of acute rheumatic fever is now approximately one case per 1 million population.
8. Close Contacts During epidemics, 50 percent of the siblings and 20 percent of the parents of infected children develop streptococcal pharyngitis.

14 Asymptomatic contacts do not require cultures or prophylaxis. Symptomatic contacts may be treated with or without cultures. Follow-up and Carriers Routine post-treatment throat cultures are not necessary. About 5 to 12 percent of treated patients have a positive post-treatment culture, regardless of the therapy given. 27 A positive post-treatment culture represents the asymptomatic chronic carrier state, and carriers are not a significant source for the spread of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Furthermore, they are not at risk of developing rheumatic fever. 14 In general, asymptomatic carriers are not treated unless they are associated with treatment failure in a close-contact index patient.

### Recommendations for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: review of recent international guidelines [^1119yGN8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

Introduction

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are the most common healthcare-associated infections in adults and are the leading causes of death in critical care. HAP and VAP are associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, hospitalization, and increased healthcare cost. They are thus associated with an excess of morbidity and mortality. HAP and VAP may be caused by a wide variety of pathogens and can be polymicrobial. Moreover, multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacilli, are increasingly frequently isolated in HAP and VAP and are associated with mortality rates over 50%. Early appropriate antibiotic therapy undoubtedly reduces morbidity and mortality of HAP and VAP, but these infections are responsible for up to half of the consumption of antibiotics in ICU. Therefore, international guidelines advocate the empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics including carbapenems in the treatment of VAP caused by Gram-negative bacilli in the case of prior antibiotic therapy, in patients colonized by multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR), or in any late-onset VAP (more than 5 days after the beginning of mechanical ventilation). Usually, the time between respiratory sampling and the definitive microbiological results including antibiotic susceptibility testing is at least 48 h, during which time treatment is empirical. However, even very short exposure (1 to 3 days) to carbapenem is associated with a 5-fold higher risk of emergence of imipenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of ICU patients. Intensivists are thus confronted with a permanent dilemma between the initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy and the risk of increasing MDR bacteria by the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Results: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Hospital-acquired pneumonia: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^113T6AKg]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common causes of nosocomial infection, morbidity, and mortality in hospitalized patients. Many patient- and disease-specific factors contribute to the pathophysiology of HAP, particularly in the surgical population. Risk-factor modification and inpatient prevention strategies can have a significant impact on the incidence of HAP. While the best diagnostic strategy remains a subject of some debate, prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy in patients suspected of having HAP has been shown to significantly decrease mortality. Because the pathogens responsible for HAP are frequently more virulent and have greater resistance to commonly used antimicrobials than other pathogens, clinicians must have knowledge of the resistance patterns at their institutions to choose appropriate therapy.

Pneumonia is one of the most common infectious reasons for hospital admission, but current standard-of-care pneumonia diagnostics leave much to be desired. In a population-based survey of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults in the United States, only 38% had a pathogen identified despite exhaustive clinical testing with culture, multiplex PCR, and urinary antigens. This diagnostic gap leads to the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotic agents, contributing to the ever-increasing global burden of antimicrobial resistance, which is outpacing novel antimicrobial agent development and cited by the World Health Organization as one of the top 10 global threats facing humanity. Furthermore, as the number of immunocompromised patients steadily increases, so does the risk of infection with unusual pathogens often missed by standard microbiologic testing, resulting in delayed or missed diagnoses in our most vulnerable patients. There is an urgent need for new respiratory diagnostics that are less biased and more sensitive and provide rapid results.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — antibiotic strategy guidance: For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who are not in septic shock or at a high risk for death, and for whom the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we recommend monotherapy using an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible rather than combination therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we suggest combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible rather than monotherapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). High risk of death in the meta-regression analysis was defined as mortality risk > 25%; low risk of death is defined as mortality risk < 15%.

### Qualitative cultures in ventilator-associated pneumonia-can they be used with confidence? [^112yiuKx]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic and clinical evidence used to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia vary depending on the number of clinical criteria present. Bacteriological confirmation that rules out other diseases can be achieved by quantitative or qualitative cultures of tracheal aspirate. The rate of tracheal colonization in ventilated patients reduces the usefulness of qualitative cultures, but the absence of multiresistant micro-organisms in cultures from patients on prior antibiotics or a sterile culture in patients without prior antimicrobials may provide sufficient justification to stop or de-escalate antibiotics. However, more accurate guidance regarding whether antibiotics are unnecessary and should be stopped is provided by quantitative culture.

Purpose Of Review

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. New evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of these entities were released by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society in 2016. This review summarizes the recommendations contained within these guidelines and their supporting rationale.

Recent Findings

With respect to diagnosis of HAP and VAP, the guidelines suggest using semiquantitative cultures of noninvasively obtained respiratory samples instead of quantitative cultures of invasively obtained samples. With respect to antibiotic treatment, the guidelines separate the treatment approach for VAP and HAP (non-VAP), and stress the importance of devising an appropriate empiric regimen based on an appropriate hospital or unit-specific antibiogram. For VAP, coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is recommended only when patients have specific risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens or in units where greater than 10–20% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates are methicillin resistant. Single coverage for MDR gram-negative pathogens can be used in many HAP and VAP patients without risk factors for MDR pathogens when the antibiogram demonstrates that at least 90% of gram negatives are sensitive to the agent being considered for monotherapy. A 7-day course of antibiotics was recommended for most patients, including those with glucose nonfermenting gram-negative organisms.

Summary

New guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP contain several novel recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of these entities.

### Value of lower respiratory tract surveillance cultures to predict bacterial pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia: systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis [^114RdQ14]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

In ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), early appropriate antimicrobial therapy may be hampered by involvement of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.

Methods

A systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis were performed to analyse whether lower respiratory tract surveillance cultures accurately predict the causative pathogens of subsequent VAP in adult patients. Selection and assessment of eligibility were performed by three investigators by mutual consideration. Of the 525 studies retrieved, 14 were eligible for inclusion (all in English; published since 1994), accounting for 791 VAP episodes. The following data were collected: study and population characteristics; in- and exclusion criteria; diagnostic criteria for VAP; microbiological workup of surveillance and diagnostic VAP cultures. Sub-analyses were conducted for VAP caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. MDR microorganisms, frequency of sampling, and consideration of all versus the most recent surveillance cultures.

Results

The meta-analysis showed a high accuracy of surveillance cultures, with pooled sensitivities up to 0.75 and specificities up to 0.92 in culture-positive VAP. The area under the curve (AUC) of the hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic curve demonstrates moderate accuracy (AUC: 0.90) in predicting multidrug resistance. A sampling frequency of > 2/week (sensitivity 0.79; specificity 0.96) and consideration of only the most recent surveillance culture (sensitivity 0.78; specificity 0.96) are associated with a higher accuracy of prediction.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence for the benefit of surveillance cultures in predicting MDR bacterial pathogens in VAP. However, clinical and statistical heterogeneity, limited samples sizes, and bias remain important limitations of this meta-analysis.

### Pulmonary infections in critical / intensive care-rapid diagnosis and optimizing antimicrobial usage [^114qBohp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diagnosis of pulmonary infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the critically ill patient remains a common and therapeutically challenging diagnosis with significant attributable morbidity, mortality, and cost. Current clinical approaches to surveillance, early detection and, conventional culture-based microbiology are inadequate for optimal targeted antibiotic treatment and stewardship. Efforts to enhance diagnosis of HAP and VAP and the impact of these novel approaches on rational antimicrobial selection and stewardship are the focus of recent studies reviewed here.

Recent Findings

Recent consensus guidelines for diagnosis and management of HAP and VAP are relatively silent on the potential role of novel rapid microbiological techniques and reply heavily on conventional culture strategies of noninvasively obtained (including endotracheal aspirate samples). Novel rapid microbiological diagnostics, including nucleic acid amplification, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy-based technologies are promising approaches for the future. Exhaled breath biomarkers, including measurement of VOC represent a future approach.

Summary

Further validation of novel diagnostic technology platforms will be required to evaluate their utility for enhancing diagnosis and guiding treatment of pulmonary infections in the critically ill. However, the integration of novel diagnostics for rapid microbial identification, resistance phenotyping, and antibiotic sensitivity testing into usual care practice could significantly transform the care of patients and potentially inform improved targeted antimicrobial selection, de-escalation, and stewardship.

### Guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw [^113wt7oq]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

The 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines for pneumonia introduced the new category of health-care-associated pneumonia, which increased the number of people to whom the guidelines for multidrug-resistant pathogens applied. Three fundamental issues inherent in the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia undermined the credibility of these guidelines and the applicability of their recommendations: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. The vulnerability is the extreme heterogeneity of the population of patients. The fatal flaw is the failure to accurately diagnose hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; inability to distinguish colonisation from infection in respiratory-tract cultures renders the guidelines inherently unstable. The pitfall is spiralling empiricism of antibiotic use for severely ill patients in whom infection might not be present. A vicious circle of antibiotic overuse leading to emergence of resistant microflora can become established, leading to unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum combination antibiotics and increased mortality. Controlled studies now show that administration of broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy can lead to increased mortality in uninfected patients. Proposed solutions include the use of individualised assessment of patients. Health-care-associated pneumonia should be broken down into several distinct subgroups so narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be used. Emphasis should be placed on defining the microbial cause of the pneumonia rather than reflex administration of empirical combination therapy.

### Practical comparison of the bioFire filmArray pneumonia panel to routine diagnostic methods and potential impact on antimicrobial stewardship in adult hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections [^116GR8Qb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Lower respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), are linked to significant morbidity and mortality. These infections can be caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal agents, depending on patient exposure and clinical risk factors. Bacterial pathogens associated with HAP and VAP, including, and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae, are often multidrug resistant. This includes carbapenemase-producing organisms, which have been independently associated with higher mortality rates following infection. Selected studies have identified a significant decrease in mortality for patients who receive prompt and effective antibiotic therapy to treat pneumonia. Based on these findings, broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy consisting of 2 or 3 agents is recommended for patients with symptoms consistent with HAP or VAP until definitive laboratory results are available to inform targeted and specific therapy. As a result, it is estimated that up to 50% of antibiotics used in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) are prescribed to treat these infections. An emphasis of the current American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for management of patients with HAP or VAP is to reduce exposure to broad-spectrum and unnecessary antibiotics by targeting therapy to treat the most likely pathogens based on patient risk factors and laboratory results.

Laboratory identification of a specific infectious etiology in patients with pneumonia has been associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality, presumably because it enables targeted effective therapy. Historically, quantitative and qualitative bacterial culture has been the primary approach for laboratory diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia. These methods are useful in establishing definitive antibiotic therapy; however, recovery of potential pathogens is variable due to antibiotic exposure prior to specimen collection, fastidious growth characteristics of some pathogens, or overgrowth of resident flora. These factors contribute to variable culture sensitivity and turnaround times of 48 h or more. Furthermore, additional specific culture or molecular tests are required to identify atypical bacteria or viral pathogens, and these tests may not be routinely ordered by clinicians. Combined, these shortcomings diminish the ability of current standard-of-care (SOC) methods to rapidly and accurately identify specific infectious etiologies and target antibiotic therapy for these infections.

### Predicting bacteremia in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^115gQ7pV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

It is recommended that blood cultures be performed on all patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. Questions regarding the cost-effectiveness of this practice have emerged. We used data on 13,043 Medicare patients hospitalized with pneumonia to determine predictors of bacteremia. Predictors included recent antibiotic treatment, liver disease, and three vital-sign and three laboratory abnormalities. Patients were stratified into three groups on the basis of the likelihood of bacteremia. We then created a decision support tool that recommends performing no blood cultures on patients with low likelihood of bacteremia, one blood culture on patients with moderate likelihood of bacteremia, and two blood cultures on patients with higher likelihood of bacteremia. This tool was then applied to a validation cohort of 12,771 patients with pneumonia. Use of the decision support tool would result in 38% fewer blood cultures being performed when compared with the standard practice of performing two blood cultures for each patient and identified 88 to 89% of patients with bacteremia. A simplified tool performed similarly overall but was less sensitive than was the first tool among pneumonia severity index Class V patients. These tools may allow clinicians to target patients with pneumonia in whom blood cultures are most likely to yield a pathogen.

### Diagnostic tests for agents of community-acquired pneumonia [^113ozgkH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Lower respiratory infections are the major cause of death due to infectious disease in the United States and worldwide. Most forms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are treatable, and there is consensus that the selection of antimicrobial agents is notably simplified if the pathogen is defined. The rich history of CAP studies in the prepenicillin era showed that an etiologic diagnosis was established in > 90% of cases, but the 2009 data from Medicare indicate that a probable pathogen is now detected in < 10% according to a review of the records of > 17,000 patients hospitalized with CAP. This review addresses the issue of the state of the art of microbiological studies of CAP in terms of the realities of current-day practice. Unfortunately, the desire for better data to achieve pathogen-directed treatment clashes with a multitude of harsh realities, including cost, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements for antibiotics to be administered within 6 h of disease onset, guidelines that discourage any microbiological studies in most cases, belief in empiricism that is well supported by at least 1 prospective study, the decline of microbiological analysis standards in most laboratories, and the devastating impact of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations that led to the demise of "the house staff laboratory" and the distancing of microbiological analysis from the site of care. Microbiological principles are reviewed, with emphasis on specimen source, pathogenic potential of isolates, concentrations, impact of antecedent antibiotics, and the "Washington criteria" for expectorated sputum. The recommendation is that the high-quality microbiological analysis that is still achieved in some places should be retained but that to advance the field on the basis of the contemporary realities, two goals should be adopted: First is the broad use of antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila with interpretation by clinical staff under the CLIA waiver for low-complexity tests. The second and more ambitious recommendation is the adoption of molecular techniques, with particular emphasis on nucleic acid detection, which is rapid and sensitive and has already been developed for virtually all recognized pulmonary pathogens. This may be the ultimate solution for many laboratories, and it is likely to have selected use.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in casualty: etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management (or a look at the "new" in pneumonia since 2002) [^114BR9op]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

### Surveillance cultures in healthcare-associated pneumonia: sense or nonsense? [^113YfiJ8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review explores the usefulness of surveillance cultures in healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

Recent Findings

The definition of HCAP is controversial. Causative micro-organisms of HCAP resemble those found in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Some types of surveillance cultures have proven useful in hospitalized patients. Whereas numerous studies have investigated the role of surveillance cultures in VAP, one may wonder whether surveillance culture implementation should belong in HCAP management guidelines.

Summary

Studies exploring the usefulness of obtaining surveillance cultures in VAP are numerous, but are mostly retrospective, observational and/or quasi-experimental in nature. Surveillance cultures may be useful for antibiotic guidance, but positive predictive value and specificity of surveillance cultures are low, obviously negatively impacting on cost effectiveness, especially in the large population at risk for HCAP. On the other hand, multidrug-resistance is increasing and surveillance cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in ICU-admitted patients appeared useful and cost-effective. Furthermore, surveillance cultures for the presence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli might be useful for antibiotic guidance. Currently, neither community-acquired pneumonia, HCAP, HAP nor VAP guidelines incorporate surveillance cultures. In the future, surveillance cultures in populations at risk for HCAP may be able to differentiate HCAP from other kinds of pneumonia and authorize its reason for existence.

Remarks state that patient-specific factors to consider include allergies and comorbidities that may confer an increased risk of side effects. Supporting evidence notes that comparative antibiotic data are extremely limited, with no randomized or observational studies specifically enrolling HAP/VAP due to ESBL-producing organisms, and only a few case series describing failure of third-generation cephalosporins in treating ESBL-producing pathogens.

Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Take-home message

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias (HAP and VAP) occur in 5–40% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, increasing morbidity and costs. Mortality is estimated at 10–50%, being highest in immunosuppressed patients. Early effective antibiotics improve outcomes, but routine microbiological investigation requires 48–72 h to provide results. Consequently, patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are given empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, refined once laboratory data become available. US/European consensus strategies aim to minimise the development of HAP/VAP and to optimise antibiotic therapy; nevertheless, guidelines continue to advocate broad-spectrum antibiotic combinations, hazarding collateral damage and selection of antibiotic resistance.

Numerous bacteria, viruses and fungi can cause HAP and VAP. Culture remains the gold-standard method of investigation despite slow turnaround and failure to identify pathogen(s) in up to 50% of cases. Rapid multiplex PCR tests (also called 'syndromic' panels), seeking pathogen(s) and resistance genes, offer increased speed and sensitivity, potentially improving outcomes and antibiotic stewardship. We and many others have demonstrated the excellent diagnostic performance of these systems in detecting key pathogens and antibiotic resistances. However, evidence of their clinical impact remains scanty, and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence highlights rapid testing in HAP as a research priority.

We conducted a pragmatic multi-centre RCT ('INHALE WP3'), investigating the utility — in respect of clinical outcomes and antibiotic stewardship — of a rapid, in-ICU syndromic PCR test (electronic supplementary table S1) for the microbiological investigation and informed targeted treatment of HAP and VAP.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — bacterial culture and Legionella testing guidance states that in those patients who require admission for severe CAP or who have strong risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, blood culture sets should be collected before initiating antimicrobial therapy; culture and Gram stain of good quality samples of expectorated sputum, when available, should be obtained for patients requiring hospitalization; urinary antigen tests for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, where available, should be considered for patients with severe CAP; in patients with non-severe disease and strong epidemiological risk factors for Legionella infection, testing for Legionella is warranted; in geographic areas where Legionella species other than L. pneumophila are more prevalent, culture for Legionella should be performed if clinically indicated; and the molecular syndromic pneumonia panel tests also detect Legionella pneumophila.

### Diagnostic accuracy of Gram staining when predicting staphylococcal hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113f5FtY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no clear guidance on empirical antibiotic coverage against Staphylococcus aureus for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Objective

To evaluate whether the presence of clusters of Gram-positive cocci in Gram staining of respiratory samples predicts S. aureus as HAP/VAP pathogen.

Methods

Data sources were MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Scielo, CINAHL and Scopus, from inception to 15/07/2017 (update on 31/10/2019), and original data from a single-centre database (PROSPERO: CRD42017072138). We included studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of a Gram-staining evaluation suggestive of Staphylococcus compared with a positive culture for S. aureus in any type of lower respiratory tract sample. Participants were adult patients with HAP/VAP. The index test was morphological evaluation of Gram staining of respiratory samples. We followed PRISMA guidelines and assessed risk of bias and applicability with the QUADAS-2 tool. We conducted a meta-analysis using a bivariate random effects model.

Results

We selected five studies that included only VAP and data from a single-centre database including VAP and HAP. We pooled six studies for VAP and analysed 1665 respiratory samples. Pooled sensitivity was 68% (95%CI 49–83 and specificity 95% (95%CI 86–98). The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 12.7 (95%CI 5.1–31.6), negative likelihood ratio 0.34 (95%CI 0.20–0.57), diagnostic odds ratio 38 (95%CI 13–106) and area under the summary receiver operating curve (SROC) 0.91 (95%CI 0.88–0.93). There was great heterogeneity between sensitivity and specificity. In scenarios in which the prevalence of S. aureus was between 5% and 20%, the positive and negative predictive values were 62% (95%CI 47–77) and 95% (95%CI 82–100), respectively.

Conclusions

Detection of Gram-positive cocci in clusters in respiratory samples of patients with VAP has the potential to guide risk assessments of S. aureus for more personalized antibiotic coverage. Randomized clinical trials with patient-centred outcomes are needed for strong clinical recommendations.

Microbiologic assessment and methods

We tried to assess all patients upon clinical diagnosis of HAP, aiming to establish a microbiological diagnosis. Lower respiratory airway samples that could be collected for quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures were (1) sputum, (2) endotracheal aspirate (EAT), (3) bronchial aspirate through a fiberoptic-bronchoscopy (FBAS), and (4) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blinded or through a fiberoptic-bronchoscopy. Only samples of sputum or tracheal aspirates of high quality (i.e. < 10 squamous cells and > 25 leukocytes per optical microscopy field) were processed for culture. Additionally, blood cultures (recommended to all patients) and pleural fluid (if a pleural puncture was indicated) could be collected, as well as urinary antigens of Legionella sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae (mainly recommended for early-onset HAP). Pathogen identification and susceptibility testing were performed by standard methods. Microbiological diagnosis was defined by the presence of at least one potentially pathogenic microorganism (PPM) in respiratory samples above predefined thresholds (sputum, EAT, FBAS > 10⁵ colony-forming units/mL or BAL > 10⁴, or any count if the patient was receiving a new systemic antibiotic treatment). Blood cultures were considered positive if an alternative cause of bacteremia was ruled out.

Polymicrobial pneumonia was defined when more than one PPM was identified as causative agents. The initial empiric antimicrobial treatment was chosen following a local adaptation of the 2005 ATS/IDSA guidelines, based on the most frequently isolated pathogens and their patterns of antimicrobial sensitivity at our institution. The empiric antimicrobial treatment was considered appropriate when the isolated pathogens were susceptible in vitro to at least one of the antimicrobials administered. Multi-drug-resistant pathogens were defined based on consensus definition.

Antibiotic de-escalation was considered when physicians changed the antibiotic regimen to a narrower spectrum regimen, stopped the coverage for a class of pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), or reduced the number of antibiotics prescribed. Escalation was considered when physicians introduced a new regimen with broader coverage. We further divided the patients whom the empiric antibiotic scheme was maintained in those that no change was done, and in those whom an additional antibiotic was added to the empiric regimen.

It should be emphasized that, for the management of VAP, like for all infectious diseases, the choice of antimicrobial treatment is much easier when the specific etiologic agents are identified by a reliable diagnostic technique. Before new antibiotics are administered, reliable pulmonary specimens (chosen according to the literature and within the capabilities of the local microbiology laboratory) must be obtained for direct examination and cultures from patients clinically suspected of having developed VAP.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^113rCWPj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Initial treatment of VAP and HAP — empiric antibiotic selection for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is directed by local resistance data as follows: We recommend that all hospitals regularly generate and disseminate a local antibiogram, ideally one that is specific to their intensive care population(s) if possible, and we recommend that empiric treatment regimens be informed by the local distribution of pathogens associated with VAP and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. The frequency with which pathogen distribution and susceptibility data are updated should be determined by the institution, with considerations including their rate of change, resources, and the amount of data available for analysis. This approach is supported by the observation that antimicrobial flora and resistance patterns can vary considerably between and within countries, regions, hospitals, ICUs in a hospital, and specimen sources; because of this variability, the only way to know the local prevalence and resistance patterns of pathogens associated with VAP is to develop a local antibiogram, ideally specific for VAP patients or, failing that, ICU patients. In the absence of local microbial epidemiology, clinicians can refer to large national and international surveys of organisms and resistance patterns, and the survey closest to the local level should be utilized; an approved guideline for susceptibility testing is available.

Authors state that most patients had pneumonia of unknown etiology with negative blood culture, S pneumoniae and H influenzae were the most common pathogens identified, and that blood culture is "recommended despite low yield because of the prognostic importance of bacteremia and the potential to direct therapy against a specific pathogen". Limitations include that a large number of eligible patients were not enrolled, enrolled patients were younger, more likely to be white, more likely to be low risk for mortality, few outpatients had blood culture done, and the study did not directly assess the effect of routine microbiologic testing on medical outcomes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — monotherapy vs combination therapy: For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who are not in septic shock or at a high risk for death, and for whom the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we recommend monotherapy using an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible rather than combination therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we suggest combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible rather than monotherapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). High risk of death in the meta-regression analysis was defined as mortality risk ≥ 25%; low risk of death is defined as mortality risk ≤ 15%.

Results

Identified topics covering unmet needs in CAP research

Detection of causative pathogens

Current setting

Defining the causative pathogen in patients with pneumonia is relevant for ensuring the best-suited antimicrobial treatment. However, microbial diagnosis of pneumonia is still based on culture in most hospitals worldwide and a causative pathogen is only detected in the minority of patients. In a recent CAPNETZ study, bacteraemia rates in CAP were 0.5% in outpatients, 7.8% in hospitalized patients, 12.4% in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and a relevant proportion of patients with bacteraemia and CAP (34.6%) was afebrile. With the rapid emergence of novel diagnostic techniques (e.g. isothermic multiplex-PCRs for point of care testing, microbiome analysis, host transcriptomics and metagenomics), the question arises if these techniques will provide an added value to the currently available and established diagnostic methods and whether they will change management.

Unmet needs

Define an improved gold standard for microbial diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia: Currently, microscopy and culture of lower respiratory tract specimens as well as blood cultures, detection of urine antigen detection and serology are routinely used to complement thorax imaging results in diagnosing pneumonia. However, most tests (particularly serology) lack sensitivity and specificity, while tests with a high sensitivity, such as PCR for non-influenza respiratory viruses may currently not properly translate into clinical relevance. No internationally accepted standard for microbiological tests in CAP has been defined, both in terms of including novel PCR-based techniques but also regarding the quality of the required respiratory samples. There is a need for a consented diagnostic standard that also serves as comparison for new diagnostic techniques.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — core pathogen coverage: In patients with suspected VAP, we recommend including coverage for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli in all empiric regimens (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Values and preferences note these recommendations balance providing early appropriate antibiotic coverage with avoiding superfluous treatment that may lead to adverse drug effects, C. difficile infections, antibiotic resistance, and increased cost.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia: the state of evidence to date [^111K4bVL]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As evidence about the importance of correct choice of empiric therapy in the setting of pneumonia accumulates, balancing antibiotic spectrum against the risk of selecting for resistant organisms gains importance. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) defines a set of risk factors to underscore the probability of a resistant etiologic pathogen, requiring broader spectrum treatment than is generally needed in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Controversies persist as to whether HCAP is a useful designation for diagnosis, treatment and outcome prediction.

Recent Findings

HCAP represents a discrete syndrome, where offending organisms and outcomes differ from those for CAP. However, HCAP designation is neither a sensitive nor a specific system to predict the presence of a resistant organism. Several other instruments have been developed that require prospective validation. Recent findings that CAP guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment among HCAP patients does not alter outcomes is confounded by the emerging understanding that culture-negative HCAP may be successfully treated with therapy targeted at CAP pathogens.

Summary

Because HCAP is an important emerging syndrome, a systematic approach to its study is critical. As evidence in this area evolves, it remains important for investigators and clinicians to identify knowledge gaps and to set the research agenda to resolve multiple unanswered questions.

Blood cultures in adults with CAP — We recommend not obtaining blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the outpatient setting (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) and we suggest not routinely obtaining blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend obtaining pretreatment blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting who are classified as severe CAP (see Table 1) (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), are being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), were previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially those with prior respiratory tract infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence), or were hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The yield of blood cultures in most series of adults with nonsevere CAP is low, ranging from 2% (outpatients) to 9% (inpatients).
