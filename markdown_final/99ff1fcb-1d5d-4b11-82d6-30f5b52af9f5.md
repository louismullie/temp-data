## Question

Titrating off escitalooram that is 10mg daily

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to safely taper off escitalopram 10 mg daily, including the steps involved and important considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication for tapering and the risks of abrupt discontinuation. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram and how that influences taper design. Next, I will review guideline-based tapering principles and reconcile them with newer evidence on hyperbolic tapering. After that, I will construct a practical, stepwise taper schedule with contingencies for withdrawal symptoms. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and patient counseling, and I will double-check any areas where I might be overgeneralizing or missing nuance.

> Let me first confirm the indication and the risks of stopping abruptly. Escitalopram is an SSRI with a known discontinuation syndrome characterized by dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances such as electric shock sensations, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania; abrupt cessation increases the risk of these symptoms, so a gradual dose reduction is recommended whenever possible [^1167TZyP] [^115UdPaN]. Hold on, I should verify the incidence to set expectations: a recent meta-analysis estimates that about 31% of patients experience at least one discontinuation symptom after stopping antidepressants, with severe symptoms in about 2.8%, underscoring the need for a planned taper rather than abrupt cessation [^115DPAaa].

> Next, I should review the pharmacokinetics to inform taper pacing. Escitalopram has an elimination half-life around 27–32 hours, which is intermediate among SSRIs; this supports a taper over weeks rather than days, but it is not as forgiving as fluoxetine's long half-life, so withdrawal remains a concern if tapered too quickly [^1163Dsib]. Wait, let me verify whether alternate-day dosing helps; in silico modeling suggests that extending the inter-dose interval at low doses increases receptor occupancy fluctuation and may worsen withdrawal, so I should avoid alternate-day strategies during tapering [^1176yG9V].

> I will now examine guideline-based tapering principles. The APA recommends tapering over at least several weeks when discontinuing antidepressants, and the FDA labeling advises a gradual reduction with monitoring for discontinuation symptoms, with the option to resume the prior dose and slow the taper if symptoms emerge. This aligns with a conservative, clinically paced approach rather than abrupt cessation [^1144A8bJ] [^115UdPaN]. But wait, what if the patient has been on the medication for years or is particularly sensitive to dose changes? In that case, I should individualize the pace and consider even slower tapers to mitigate risk [^1151WT3V].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about linear tapers being sufficient. Emerging expert opinion and translational work suggest that hyperbolic (exponentially decreasing) tapers that reduce relative dose by smaller and smaller absolute amounts as the dose gets lower may better match receptor occupancy dynamics and reduce withdrawal. However, I should confirm that this remains largely expert-opinion and modeling-based rather than guideline-mandated, so I will integrate it as an option when standard tapers are not tolerated [^1178DTWU]. Let me reconsider: for many patients, a careful linear taper with flexibility still works, but for those with prior withdrawal or long-term exposure, a hyperbolic approach is reasonable to trial [^1178DTWU].

> Now, I will construct a practical taper schedule for escitalopram 10 mg daily. A standard, conservative approach is to reduce by 50% initially to 5 mg daily for 2–4 weeks, then by 50% again to 2.5 mg daily for 2–4 weeks, and then stop. This spans roughly 4–8 weeks total and allows time to stabilize between decrements, which is consistent with FDA guidance to taper gradually and monitor for symptoms [^115UdPaN] [^1167TZyP]. Wait, I should double-check the feasibility of 2.5 mg dosing; if only 10 mg and 5 mg tablets are available, a liquid formulation or pill-splitting can facilitate 2.5 mg, and this is acceptable in practice for tapering purposes [^116sd7Rp].

> But what if the patient experiences withdrawal at any step? I need to ensure a contingency plan. If intolerable symptoms occur, I should return to the last tolerated dose, stabilize for 1–2 weeks, and then resume tapering at a slower pace or with smaller decrements; this may mean using 1 mg steps if needed, ideally with a liquid or compounded preparation to achieve fine adjustments, and I should document symptom trajectories to distinguish withdrawal from relapse [^115UdPaN] [^1167TZyP]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is aligned with consensus statements; yes, expert panels support individualized, slower tapers with clinical monitoring and patient education as core strategies [^115KGUcD].

> For patients with higher risk profiles or prior withdrawal, I should consider a hyperbolic taper. Let me think about a concrete example: over about 10–12 weeks, reduce from 10 mg to 7.5 mg for 2–3 weeks, then 5 mg for 2–3 weeks, then 2.5 mg for 2–3 weeks, then 1.25 mg for 2–3 weeks, then 0.625 mg for 1–2 weeks before stopping. This progressively smaller absolute reduction mirrors the principle of decreasing relative dose changes at lower exposure, though I must acknowledge this specific schedule is extrapolated from expert opinion rather than a mandated protocol [^1178DTWU]. I should confirm that the patient understands this is a tailored, experimental approach and that we will adjust based on tolerability [^1178DTWU].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In older adults, I should start with lower doses and taper more slowly due to higher sensitivity and comorbidities; geriatric guidance supports 5–10 mg as a typical dose range and a cautious taper, and I should extend the taper interval if cognition, falls, or cardiovascular comorbidities are present [^111Wtsxq] [^113yTxyS]. For hepatic impairment, the maximum recommended dose is 10 mg, so any taper should proceed with extra caution and potentially longer intervals; for severe renal impairment, use 5 mg as a practical floor during taper and monitor closely [^111Wtsxq] [^113D7H3H]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never go below 5 mg", but I should correct that: in select cases with careful monitoring, doses below 5 mg can be used transiently to finish a taper, especially with liquid formulations [^116sd7Rp].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I will schedule check-ins every 2–4 weeks during the taper to assess for discontinuation symptoms, functional status, and mood or anxiety changes that could signal relapse. I will also counsel patients and caregivers to watch for suicidality or unusual changes during dose adjustments, as risk can transiently increase during changes up or down [^1167TZyP] [^111absYG]. I should double-check that we are not conflating withdrawal with relapse: withdrawal tends to emerge within days of a dose change and includes somatic and sensory symptoms, whereas relapse unfolds over weeks and reflects return of the original disorder; distinguishing these guides whether to slow the taper or treat relapse separately [^116Mfi2x].

> Patient counseling is essential. I will explain that gradual tapering reduces but does not eliminate withdrawal risk, that symptoms like dizziness, nausea, "brain zaps", irritability, and insomnia may occur and are usually self-limited, and that we have a plan to slow down or briefly step back if needed. I will also advise against stopping abruptly and document shared decision-making [^1167TZyP] [^115UdPaN]. Hold on, I should verify that we cover serotonin syndrome precautions and drug interactions during the taper; although the risk is lower during dose reduction, concurrent serotonergic drugs still warrant caution and education [^1169k4o3].

> Finally, I should confirm the plan's alignment with evidence and guidelines. The taper schedule respects FDA labeling to reduce gradually, APA guidance to taper over several weeks, and contemporary evidence that short, rigid tapers are often insufficient; incorporating a hyperbolic option for sensitive patients reflects evolving expert opinion while acknowledging the evidence gap and individualizing to tolerability and prior withdrawal history [^115UdPaN] [^1144A8bJ] [^1178DTWU]. If the patient prefers the simplest path and has no prior withdrawal, a 10 mg to 5 mg to 2.5 mg to stop approach over 6–8 weeks with close monitoring is reasonable; if prior withdrawal occurred or symptoms emerge, I will pivot to smaller, hyperbolic decrements and extend the timeline as needed, documenting each adjustment and rationale [^115UdPaN] [^1178DTWU].

Tapering off escitalopram 10 mg daily should be **gradual and individualized** to minimize withdrawal and relapse risk. A typical taper is to **5 mg daily for 2–4 weeks**, then **2.5 mg daily for 2–4 weeks**, then stop, with longer intervals if withdrawal symptoms occur [^115UdPaN] [^1178DTWU]. Monitor for **discontinuation symptoms** (dizziness, nausea, sensory disturbances, anxiety, insomnia) [^1167TZyP] and return of depressive/anxiety symptoms; if withdrawal is severe, return to the last tolerated dose and taper more slowly [^115UdPaN]. Avoid abrupt stopping [^115UdPaN] and consider switching to a longer half-life SSRI (e.g. fluoxetine) if tapering is difficult [^116Fm9VS]. Taper duration should reflect clinical stability, prior relapse, and patient preference, with closer monitoring in older adults or those with comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Recommended tapering schedule

A **standard tapering schedule** for escitalopram 10 mg daily is:

1. 5 mg daily**: 2–4 weeks
2. 2.5 mg daily**: 2–4 weeks
3. Discontinue**: ∅

---

Alternatively, a **hyperbolic taper** — with smaller, nonlinear reductions at lower doses — may better match receptor occupancy and reduce withdrawal [^1178DTWU].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Monitor for dizziness, nausea, sensory disturbances, anxiety, and insomnia [^1167TZyP] [^1163Dsib].
- **Relapse risk**: Watch for return of depressive or anxiety symptoms [^116fweq4] [^1152DFqR].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Tailor taper to duration of therapy, prior withdrawal, comorbidities, and patient preference [^1151WT3V].

---

## Management of withdrawal symptoms

- **Return to last tolerated dose**: If withdrawal occurs, resume the prior dose and taper more slowly [^115UdPaN].
- **Switch to longer half-life SSRI**: Consider fluoxetine if tapering is difficult [^1163Dsib].
- **Supportive measures**: Use psychoeducation, reassurance, and symptomatic treatment [^115KGUcD].

---

## Special populations

In special populations, **older adults** may require slower tapers and closer monitoring due to higher sensitivity and comorbidities [^114r78zT], whereas patients with **hepatic impairment** should receive a reduced maximum dose and a slower taper [^111Wtsxq].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education and counseling should emphasize that **abrupt stopping is not recommended** and that a gradual taper is advised [^115UdPaN]. Patients should be taught to recognize withdrawal and relapse symptoms and to report them promptly [^1169k4o3]. Shared decision-making should incorporate patient preferences and clinical judgment to guide the taper plan [^1169k4o3].

---

Tapering escitalopram 10 mg daily should be **gradual and individualized**, with close monitoring for withdrawal and relapse; adjust the pace based on symptoms and patient factors, and use supportive strategies as needed [^1178DTWU].

### Escitalopram in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: double-blind, placebo controlled, flexible-dose study [^116Fgq2c]. Depression and Anxiety (2004). Low credibility.

Escitalopram has been shown in clinical trials to improve anxiety symptoms associated with depression, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Outpatients (18 years or older) who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD, with baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) scores ≥ 18, were randomly assigned to double blind treatment with escitalopram (10 mg/day for the first 4 weeks and then flexibly dosed from 10–20 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks, following a 1-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total HAMA score at Week 8. The escitalopram group (N = 158) showed a statistically significant, and clinically relevant, greater improvement at endpoint compared with placebo (N = 157) in all prospectively defined efficacy parameters. Significant improvement in HAMA total score and HAMA psychic anxiety subscale score for the escitalopram-treated group vs. the placebo-treated group was observed beginning at Week 1 and at each study visit thereafter. Mean changes from baseline to Week 8 on the HAMA total score using a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach were -11.3 for escitalopram and -7.4 for placebo (P < .001). Response rates at Week 8 were 68% for escitalopram and 41% for placebo (P < .01) for completers, and 58% for escitalopram and 38% for placebo LOCF values (P < .01). Treatment with escitalopram was well tolerated, with low rates of reported adverse events and an incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events not statistically different from placebo (8.9% vs. 5.1%; p = 0.27). Escitalopram 10–20 mg/day is effective, safe, and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with GAD.

Methods

The original study was conducted in 46 centers in 7 European countries from October 2003 to May 2005, in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki applicable at the time of the study. The study was approved by the relevant local ethics committees and all patients gave written informed consent for participation. The methods and main results of the principal study have been described.

Design Overview

This relapse prevention study started with a 12-week open-label treatment period that was followed by a 24-week, randomised, double blind treatment period (Figure 1). During the initial open-label period, outpatients aged at least 65 years received escitalopram 10mg/day during the first week; the dose could be increased to 20mg/day at Week 2, based on the clinical judgement of the investigator. Subsequently the dose remained constant for the remaining open label period. At the end of the 12-week open-label period, patients who achieved remission, defined by a Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≤ 12, were eligible for randomisation to either continue escitalopram at their last fixed dose of 10 or 20mg/day, or to switch to placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients randomised to placebo who were on 20 mg/day escitalopram during the open period received 10 mg/day escitalopram for the first week (Week 13) before receiving placebo for the remainder of the study. Non-remitters left the study and were treated at the physician's discretion.

Figure 1
Study design.

During the 24-week double-blind period (until taper at Week 36), study investigators regularly evaluated relapse symptoms. Relapse was defined either as a MADRS total score ≥ 22 at a single visit, or an unsatisfactory treatment effect (lack of efficacy), as judged by the local investigator. In order to capture all patients who could be considered to have relapsed, this definition was extended in a sensitivity analysis to include patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for MDE or who attempted suicide. Patients who relapsed were withdrawn from the study and were contacted for a safety follow-up assessment 4 weeks later.

Patients

Psychiatrists recruited patients in private practice or hospital outpatient clinics. Those eligible for study were outpatients with a primary diagnosis of MDD (assessed by psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), moderate or severe, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria, and who gave informed consent. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail by Gorwood et al. Patients were required to have a MADRS score ≥ 22 and an MMSE score ≥ 24 at entry. Patients with severe or unstable medical co-morbid diseases were excluded.

Medication treatment

Study medications were tablets for oral administration of identical appearance, taste and smell. The oxalate salt of escitalopram, or a placebo, was used in the tablets. After the open-label period, eligible patients were assigned to escitalopram or placebo according to a computer-generated randomisation list drawn up by H. Lundbeck A/S. Details of the randomisation were unknown to any of the investigators and were contained in a set of sealed opaque envelopes. At each study center, sequentially enrolled patients were assigned the lowest randomisation number available in blocks of four. All study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study.

Assessments

After baseline assessment of efficacy measures, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of open-label treatment. For patients randomised to double-blind treatment, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed 1, 2, and 4 weeks after randomisation, and then every 4 weeks until the last dose of double-blind treatment (Week 24 of double blind, also Week 36 of the full study).

Efficacy assessments at baseline and each follow-up visit included the MADRS, Clinical Global Impression - Severity of illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of illness (CGI-I). The primary analysis of efficacy was the time to relapse from the start date of double-blind treatment. Prior to the study, all investigators attended a joined MADRS and CGI rating session chaired by an experienced research psychiatrist.

The tolerability and safety evaluations were based on spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), vital signs, body weight, and physical examination.

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^111ivSXM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another possible explanation of these results is that the short-term discontinuation required to enter in the trial disturbed the stability previously acquired with medications, generating discontinuation symptoms. In support of this hypothesis, discontinuers showed an increase in depressive symptoms between trial screening and baseline (i.e. when withdrawal was taking place), as well as a trend towards higher depression scores at baseline compared with unmedicated patients. Tapering or cessation of SSRI/SNRIs is commonly associated with withdrawal symptoms which often resemble symptoms of depression or a worsening of depressive symptom severity. These symptoms can be distinguished from a relapse of the original disorder by rapidity of onset, the presence of somatic symptoms like nausea, shock-like feelings, dizziness and rapid response by reintroduction of SSRI/SNRIs. While a minimum of 2 weeks of tapering is commonly considered sufficient, it may not mitigate prolonged symptoms. In fact, there is evidence suggesting that linear tapering over this period might not have additional benefit compared with abrupt discontinuation.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113auBb2]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Nonhormone prescription therapies — suggested dosing ranges and starts are as follows: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include paroxetine salt 7.5 mg (single dose, no titration needed), paroxetine 10–25 mg/d (start with 10 mg/d), citalopram 10–20 mg/d (start with 10 mg/d), and escitalopram 10–20 mg/d (start with 10 mg/d; for sensitive or older women, start with 5 mg/d for titration, but this dose has not been evaluated for efficacy). Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) include desvenlafaxine 100–150 mg/d (start with 25–50 mg/d and titrate up by that amount each day) and venlafaxine 37.5–150 mg/d (start with 37.5 mg/d). Gabapentinoids: gabapentin 900–2,400 mg/d (start with 100–300 mg at night, then add 300 mg at night, then a separate dose of 300 mg in the morning; start 100 mg if concerned about sensitivity). Neurokinin B antagonists: fezolinetant 45 mg/d (single dose, no titration needed).

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116sd7Rp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementing pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder highlights practical dosing and response expectations: for most patients, "the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer", yet "for patients who are worried about side effects, the medication can be started at half the listed dose or less", and many SRIs "are available in liquid form or in pills that can be split". Lower initial doses and gradual titration "may also be needed in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders", and in the elderly "lower starting doses of medication and a more gradual approach to dose increase are often advisable". "Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks" and some responders may show "little improvement for as many as 10–12 weeks". Trial data "suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief", and "some patients… may benefit from even higher doses than those shown in the last column of Table 3", in which case "the patient should be closely monitored for side effects, including the serotonin syndrome"; moreover, patients "who have not responded to a known effective dose after 10–12 weeks may respond at higher doses".

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram Tablets

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with escitalopram tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

### No evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect of escitalopram intervention in healthy individuals with a family history of depression [^1145max7]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2012). Low credibility.

Inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression and antidepressants are hypothesised to have an anti-inflammatory effect. In this randomised double-blinded trial we investigated the cytokine levels in supernatants of stimulated whole blood samples from first degree relatives to patients with depression randomised to a single daily dose of either 10mg escitalopram or placebo for four weeks. No significant differences were found in any of the cytokine levels between the participants treated with escitalopram (n = 21) or placebo (n = 23). Our data does thus not support the hypothesis of a global anti-inflammatory effect of escitalopram on cytokines in healthy subjects.

### Clinical milestones predict symptom remission over 6-month and choice of treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) [^116sfftE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It is uncertain as to what short-term outcomes predict long-term treatment compliance and outcomes in patients with MDD.

Aims

To determine what treatment milestones predict symptom remission with long-term treatment with antidepressant medication.

Method

Pooled analysis of four randomised, double-blind, active comparator, 6-month trials in MDD.

Results

Patients received double-blind treatment with escitalopram (N = 699) or a comparator (citalopram, duloxetine, or paroxetine) (N = 699). Onset of effect at week 2 was correlated with response at week 8, and response at week 8 with completion of 6-month treatment. Week 8 response was associated with a greater probability of achieving later remission. Week 24 remission (MADRS ≥ 10) was significantly (p < 0.01) higher for patients treated with escitalopram (70.7%) than for the pooled comparators (64.7%). Week 24 complete remission (MADRS ≤ 5) was significantly (p < 0.01) higher for escitalopram (51.7%) than for the pooled comparators (45.6%). Fewer patients discontinued treatment with escitalopram (15.9%) than with the pooled comparators (23.9%) (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

A higher probability of achieving remission is associated with responding after 8 weeks and with completing 6 months of treatment.

### Efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram versus citalopram in major depressive disorder: a 6-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in adult outpatients [^115JbVkt]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The S-enantiomer of citalopram (escitalopram) is the active moiety linked to the anti-depressant effects associated with citalopram (the racemate). For escitalopram to be approved for the treatment of depression in Europe, findings from clinical trials of escitalopram are required to match previous results from studies of the racemate, citalopram.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram and citalopram in outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Methods

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study was conducted at 8 psychiatric outpatient clinics in the Federation of Russia. Adult outpatients aged 25 to 45 years with MDD and a total score ≥ 25 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of treatment with fixed daily doses of escitalopram 10 mg, citalopram 10 mg, or citalopram 20 mg. Efficacy assessments were made at weeks 0 (baseline), 1, 4, and 6 (study end or last observation carried forward). The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline in MADRS total score. Secondary measures were the change from baseline in MADRS total score in a subgroup of severely depressed patients (baseline MADRS total score, ≥ 35), MADRS core depression subscale score, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity and Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I) scores; and the proportions of patients classified as responders and remitters at study end. Tolerability was assessed using adverse events (AEs) recorded by the investigator.

Results

Of 330 assessable randomized patients, 8 withdrew, including 7 who withdrew consent and 1 who withdrew due to recurrence of a preexisting event. Thus, 322 patients were included in the assessment (mean age, 35 years; 41.6% male; all white; escitalopram 10 mg, 108 patients; citalopram 10 mg, 106; citalopram 20 mg, 108). At study end, the mean (SE) change from baseline in MADRS total score was significantly greater in the escitalopram arm than in the 10- and 20-rag citalopram arms (-28.70 [0.78] vs -20.11 [0.80] and -25.19 [0.78]; both, P < 0.001). Improvements were more marked in the severely depressed subgroup (-30.33 [0.95] vs -20.87 [0.99] and -26.34 [0.91]). Changes in the CGI-S and CGI-I scores and the rates of response and remission were significantly greater in the escitalopram group compared with those in the citalopram 10- and 20-mg groups (CGI-S: -2.60 [0.10] vs -1.61 [0.10] and -2.05 [0.10]; CGI-I: +1.58 [0.09] vs +2.35 [0.10] and +1.80 [0.09]; response: 95.4% vs 44.3% and 83.3%; remission: 89.8% vs 25.5% and 50.9% [all, P < 0.001]). Mean (SE) changes from baseline in core depression subscale score were -19.00 (0.59), -13.00 (0.60), and -16.52 (0.58) with escitalopram, citalopram 10 mg, and citalopram 20 mg, respectively. The prevalence of AEs was significantly lower in the escitalopram group (7) compared with the citalopram groups (16 and 19 in the 10- and 20-mg groups, respectively; both, P < 0.05). Nausea (2 [1.9%], 5 [4.7%], and 7 [6.5%] patients in the escitalopram and citalopram 10- and 20-mg groups, respectively) and headache (1 [0.9%], 2 [1.9%], and 4 [3.7%]) were the most frequently reported AEs.

Conclusions

The results from this study suggest that escitalopram 10 mg was more effective than citalopram 10 and 20 mg at 6 weeks in these adult outpatients with MDD. All treatments were well tolerated.

### Management of vasomotor symptoms in cancer patients [^113kw4Pw]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, escitalopram, citalopram, and paroxetine) and SNRIs (eg, duloxetine and venlafaxine) are the largest groups of nonhormone therapies studied, both in healthy women and cancer patients with VMS. They can reduce hot flash frequency by up to 58% and hot flash scores by up to 65%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs have also been compared with other drugs such as clonidine. As there is no convincing evidence supporting the superiority of any these agents over others, tolerability and side-effect profile are important determinants of treatment outcome. At present, paroxetine (Brisdelle, 7.5 mg) is the only antidepressant approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe VMS associated with menopause. Its efficacy has also been demonstrated in patients with breast and gynecological cancers. However, due to its strong inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme, paroxetine should be avoided in patients on tamoxifen treatment. Active metabolites of tamoxifen can be decreased by up to 64% in patients taking paroxetine. Likewise, fluoxetine, another strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, should also be avoided in tamoxifen-treated patients. In older adults, venlafaxine and paroxetine may not be the initial drug of choice due to risk of withdrawal. Escitalopram and citalopram may be the preferred drugs in this age group due to their lower side effect profile. Compared with citalopram, there are fewer cardiac side effects with escitalopram (eg, QTc prolongation). Drowsiness and dizziness are common adverse effects of SSRIs and SNRIs and can be potentially managed by adjusting the timing of administration. Taking the medication at night may not only alleviate symptoms from nocturnal VMS more effectively but also mitigate side effects such as nausea. Caution should be exercised in patients with hyponatremia, which can be associated with both cancer and SSRI use. Other adverse effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction and weight gain, which may overlap with symptoms of menopause, and should be considered in discussion on VMS treatment options. Regardless of the drug chosen, the lowest possible dose necessary for symptom relief should be used. Upon decision to stop the therapy, tapering should be done to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### Alternate-day dosing to taper antidepressants risks severe withdrawal effects: an in silico analysis [^1176yG9V]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians often recommend dosing antidepressants every other day when tapering to reduce 'average' daily doses. This is used in place of liquid formulations or other methods for obtaining smaller doses. There is limited evidence to support this approach. This paper explores variation of the inter-dose interval when tapering five widely used antidepressants: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, and mirtazapine. We analysed the resultant occupancy of relevant target receptors to establish whether prolonging the interval between doses would likely increase the risk of withdrawal symptoms.

Design and Methods

Analysis was conducted in silico using pre-existing pharmacokinetic data including bioavailability, distribution volumes, time to maximal concentration, and elimination half-lives. Modelling was conducted to assess the effect of altered administration frequency. Receptor occupancy was predicted using previous imaging data. We used pre-defined thresholds to evaluate the tolerability of receptor occupancy variation for different dosing strategies.

Results

Prolonging the inter-dose interval led to a pronounced increase in receptor occupancy variation at standard doses of all antidepressants. Variation increased as dosage reduced until the ED 50 for each drug, which is often far below doses used in current practice. Therefore, increasing the dose interval at minimum therapeutic doses, or even half of that dose, likely increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms and cannot be recommended as a prudent strategy for tapering.

Conclusion

Dosing every other day is likely to cause withdrawal effects with the antidepressants examined in this study. These recommendations remain theoretical until further clinical research and empirical validation of our proposed antidepressant tapering regimens.

### Escitalopram in major depressive disorder: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, parallel trial in a Chinese population [^116b1o1K]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Escitalopram, the S-enantiomer of citalopram and the most selective of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of major depression in white populations. Our aim in this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in Chinese patients with moderate to severe major depression. Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose comparison trial. Patients were given escitalopram 10 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 mg/day for 8 weeks. All patients were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Tolerability was assessed on the basis of adverse effects (measured with a locally developed checklist), regular biochemical tests, and electrocardiograph (ECG) assessments. Two hundred forty patients were enrolled and randomized to escitalopram (123 patients) or fluoxetine (117 patients). The HAM-D-17 total scores of both groups decreased significantly from baseline, but there was no significant difference at week 8 between the two groups (15.8 for escitalopram and 14.7 for fluoxetine; P > .05). There were no significant differences in response rates at all visits after treatment based on either HAM-D-17 or MADRS. A post hoc analysis indicated that escitalopram was superior to fluoxetine on two items of the HAM-D-17: "depressed mood" (P = .023) and "work and interest" (P = .024). The adverse events reported in the escitalopram and fluoxetine groups were comparable, and most were mild to moderate. Both drugs showed good compliance profiles. Escitalopram 10 mg/day is at least as efficacious as fluoxetine 20 mg/day and well tolerated in Chinese patients with major depression, with possible superiority in some core symptoms such as "depressed mood" and "work and interest".

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^116Vcgfs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

As is standard practice in psychedelic trials, participants in thestudy, who were taking SSRI/SNRIs at screening, were required to discontinue prior to commencing the study. This practice is due to some overlap in serotonergic pharmacology of SSRI/SNRIs and psilocybin (i.e. both cause elevated stimulation of 5-HT receptors) as well as an absence of established safety data for combined treatment – at least at the time of conducting the present study. Additionally, previous case reports have indicated that long-term administration of SSRI/SNRIs can reduce the therapeutically important subjective effects of psychedelics. In accordance with guidelines set forth by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE;) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, SSRI/SNRI tapering in this study was done gradually for a period of 2–4 weeks with linear reductions to minimize withdrawal symptoms. There was at least a two-week (or 5 half-lives) drug-free washout period before study commencement, and participants were required to remain abstinent from the medication for the duration of the trial. Once the trial was complete, participants could re-start antidepressant medication under the guidance of their main care provider, typically their general practitioner (GP). This process has been found to be safe and effective (i.e. no serious adverse events) in clinical trials thus far.

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^116u5sr5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current results suggest that patients with recent discontinuation of SSRI/SNRIs may be less responsive to treatment with psilocybin. If tapering is decided prior to psychedelic intervention, a more cautious approach could involve longer tapering periods (e.g. hyperbolic) and/or regimens with partial tapering focused on lowering doses instead of total discontinuation might be required. More confirmatory research as well as careful clinical consideration before deciding whether to discontinue SSRI/SNRIs is thus needed to inform future medical use. Lastly, we are mindful that a need for SSRI/SNRI discontinuation could impact on the potential future roll-out of psilocybin-therapy given that SSRI/SNRIs are the most common class of drugs prescribed for MDD, and patients tend to stay on these medications for long periods of time. A requirement for SSRI/SNRI discontinuation would be an inconvenience for this roll-out. Much more work is required to better understand if this is a necessary inconvenience or not.

### Escitslopram (escitalopram) [^117GT6kW]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In a longer-term trial, 274 patients meeting (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder, who had responded during an initial 8-week, open-label treatment phase with escitalopram 10 mg or 20 mg daily, were randomized to continuation of escitalopram at their same dose, or to placebo, for up to 36 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined by having a decrease of the MADRS total score to < 12. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the MADRS total score to ≥ 22, or discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response. Patients receiving continued escitalopram experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse compared to those receiving placebo.

Pediatric Patients 12 years of age and older

The efficacy of escitalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years was established in an 8 week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared escitalopram (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients 12 to 17 years of age inclusive who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary outcome was change from baseline to endpoint in the Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRSR). In this study, escitalopram showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the CDRS-R.

The efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of major depressive disorder in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study with racemic citalopram 20 mg to 40 mg daily. In this outpatient study in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, citalopram treatment showed statistically significant greater mean improvement from baseline, compared to placebo, on the CDRS-R; the positive results for this trial largely came from the 12 to 17 year subgroup.

Two additional flexible-dose, placebo-controlled MDD studies (one escitalopram study in patients ages 7 to 17 years and one citalopram study patients 13 to 18 years) did not demonstrate efficacy. The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with MDD.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^113fvPYK]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies comparing escitalopram with citalopram

A total of five randomized, double-blind studies have directly compared the efficacy of escitalopram (10–20 mg) with that of citalopram (10–40 mg) in more than 1700 patients. The mean change in MADRS score was significantly greater in patients receiving escitalopram than citalopram at both six and eight weeks. At 24 weeks, however, there was no significant difference in efficacy between citalopram and escitalopram. In the two placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in which citalopram was used as an active comparator, analysis of time to separation from placebo showed that escitalopram (10–20 mg) resulted in a statistically significant separation from placebo on all rating scales during weeks 1–2, compared with weeks 6–8 for citalopram (20–40 mg). This suggests that treatment with escitalopram is associated with earlier relief of depressive symptoms compared with citalopram, which is in keeping with findings from preclinical studies. Only a single study reported an increased prevalence of adverse events with citalopram compared with escitalopram; in all other studies, both treatments were found to be equally safe and well tolerated.

Furthermore, three pooled analyses have compared the efficacy of escitalopram with that of citalopram. In these three studies, escitalopram was superior to citalopram with respect to MADRS score. In the study by, for example, the mean decrease from baseline in MADRS total score in the results of the pooled studies was greater after eight weeks of treatment in escitalopram-treated patients than in those treated with citalopram, even in a subpopulation of severely ill patients (i.e. those with MADRS score of ≥ 30). Two early pooled analyses of the initial registration trials showed a faster onset and superior efficacy of escitalopram compared with citalopram. Data on speed of onset need to be viewed cautiously because statistical separation is partly dependent on subject numbers.

### Escitalopram oral (escitalopram oral solution) [^116KERU6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Escitalopram

Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by the 1428 patients treated with escitalopram for periods of up to one year in double-blind or open-label clinical trials during its premarketing evaluation. The listing does not include those reactions already listed in Tables 2 & 3, those reactions for which a drug cause was remote and at a rate less than 1% or lower than placebo, those reactions which were so general as to be uninformative, and those reactions reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life threatening. Reactions are categorized by body system. Reactions of major clinical importance are described in the Warnings and Precautions section (5).

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram Tablets

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with escitalopram tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

14.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of escitalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

A fixed-dose study compared 10 mg daily escitalopram and 20 mg daily escitalopram to placebo and 40 mg daily citalopram. The 10 mg daily and 20 mg daily escitalopram treatment groups showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg escitalopram groups were similar on this outcome measure.

In a second fixed-dose study of 10 mg daily escitalopram and placebo, the 10 mg daily escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

In a flexible-dose study, comparing escitalopram, titrated between 10 mg and 20 mg daily, to placebo and citalopram, titrated between 20 mg and 40 mg daily, the escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^116DzzZr]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To assess and clarify the relations between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dose efficacy, acceptability (early treatment discontinuation (dropouts)), and tolerability (reported adverse drug effects), and critically evaluate methods previously used to examine SSRI dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults.

Design

Systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration library, from 1975 to December 2021. Reference lists of national depression treatment guidelines were systemically searched by hand.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Reviews assessing SSRI monotherapy dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults (age ≥ 18 years) reporting efficacy, acceptability, or tolerability. Reviews meeting inclusion criteria had a high degree of heterogeneity, due to methodological diversity; therefore, a meta-narrative synthesis approach was applied. Standard daily doses were defined as 20mg citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine; 50mg sertraline; and 10mg escitalopram. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool, in line with Cochrane recommendations.

Results

The search identified 9138 records; 387 full text reports were assessed for eligibility, 42 of which matched the inclusion criteria. The majority, 83% (n = 35), of reviews included data for studies with a duration of ≤ 12 weeks (ie, the acute phase of depression treatment). Of 39 reviews assessing efficacy, the majority (n = 26) indicated that individual SSRIs and SSRI class demonstrated flat dose-response effects; standard doses were optimal for efficacy. Acceptability or tolerability were assessed in 28 reviews. Higher than standard daily doses were associated with higher dropout rates and a greater incidence of adverse drug effects (eg, nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety). Despite a range of methods being reported, there was an overall consensus regarding SSRI dose related efficacy, dropouts, and adverse drug effects.

Conclusion

Standard daily doses of SSRIs for the treatment of depression in adults provide a favourable balance between efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability. Patients are encouraged to talk to their prescriber or community pharmacist if they experience adverse effects or have any concerns about their drug treatments.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^117UKctT]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitor dosing in obsessive-compulsive disorder (mg/day) is outlined as follows: citalopram starting 20, usual target 40–60, usual maximum 80, occasionally prescribed maximum 120; clomipramine starting 25, usual target 100–250, usual maximum 250; escitalopram starting 10, usual target 20, usual maximum 40, occasionally prescribed maximum 60; fluoxetine starting 20, usual target 40–60, usual maximum 80, occasionally prescribed maximum 120; fluvoxamine starting 50, usual target 200, usual maximum 300, occasionally prescribed maximum 450; paroxetine starting 20, usual target 40–60, usual maximum 60, occasionally prescribed maximum 100; sertraline starting 50, usual target 200, usual maximum 200, occasionally prescribed maximum 400. Occasionally prescribed doses are "sometimes used for rapid metabolizers or for patients with no or mild side effects and inadequate therapeutic response after 8 weeks or more at the usual maximum dose", sertraline is "better absorbed with food", and for clomipramine "combined plasma levels of clomipramine plus desmethylclomipramine 12 hours after the dose should be kept below 500 ng/mL".

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

SSRIs act by selective blockade of the presynaptic 5-HT transporter, boosting 5-HT neurotransmission and consequently stimulating intestinal transit; however, by not acting on NA receptors, SSRIs do not treat pain. Their primary serotonergic effect, without noradrenergic effect, leads to more significant expected benefits in treating anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobic-related behaviors. They can be added to a TCA or SNRI in low doses when anxiety is dominant. Similarly SSRIss may be used instead of a TCA to manage a patient with IBS-C when pain is not dominant. SSRI are more likely to cause diarrhea, while TCAs tend to be constipating due to their NA effect.

The SSRIs include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram. Although all act on 5-HT reuptake inhibition, each of them has specific pharmacologic properties, like greater 5-HT2C antagonism of fluoxetine and greater anticholinergic action of paroxetine, so unlike the other SSRIs, paroxetine may produce constipation.

Sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram tend to have the fewest pharmacokinetic drug interactions as they exhibit minimal effects on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, however, have an increased risk of pharmacokinetic drug interactions through their strong inhibition of the P450 isoenzymes 1A2 and 2D6; therefore, they should be administered with caution when used in conjunction with TCAs and beta-blockers like metoprolol, opioids, lithium, tryptophan and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

SSRIs are first-line pharmacologic agents for treating anxiety disorders, but they have the potential to induce restlessness and exacerbate anxiety when the drug is initiated. They are typically initiated at half of the usual starting dose to minimize these potential anxiogenic adverse effects. The dose may gradually increase to the regular starting dose after about 1 week (Table 3). The higher effect of the SSRI is usually delayed 3–4 weeks, which may represent a problem for those patients with significant anxiety that is complicating treatment and causing significant functional impairment. A useful strategy for this situation is to schedule a long-acting benzodiazepine to temporarily bridge this lag time and provide symptomatic relief for the patient's anxiety symptoms. The benzodiazepine should then be tapered after about 4 weeks of SSRI treatment.

Table 3.
SSRI dose range

Other side effects of SSRIs are agitation, sleep disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, night sweats, headache, weight loss, and sexual dysfunction.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116HA7ha]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder pharmacotherapy — citalopram and escitalopram outcomes: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 12 weeks of citalopram 20 mg/day (n = 102), 40 mg/day (n = 98), or 60 mg/day (n = 100) produced higher YBOCS-25% response rates (57%, 52%, and 65%, respectively) than placebo (n = 101) (37%). Open-label data include similar inpatient YBOCS-35% responder rates with citalopram (n = 11; mean dose = 51 mg/day) and paroxetine (n = 9; mean dose = 53 mg/day) at 40% and 45%, with fluvoxamine (n = 10; mean dose = 290 mg/day) at 60%; and no significant difference across 12 weeks among citalopram 40–60 mg/day (n = 23) (48%), fluvoxamine 200–300 mg/day (n = 83) (55%), clomipramine 150–250 mg/day (n = 37) (48%), and paroxetine 40–60 mg/day (n = 16) (50%). Additional open-label findings reported that flexibly dosed citalopram 20–60 mg/day (mean final dose = 46 mg/day) led to 22 of 29 (76%) patients achieving a ≥ 50% decrease in Y-BOCS score over 24 weeks, whereas a 12-week trial in prior SRI nonresponders found only one of seven (14%) responded to citalopram 20 mg/day for 2 weeks then 40 mg/day; a case report described benefit when increasing from 80 mg/day to 160 mg/day, and intravenous citalopram was tolerated at 20–80 mg/day. Escitalopram was as effective as paroxetine for OCD and was superior to placebo in preventing OCD relapse in European double-blind trials.

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Relapse of vasomotor symptoms after discontinuation of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram: results from the menopause strategies: finding lasting answers for symptoms and health research network [^113HNaL1]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) recur after discontinuation of hormonal therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used increasingly to treat VMS, but whether VMS recur after cessation of SSRI is unknown. We hypothesized that relapse of VMS to baseline levels after SSRI cessation would be common and predicted by menopausal and psychological characteristics.

Methods

Recurrence of VMS (frequency, severity, and bother) was measured with daily diaries for 3 weeks after cessation of escitalopram, which was administered to perimenopausal/postmenopausal women with hot flashes and night sweats in an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Blinding of staff and participants was maintained throughout. Relapse was defined as mean daily VMS frequency, severity, or bother 20% or less lower than pretreatment levels.

Results

Of 76, 57, and 51 women included in the analysis for VMS frequency, severity, and bother, 34.2%, 38.6%, and 37.3%, respectively, had relapse of VMS frequency, severity, and bother. In adjusted models, VMS frequency relapse was predicted by higher levels of pretreatment insomnia symptoms (P = 0.02) and a weaker response to escitalopram (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Among women whose VMS improved with escitalopram, approximately one third relapsed swiftly after discontinuation of the medication. Those with pretreatment insomnia and those with a weaker response to escitalopram may be at greatest risk for VMS relapse after treatment discontinuation. Women should be educated about the likelihood of VMS symptom relapse when they discontinue SSRIs after receiving benefits from short-term treatment.

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with escitalopram. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

2.3 Escitalopram administration

All participants underwent a baseline functional MRI scan, following which they consented to commence escitalopram treatment at a dose of 10 mg/day. Afterward, the dose for each individual was determined by each patient's response and tolerance. After 7 days, patients had their escitalopram dosage increased during the study period. The final escitalopram dosage in the three multicenters (Nanjing Brian Hospital/Drum Tower Hospital/Peking University Institute of Mental Health) were 20 mg/day (n = 15/4/11), 15 mg/day (n = 15/20/19), and 10 mg/day (n = 4/10/6). The average dose (± SD) at the endpoint was 16.6 ± 3.4/14.1 ± 3.1/15.7 ± 3.4 mg.

2.4 MRI data acquisitions

Participants were not allowed to carry any piece of metal in the magnetically shielded room. They were instructed to keep their eyes closed, not fall asleep and minimize movement. Head motion was confined to less than 1.5 mm in any direction. No subjects were reported to fall asleep during the scanning.

Data from the first and second cohorts were collected by a 3.0T Siemens MRI Scanner (Siemens Medical solutions, Germany) equipped with a 12‐channel neurovascular array coil. Resting‐state functional images were recorded using echo‐planar imaging sequence, yielding whole‐brain coverage in all participants. (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] = 3,000 ms/40 ms; flip angle [FA] = 90°; matrix = 64 × 64; thickness/gap = 4.0 mm/0 mm; slice number = 32). The recording session lasted 6 min 45 s. The T1‐weighted anatomic images were obtained by gradient‐echo sequence (TR/TE/FA = 1,900 ms/2.48 ms/9°).

Images from the cohort Sample 3 were also acquired by a 3.0T Siemens MRI Scanner with the following parameters: TR/TE = 2,000 ms/30 ms, FA = 90°, matrix = 64 × 64, thickness/gap = 4.0 mm/0.8 mm, number of slices = 30, and lasting scan time = 7 min. The parameters for the T1‐weighted anatomic images were TR/TE/FA = 2,300 ms/3.01 ms/9°.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^1115M1UX]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The pattern of AEs was similar in both age groups, and to that previously seen with escitalopram in younger adults. Based on the incidence of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, old-old patients tolerated treatment with escitalopram equally well as young-old patients. During the 24-week relapse prevention period, escitalopram was significantly more efficacious than placebo.

This study's main strength is that, as a result of the high remission rates during the open-label escitalopram phase, there were relatively large numbers of patients in both the young-old and old-old groups at the point of randomisation, giving the study satisfactory statistical power to detect differences in relapse rate and pattern between them. The analysis by age group was, however, retrospective, and its inclusion and exclusion criteria to some extent limit the generalizability of its findings to the depressed old-old population. A further limitation of the study is that we did not investigate in detail the effect of medical co-morbidities on outcomes. As Reynolds et al. note, the number and severity of co-morbid medical illnesses moderate depression recurrence in older old depressed patient. Since medical co-morbidities were comparable across the randomization groups (Table 2), it is unlikely that medical co-morbidity influenced any treatment benefit from escitalopram.

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^112bfD7e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations that should be considered in interpreting these results. First is the small and unequal sample sizes and the exploratory, post hoc, opportunistic nature of the analyses. As such, these results should not be taken as confirmatory – rather, they may be used to inform hypothesis testing in well controlled future studies. Aside from there being a 2-week washout period at the end of tapering, the length of each medication taper was not collected during the trial and formal assessments of withdrawal symptoms were not performed, so it was not possible to include this information in our analyses. The samples that discontinued or were unmedicated at the start of the trial might have differed in other fundamental ways. For example, discontinuers may represent a more treatment-resistant form of MDD, given that they were already treated with an antidepressant medication and sought to be enrolled in a clinical trial focused on a different treatment. There is also the possibility that the unmedicated were unmedicated because they had negative expectations for SSRI/SNRIs – causing them to be primed for a negative response to escitalopram if they were allocated to that arm. Accordingly, demographic information suggests that the number of psychiatric medications previously used was higher in discontinuers than in the unmedicated. The discontinuation group also discontinued other psychiatric medications at the start of the study (see for a complete list of these medications), and this could have impacted outcomes. Finally, it is important to note that both treatment groups benefited from extensive psychological support, with an approach inspired by the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy model. The therapeutic effects derived from the support cannot thus be separated from the effects of the drugs in any of the trial arms, and likely acted synergistically to enhance both psilocybin's and escitalopram's effects.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Escitalopram oral solution should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.

2.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adolescents

The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution (10 mg/day to 20 mg/day) demonstrated the effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks.

Adults

The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of escitalopram oral solution, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of continuing escitalopram oral solution 10 mg/day or 20 mg/day in adult patients with major depressive disorder who responded while taking escitalopram oral solution during an 8-week, acute-treatment phase demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use escitalopram oral solution for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

2.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adults

The recommended starting dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

Generalized anxiety disorder is recognized as a chronic condition. The efficacy of escitalopram oral solution in the treatment of GAD beyond 8 weeks has not been systematically studied. The physician who elects to use escitalopram oral solution for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Escitalopram Oral Solution

Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram oral solution or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^116oF1Qk]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosage and duration of antidepressants

Most studies and meta-analyses have found no benefit for antidepressant dose escalation versus staying on the minimum licensed dose, with an increased risk of side effects and discontinuation, even if there is also evidence that higher doses may have superior efficacy and that higher starting doses may be associated with higher response rates. In terms of 'minimum duration', some studies have shown that, while two weeks can be enough to observe an initial response, a stable response/remission is usually detectable after four weeks. However, a complete remission may not be detectable after four weeks. For example, approximately half of remitters on citalopram in level 1 of the STAR*D trial remitted between week 6 and week 14. Of note, this is different for fast-acting medications, such as esketamine, but these drugs are indicated for individuals that already have TRD.

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 74%) that the criteria of 'adequate dose and duration' is the minimal effective dosage, that is, the minimal approved dosage, administered for at least four weeks.

Interestingly, in regulatory clinical trials, participants' discontinuation of treatments may be considered as an endpoint equivalent to a failure. However, we recommend (with strong consensus, 96%) that discontinuation of treatment before the completion of the fourth week, without clear evidence of lack of response, should not be considered as a treatment failure for the purpose of establishing TRD/PRD, especially because of the difficulty in distinguishing retrospectively between non-response and intolerance.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^114r78zT]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with depression often have several chronic disorders and are more treatment-resistant. These patients also have a higher risk of medication side effects, due to co-morbid medical conditions and age-associated changes in organ function. Moreover, a higher risk for drug-drug interactions may cause them to terminate treatment prematurely.

Second generation antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)] are recommended as first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines and are most commonly prescribed for depressive disorders in older patients. Nevertheless, until 2003, only one large placebo-controlled trial of a non-tricyclic antidepressant, marketed in the US, in outpatients 60 years of age or older with major depressive disorder had been published. The first trials of second-generation antidepressants, including a large study of patients aged 75 years and above treated with citalopram, reported no advantage over placebo or small drug-placebo differences, hence the clinical value of these agents in treating older depressed adults was uncertain.

A later meta-analysis of 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials in depressed patients aged 60 years and older concluded that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, although effects were modest and variable. A major limitation was that the average age of patients in these trials ranged from 60 to 72 years, with only a small number over 75. Late-life spans a broad age range and can be divided into young-old (60–74 years), and old-old (≥ 75 years). Among the old-old, antidepressant treatment may be especially complicated because of the high frequency and severity of co-morbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or heart disease.

In addition to being well tolerated as an antidepressant in older persons, escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse of MDD in patients ≥ 65 years. The latter study, as well as open-label data, suggests that escitalopram is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of older patients with MDD.

In order to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in the old-old with the young-old, we undertook a secondary analysis of a published clinical trial. The primary aim was to compare the effect of escitalopram in preventing relapse of MDD among young-old and old-old patients. A secondary objective was to compare the initial response to open-label escitalopram in these two age groups. We hypothesized that old-old and young-old patients on escitalopram would have comparable benefits with regard to prevention of relapse and initial remission.

### A double-blind comparison of escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release in the treatment of major depressive disorder [^111wNDQf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Escitalopram is the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant available. Venlafaxine is a non-selective SRI that also inhibits noradrenergic re-uptake. This study compared escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR) in depressed outpatients at the highest doses recommended in the United States.

Method

In this randomized trial, patients (diagnosis of DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder; baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of ≥ 20) received 1 week of single-blind placebo treatment, followed by 8 weeks of double-blind, fixed-dose treatment with either escitalopram or venlafaxine XR (rapidly titrated to 20 mg/day and 225 mg/day, respectively, in accordance with prescribing information). The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline to week 8 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Data were collected from May to December 2002.

Results

Mean baseline MADRS scores for the escitalopram (N = 97) and venlafaxine XR (N = 98) groups were 30.7 and 30.0, respectively. There were no significant differences in measures of efficacy between the 2 antidepressants. Mean changes from baseline to endpoint in MADRS total score for escitalopram and venlafaxine XR were -15.9 and -13.6, respectively. Remission (MADRS score of ≤ 10) rates at endpoint were 41.2% for escitalopram and 36.7% for venlafaxine XR. Response (≥ 50% reduction from baseline MADRS score) rates for the escitalopram and venlafaxine XR groups were 58.8% and 48.0%, respectively. Tolerability measures favored escitalopram over venlafaxine XR treatment. The venlafaxine XR group had a higher incidence than the escitalopram group of treatment-emergent adverse events (85.0% vs. 68.4%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (16.0% vs. 4.1%; p < .01).

Conclusion

Results of this study indicate that, when titrated rapidly to their maximum recommended doses, escitalopram is at least as effective as venlafaxine XR and significantly better tolerated. These results do not support the hypothesis that nonselective SRIs have greater efficacy than selective SRIs.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^116Mfi2x]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms

Withdrawal symptoms after SSRIs typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks, also with gradual tapering, but the withdrawal symptoms might include late onset and longer persistence of disturbances and may be easily misidentified as signs of impending relapse. There are many similarities between the withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRIs and the withdrawal symptoms associated with antidepressants such as venlafaxine and duloxetine. A recently published review found that a significant proportion of people who experience withdrawal symptoms after treatment with antidepressants do so for more than 2 weeks and that it is not uncommon for people to experience withdrawal for several months. Withdrawal symptoms may be alleviated by reinstating treatment with the antidepressant that triggered the symptoms, and it may for this, and many other reasons, be difficult for some patients to stop taking antidepressants once the treatment has started. Withdrawal symptoms might also explain why some studies have alleged to show that the risk of relapse seems to be reduced if antidepressants are continued instead of not continued. Withdrawal symptoms might be the reason why patients who do not continue antidepressants might do worse compared with patients who continue antidepressants.

### Escitalopram for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^111bwpMw]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in older adults; however, few data exist to guide clinicians in efficacious and safe treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are efficacious for younger adults with GAD, but benefits and risks may be different in older adults.

Objective

To examine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the SSRI escitalopram in older adults with GAD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized controlled trial in primary care practices and related specialty clinics in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, of 177 participants aged 60 years or older with a principal diagnosis of GAD randomized to receive either escitalopram or placebo and conducted between January 2005 and January 2008.

Interventions

Twelve weeks of 10 to 20 mg/d of escitalopram (n = 85) or matching placebo (n = 92).

Main Outcome Measures

Cumulative response defined by Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of much or very much improved; time to response; and anxiety and role functioning changes measured by the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument activity limitations subscale, and the role-emotional impairment and social function subscales of the Medical Outcome Survey 36-item Short Form.

Results

In the primary analytic strategy in which participants (n = 33) were censored at the time of dropout, mean cumulative response rate for escitalopram was 69% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58%-80%) vs 51% (95% CI, 40%-62%) for placebo (P = .03). A conservative intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in mean cumulative response rate between escitalopram and placebo (57%; 95% CI, 46%-67%; vs 45%; 95% CI, 35%-55%; p = 0.11). Participants treated with escitalopram showed greater improvement than with placebo in anxiety symptoms and role functioning (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale: effect size, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.50–1.36; P < .001; Penn State Worry Questionnaire: 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23–0.48; p = 0.01; activity limitations: 0.32; 95% CI, 0.01–0.63; p = 0.04; and the role-emotional impairment and social function: 0.96; 95% CI, 0.03–1.90; p = 0.04). Adverse effects of escitalopram (P < .05 vs placebo) were fatigue or somnolence (35 patients [41.1%]), sleep disturbance (12 [14.1%]), and urinary symptoms (8 [9.4%]).

Conclusions

Older adults with GAD randomized to escitalopram had a higher cumulative response rate for improvement vs placebo over 12 weeks; however, response rates were not significantly different using an intention-to-treat analysis. Further study is required to assess efficacy and safety over longer treatment durations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^112jofy1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP guideline — SSRI switching, monitoring, discontinuation, and treatment duration in children and adolescents with depressive disorders notes that there is "no definitive empirical guidance for switching from one SSRI to another", and while tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second (with a fluoxetine washout) is the most conservative strategy, "Cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored". When a concerning adverse effect could be linked to medication, the dose "would be reduced", and if it persists, the medication "would be discontinued", with monitoring recommended and "no specific laboratory tests" in the absence of relevant comorbidities. For continuation, a generally accepted approach is to continue an effective dose for "approximately 6 to 12 months after remission", with discontinuation "during a relatively stress-free period", and longer maintenance "from more than 1 year to several years or longer" in higher-risk presentations. Discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or abrupt stopping of short-acting SSRIs "notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline", warranting "close adherence… and a slow discontinuation taper", whereas "fluoxetine… is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome" and has not shown withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed.

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Advise patients, their families and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, especially during treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down and instruct them to report such symptoms -to- their healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of escitalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines and St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid) Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinuation Syndrome

Advise patients not to abruptly discontinue escitalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when escitalopram is discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome

During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Seizures

Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinuation Syndrome

Advise patients not to abruptly discontinue escitalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when escitalopram is discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Obsessive-compulsive disorder SRI discontinuation is associated with widely varying reported rates of relapse or discontinuation for insufficient clinical response after double-blind switch to placebo, ranging from 89% within 7 weeks to 24% within 28 weeks. An open discontinuation study reported significantly higher 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year relapse rates for the patients whose SRI treatment was discontinued. Given these observations, discontinuation of pharmacotherapy should be carefully considered, and for most patients, continued treatment of some form is recommended.

### Tapering of SSRI treatment to mitigate withdrawal symptoms [^1178DTWU]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

All classes of drug that are prescribed to treat depression are associated with withdrawal syndromes. SSRI withdrawal syndrome occurs often and can be severe, and might compel patients to recommence their medication. Although the withdrawal syndrome can be differentiated from recurrence of the underlying disorder, it might also be mistaken for recurrence, leading to long-term unnecessary medication. Guidelines recommend short tapers, of between 2 weeks and 4 weeks, down to therapeutic minimum doses, or half-minimum doses, before complete cessation. Studies have shown that these tapers show minimal benefits over abrupt discontinuation, and are often not tolerated by patients. Tapers over a period of months and down to doses much lower than minimum therapeutic doses have shown greater success in reducing withdrawal symptoms. Other types of medication associated with withdrawal, such as benzodiazepenes, are tapered to reduce their biological effect at receptors by fixed amounts to minimise withdrawal symptoms. These dose reductions are done with exponential tapering programmes that reach very small doses. This method could have relevance for tapering of SSRIs. We examined the PET imaging data of serotonin transporter occupancy by SSRIs and found that hyperbolically reducing doses of SSRIs reduces their effect on serotonin transporter inhibition in a linear manner. We therefore suggest that SSRIs should be tapered hyperbolically and slowly to doses much lower than those of therapeutic minimums, in line with tapering regimens for other medications associated with withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms will then be minimised.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^114NToE9]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — pediatric depression FDA approvals, dosing, and response timing — include that medications from the SSRI class marketed in the United States are citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone, and currently only 2 SSRIs are FDA approved for depression in youth: fluoxetine for youth aged 8 years and older and escitalopram for youth aged 12 years and older; most SSRIs have long half-lives permitting single daily dosing, though at low doses of sertraline and at any dose of fluvoxamine youth may require twice-daily dosing to avoid withdrawal side effects; modeling suggests early improvement with two-thirds of benefits by week 2 and maximal benefit by week 4, and this pharmacodynamic profile suggests that 2-month clinical SSRI trials may unnecessarily prolong an ineffective treatment if response or remission is not observed within the first 4 to 6 weeks.

### Escitalopram maintenance treatment for prevention of recurrent depression: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1152DFqR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder is a recurrent illness that often requires maintenance antidepressant treatment. Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has shown efficacy in both acute and continuation treatment of major depressive disorder. The current trial examined the efficacy of maintenance escitalopram treatment in preventing depression recurrence in patients who responded to acute SSRI therapy.

Method

Patients with recurrent DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (≥ 2 previous episodes; baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score ≥ 22) who had responded (MADRS score ≤ 12) to acute open-label treatment (8 weeks) with 1 of 4 SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, or citalopram) received open-label, flexible-dose continuation treatment (16 weeks) with escitalopram (10–20 mg/day). At the end of continuation treatment, patients maintaining response criteria were randomly assigned to 52 weeks of double-blind, fixed-dose maintenance treatment with escitalopram (10 or 20 mg/day) or placebo. Recurrence was defined as a MADRS score ≥ 22 or insufficient therapeutic response during the double-blind phase. The study was conducted between October 16, 2000, and February 4, 2003.

Results

A total of 234 patients who responded to acute open-label treatment with 1 of 4 SSRIs received at least 1 dose of open-label escitalopram continuation treatment. Of 164 patients who completed escitalopram continuation treatment, 139 were randomly assigned to double-blind maintenance treatment with escitalopram (N = 73) or placebo (N = 66). Mean baseline MADRS scores at the start of the maintenance phase were < 5 for both the placebo- and escitalopram-treatment groups. Time to recurrence was significantly longer in patients who received maintenance treatment with escitalopram compared with patients switched to placebo (hazard ratio = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.52, p < .001). Long-term escitalopram treatment was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Maintenance treatment with escitalopram was well tolerated and significantly reduced the risk for recurrence of depression. Patients with few residual symptoms following continuation treatment with escitalopram experienced a high rate of depression recurrence when switched to placebo, demonstrating the need for maintenance therapy of recurrent major depressive disorder beyond 4 to 6 months of initial symptom resolution even if few residual symptoms are present.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^112XAqxs]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Withdrawals

Of the patients continuing into the double-blind period of the study, 74 (40 escitalopram-treated and 34 placebo-treated patients) completed the study, corresponding to completion rates of 80% (escitalopram) and 59% (placebo). The overall withdrawal rate excluding relapses, was comparable for both age groups (7.6% for young-old versus 7.4% for old-old): 5.9% for young-old patients treated with escitalopram (total of 102 patients, 6 withdrawals not due to relapse), and 9.5% for young-old patients treated with placebo (total of 95 patients, 9 withdrawals not due to relapse). For old-old patients, the overall withdrawal rate excluding relapses, was 8.0% for patients treated with escitalopram (total of 50 patients, 4 withdrawals not due to relapse), and 6.9% for patients treated with placebo (total of 58 patients, 4 withdrawals not due to relapse).

Relapse prevention

Old-old patients randomised to double-blind treatment had mean MADRS total scores of 5.8 (both treatment groups) at week 12, compared to 5.0 for young-old patients. For old-old patients, the proportion of patients who relapsed within 24 weeks was significantly higher on placebo (34.5%; 20 out of 58 patients) than on escitalopram (12.0%; 6 out of 50 patients) (chi-square test, χ 2 = 7.426, df = 1, p = 0.006). For young-old patients, the proportion of patients who relapsed within 24 weeks was also significantly higher on placebo (31.6%; 30 out of 95 patients) than on escitalopram (6.9%; 7 out of 102 patients) (chi-square test, χ 2 = 19.698, df = 1, p < 0.001).

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^113e8GsJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The study has clear and relevant implications for clinical practice. The slightly higher percentage of young-old patients achieving complete remission during the open-label phase probably reflects the somewhat higher burden of symptoms that old-old patients have at the start of acute treatment. The comparable (and very low) incidence of adverse events and of adverse event-related withdrawals in old-old and young-old patients in both phases of the study suggests that escitalopram is well-tolerated by old-old depressed patients. Although slightly fewer young-old patients on escitalopram relapsed (6.9% vs 12% in the old-old group), the hazard ratio was only slightly larger (1.2). It is therefore clear that escitalopram is highly effective (compared with placebo) in preventing depressive relapse in old-old patients who remit during acute escitalopram treatment, as shown by the hazard ratio in this sub-group.

### Understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs [^113L17dr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.

### Fixed-dose trial of the single isomer SSRI escitalopram in depressed outpatients [^115Jhu25]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Escitalopram is the single isomer responsible for the serotonin reuptake inhibition produced by the racemic antidepressant citalopram. The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose multicenter trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in the treatment of major depressive disorder.

Method

Outpatients with an ongoing DSM-IV major depressive episode (N = 491) were randomly assigned to placebo, escitalopram, 10 mg/day, escitalopram, 20 mg/day, or citalopram, 40 mg/day, and entered an 8-week double-blind treatment period following a 1-week single-blind placebo lead-in. Clinical response was evaluated by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scales, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), and patient-rated quality-of-life scales.

Results

Escitalopram, at both doses, produced significant improvement at study endpoint relative to placebo on all measures of depression; significant separation of escitalopram from placebo was observed within I week of double-blind treatment. Citalopram treatment also significantly improved depressive symptomatology compared with placebo; however, escitalopram, 10 mg/day, was at least as effective as citalopram, 40 mg/day, at endpoint. Anxiety symptoms and quality of life were also significantly improved by escitalopram compared with placebo. The incidence of discontinuations due to adverse events for the escitalopram 10 mg/day group was not different from the placebo group (4.2% vs. 2.5%; p = .50), and not different for the escitalopram 20 mg/day group and the citalopram 40 mg/day group (10.4% vs. 8.8%; p = .83).

Conclusion

Escitalopram, a single isomer SSRI, is well-tolerated and has demonstrated antidepressant efficacy at a dose of 10 mg/day.

### Cyclic gastrointestinal symptoms induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a case report of menstruation-related adverse effects [^116Shevb]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), yet menstruation‑specific cyclic gastrointestinal symptoms have not been described.

Objective

This report describes, to the best of our knowledge, the first documented case of menstruation-specific exacerbation of cyclic gastrointestinal symptoms associated with SSRI treatment and proposes a pragmatic management approach.

Case Summary

A 20‑year‑old woman with generalized anxiety disorder developed nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dizziness limited to menstrual periods after initiating escitalopram 10 mg/day; gastrointestinal symptoms persisted following a switch to paroxetine 20 mg/day. A comprehensive gynecologic work‑up (pelvic examination, hormonal assessment, and ultrasonography) was unremarkable. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale scored 7, indicating a "probable" menstruation-specific adverse reaction. Reducing paroxetine to 10 mg/day resolved gastrointestinal symptoms, but anxiety symptoms recurred; titration to 15 mg/day achieved psychiatric remission without gastrointestinal symptom recurrence. After 6 months of stability, paroxetine was tapered off without recurrence of either gastrointestinal or anxiety symptoms.

Key Findings

This case demonstrates a menstruation‑modulated SSRI adverse effect mediated by a possible interaction between serotonergic signaling and cyclical sex‑steroid fluctuations.

Implications

An interdisciplinary, stepwise strategy (ruling out gynecologic disease, considering dose optimization, and monitoring menstruation‑linked symptoms) may help balance efficacy with tolerability in reproductive‑age patients. Prospective studies should evaluate SSRI-hormone interactions and menstrual-aware adverse‑effect monitoring.

### ESCITALOPRAM 5mg tablets… [^113D7H3H]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Escitalopram tablets should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Initial Treatment Adolescents The recommended dose of Escitalopram tablets is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of Escitalopram demonstrated the effectiveness of Escitalopram. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks. Adults The recommended dose of Escitalopram tablets is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of Escitalopram demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of Escitalopram, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week. Maintenance Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode.

Systematic evaluation of continuing Escitalopram 10 or 20 mg/day in adults patients with major depressive disorder who responded while taking Escitalopram during an 8-week, acute-treatment phase demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment. 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Escitalopram should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms. In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased.

The recommended dose of Escitalopram in hepatically impaired patients is 10 mg/day. Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with Escitalopram, however, it should be used with caution in such patients.

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram Tablets

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with escitalopram tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

### Antidepressant tapering is not routine but could Be [^1157bh4f]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When antidepressants are discontinued, severe withdrawal symptoms are possible. Some patients have few or no problems stopping, whereas others struggle. That struggle can be minimized or prevented with careful dose tapering. How often is that done?

Methods

Using 7years of medical records, we determined the percentage of patients who received a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant before it was discontinued, as an indicator of a deliberate taper.

Results

Over that period, 8.9% of patients had evidence of tapering. The percentage increased from 4.9% in 2014 to a plateau around 10% in the past 4 years.

Discussion

While reports of severe withdrawal are increasingly recognized and must be addressed, our data suggest that many patients can discontinue their antidepressants without a taper through the lowest dose. However, it is difficult to identify which patients will struggle without a careful taper. A "one-size-fits-all" taper approach is recommended, balancing the need for withdrawal prevention with the need to avoid unnecessary complexity for the majority of patients. The first decrement is key for all patients: it must go well. Thereafter many patients may accelerate but all should receive a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant.

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^111absYG]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers [see also Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Prescriptions for Lexapro should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^117Vhu9P]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder discontinuation and maintenance guidance states that successful medication treatment should be continued for 1–2 years before considering a gradual taper by decrements of 10%–25% every 1–2 months while observing for symptom return or exacerbation [I]. Successful exposure and response prevention (ERP) should be followed by monthly booster sessions for 3–6 months, or more intensively if response has been only partial [II]. Given variability across discontinuation trials, discontinuation of pharmacotherapy should be carefully considered, and for most patients, continued treatment of some form is recommended [III], and the data suggest that CBT consisting of ERP may have more durable effects than some SRIs after discontinuation, although observed differences in relapse rates could be explained by other factors.

Study intervention and clinical visits

Participants were randomized to either escitalopram or placebo in a 2 to 1 allocation. The study statistician (HK) created a sequential predetermined assignment managed by the Vanderbilt Investigational Drug Service to assign participants to each treatment arm. As WMH severity may influence treatment outcomes (Gunning-Dixon et al; Sheline et al; Taylor et al.), randomization was stratified by 'high' or 'low' WMH severity based on a median WMH volume derived from earlier datasets in LLD. The initial cutoff was a WMH volume of 3.86 mL, the median WMH volume observed on 3 T MRI in 145 depressed older adults across prior studies (Chang et al; Taylor et al.). This stratification threshold was adjusted downward to 2.00mL by the end of the study based on the median WMH volume observed in the current study population. Participants, study physicians, and staff were blinded to treatment allocation.

For phase 1, study medication was started at one tablet daily (either 10 mg of over-encapsulated escitalopram or matching placebo), with the option to increase to two tablets daily as early as week 2. The decision to increase the dose was based on change in depression severity, clinical judgment, tolerability, and patient preference. Participants were assessed every two weeks, by telephone at weeks 2 and 6, and in clinic at weeks 4 and 8.

Participants who could not tolerate study medication or did not remit after 8 weeks had their phase 1 drug tapered over one week before progressing to phase 2, an 8-week open-label trial of bupropion, using the 24-h extended dose formulation. Dosage started at 150 mg daily and increased to 300 mg daily in 2–4 weeks if tolerated. Participants had the option to withdraw if they did not tolerate the 300 mg dose. They could continue on the 300 mg dose or increase to a maximum 450 mg daily as early as week 4 if they tolerated the medication and were not experiencing clinical improvement. Study assessments and depression severity scoring through MADRS followed the same protocol as phase 1.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^114xMCMw]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Another difficulty with imipramine dose equivalents is that researchers have used irregular dose groupings: imipramine doses of < 100, 100–199, 200–250, and > 250 mg/day. Introducing these groupings reduces sensitivity to detect dose-response differences, and gives greater weight to those patients that can tolerate higher doses. Imipramine dose equivalents are also based on arbitrary SSRI doses that cannot routinely be prescribed in clinical practice (eg, 45 mg citalopram, 125 mg sertraline, and 33.3 mg fluoxetine). However, other dose standardisation techniques have different limitations; for example, Braun et al compared non-equivalent low (potentially subtherapeutic) SSRI daily doses with standardised doses of the same compound (eg, ≤ 10 mg citalopram (equivalent to 5 mg escitalopram) v ≤ 9 mg escitalopram (equivalent to 18 mg citalopram)). Citalopram is a racemic 50:50 mixture of active S-enantiomer (escitalopram) and inactive R-enantiomer, such that 2 mg of citalopram contains 1 mg of S-citalopram (escitalopram) and 1 mg of R-citalopram. Conversely, Braun et al also categorised a wide range of doses as high in their study, which could have affected their findings — for example, ≥ 40 mg citalopram with ≥ 80 mg fluoxetine. But other systematic reviews have focused on individual SSRIs, using the actual drug dose — therefore, removing interclass and intraclass variations.

Few reviews focus on primary care (ie, general/family practice and outpatients). While some reviews combine primary and secondary care inpatient studies, most lack clarity regarding the study settings. Therefore, the inclusion of inpatient studies could limit the generalisability of their findings to wider primary care populations, as demonstrated by Cheng et al. Other methodological limitations include: inclusion of mild depression studies; non-placebo controlled studies; narrative reviews that might lack a systematic approach; use of data on file, which misses search strategies and misses references, preventing others from replicating the review; assessing and reporting on efficacy but not on adverse effects or dropout rates; and assessing response without reporting remission effects. However, even after considering the potential limitations of previous reviews, this systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis shows an overall consensus that SSRIs demonstrate a flat dose-response effect for efficacy, and poorer acceptability and tolerability as SSRI doses are increased for the treatment of depression.

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Lexapro and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.5 Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with Lexapro. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Lexapro before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4.1)].

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^113PFMwr]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies comparing escitalopram with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

The efficacy of escitalopram in MDD has been compared with that of paroxetine in two randomized, double-blind studies. Escitalopram elicited a statistically significant improvement in MADRS, HAM-D and CGI-severity (CGI-S) scores following 8 weeks of treatment and, in a subgroup of severely depressed patients, significant improvement in MADRS score was detected at 27 weeks. Furthermore, not only was there an increase in the rate of treatment discontinuations owing to adverse events in paroxetine compared with escitalopram-treated patients, but significantly more patients in the paroxetine group withdrew from the study owing to lack of efficacy.

Only two randomized, double-blind studies compared the efficacy of escitalopram with that of fluoxetine and these studies have reported conflicting results. The study byin Chinese patients showed no significant difference between the two treatments at 8 weeks, although escitalopram was superior with respect to both the 'depressed mood' and 'work and interests' items of the HAM-D scale. The second study, byin elderly patients, suggested that although fluoxetine was significantly less efficacious than both escitalopram and placebo, escitalopram in turn was not superior to placebo. The adverse-event profile of the two antidepressants was similar, but there were a greater number of treatment discontinuations with fluoxetine compared with escitalopram owing to either adverse events or lack of efficacy.

A single study has explored the comparative efficacy of escitalopram and sertraline and found no differences between agents. However, in this study a fixed dose of escitalopram of 10 mg/day, which is the lowest therapeutic dose, was compared with sertraline flexibly dosed across its entire recommended dose range of 50–200 mg/day (mean dose at week 8: 144 mg/day). The similarity in the efficacy of these two antidepressants reported in this clinical study may not, therefore, translate into clinical practice.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: consensus panel recommendations for clinical management and additional research [^115KGUcD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation syndrome. This article summarizes recommendations with respect to future research as well as clinical management recommendations for SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Participants

In April 2004, a panel of physicians convened in New York City to discuss recommendations for clinical management of and additional research on SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Evidence

Previous guidance for management of SRI discontinuation syndrome was proposed in 1997 in a consensus meeting also chaired by Alan F. Schatzberg. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles on SRI discontinuation syndrome that have been published since 1997.

Consensus Process

The 2004 panel reviewed important preclinical and clinical studies, discussed prospective investigation of this syndrome in clinical trials, and suggested the establishment of a research network to collect data in naturalistic settings. The panel also reviewed the management recommendations published in 1997 and subsequently updated the recommendations, taking into account the latest clinical data as well as the personal experience of its members with patients.

Conclusions

Additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of SRI discontinuation syndrome and to identify the patient populations and agents that are most affected by this phenomenon. Management strategies include gradual tapering of doses and should emphasize clinical monitoring and patient education.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: why, how, and when [^1163Dsib]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome

If the decision is to withdraw treatment, abrupt discontinuation of central serotonergic neuromodulators (mainly SSRIs and SNRIs) may be associated with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), which consists of various symptoms, including nausea, headache, flulike symptoms, imbalance, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and sensory disturbance like brain zaps and paresthesia.

The ADS is more common using agents with a shorter half-life. So, for the SSRIs, paroxetine, with a half-life of less than a day, is more likely to produce ADS when stopped abruptly. By contrast, fluoxetine has a half-life of 3–4 days, and ADS is less common. Citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline are intermediate and exhibit half-lives of longer than a day but may still require a gradual taper to avoid the uncomfortable symptoms of ADS.

There is no clearly defined strategy for preventing and treating ADS symptoms, and patient attributions to the withdrawal must be considered. The patient who is hypervigilant to withdrawal effects is more likely to have difficulty withdrawing. In addition, when comorbidities such as major depression or anxiety disorders are present, cognitive behavioral therapy or other brain-gut behavior therapies should be used concurrently to supplement the loss of the use of the medication. In addition, self-care behavior interventions like mindfulness, relaxation, and supportive relationships explain up to 20%–30% of the variance in predicting successful discontinuation of the antidepressants.

Some strategies may be helpful. It is better to discontinue the morning dose for a week and then discontinue the evening dose. Another alternative is to switch to an agent with a longer half-life, like fluoxetine when planning to stop another antidepressant. However, in cases where symptoms are severe, sometimes it is necessary to reintroduce the neuromodulator and retry using a slower discontinuation process. Since the lowest dose of duloxetine is 20 mg, we sometimes advocate patients opening the capsule and taking half the dose (10 mg) when continuing the tapering protocol.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^114d1DBD]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acceptability and tolerability

Of the 42 reviews, 28 (67%) assessed and reported the dose-response effects related to acceptability (early treatment discontinuation — dropouts) and tolerability (reported adverse drug effects). All reviews demonstrated that dropouts and adverse drug effects increased with increasing dose (table 2).

At a class and individual SSRI level, the following adverse drug effects were associated with (but not limited to) dose-response effects: nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia. A network meta-analysis identified escitalopram as potentially providing the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability. However, this study considered that escitalopram doses up to 27 mg/day might be more effective, and all SSRIs demonstrated a poor risk-benefit ratio for older adults (age > 70 years old) owing to adverse effects exceeding potential efficacy.

In the six reviews comparing flexible upward dose titration with maintenance dose for individuals not achieving satisfactory symptom resolution or remission, researchers also demonstrated that higher doses were associated with poorer acceptability and tolerability.

Risk of bias

The assessment revealed that the minority (12%, n = 5) of reviews were at low risk of bias (table 2, figure 2 and online supplemental table S3). Four reviews demonstrated a flat dose-response effect for efficacy, and a positive dose-response effect for adverse drug effects and dropouts for all SSRIs. One review, however, indicated that citalopram demonstrated efficacy dose-response to 30 mg/day, and sertraline showed curvy-linear effects peaking at about 75 mg/day. Thirteen (31%) reviews were assessed as having an unclear risk of bias, whereas the majority (57%) had a high risk of bias that was mainly associated with a range of methodological issues.

### Escitalopram continuation treatment prevents relapse of depressive episodes [^116fweq4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for antidepressant use recommend 4 to 6 months of continuation treatment to prevent relapse of depression following symptom resolution. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of continuation escitalopram treatment.

Method

Outpatients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (male or female, aged 18 to 81 years) who had completed 8 weeks of randomized double-blind treatment with escitalopram, citalopram, or placebo entered an 8-week flexible-dose, open-label phase in which all patients received escitalopram (10–20 mg/day). This study was initiated November 3, 1999, and completed April 5, 2001. Patients who met responder criteria (score of ≤ 12 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to escitalopram (at the dose each patient was receiving at the end of the open-label phase) or placebo for 36 weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy variable was time to depression relapse (defined as MADRS score ≥ 22 or discontinuation due to an insufficient therapeutic response) from the start of the double-blind treatment phase.

Results

A total of 502 patients received open-label escitalopram treatment and had at least 1 MADRS assessment. A total of 274 evaluable subjects entered the double-blind treatment phase; 93 received placebo and 181 received escitalopram. Time to depression relapse was significantly longer (p = .013) and the cumulative rate of relapse was significantly lower in patients who received escitalopram (26% escitalopram vs. 40% placebo; hazard ratio = 0.56; p = .01). Escitalopram-treated subjects had significantly lower depression ratings than those of placebo-treated patients. Escitalopram continuation treatment was safe and well tolerated. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 7% for the placebo group and 4% for the escitalopram-treated group.

Conclusion

Continuation treatment with escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse into an episode of major depressive disorder.

### A randomized, double-blind, 6-week prospective pilot study on the efficacy and safety of dose escalation in non-remitters in comparison to those of the standard dose of escitalopram for major depressive disorder [^116w7aV6]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Escalating doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often used to treat patients with a suboptimal response to the standard dose. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of dose escalation of escitalopram, up to 30 mg, in non-remitters with major depressive disorder (MDD) after treatment with the standard dose.

Method

We recruited 98 patients with MDD (aged 18–65 years). After 4 weeks of open-label treatment with 10–20 mg of escitalopram per day, non-remitters [Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score > 10] were randomized 1:1 for double-blind treatment with either escitalopram (30 mg per day) or escitalopram (20 mg per day) plus placebo for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was a change in the total MADRS score.

Results

After 4 weeks of open-label treatment, 12 patients achieved remission, and 36 dropped out, leaving 50 non-remitters, of whom 44 (88%) completed the double-blind study. The primary outcome measure, the least-squares mean (standard error) change in the total MADRS score at week 6 was significantly different (p = 0.046) between the groups [-8.0 (1.2) in the placebo dose-escalation and -11.8 (1.2) in the escitalopram dose-escalation]. The dose escalation of escitalopram was well tolerated. However, the response and remission rates and quality of life showed no significant differences.

Limitations

Small sample size and short follow-up period CONCLUSION: This study suggests that dose escalation of escitalopram up to 30 mg per day may be beneficial for the treatment of depressive symptoms in non-remitters after standard (10–20 mg/day) treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^115sXPGb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — SSRI discontinuation and switching highlight that a discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or acute discontinuation of shorter-acting SSRIs, notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline; accordingly, these medications warrant close adherence to the prescribed regimen and a slow discontinuation taper. In contrast, fluoxetine is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome and has not been associated with withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed. For switching, the most conservative approach would entail tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second, with a washout interval if the first SSRI is fluoxetine; cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^1151WT3V]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for relapse or DS following discontinuation

To our knowledge, based on a systematic review, no consistent empirical evidence links patient characteristics to predicting DS, including residual symptoms, number of prior episodes, and duration of antidepressant use. Length of antidepressant use has been suggested to be a risk factor for some antidepressants, though the data are inconsistent. Possible predictors of relapse following discontinuation are effort-reward decision time and cognitive reactivity, the latter being the most consistent predictor independent of residual symptoms. However, these predictors have not been firmly established.

When to discontinue?

Most guidelines recommend to continue antidepressants for at least 4–6 months after successful acute-phase therapy in patients with first-episode MDD to prevent relapse, and longer periods after recurrent MDD. Nevertheless, there is little evidence supporting a minimum duration of antidepressant treatment after stable remission. Patients with recurrent MDD should stay on treatment longer and sometimes indefinitely.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Consensus supports slow discontinuation of antidepressants, but few randomized studies have compared discontinuation strategies. Most studies employ a rather rapid 2-week tapering period with at most two steps. Compared to abrupt discontinuation, 1–3-week tapering schedules lower DS frequency. Although hyperbolic tapering, which involves decreasing relative dose reductions over time (Supplementary Text), is supported by expert opinion, it lacks evidence. Given the heterogeneity of DS between antidepressants and individual patient variation, general advice would be to slowly taper in those taking antidepressants for longer periods of time (e.g. years), and antidepressants with higher DS risk.

Dose reduction

A meta-analysis of five randomized trials found that dose reductions of phenelzine, maprotiline, imipramine, amineptine, and paroxetine increased the risk of MDD relapse by 62% relative to the group randomized to unchanged continuation.

Discontinuation interventions

A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in time to depression relapse between patients receiving psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) during or after antidepressant tapering, compared to those who continued with antidepressant maintenance therapy only. Another meta-analysis of 12 RCTs showed that MDD patients receiving psychotherapy during antidepressant treatment or tapering had a lower rate of relapse compared to those receiving active controls (antidepressant treatment) or treatment as usual. In conclusion, a (preventive) psychotherapy is as effective as antidepressant maintenance.

### Incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DPAaa]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Background

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms are becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice, but the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms has not been quantified. An estimate of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms incidence could inform patients and clinicians in the discontinuation of treatment, and provide useful information to researchers in antidepressant treatments. We aimed to assess the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms in patients discontinuing both antidepressants and placebo in the published literature.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from database inception until Oct 13, 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), other controlled trials, and observational studies assessing the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms. To be included, studies must have investigated cessation or tapering of an established antidepressant drug (excluding antipsychotics, lithium, or thyroxine) or placebo in participants with any mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder. We excluded studies in neonates, and those using antidepressants for physical conditions such as pain syndromes due to organic disease. After study selection, summary data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation, data were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. The main outcome was the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms after discontinuation of antidepressants or placebo. We also analysed the incidence of severe discontinuation symptoms. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses tested a selection of methodological variables.

Findings

From 6095 articles screened, 79 studies (44 RCTs and 35 observational studies) covering 21002 patients were selected (72% female, 28% male, mean age 45 years [range 19·6–64·5]). Data on ethnicity were not consistently reported. 16532 patients discontinued from an antidepressant, and 4470 patients discontinued from placebo. Incidence of at least one antidepressant discontinuation symptom was 0·31 (95% CI 0·27–0·35) in 62 study groups after discontinuation of antidepressants, and 0·17 (0·14–0·21) in 22 study groups after discontinuation of placebo. Between antidepressant and placebo groups of included RCTs, the summary difference in incidence was 0·08 [0·04–0·12]. The incidence of severe antidepressant discontinuation symptoms after discontinuation of an antidepressant was 0·028 (0·014–0·057) compared with 0·006 (0·002–0·013) after discontinuation of placebo. Desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine, and escitalopram were associated with higher frequencies of discontinuation symptoms, and imipramine, paroxetine, and either desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine were associated with a higher severity of symptoms. Heterogeneity of results was substantial.

Interpretation

Considering non-specific effects, as evidenced in placebo groups, the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms is approximately 15%, affecting one in six to seven patients who discontinue their medication. Subgroup analyses and heterogeneity figures point to factors not accounted for by diagnosis, medication, or trial-related characteristics, and might indicate subjective factors on the part of investigators, patients, or both. Residual or re-emerging psychopathology needs to be considered when interpreting the results, but our findings can inform clinicians and patients about the probable extent of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms without causing undue alarm.

Funding

### Loss of responsiveness on reinstatement of antidepressants after treatment interruption – A systematic review [^114aUpRo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

This open-label study investigated the recurrence of depression and the effect of restarting treatment in older patients with a first episode of major depression. After a tapering period of 8 weeks, patients were followed up for 2 years, and their antidepressant was restarted if depression recurred. Most relapses occurred within 1 year. One of 11 relapsing patients did not respond on re-exposure.

Investigators described an open-label trial where patients in remission from a first episode of major depression discontinued escitalopram over a period of 6 months or more. If depression recurred, escitalopram was restarted. Overall, 43% of patients responded to escitalopram on re-exposure (i.e. 57% did not respond). The authors noted that the mean reduction in HAMD was greater with the initial treatment than with the restarted treatment.

This was an open-label antidepressant restarting phase of a double-blind RCT in patients who met the criteria for DSM-III dysthymia before initial treatment with desipramine. Responders to desipramine were randomised in a double-blind manner to receive either placebo or to continue desipramine. If relapse occurred, then open-label treatment with desipramine was restarted. One of 12 patients who relapsed was unresponsive when desipramine was restarted.

This open-label trial reported initial antidepressant treatment and restarting of antidepressant treatment in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Patients were restarted on their original treatment at the dose that was previously effective for them if relapse occurred during a 6-month follow-up. The authors reported a statistically significant difference in response to antidepressant treatment when comparing the initial treatment episode with their corresponding reinstitution episode. Thirteen of 81 patients (16%) did not respond at all on restarting.

14.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of escitalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

A fixed-dose study compared 10 mg daily escitalopram and 20 mg daily escitalopram to placebo and 40 mg daily citalopram. The 10 mg daily and 20 mg daily escitalopram treatment groups showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg escitalopram groups were similar on this outcome measure.

In a second fixed-dose study of 10 mg daily escitalopram and placebo, the 10 mg daily escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

In a flexible-dose study, comparing escitalopram, titrated between 10 mg and 20 mg daily, to placebo and citalopram, titrated between 20 mg and 40 mg daily, the escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

Data acquisition

Patient-level data from all drug company-sponsored fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trials regarding the treatment of depression in adults that have been conducted for citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine and sertraline were requested from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Brentford, UK; paroxetine), Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA; fluoxetine), Lundbeck (Valby, Denmark; citalopram and escitalopram), Actavis (Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA; escitalopram) and Pfizer (New York, NY, USA; sertraline). Data for fluvoxamine were not requested, as it was deemed sufficient to include those SSRIs that are currently commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression. Whereas the manufacturers of citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline sent us the requested data, individual item data on fluoxetine were unfortunately not available in an electronic format and could hence not be delivered. Although we did obtain patient-level data also from the escitalopram trials conducted by Lundbeck, these were not relevant for this analysis since only one dose (10 mg) had been tested using a fixed-dose design. We have tried to obtain patient-level data from trials sponsored by the other company involved in the clinical trial program for escitalopram, that is, Forest, but the company that has since then acquired Forest, that is, Actavis, has unfortunately not been able to submit the requested information in electronic format. We confirmed that we had access to all pertinent studies regarding citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline by examining the Food and Drug Administration-approval packages for the relevant drugs.

Only two sertraline studies (PZ/101 and PZ/310) comprised a 400-mg dose, and these lasted for 4 weeks only; hence, no efficacy measures were available for this dosage beyond week 4. The polymeric matrix used in paroxetine-controlled-release (CR) releases ~80% of the active compound; the company hence used the doses 12.5 and 25 mg of paroxetine CR, assuming that they should correspond to 10 and 20 mg of paroxetine immediate-release. We have similarly assumed that patients medicating with paroxetine CR 12.5 or 25 mg per day received a daily paroxetine dose of 10 and 20 mg, respectively. None of the studies included a comparator SSRI given in a fixed-dose manner; therefore, for each study only data regarding one compound were obtained.
