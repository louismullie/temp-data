## Question

What is difference in sensetivity for kidney stones if you use US or non contrast CT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference in sensitivity between non-contrast CT and ultrasound for kidney stone detection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the reference standard and its performance characteristics. Then, I should verify ultrasound sensitivity across settings and populations. Next, I will examine head-to-head data to ground the comparison. After that, I should calculate the sensitivity gap and analyze factors that drive ultrasound misses. Finally, I need to integrate guideline perspectives, weigh radiation and low-dose CT options, and close with practical takeaways for typical, pediatric, and pregnancy scenarios [^116P58kz] [^111kMaDx].

> Let me first confirm the reference standard so I don't anchor on a flawed premise; non-contrast CT is widely considered the gold standard for urolithiasis detection, with true non-contrast scans typically showing pooled sensitivity in the 95–100% range in contemporary summaries and meta-analyses, which is the benchmark against which ultrasound should be judged [^117BXjP7] [^117BXjP7].

> Next, I should review ultrasound sensitivity carefully, because it varies by study design, stone location, and population; per-kidney detection in a same-day CT-validated cohort showed 78.9% sensitivity for at-least-one-stone and 70.0% for individual stones, whereas literature pooled analyses focused on anatomic sites found much lower sensitivity around 45% for both ureteric and renal calculi, and pediatric cohorts typically report 66.7–70% sensitivity overall with higher sensitivity for Doppler "twinkle" artifact but a risk of false positives and incomplete specificity characterization [^111qJB1i] [^1127gxL4] [^113GURr7] [^113r5Fsh] [^115zcTmy].

> I will now examine a key head-to-head study to ground this; in a 155-patient, within-24-hours comparison, my first read says "NC detected stones in % of patients where US missed them", but wait, let me verify because that looks garbled; on re-check, both US and NCCT identified a stone in 51.0% of patients, 37.4% had a stone on NCCT but not on US, and only 1.3% had a stone on US but not on NCCT, with the average NCCT size of stones missed on US being 4.5 mm, confirming a substantial proportion of US false negatives are small stones [^112wPrU3].

> Hold on, I should quantify the sensitivity gap explicitly; if CT is 95–100% sensitive and ultrasound ranges from about 79% per kidney in best-case settings, to around 70% in typical mixed settings, down to roughly 45% for ureteral stones, the absolute sensitivity difference spans approximately 16–21 percentage points in best-case use, 25–30 points in typical practice, and 50–55 points for ureteral stones, which is clinically meaningful across scenarios [^114c9Sia] [^111qJB1i] [^1127gxL4].

> Let me consider why ultrasound underperforms; I need to ensure I capture size, location, and operator effects: ultrasound disproportionately misses smaller stones, especially those ≤ 5 mm, and accuracy is reduced for ureteral stones, with operator dependence and skin-to-stone distance contributing to error, and importantly, ultrasound systematically overestimates stone size by about 1.9–2.2 mm versus CT, which can misguide management thresholds if uncorrected [^1127gxL4] [^112wPrU3].

> Next, I should review guidelines so we don't jump to conclusions based only on sensitivity; European Association of Urology guidance endorses ultrasound first due to safety and accessibility but advises non-contrast CT to confirm diagnosis and characterize stones in acute flank pain or when decisions hinge on precise stone features, while multispecialty consensus supports ultrasound or no further imaging in many scenarios and reserves CT for selected cases, and ACR recommends ultrasound first in pregnancy with consideration of Doppler, MR urography, or unenhanced CT if needed [^116P58kz] [^111kMaDx] [^111iVYkS] [^111Jc1PK] [^112vwgDG].

> But wait, I should balance diagnostic accuracy against radiation; CT's sensitivity advantage is undeniable, yet repeated CT exposes patients to cumulative ionizing radiation, so when CT is indicated, low-dose and ultra-low-dose protocols can maintain high sensitivity for stones at substantially reduced effective doses, mitigating risk while preserving diagnostic certainty in equivocal or management-determining scenarios [^113PxCYL] [^11178row] [^113ikPXY].

> I should double-check the practical clinical implications so they are actionable; in routine adult care, ultrasound will miss roughly 3–5 out of 10 stones that CT would detect, particularly small (≤ 5 mm) and ureteral stones, and ultrasound tends to over-call size by about 2 mm, so if management thresholds are tight, confirmatory CT is appropriate; conversely, for initial screening where radiation is a concern and clinical suspicion is moderate, ultrasound is reasonable with close follow-up and escalation to CT if symptoms persist or complications are suspected [^112wPrU3] [^1127gxL4] [^111qJB1i].

> For special populations, I need to ensure alignment with best practice; in children and adolescents, ultrasound remains first-line given radiation considerations, recognizing sensitivities around 67–70% and the adjunctive value of twinkle artifact with caution about false positives, and in pregnancy, ultrasound is the initial modality with escalation to Doppler, MR urography, or carefully selected unenhanced CT when maternal-fetal risk-benefit justifies it [^113GURr7] [^113r5Fsh] [^112vwgDG].

> In summary, let me reconsider the core answer to ensure consistency: non-contrast CT detects urinary stones with about 95–100% sensitivity, whereas ultrasound spans roughly 45–79% depending on stone size, location, and operator factors, yielding an absolute sensitivity gap of about 16–55 percentage points; the stones that ultrasound most often misses are small and ureteral, ultrasound overestimates stone size by about 2 mm, and guidelines endorse ultrasound first with selective use of CT for confirmation or planning when results affect management or suspicion remains high after a negative ultrasound [^114c9Sia] [^111qJB1i] [^1127gxL4] [^112wPrU3] [^116P58kz] [^111kMaDx].

Non-contrast CT is the **gold standard** [^111kMaDx] for kidney stone detection, with **sensitivity 95–100%** [^117BXjP7] and **specificity 94–100%**. Ultrasound has lower sensitivity (45–70%) [^1127gxL4] but high specificity (88–94%) [^111qJB1i]; it is radiation-free and suitable for initial assessment [^116P58kz], pregnancy [^112vwgDG], and pediatrics [^113GURr7]. CT is superior [^111TVuQr] for small (< 5 mm) [^113GURr7] and ureteral stones [^1127gxL4], whereas ultrasound is less accurate for these and may overestimate size [^112wPrU3]. Use ultrasound first in **low-risk or radiation-sensitive patients** [^116P58kz] [^112vwgDG], and reserve CT for inconclusive cases [^111iVYkS] or when precise stone characterization is needed [^11178row].

| **Attribute** | **Non-contrast CT** | **Ultrasound** |
|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 95–100% [^117BXjP7] | 45–70% [^1127gxL4] |
| Specificity | 94–100% | 88–94% [^1127gxL4] |
| Radiation exposure | Yes [^113ikPXY] | No [^112vwgDG] |
| Clinical use | - Gold standard [^111kMaDx] <br/> - Detects small and ureteral stones [^1127gxL4] <br/> - Precise sizing [^113oDFxc] | - Initial assessment [^116P58kz] <br/> - Pregnancy [^112vwgDG] <br/> - Pediatrics [^113GURr7] <br/> - May miss small/ureteral stones [^1127gxL4] |

### Ultrasonography significantly overestimates stone size when compared to low-dose, noncontrast computed tomography [^112wPrU3]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the differences between low-dose noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and renal ultrasound (US) in the identification and measurement of urinary calculi, a retrospective review was conducted at three institutions of patients evaluated for flank pain with both renal US and NCCT, within one day of one another, from 2012 to 2015. Stone presence and size were compared between imaging modalities. Stone size was determined by the largest measured diameter, and stones were grouped into size categories (≤ 5mm, 5.1–10mm, and > 10mm) based on NCCT and compared with US. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-sided t tests.

One hundred fifty-five patients received both a renal US and NCCT within 1 day.

- **Comparison of imaging modalities**: In 79 patients (51.0%), both US and NCCT identified a stone for size comparison. Fifty-eight patients (37.4%) had a stone visualized on NCCT but not on US, and 2 patients (1.3%) had a stone documented on US but not seen on NCCT. The average NCCT size of the stones missed on US was 4.5mm. When comparing the average largest stone diameter for US (9.1mm) versus NCCT (6.9mm), US overestimated stone size by 2.2mm.

US significantly overestimated stone size, and this was most pronounced for small (≤ 5mm) stones. The potential for systematic overestimation of stone size with standard US techniques should be taken into consideration when evaluating endourologic treatment options.

### Limitations to ultrasound in the detection and measurement of urinary tract calculi [^1127gxL4]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate differences in stone measurement using computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US), axial unenhanced helical CT is the reference-standard imaging modality for the assessment of urinary tract calculi; however, US is also commonly used. Differences in stone measurement using these techniques are poorly described, and contributors to measurement error remain unknown.

All patients at our institution undergoing both abdominal CT and renal US less than 1 month apart since June 2004 were reviewed. Solitary renal calculi were identified on both CT and US in all cases. We identified 71 calculi in 60 patients. Compared with CT, US overestimated stone size, an effect that was more pronounced with smaller calculi. The mean stone measurement on CT was 7.4 ± 4.4 mm, and on US, it was 9.2 ± 4.5 mm (P = 0.018). For stones ≤ 5 mm, US measurements were a mean of 1.9 ± 1.2 mm greater than CT (P < 0.001). US and CT measurements were discordant for 60% of stones ≤ 5 mm. Discordance was associated with US measurement of skin-to-stone distance (P = 0.018), but not body mass index (P = 0.189) or location within the urinary tract (P = 0.161). A review of the literature revealed that US has a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 45% and 94%, respectively, for the detection of ureteric calculi and 45% and 88%, respectively, for renal calculi.

US overestimates stone size in urolithiasis, a finding that may have implications for stone management. Discordance in stone measurement varies with size and is greatest in stones ≤ 5 mm.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound in patients suspected of having kidney stones. An unenhanced helical CT should be obtained to determine the Hounsfield Units (HUs), which provides information about the possible stone composition.

### The efficacy of ultrasonography for the detection of renal stone [^111qJB1i]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of ultrasonography (US) for detecting renal stones using noncontrast enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) as a standard reference.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective study of 428 patients who underwent NCCT and US imaging on the same day from January 2009 to September 2011. The sensitivity of US to detect each individual stone and at least one stone per kidney was evaluated. The detection rates according to the location and stone size were also examined. We compared the sizes of stones determined in the longest axis of NCCT and US, and performed group classification based on size to examine whether stone sizes measured by NCCT and US were similar.

- **Results**: Of 856 kidneys, NCCT detected 474 stones in 361 kidneys, while US detected 332 out of 474 stones detected by NCCT, yielding a sensitivity of 70.0% and a specificity of 94.4%. Similarly, US alone detected at least one stone in 285 kidneys, yielding a sensitivity of 78.9% and a specificity of 83.7%. The detection rate for the left upper calyx was lower than that for other sites (P = 0.002), and the detection rate increased with stone size. Furthermore, stone sizes obtained by US were positively correlated with those obtained by CT, and stone size measurement by NCCT and US was concordant in 240 of 332 cases (72%). Importantly, stone size was the only factor that affected renal stone diagnosis using US.

The conclusion of this study is that US is an effective imaging modality for detecting renal stones.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BXjP7]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Haematuria is a common finding in clinical practice and can be described as visible or microscopic. The prevalence of microscopic haematuria varies from 1% to 18%, depending on patient age, gender, and rate of testing. Clinical differentials for microscopic haematuria include urinary calculi, malignancy, and strictures. Urolithiasis is particularly common, affecting the Australian population with an incidence of 0.13% per year. The lifetime prevalence of urinary calculi is higher for males (15%) compared to females (8%).

Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard imaging test for microscopic haematuria as it can diagnose urinary calculi, renal masses, and urothelial tumours. CT urography has a reported low diagnostic yield of 22.1% for a clinically significant cause of haematuria. A contemporary multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) urogram protocol consists of a non-contrast scan and one or two subsequent acquisitions after the intravenous administration of iodinated contrast. The true non-contrast CT scan (tNCT) is performed to identify urinary calculi. Bhojani et al. reported that tNCT alone has a sensitivity of 95–100% for the detection of urinary calculi. Either combined (dual phase) or separate nephrographic and late excretory phase acquisitions are then performed to identify renal masses and urothelial tumours.

A disadvantage of CT urography is the radiation dose, which can be up to three times that of a routine CT abdomen scan due to the multiple phases required. Advances in CT technology have given rise to the development of dual-energy (DE) and spec-

### Recent finding and new technologies in nephrolithiasis: A review of the recent literature [^114a8sz3]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography is a well-recognized diagnostic tool and is usually the first imaging modality during diagnostic work-up. It is a safe and useful option in both pediatric and pregnant populations, for whom it is the imaging modality of choice. Further studies have refined the diagnostic usefulness of ultrasonography in localizing distal ureter calculi by imaging transrectally and transvaginally. Mitterberger et al. placed ultrasound transducers with three-dimensional and volume scanning capabilities transvaginally in female patients and transrectally in males. The team was able to exhibit stones with 100% sensitivity, improving diagnosis in patients examined with transabdominal ultrasound and intravenous urogram (IVU), which together had 81% sensitivity.

An in vitro study is developing a promising modality to facilitate spontaneous clearance of kidney stones and increased clearance of residual stone fragments after surgical management. Shan et al. presented a novel method and device to reposition kidney stones using ultrasound radiation force delivered by focused ultrasound and guided by ultrasound imaging. The feasibility of repositioning stones was investigated by implanting artificial and human stones into a kidney-mimicking phantom that simulated a lower pole and collecting system. During the experiment, stones were located using ultrasound imaging and repositioned by delivering short bursts of focused ultrasound. Stones were observed to move immediately after delivering focused ultrasound and were successfully repositioned.

### Imaging in suspected renal colic: Systematic review of the literature and multispecialty consensus [^111iVYkS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Renal colic is common, and CT is frequently utilized when the diagnosis of kidney stones is suspected. CT is accurate but exposes patients to ionizing radiation and has not been shown to alter either interventional approaches or hospital admission rates. This multi-organizational transdisciplinary collaboration sought evidence-based, multispecialty consensus on optimal imaging across different clinical scenarios in patients with suspected renal colic in the acute setting.

- **Methods**: In conjunction with the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) eQual network, we formed a nine-member panel with three physician representatives each from ACEP, the ACR, and the American Urology Association. A systematic literature review was used as the basis for a three-step modified Delphi process to seek consensus on optimal imaging in 29 specific clinical scenarios.

- **Results**: From an initial search yielding 6,337 records, there were 232 relevant articles of acceptable evidence quality to guide the literature summary. At the completion of the Delphi process, consensus agreement was rated as perfect in 15 (52%), excellent in 8 (28%), good in 3 (10%), and moderate in 3 (10%) of the 29 scenarios. There were no scenarios where at least moderate consensus was not reached. CT was recommended in 7 scenarios (24%), with ultrasound in 9 (31%) and no further imaging needed in 12 (45%).

- **Summary**: Evidence and multispecialty consensus support ultrasound or no further imaging in specific clinical scenarios, with reduced-radiation dose CT to be employed when CT is needed in patients with suspected renal colic.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^114B88UM]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Hematuria and urolithiasis rank among the most common urologic diagnoses, with urolithiasis being one of the leading causes of hematuria. While the prevalence of hematuria has been reported between 2.4% and 31.1%, the lifetime prevalence of urolithiasis is approximately 15% in developed countries. In patients with suspected urolithiasis, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is recommended. For patients with hematuria and a high risk for genitourinary malignancy, multiphasic CT is advocated by international guidelines authored by the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association, respectively. Due to the rising prevalence of urolithiasis and a high rate of recurrence of up to 50%, limiting radiation exposure in these and other urologic patients is a major concern.

In recent decades, technical advances have allowed for extensive investigations regarding the reduction of radiation dose in computed tomography. This has led to the implementation of low-dose scanning protocols for patients with suspected urolithiasis in the international guideline by the EAU. On the contrary, the radiation dose of multiphasic CT in patients with hematuria, which includes non-contrast, parenchymal, and excretory phases, still exhibits a high radiation dose. Here, virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) of the excretory phase derived from dual-energy CT systems have shown promising results in urinary stone detection, potentially replacing true non-contrast scans. More recently, split-bolus protocols have been described to further reduce radiation dose by combining the parenchymal and excretory phases.

### Urinary tract stones — part I: Role of radiological imaging in diagnosis and treatment planning [^113GJxZG]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

The modern management of urolithiasis requires a multidisciplinary approach. Imaging plays a central role in both the diagnosis and planning of therapy for renal and ureteric calculi. This article reviews the status of diagnosis and management of stone disease, and the contribution of radiological imaging in accurately triaging a given case to the most appropriate therapy.

### Progress in the use of helical CT for imaging urinary calculi [^113stMui]. Journal of Endourology (2004). Low credibility.

Helical CT has become the preferred method to diagnose urinary calculi in patients presenting with abdominal or flank pain. Recent in vitro studies have shown that CT can also display the internal structure in stones with remarkable detail. Because some stones respond better to SWL than others, knowing stone structure at diagnosis could be helpful in choosing among treatment options. This paper examines the potential for CT to be used in this way.

Older CT technology proved to be problematic, in that all studies using low-resolution CT suffer from an artifact where stone size affects apparent CT attenuation values. Thus, the observation that stones with low measured CT attenuation break more easily than stones with high attenuation could be entirely attributable to an artifact of stone size. Most stones are composed of more than one mineral, and heterogeneity of composition may contribute to variability in stone response to SWL. While older technology is not useful in evaluating stone composition, emerging CT machines have sufficient resolution to determine the composition and structure of stones inside the patient, provided proper viewing windows are used. Continuing improvement in image resolution in helical CT promises to provide information about stone composition and structure that will ultimately lead to better care for patients with stone disease.

### Imaging advances in urolithiasis [^116CA3qi]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of urinary stones in the United States has been described as 1 in 11 persons reporting a history of stones. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis, management, and follow-up for these patients, and imaging technology over the last 100 years has advanced as the disease prevalence has increased. CT remains the gold standard for imaging urolithiasis, and changes in this technology, with the addition of multidetector CT and dual-energy CT, as well as changes in utilization of CT, have decreased the radiation dose encountered by patients and allowed for improved stone detection. The use of digital tomography has been introduced for follow-up of recurrent stone formers, offering the potential to lower radiation exposure over the course of a patient's lifelong treatment. However, there is still a demand for improved imaging techniques to detect smaller stones and stones in larger patients at lower radiation doses, as well as the continued need for the judicious use of all imaging modalities for healthcare cost containment and patient safety.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114c9Sia]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Two authors, K.M. and K.D., reviewed the included studies and independently applied a customized Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. The 12 QUADAS criteria were marked as 'yes', 'no', or 'unclear'. The four key areas of focus were patient selection, reference standard, index test, and review bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus discussion.

- **Data analysis**: Data was presented in all included studies on a per-calculus rather than per-patient or per-segmental basis. Pooling of data to generate combined estimates was performed only for sensitivity, defined as TP/(TP + FN). Pooled specificity analysis was not able to be performed as TN results were not reported in any of the included studies for per-calculus level.

Meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled sensitivity and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model with DerSimonian and Laird weights. The Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation of the raw proportions was employed to stabilize the variances and allow appropriate use of normal approximation procedures for proportions close to 100%.

Heterogeneity, in the form of between-study variation, was measured using the I² index, estimated by an inverse variance fixed-effects model. Levels were defined by Higgins et al, with low at 75%. Sources of heterogeneity were explored, including their effect on sensitivity.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^113oDFxc]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding CT-based size measurements, the mean ICC was 0.923 (0.907–0.936), indicating excellent interrater reliability. Across all stones, the manually measured size was 6.7 ± 2.8 mm, ranging from 3.0 to 14.0 mm, while CT-based measurements were higher when averaging all reconstructions (7.1 ± 3.5 mm; p < 0.05).

### Acoustic shadowing in pediatric kidney stone ultrasound: A retrospective study with non-enhanced computed tomography as reference standard [^113r5Fsh]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The usefulness of acoustic shadowing as a feature of pediatric kidney stone ultrasound (US) may be underestimated. The hypothesis was that the majority of stones in children have acoustic shadowing and that its specificity is high (> 90%) in pediatric kidney stones.

- **Materials and methods**: Our retrospective observational study included children who had undergone abdominal non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for kidney stones in a pediatric renal stone referral center between 2015 and 2016. US examinations prior to CT were retrospectively assessed for US features such as acoustic shadowing, twinkle artifact, and stone size. These features were compared to CT as the reference standard.

- **Results**: Thirty-one patients (median age: 13 years, range: 1–17 years) with 77 suspected kidney stones were included. The median stone size was 5 mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 5 mm). For acoustic shadowing, the sensitivity was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 56–80%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI 56–100%). All kidney stones with a diameter ≥ 9 mm demonstrated shadowing. Sensitivity for the twinkle artifact was 88% (95% CI 72–96%), but specificity for the twinkle artifact could not be calculated due to the lack of true negatives. All false-positive stones on US demonstrated a twinkle artifact, but none showed shadowing.

- **Conclusion**: Acoustic shadowing was demonstrated in the majority of pediatric kidney stones. Specificity was high, but this was not significant. The twinkle artifact is a sensitive US tool for detecting pediatric kidney calculi but presents a risk of false-positive findings.

### Detection of different kidney stone types: an ex vivo comparison of ultrashort echo time MRI to reference standard CT [^112p85fW]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

With the development of ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequences, it may now be possible to detect kidney stones using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, kidney stones of varying composition and sizes were imaged using both UTE MRI and the reference standard of computed tomography (CT), with different surrounding materials and scan setups.

- **Methods**: One hundred fourteen kidney stones were inserted into agarose and urine phantoms and imaged both on a dual-energy CT (DECT) scanner using a standard renal stone imaging protocol and on an MRI scanner using the UTE sequence with both head and body surface coils. A subset of the stones representing all composition types and sizes was then inserted into the collecting system of porcine kidneys and imaged in vitro with both CT and MRI.

- **Results**: All of the stones were visible on both CT and MRI imaging. DECT was capable of differentiating between uric acid and non-uric acid stones. In MRI imaging, the choice of coil and large field of view (FOV) did not affect stone detection or image quality. The MRI images showed good visualization of the stones' shapes, and the stones' dimensions measured from MRI were in good agreement with the actual values (R² = 0.886, 0.895, and 0.81 in the agarose phantom, urine phantom, and pig kidneys, respectively). The measured T2 relaxation times ranged from 4.2 to 7.5 ms, but did not show significant differences among different stone composition types.

- **Conclusions**: UTE MRI compared favorably with the reference standard CT for imaging stones of different compositions and sizes.

### Non-contrast CT attenuation value of renal papilla is a novel predictor of recurrence in kidney stone disease [^1166JVYM]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, Hounsfield unit (HU) value of the renal papilla correlated with recurrence in calcium oxalate stone formers in our cohort. HU value of the renal papilla may be a simple and effective means of identifying patients with a higher risk of stone formations and facilitating changes in clinical management for these patients.

### Ultra-low-dose CT: An effective follow-up imaging modality for ureterolithiasis [^113PxCYL]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Classically, abdominal X-ray (KUB), ultrasound, or a combination of both have been routinely used for ureteral stone surveillance after initial diagnosis. More recently, ultra-low-dose CT (ULD CT) has emerged as a CT technique that reduces radiation dose while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity for urinary stone detection. We aim to evaluate our initial experience with ULD CT for patients with ureterolithiasis, measuring real-world radiation doses and stone detection performance.

- **Methods**: We reviewed all ULD CT scans performed at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System between 2016 and 2018. We included patients with ureteral stones and calculated the mean effective radiation dose per scan. We determined stone location and size, if the stone was visible on the associated KUB or CT scout film, and if hydronephrosis was present. We performed logistic regression to identify variables associated with visibility on KUB or CT scout film and hydronephrosis.

- **Results**: One hundred eighteen ULD scans were reviewed, of which 50 detected ureteral stones. The mean effective radiation dose was 1.04 ± 0.41 mSv. Of the ULD CTs that detected ureterolithiasis, 38% lacked visibility on KUB/CT scout film and had no associated hydronephrosis, suggesting that they would be missed with a combination of KUB and ultrasound. Larger stones (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 1.96 for every 1mm increase in stone size) were more likely to be detected by KUB/CT scout film or ultrasound, while stones in the distal ureter (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: incomplete information).

### The accuracy and prognostic value of point-of-care ultrasound for nephrolithiasis in the emergency department: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158YXyU]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been suggested as an initial investigation in the management of renal colic. Our objectives were to determine the accuracy of POCUS for the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and to assess its prognostic value in the management of renal colic.

- **Methods**: The review protocol was registered to the PROSPERO database (CRD42016035331). An electronic database search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed was conducted utilizing subject headings, keywords, and synonyms that address our research question. Bibliographies of included studies and narrative reviews were manually examined. Studies of adult emergency department patients with renal colic symptoms were included. Any degree of hydronephrosis was considered a positive POCUS finding. Accepted criterion standards were computed tomography evidence of renal stone or hydronephrosis, direct stone visualization, or surgical findings. Screening of abstracts, quality assessment with the QUADAS-2 instrument, and data extraction were performed by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Test performance was assessed by pooled sensitivity and specificity, calculated likelihood ratios, and a summary receiver operator curve (SROC). The secondary objective of prognostic value was reported as a narrative summary.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^115Esah5]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are estimated to occur at some point in nearly 1 in 11 people in the United States, with flank or kidney pain resulting in over two million annual visits to the emergency department. Computed tomography (CT) has been described as the "best imaging study to confirm the diagnosis of a urinary stone" and is now the first-line imaging study for suspected kidney stones in the United States. Though accurate, CT is costly, involves the use of ionizing radiation, and does not seem to have impacted patient-centered outcomes, such as rates of diagnosis or hospital admission, in those with suspected kidney stones.

Many patients with flank pain will not benefit from a CT scan, as most kidney stones will pass spontaneously. Moreover, it is unlikely that a CT scan in the setting of flank pain will detect acutely important alternative findings in patients without signs of infection. Hence, an objective clinical prediction rule for renal colic that could reliably identify patients highly likely to have a ureteral stone (and thus unlikely to have an important alternative diagnosis) may allow patients to be safely managed without imaging, or imaged with other approaches such as ultrasonography or reduced dose CT.

We derived and validated a clinical prediction score for ureteral stones that cause symptoms, identifying patients with either a very high or very low probability of having an uncomplicated ureteral stone. We hypothesized that patients who are highly likely to have a kidney stone are unlikely to harbor an important alternative diagnosis and may be appropriately managed without CT imaging.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115snFMF]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Eligible studies and quality assessment**: Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA flow diagram used for study eligibility. The search strategy identified 3,374 articles. From these, 1,750 were found to be duplicates and subsequently excluded. After the title and abstract of the remaining 1,624 articles were analyzed, 1,610 were removed based on the described inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full text was analyzed for the remaining 15 articles. Two of the 15 articles were not written in English and therefore excluded. The reference list of all review articles was also checked manually for additional articles, but no additional suitable publications for inclusion were identified. Two articles by the same author were both included as the data collection periods for these studies did not overlap.

- **QUADAS assessments**: Thirty-two of the 132 QUADAS assessments across the remaining 12 studies were classed as 'no' or 'unclear'. No studies were excluded from the meta-analysis based on the QUADAS tool assessment.

- **Data extraction**: Table 3 summarizes the characteristics of the included studies, while Appendix 1 details the data extracted about the different technical parameters of each study. Table 4 summarizes the data extracted from the studies regarding the sensitivity of the detection of urinary calculi.

Note: *Diagnostic accuracy (per calculus) is reported as sensitivity. "NA" denotes data not applicable or not provided in the article.

### Imaging in suspected renal colic: Systematic review of the literature and multispecialty consensus [^111Jc1PK]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Renal colic is common, and CT (computerized tomography) is frequently utilized when the diagnosis of kidney stone is suspected. While CT is accurate, it exposes patients to ionizing radiation and has not been shown to alter interventional approaches or hospital admission rates. This multi-organizational, transdisciplinary collaboration sought evidence-based, multispecialty consensus on optimal imaging across different clinical scenarios in patients with suspected renal colic in the acute setting.

- **Materials and methods**: In conjunction with the ACEP (American College of Emergency Physicians®) E-QUAL (Emergency Quality Network), we formed a nine-member panel with three physician representatives each from the ACEP, the ACR® (American College of Radiology), and the AUA (American Urological Association). A systematic literature review served as the basis for a three-step modified Delphi process to seek consensus on optimal imaging in 29 specific clinical scenarios.

- **Results**: From an initial search yielding 6,337 records, there were 232 relevant articles of acceptable evidence quality to guide the literature summary. By the completion of the Delphi process, consensus agreement was rated as perfect in 15 (52%), excellent in 8 (28%), good in 3 (10%), and moderate in 3 (10%) of the 29 scenarios. There were no scenarios where at least moderate consensus was not reached. CT was recommended in 7 scenarios (24%), ultrasound in 9 (31%), and no further imaging was needed in 13 (45%).

- **Conclusions**: Evidence and multispecialty consensus support ultrasound or no further imaging in specific scenarios.

### Dual-energy CT kidney stone characterization-can diagnostic accuracy be achieved at low radiation dose [^11178row]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Dual-energy CT stone analysis indicates that a total of 225 out of 227 kidney stones were correctly classified by the dual-energy CT analysis. There was one false positive and one false negative uric acid stone classification. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 1.0 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.00), respectively, demonstrating that the accuracy to discriminate a uric acid from a non-uric acid stone was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00). Notably, eighty-two of 84 stones with a diameter of ≤ 3 mm were correctly classified.

A total of 14 stones were not automatically color-coded by the DECT software algorithm. These stones were significantly smaller, with a mean length and width of 1.9 ± 0.3 mm and 1.6 ± 0.3 mm, respectively, and had a significantly lower CT attenuation (mean 372 ± 185 HU) compared to the automatically detected stones (mean 932 ± 326 HU) (both p < 0.001). Thirteen of these stones were non-uric acid stones. After optimizing the resolution parameter, all 14 stones were color-coded. Of these, 12 stones were correctly classified. The two falsely classified stones were small, with a length and width of 2.2 mm × 1.6 mm and 2.3 mm × 1.9 mm, respectively. Both stones were imaged on the second-generation dual-source DECT.

### Detection of residual stones after percutaneous nephrolithotomy: Role of nonenhanced spiral computerized tomography [^111TVuQr]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

We addressed the impact of stone density and size on the role of computerized tomography for diagnosing residual stones after percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

- **Materials and methods**: We prospectively evaluated 100 renal units that underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The study included 55 opaque and 45 lucent or faint stones. Patients were examined after the procedure by plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, linear tomography, ultrasound, and spiral computerized tomography. Minute residual stones were defined as 1 or 2 caliceal stones less than 5 mm, as measured by computerized tomography.

- **Results**: Stone-free status was achieved in 38 renal units. Minute and significant residual stones were detected in 26 and 36 renal units, respectively. For faint and lucent stones, sensitivity for overall stone detection was 100% for computerized tomography, 11.1% for plain x-ray, 22.2% for linear tomography, and 22.2% for ultrasound (p < 0.05). Sensitivity for detecting significant residual stones was 100% for computerized tomography, 20% for plain x-ray, 33.3% for linear tomography, and 20% for ultrasound (p < 0.05). For opaque stones, sensitivity for overall stone detection was 100% for computerized tomography, 62.9% for plain x-ray, 74.3% for linear tomography, and 48.6% for ultrasound (p < 0.05). Sensitivity for detecting significant residual stones was 100% for computerized tomography, 85.7% for plain x-ray (p not significant), 95.2% for linear tomography (p not significant), and 57.1% for ultrasound (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Computerized tomography provides the most sensitive detection method for residual stones.

### Dual-energy CT kidney stone characterization-can diagnostic accuracy be achieved at low radiation dose [^115PqGAK]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

To assess the accuracy of low-dose dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in differentiating uric acid from non-uric acid kidney stones, stone composition analysis was used as the reference standard. Patients who underwent low-dose unenhanced DECT for the detection or follow-up of urolithiasis, along with stone extraction and composition analysis between January 2020 and January 2022, were retrospectively included. Collected stones were characterized using X-ray diffraction. Metrics such as size, volume, CT attenuation, and stone characterization were assessed using DECT post-processing software. Classification as uric acid or non-uric acid stones was compared to the reference standard of stone composition analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of stone classification were computed. The dose length product (DLP) and effective dose served as radiation dose estimates.

A total of 227 stones from 203 patients were analyzed. Stone composition analysis identified 15 uric acid and 212 non-uric acid stones. The mean size and volume were measured to be 4.7 mm × 2.8 mm and 114 mm³, respectively. CT attenuation of uric acid stones was significantly lower compared to non-uric acid stones (p < 0.001). Two hundred twenty-five of the 227 kidney stones were correctly classified by DECT. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 1.0 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.00), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00), respectively. Among stones with a diameter of ≤ 3 mm, 82 of 84 were correctly classified. The mean DLP was 162 ± 57 mGy*cm and the effective dose was calculated.

### Radiological imaging of patients with suspected urinary tract stones: National trends, diagnoses, and predictors [^1123vwPa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Overutilization of computed tomography (CT) is a growing public health concern due to increasing health care costs and exposure to radiation; these must be weighed against the potential benefits of CT for improving diagnoses and treatment plans. This study aimed to determine the national trends of CT and ultrasound (US) utilization for the assessment of suspected urolithiasis in emergency departments (EDs) and whether these trends are accompanied by changes in diagnosis rates for urolithiasis or other significant disorders and hospitalization rates.

This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of ED visits from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) between 1996 and 2007. The authors determined the proportion of patient visits for flank or kidney pain receiving CT or US testing and calculated the diagnosis and hospitalization rates for urolithiasis and other significant disorders. Patient-specific and hospital-level variables associated with the use of CT were examined.

Utilization of CT to assess patients with suspected urolithiasis increased from 4.0% to 42.5% over the study period (p < 0.05). However, the hospitalization rate (approximately 11%, p = 0.49) did not change significantly. The following characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving CT testing.

### EAU guidelines on diagnosis and conservative management of urolithiasis [^111rED3m]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) has become the first choice for detection of ureteral calculi. Conservative observational management of renal stones is possible, although the availability of minimally invasive treatment often leads to active treatment. Acute renal colic due to ureteral stone obstruction is an emergency that requires immediate pain management. Medical expulsive therapy (MET) for ureteral stones can support spontaneous passage in the absence of complicating factors. These guidelines summarize recommendations for imaging, pain management, conservative treatment, and MET for renal and ureteral stones. Oral chemolysis is an option for uric acid stones.

The objective is to evaluate the optimal measures for diagnosis and conservative and medical treatment of urolithiasis.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Several databases were searched for studies on imaging, pain management, observation, and MET for urolithiasis, with particular attention to the level of evidence.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Most patients with urolithiasis present with typical colic symptoms, but stones in the renal calices remain asymptomatic. Routine evaluation includes ultrasound imaging as the first-line modality. In acute disease, low-dose CT is the method of choice. Ureteral stones less than 6 mm can pass spontaneously in well-controlled patients. Sufficient pain management is mandatory in acute renal colic. MET, usually with α-receptor antagonists, facilitates stone passage and reduces the need for analgesia. Contrast imaging is advised for accurate determination of the renal anatomy.

### Diagnosis and initial management of kidney stones [^112AesrX]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and initial management of urolithiasis have undergone considerable evolution in recent years. The application of noncontrast helical computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected renal colic is a major advance. The superior sensitivity and specificity of helical CT allow for the definitive and expeditious diagnosis or exclusion of urolithiasis without the potentially harmful effects of contrast media.

Initial management is based on three key concepts:

- **Recognition of urgent and emergency requirements**: Timely urologic consultation is essential.
- **Provision of effective pain control**: This involves using a combination of narcotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in appropriate patients.
- **Understanding stone location and size**: Recognizing their impact on natural history and definitive urologic management is critical.

These concepts are discussed with reference to contemporary literature, aiming to equip family physicians with tools for use in the emergency department or clinic.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound versus conventional ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with a non-dilated collecting system: Results of a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114enw3W]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Urolithiasis is one of the most prevalent diseases of the urinary system, and its incidence continues to increase every year. According to the American Urological Association, most patients with staghorn renal stones and larger kidney stones (> 20 mm) should be recommended percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) as their first treatment option. Compared with other open surgical methods, PCNL has a more efficient stone clearance rate and is less invasive. However, PCNL has a potential for serious complications, such as bleeding and injury to peripheral organs. Consequently, precise needle puncture of the kidney is the most critical stage in PCNL surgery.

Fluoroscopic guidance, traditionally used for renal access, can accurately identify the calyx to be punctured. A significant disadvantage of fluoroscopic guidance is its inability to visualize adjacent organs in real time, which increases the risk of damaging surrounding structures. Additionally, exposure to ionizing radiation emitted by this method can harm patients and healthcare professionals. By contrast, ultrasound-guided renal puncture has effectively demonstrated efficacy and safety as an alternative to X-ray guidance, reducing radiation hazards while providing real-time guidance.

However, for young physicians, the learning curve of ultrasound-guided PCNL is more prolonged, especially when dealing with an unexpanded renal collecting system, and the degree of calyceal puncture visualization is low. Clinical practice has found that using large amounts of saline to create artificial hydronephrosis causes difficulties for practitioners.

### Limitations of noncontrast CT for measuring ureteral stones [^114BBzuF]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with renal colic are frequently evaluated in the emergency room with a helical noncontrast CT scan (NCCT) as the primary imaging modality. Treatment decisions are often based on the size of the ureteral stones. We aimed to assess the accuracy of NCCT in estimating ureteral stone size compared with plain abdominal (KUB) films.

- **Patients and methods**: Forty-eight patients were identified who had ureteral stones visible on both NCCT and KUB films performed on the same day. The number of consecutive images on which a ureteral stone was visible on NCCT was multiplied by the reconstruction interval of 5 mm to create a size estimate, which was then compared with the measurements of the same stone seen on the KUB film.

- **Results**: The NCCT overestimated stone size by approximately 30% to 50% compared with KUB films.

- **Conclusion**: Counting the number of consecutive NCCT images depicting a ureteral stone is not an accurate method of stone measurement when a reconstruction interval of 5 mm is used. Urologists should consider stone measurement techniques carefully and understand the limitations of imaging studies when evaluating patients with symptomatic ureteral stones.

### Single-energy CT predicts uric acid stones with accuracy comparable to dual-energy CT-prospective validation of a quantitative method [^113umL9C]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary stone disease continues to be an increasing reason for healthcare admissions worldwide, with an incidence of 7% among women and 11% among men in the United States in 2010. In northern Europe, an increasing frequency of uric acid (UA) stones has been reported. Approximately 7–11% of all urinary stones are UA stones.

Distinguishing UA from non-UA stones is of particular interest for the urologist, as the former can be treated with alkalization of the urine, allowing for secondary prophylaxis after ex vivo composition analysis of a passed or surgically removed stone. Ideally, a UA stone is identified and dissolved in vivo to facilitate stone passage and obviate surgical removal. At present, in vivo stone composition analysis is mostly accomplished with dual-energy CT (DE-CT), which has shown high accuracy in several studies.

### Dual energy computerized tomography with a split bolus — a 1-stop shop for patients with suspected urinary stones [^114LsVqa]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

We evaluated a dual energy, split bolus computerized tomography protocol that provides virtual noncontrast, parenchymal, and urographic phases in a single scan. We assessed the sensitivity of the virtual noncontrast phase using this protocol to detect urinary stones compared to the gold standard of the true noncontrast phase.

We prospectively enrolled in the study 81 patients who underwent unenhanced single energy computerized tomography at 120 kV/200 mA as well as contrast-enhanced dual energy computerized tomography on a Somatom® Definition Flash-CT (tube A 80 kV/233 mA and tube B SN 140 kV/180 mA with 1/0.8 mm slice thickness). For the split bolus protocol, 400 mg/ml Iomeron® were injected at two time points, that is, 15 mL 10 minutes before the scan and 80 mL 65 seconds before the scan. In a consensus reading, two readers evaluated the presence and diameter of stones on the true and virtual noncontrast phases.

Of the 350 stones noted on the true noncontrast phase, we found 289 on the virtual noncontrast phase as well as 13 false-positive and 66 false-negative stones. Sensitivity was 98.4%, 89.8%, and 82.6% per patient, segment, and stone, respectively. The diameter measured on the virtual noncontrast phase corresponded to a mean ± SD 92.5% ± 31.6% of the diameter on the true noncontrast phase. The mean effective dose was 4.8 ± 1.8 and 10.5 ± 3.7 mSv for the true and virtual noncontrast phases, respectively.

The proposed protocol allows for combining three phases in a single scan while still enabling the detection of urinary stones.

### B-mode ultrasound versus color Doppler twinkling artifact in detecting kidney stones [^115zcTmy]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

To compare color Doppler twinkling artifact and B-mode ultrasonography in detecting kidney stones, nine patients with recent CT scans prospectively underwent B-mode and twinkling artifact color Doppler ultrasonography on a commercial ultrasound machine. Video segments of the upper pole, interpolar area, and lower pole were created, randomized, and independently reviewed by three radiologists. Receiver operator characteristics were determined.

There were 32 stones in 18 kidneys, with a mean stone size of 8.9 ± 7.5 mm. B-mode ultrasonography had 71% sensitivity, 48% specificity, 52% positive predictive value, and 68% negative predictive value, while twinkling artifact Doppler ultrasonography had 56% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 62% positive predictive value, and 68% negative predictive value.

When used alone, B-mode is more sensitive, but twinkling artifact is more specific in detecting kidney stones. This information may help users employ twinkling and B-mode to identify stones and developers to improve signal processing to harness the fundamental acoustic differences to ultimately improve stone detection.

### Determining the true burden of kidney stone disease [^114xZesX]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of kidney stones have increased over the past four decades. However, the diagnosis of 'kidney stone' can range from an incidental asymptomatic finding of limited clinical significance to multiple painful episodes of ureteral obstruction with eventual kidney failure. Some general strategies may be useful to prevent the recurrence of kidney stones. In particular, greater attention to kidney stone classification, approaches to assessing the risk of recurrence, and individualized prevention strategies may improve the clinical care of stone formers.

Although there have been some advances in approaches to predicting the recurrence of kidney stones, notable challenges remain. Studies of kidney stone prevalence, incidence, and recurrence have reported inconsistent findings, in part because of the lack of a standardized stone classification system. A kidney stone classification system based on practical and clinically useful measures of stone disease may help to improve both the study and clinical care of stone formers.

Any future kidney stone classification system should be aimed at distinguishing asymptomatic from symptomatic stones, clinically diagnosed symptomatic stone episodes from self-reported symptomatic stone episodes, symptomatic stone episodes that are confirmed from those that are suspected, and symptomatic recurrence from radiographic recurrence. This includes radiographic evidence of a new stone, stone growth, or stone disappearance from presumed passage. Furthermore, it should determine stone composition based on mutually exclusive categories.

### Limited field noncontrast computerized tomography for followup of ureteral stones: Initial results [^116c9SoE]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Due to its high specificity and sensitivity, noncontrast computerized tomography is increasingly used to diagnose and follow up with patients who have ureteral stones. We evaluated the feasibility of using limited field noncontrast computerized tomography for this purpose.

- **Materials and methods**: Included in the study were 71 patients who underwent diagnostic and followup noncontrast computerized tomography for ureteral stones. Depending on the stone's position in the initial diagnostic scan, a limited field batch from the followup scan was formed and examined by an independent radiologist. Radiation doses and rates of potentially missed findings in the batch were compared to those of the full followup noncontrast scan.

- **Results**: The average length for a full followup noncontrast computerized tomography was 46.5 cm. The average batch length was 20.7 cm for proximal stones and 13.8 cm for distal stones. The average radiation dose for a full followup noncontrast scan was 12.2 mSv. Average batch doses were 6.1 mSv for proximal stones and 4.1 mSv for distal stones (p = 0.002), leading to a radiation exposure reduction of 48.8% for proximal stones and 66% for distal stones. In three cases, additional clinical information (not including hydronephrosis) was missed when relying solely on batch images. This missing information did not impact further urological treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Limited field noncontrast computerized tomography is a feasible option for monitoring patients diagnosed with ureteral stones. It may lead to significantly lower radiation exposure.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^113ikPXY]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

While the health risk attributable to a single CT scan is small, in a country of 310 million people (approximate US population), it is important to note a lifetime incidence of nephrolithiasis of approximately 10%. If half of these people undergo a CT scan to detect nephrolithiasis — which is likely a conservative estimate as kidney stones are often recurrent and many patients undergo multiple CT scans — we could expect 15 million CT scans to be performed on US residents. In addition to the cost of this imaging, it could be estimated that exposure to ionizing radiation from CT would cause between 10,000 and 30,000 additional malignancies, using risk estimates of between 1 in 500 and 1 in 1,500 for renal colic CT scans.

In this setting, CT was performed nearly as often in women as in men in both phases of the study (48.1% of CT scans in women in the derivation phase; 44.4% in the validation phase). However, the diagnostic yield (percentage of patients with ureteral stones on CT) for men was much higher — 68.8% in the derivation phase and 66.7% in the validation phase — compared with women (28.7% and 41.7%, respectively). The lower diagnostic yield in women coupled with a higher risk from radiation of the pelvis with CT suggests that women (especially younger women) may be a group that could benefit from more judicious use of CT radiation.

### Does diagnosis change as a result of repeat renal colic computed tomography scan in patients with a history of kidney stones [^112S7A7K]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the incidence of alternative diagnosis in patients with a history of kidney stones who experience recurrent symptoms and undergo repeat computed tomography (CT) imaging at their return to the emergency department (ED).

This was a retrospective chart review of ED patients at a tertiary care hospital. Inclusion criteria were all adult ED patients who received a repeat CT for renal colic after having previously received the diagnosis of obstructive kidney stone confirmed by CT in our ED. Patients were identified by reviewing the charts of those with repeat visits to the ED after January 1, 2004, in which they complained of symptoms suggestive of renal colic and received a CT scan. We determined the frequency of the same diagnosis on repeat CT scan in this population compared with the frequency of alternative diagnoses.

Two hundred thirty-one patients met criteria for the study. Fifty-nine percent were male. One hundred eighty-nine (81.8%) patients had no change in diagnosis as a result of a repeat renal colic CT scan. Twenty-seven (11.6%) patients received an alternative diagnosis that did not require urgent intervention, and 15 (6.5%) patients received a diagnosis that did require an urgent intervention.

Repeat CT imaging of patients with known nephrolithiasis changed management in a minority of patients (6.5%). Knowing the frequency of alternative diagnoses in this population may help clinicians and patients balance the risks and benefits of repeat renal colic CT scans.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^1159zF5N]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

For all examinations, the stones were placed on a layer of gelatine (Oetker) exhibiting water-equivalent HU within polystyrene 24-well plates (surface area 1.9 cm²; Corning Inc) to ensure a sufficient distance to the base plate for accurate stone size assessment using semi-automatic segmentation. The well plates were then filled with increasing amounts of iohexol (Accupaque, GE Healthcare) in water, yielding an iodine-induced attenuation of 0 HU, 200 HU, 400 HU, 600 HU, 800 HU, 1000 HU, and 1500 HU. Corresponding contrast media/water ratios were calculated based on a linear formula derived from a previously performed dilution series.

The well plates were placed on a platform in a plastic box filled with water (width x height: 280 x 200 mm), which was positioned along the z-axis on the CT table and centrally within the gantry. The procedure was repeated for each scan with different iodine-induced attenuation levels. Between each scan with increasing iodine-induced attenuation, kidney stones were washed in saline to minimize possible absorption and accumulation of contrast media on the surface of the stones.

Prior to each scan, a test scan of the different contrast media/water mixtures was acquired to ensure accurate iodine-induced attenuation, and mixtures were adjusted if necessary. Attenuation values were quantified by placing two circular regions of interest within the mixtures, with attenuation values ± 10 HU of the desired iodine-induced attenuation considered sufficient (ESM 1).

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114WsHNB]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Oral hydration, intravenous (IV) hydration (over 250 ml), and IV diuretics are documented techniques that aid in the complete opacification of the renal collecting systems during excretory phase acquisition. Additionally, utilizing thinner slices (less than 2 mm) has been shown to improve the detection of urinary calculi on traditional non-contrast CT (tNCT).

Numerous studies conducted since 2010 have explored the potential for virtual non-contrast CT (vNCT) to replace the tNCT phase in dual-energy CT (DECT) urography. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to determine the sensitivity of vNCT, generated from the excretory phase of a CT urogram, compared to tNCT for detecting urinary calculi.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^113yVPgz]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Kidney stone detection**: All stones were detected on CI 0HU and VNC 200HU. Starting at VNC 400HU, the detection rate decreased on VNC with increasing iodine-induced attenuation and was significantly lower on VNC ≥ 600HU compared to CI 0HU and VNC ≤ 400HU (p < 0.001). The detection rate on VNC 600HU was significantly higher compared to VNC ≥ 800HU, as well as significantly higher on VNC 800HU and VNC 1000HU compared to VNC 1500HU (p < 0.001, respectively).

	- **Figure 2**: Bar diagrams illustrate the detection rate of kidney stones on conventional images (CI) surrounded by water and on virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) surrounded by increasing iodine-induced attenuation from 200 to 1500 HU (A, B). The overall detection rate decreased continuously starting at VNC 400HU (A). For similar iodine-induced attenuation, the detection rate was higher in scans using the high-dose protocol (10 mGy) compared to the low-dose protocol (2 mGy) on VNC ≥ 400HU (B).

	- **Figure 3**: Dual-layer CT phantom scans of the same kidney stones using 10 mGy with different contrast media/saline mixtures exhibit specific iodine-induced attenuation from 0 HU to 1500 HU with corresponding conventional images (CI) and virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC).

### Ct for the evaluation of flank pain [^1157qAsw]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT allows for the rapid and accurate determination of whether a stone is present anywhere in the urinary tract. There is a learning curve for both radiologists and urologists, but several signs are highly predictive of stone presence. Helical CT scans should always be accompanied by a "scoutogram" to provide an idea of what the stone might look like. The scan does not require a contrast medium and takes only 5 to 10 minutes of imaging time, making it cost-effective. It is important for both urologists and radiologists to familiarize themselves with the techniques for reading these scans.

### Dual-energy CT kidney stone characterization-can diagnostic accuracy be achieved at low radiation dose [^111Fuh3P]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

All statistical analyses were performed using the R programming language (version 4.0.2). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of stone classification were calculated using ex vivo clinical stone analysis as the reference standard. To check for differences in the distribution or mean values between the two groups, Mann-Whitney U tests or Student's t-tests were conducted. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and/or median [interquartile range (IQR)]. p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^111Z17UL]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

This study investigated the effects of different degrees of surrounding iodine-induced attenuation and radiation dose on the detection rate and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast (VNC) obtained from dual-layer computed tomography (DLCT). We found that the overall detection rate continuously decreased with increasing surrounding iodine-induced attenuation, while remaining comparable to true non-contrast scans on VNC ≤ 400 HU, even when using a low-dose technique. The detection rate of kidney stones was higher in the high-dose protocol compared to the low-dose protocol and was comparable between both protocols on VNC ≤ 600 HU. Kidney stone size influenced the detection rate and was generally overestimated. Stones larger than 5 mm were better detected than stones ≤ 5 mm, while the detection rate remained comparable on VNC ≤ 800 HU.

The reported data demonstrate the beneficial value of VNC derived from dual-energy CT in the imaging of hematuria and urolithiasis. VNC has the potential to replace the true non-contrast scan in multiphasic CT protocols, resulting in a reduction of radiation dose while maintaining a high detection rate of kidney stones when taking the observed limitations into account. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first to investigate the detection of kidney stones on VNC derived from DLCT, while most published in vivo studies used rapid-switching rather than dual-source DECT. A direct translation of the presented results to other DECT systems is limited due to different technical aspects, such as a reported variation in iodine quantification accuracy between the systems.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Ppz5W]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT (vNCT) generated from DECT demonstrated a moderate pooled sensitivity of 78.1%. High heterogeneity was observed between studies, partially due to variations in study methods. Subgroups for methodological differences accounted for some of the heterogeneity. The subgroup involving oral hydration and slice thickness or increment of less than 2 mm recorded the highest sensitivity of 92.2%. These findings are important as they suggest the potential of replacing the traditional non-contrast CT (tNCT) phase in CT urography split-bolus protocol with vNCT for detecting urinary calculi.

A vNCT DECT urography protocol resulted in increased efficiency and reduced time on the CT scanner. There were significant reductions in radiation dose (28 to 47%) for patients undergoing CT urography, the gold standard imaging method for hematuria screening.

The subgroup of studies utilizing a slice thickness or increment of less than 2 mm had the highest and third-highest pooled sensitivity among the five subgroups. The study by Keteslegers et al. demonstrated that thinner slice thickness improves sensitivity for detecting urinary calculi by reducing partial volume effects on tNCT. Four out of six studies using slice thickness or increment of 2 mm or more reported the size of undetected urinary calculi as significantly smaller than those detected. This could imply that vNCT may be affected by over- or under-subtraction of iodine contrast, which might mask calculi due to partial voluming.

While the usual aim of excretory phase imaging in CT urography is to opacify the urinary tract, the discussed findings indicate further potential areas of enhancement and application for vNCT.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^114KVLtP]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Of 5383 "flank pain protocol" CT scans, which refer to non-enhanced CT scans using a renal colic protocol at our institution, performed in the emergency departments on patients 18 years of age or older during the retrospective period, 1853 (34.4%) were randomly selected for full record review. Of these, 1040 were complete records with no exclusion criteria. Approximately half (49.5%; 515 of 1040) of the patients had a ureteral stone that was causing symptoms on their computed tomogram, whereas 2.9% (30 of 1040) had acutely important alternative causes of symptoms. Inter-rater reliability for categorization of the CT result yielded a κ of 0.75–0.80, indicating excellent agreement.

### Diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for characterization of kidney lesions in patients with and without chronic kidney disease [^115qTAUo]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Evaluation of kidney lesions by ultrasound has historically been limited by lack of enhancement. Contrast-enhanced CT/MR has been the imaging standard. However, iodinated contrast agents may worsen kidney function, and gadolinium agents may cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with advanced CKD. The primary goal of this pilot study was to explore the detection of microbubble contrast in kidney lesions among patients with and without CKD and to test the accuracy of CEUS for characterizing these lesions as malignant or benign. We found that the sensitivity of CEUS, whether compared to tissue diagnosis or follow-up imaging, is high and comparable to the reported sensitivities of CT (83–100%) and MR (81–100%) among patients with and without CKD. High sensitivity provides high certainty that a negative test in an individual means the individual does not have the disease, essentially ruling out malignancy.

- **Fig. 3: Sagittal CEUS images**: Complex cystic lesions in two patients with chronic kidney disease of different severity. Both readers called the lesions Bosniak IV (long arrows). Mural nodularity (dashed arrows) is present in both cysts. Both lesions were confirmed as RCC on pathology. However, the 72-year-old woman in 3a had early kidney disease, and the non-neoplastic kidney parenchyma (short arrow) in this case demonstrates homogeneous enhancement. In 3b, a case of a 67-year-old man with advanced kidney disease on dialysis, the kidney parenchyma appears very different, demonstrating reduced, patchy enhancement.

### The utility of the kidneys-ureters-bladder radiograph as the sole imaging modality and its combination with ultrasonography for the detection of renal stones [^113wAGrU]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The study investigates the efficacy of plain radiography and ultrasonography, each as the sole imaging tool and combined, for detecting renal stones, using unenhanced computed tomography as a standard reference. Ultrasonography and plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder are often used for urinary tract stone detection. However, the effectiveness of each method used alone, or the two methods combined, remains controversial.

From January 2012 to September 2014, 822 patients underwent plain radiography, ultrasonography, and unenhanced computed tomography on the same day. The sensitivity and specificity of the two modalities to detect stones were evaluated. The sizes of stones on plain radiography and ultrasonography were compared with their size on unenhanced computed tomography.

- **Results**: Of 1644 kidneys, unenhanced computed tomography detected at least one stone in 994 kidneys. Ultrasonography and plain radiography detected at least one stone in 882 and 488 kidneys, yielding sensitivities of 88.7% and 49.1% and specificities of 68.3% and 99.1%, respectively. Of 488 stones detected by plain radiography, 476 stones were also detected by ultrasound, showing a sensitivity of 89.9% and specificity of 68.1% for the combination of the two modalities. The detection rate for plain radiography for stones smaller than 5mm was low. Stone sizes measured by the two modalities positively correlated with those obtained by computed tomography, and the concordance rate based on size was similar.

- **Conclusion**: Plain radiography is of limited value for detecting small renal stones.

### Ultrasound use in urinary stones: Adapting old technology for a modern-day disease [^114S3Y4Y]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound has become a mainstay tool in the urologists' armamentarium for the diagnosis and management of nephrolithiasis. Originally a rudimentary form of imaging, it has evolved to play a more prominent role, paralleling advancements in ultrasound technology. In the medical community, there is a growing emphasis on reducing the amount of ionizing radiation delivered to patients during routine imaging, leading to renewed interest in ultrasound. Its lack of associated radiation exposure and proven effectiveness as a diagnostic and therapeutic imaging modality make it an attractive option. This review provides an overview of the history of ultrasound, its expanding role in the diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease, and the promising applications of ultrasound shaping the future of kidney stone management.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^117FmPtD]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

To systematically investigate the usability of virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) derived from dual-layer CT (DLCT) for detection and size measurements of kidney stones with regards to different degrees of surrounding iodine-induced attenuation and radiation dose, the following methods and results were noted:

- **Methods**: Ninety-two kidney stones of varying size (3–14 mm) and composition were placed in a phantom filled with different contrast media/water mixtures exhibiting specific iodine-induced attenuation (0–1500 HU). DLCT scans were acquired using CTDI vol of 2 mGy and 10 mGy. Conventional images (CI) and VNC 0H-1500HU were reconstructed. Reference stone size was determined using a digital caliper (Man-M). Visibility and stone size were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using the McNemar test, Wilcoxon test, and the coefficient of determination.

- **Results**: All stones were visible on CI 0HU and VNC 200HU. Starting at VNC 400HU, the detection rate decreased with increasing HU and was significantly lower as compared to CI 0HU on VNC ≥ 600HU (100.0% vs. 94.0%, p < 0.05). The overall detection rate was higher using the 10 mGy protocol as compared to the 2 mGy protocol (87.9% vs. 81.8%; p < 0.001). Stone size was significantly overestimated on all VNC compared to Man-M (7.0 ± 3.5 mm vs. 6.6 ± 2.8 mm, p < 0.001). Again, the 10 mGy protocol tended to show a better correlation with Man-M as compared to the 2 mGy protocol (R² = 0.39–0.68 vs. R² = 0.31–0.57).

Detection and size measurements of kidney stones surrounded by contrast media on VNC are feasible. The detection rate of kidney stones decreases with increased iodine-induced attenuation.

### Non-contrast CT attenuation value of renal papilla is a novel predictor of recurrence in kidney stone disease [^111nk4Tz]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of CaOx stone formers who underwent non-contrast CT scans and 24-hour urine chemistry between September 2012 and November 2021 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital, Japan, and who were followed up for at least 1 year. Stone analysis was performed by infrared spectroscopy. Ideally, CaOx stones should be subdivided into CaOx monohydrate and CaOx dihydrate. Unfortunately, there are no Japanese laboratories that report CaOx monohydrate and CaOx dihydrate separately, so in this study, the two were combined and analyzed as CaOx. We excluded patients with radiolucent stones, with pure calcium phosphate stones, and with non-calcium stones. This study was approved by the Wakayama Medical University Institutional Review Board (No. 3037) and all procedures were performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Since this is a retrospective observational study, a clinical trial number is not applicable.

- **Measurement of CT attenuation value of renal papilla**: CT scans were performed as standard with 5 mm collimation width using a LightSpeed 64-slice multidetector helical CT scanner at 0.5 s per rotation, 120 kV and 100 mA. CT images (slice thickness 2.5–5 mm) were retrospectively reviewed by two experienced urologists who were blinded to patient clinical data. The Hounsfield unit (HU) of the renal papilla was independently measured by two observers by placing regions of interest (ROI) with a mean size of 0.2 cm² in the region of renal papillae from the upper pole, middle region, and lower pole in both kidneys.

### Comparison of ultrasound versus computed tomography for the detection of kidney stones in the pediatric population: A clinical effectiveness study [^113GURr7]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of pediatric nephrolithiasis in the United States is increasing. There is a paucity of literature comparing the diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US) to computed tomography (CT) in the pediatric population.

- **Objective**: To determine the diagnostic performance of renal ultrasound for nephrolithiasis in children using a clinical effectiveness approach.

- **Materials and methods**: Institutional review board approval with a waiver of informed consent was obtained for this retrospective, HIPAA-compliant investigation. Billing records and imaging reports were used to identify children (≤ 18 years old) evaluated for nephrolithiasis by both US and unenhanced CT within 24 hours between March 2012 and March 2017. Imaging reports were reviewed for presence, number, size, and location of kidney stones. Diagnostic performance of US (reference standard = CT) was calculated per renal unit (left/right kidney) and per renal sector (four sectors per kidney). For sector analysis, US was considered truly positive if a stone was identified at CT in the same or an adjacent sector.

- **Results**: There were 68 renal stones identified by CT in 30 out of 69 patients (43%). The mean patient age was 14.7 ± 3.6 years, and 35 were boys. For detecting nephrolithiasis in any kidney, US was 66.7% (48.8–80.8%) sensitive and 97.4% (86.8–99.9%) specific (positive predictive value = 95.2% [77.3–99.8%], negative predictive value = 79.2% [65.7–88.3%], positive likelihood ratio = 26.0). Per renal sector, US was 59.7% (46.7–71.4%) sensitive and 97.4% (95.5–98.5%) specific (positive predictive value = 72.3% [58.2–83.1%], negative

### Non-contrast CT attenuation value of renal papilla is a novel predictor of recurrence in kidney stone disease [^111xeoq2]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 180 patients (114 men, 66 women) were included in the analysis.

- **Baseline clinical characteristics**: Stone composition was CaOx in 88 patients (48.9%), CaOx + CaP in 59 patients (32.8%), and unknown in 33 patients (18.3%). Recurrent stone formers and multiple stone formers accounted for 67.8% and 72.6% of the cohort, respectively. The median Hounsfield unit (HU) value of all papillae was 38.9, which was used to classify the patients into either the low-HU group (< 38.9) or the high-HU group (≥ 38.9). There was no significant difference in the variability of the data between these two groups.

There were no significant differences in age, gender, or stone composition between the two groups. The proportions of recurrent stone formers and multiple stone formers were also similar between the groups, with 70.0% versus 65.6% and 71.1% versus 74.2%, respectively.

- **Data on 24-h urine collection and AP(CaOx) index**: Five patients (three in the low-HU group and two in the high-HU group) were excluded from the analysis due to incomplete data necessary for the calculation of the AP(CaOx) index. There were no significant differences in urinary volume, urinary excretions of each constituent, or the AP(CaOx) index between the low-HU and high-HU groups.

### Ct, US and MRI of xanthine urinary stones: in-vitro and in-vivo analyses [^1114WqCR]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Xanthine urinary stones are a rare type of urinary calculus that may cause symptoms requiring numerous imaging tests over a lifetime. In-vitro and in-vivo analyses showed that xanthine stones are easily detectable on US and CT, but failed to demonstrate signal on all MRI sequences tested. CT numbers of xanthine stones did not vary when imaging with different energies. We believe that US should be considered the first line imaging test in the evaluation of xanthine urinary calculi, and judicious use of CT is warranted when ultrasound is inconclusive or insufficient and risks of radiation have been considered.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^115ipkSG]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The study systematically investigates the usability of virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) derived from dual-layer computed tomography (DLCT) for detecting and measuring the size of kidney stones. These evaluations consider different degrees of surrounding iodine-induced attenuation and radiation doses.

- **Methods**: Ninety-two kidney stones of varying sizes (3–14 mm) and compositions were placed in a phantom with various contrast media/water mixtures exhibiting specific iodine-induced attenuation (0–1500 HU). DLCT scans were acquired using CTDI vol settings of 2 mGy and 10 mGy. Conventional images (CI) and VNC 0H-1500HU were reconstructed. The reference stone size was determined using a digital caliper (Man-M). Visibility and stone size were assessed, and statistical analysis was performed using the McNemar test, Wilcoxon test, and the coefficient of determination.

- **Results**: All stones were visible on CI 0HU and VNC 200HU. Starting at VNC 400 HU, the detection rate decreased with increasing HU and was significantly lower compared to CI 0HU on VNC ≥ 600HU [100.0 vs. 94.0%, p < 0.05]. The detection rate was higher using the 10 mGy protocol compared to the 2 mGy protocol [87.9 vs. 81.8%; p < 0.001]. Stone size was significantly overestimated on all VNC compared to Man-M [7.0 ± 3.5 vs. 6.6 ± 2.8 mm, p < 0.001]. The 10 mGy protocol tended to show a better correlation with Man-M compared to the 2 mGy protocol [R² = 0.39–0.68 vs. R² = 0.31–0.57].

- **Conclusions**: Detection and size measurement of kidney stones surrounded by contrast media on VNC are feasible. The detection rate of kidney stones decreases with higher HU levels.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FC6nH]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

While the overall sensitivity of the pooled data from the excretory phase of the DECT urography was moderate, promising subgroup protocols have been identified. When employing oral hydration and < 2 mm slice thickness and increment, a higher sensitivity was observed. Further research may allow incorporation of the vNCT technique and thus reduce radiation exposure to the patient, decrease time on the CT scanner, and improve efficiency.

### Validation of an automated CT image analysis in the prevention of urinary stones with hydration trial [^113FSj3W]. Journal of Endourology (2025). Low credibility.

Kidney stone growth and new stone formation are common clinical trial endpoints and are associated with future symptomatic events. At the time of writing, a manual review of CT scans has been required to assess stone growth and new stone formation, which is laborious. We validated the performance of a software algorithm that automatically identified, registered, and measured stones over longitudinal CT studies.

- **Methods**: We validated the performance of a pretrained machine learning algorithm to classify stone outcomes on longitudinal CT scan images at baseline and at the end of the 2-year follow-up period for 62 participants aged > 18 years in the Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) randomized controlled trial. Stones were defined as an area of voxels with a minimum linear dimension of 2 mm that was higher in density than the mean plus 4 standard deviations of all nonnegative HU values within the kidney. The four outcomes assessed were: (1) growth of at least one existing stone by ≥ 2 mm, (2) formation of at least one new ≥ 2 mm stone, (3) no stone growth or new stone formation, and (4) loss of at least one stone. The accuracy of the algorithm was determined by comparing its outcomes to the gold standard of independent review of the CT images by at least two expert clinicians.

- **Results**: The algorithm correctly classified outcomes for 61 paired scans (98.4%). One pair that the algorithm incorrectly classified as stone growth was a new renal artery calcification on end-of-study CT. An automated image analysis method validated for the prospective study showed high accuracy in detecting stone growth and formation.

### Imaging-based deep learning in kidney diseases: Recent progress and future prospects [^116G6y11]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Detection of renal calculus

Renal calculi are a common kidney disease and a worldwide health problem, which can be induced by risk factors including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. The formation of renal calculi can lead to urinary system obstruction, kidney failure, hypertension, CKD, and end-stage renal disease. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of renal calculi generally requires the assistance of imaging techniques, including US and non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT). Imaging-based deep learning is developing rapidly and is already being used in these techniques to further improve the ability to detect renal calculi.

Yildirim et al. developed a coronal CT image-based deep learning model to detect renal calculi on a dataset of 1453 NCCT images and validated the model on an internal cohort of 346 NCCT images (Fig. 5). The proposed cross-residual network model shows excellent performance in detecting renal calculi with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained at 96.82%, 95.76%, and 97%, respectively. Furthermore, the study also put forward proposals to detect kidney stones on axial and sagittal CT images, and the relation between stone size and detection performance could be further explored. Caglayan et al. addressed this by dividing the dataset into three groups based on kidney stone size to evaluate the kidney stone detection performance of the deep learning-assisted model in three imaging axes, respectively.
