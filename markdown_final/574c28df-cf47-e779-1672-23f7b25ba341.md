## Question

Bronchitis antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics should be used for bronchitis and, if so, in which situations they are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing acute bronchitis from chronic bronchitis and COPD exacerbations. Then, I should verify the etiology of acute bronchitis and whether antibiotics target that cause. Next, I will review the magnitude and clinical relevance of any antibiotic benefits, weigh harms, and check guideline positions. After that, I need to identify the narrow exceptions where antibiotics are indicated, including pertussis, suspected pneumonia, and COPD exacerbations. Finally, I will consider special populations, stewardship strategies, and synthesize a practical decision framework with clear recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities, because conflating them leads to overtreatment. Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adults without chronic lung disease is a self-limited cough illness typically lasting 1–3 weeks, whereas chronic bronchitis is part of COPD and acute exacerbations of COPD are a different syndrome with different risks and evidence for antibiotics, so I need to keep these separate in my reasoning [^8f7f71fd] [^f422752c].

> I will now examine the etiology of acute bronchitis, since antibiotics only help if the cause is bacterial. Wait, let me verify the proportion that is viral; multiple high-quality sources indicate that at least 90% of acute bronchitis cases are viral, and even when sputum is purulent, that reflects leukocyte peroxidase rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotics do not address the pathophysiology in most cases [^f610ab40] [^7349c97f] [^d0cb3d9e].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of benefit, if any, from antibiotics in acute bronchitis. The Cochrane review shows a statistically significant but clinically trivial reduction in cough duration of about 0.46 days, with no improvement in overall clinical improvement or activity limitation, and with increased adverse effects, so the net clinical benefit is essentially zero for most patients [^099f05fb] [^32c17a5e]. Hold on, I should double-check the harm signal; yes, adverse effects are more common with antibiotics, reinforcing a risk–benefit balance that favors no antibiotics in typical cases [^099f05fb].

> Let me consider guideline convergence, because consistency across societies strengthens the recommendation. The ACCP advises against routine antibiotics for immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, the AAFP similarly recommends avoiding antibiotics and emphasizes education about the 2–3 week cough course, and the ACP/CDC advises not prescribing antibiotics for bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected, so the direction is uniform across high-credibility guidance [^f058b67c] [^3c8e1cef] [^2c7bcb0d].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions where antibiotics help? I need to check those carefully. Antibiotics are indicated when pertussis is suspected or confirmed, in which case macrolides are recommended to reduce transmission and modify the course if given early, and they are also indicated when pneumonia is suspected based on vital sign abnormalities or focal lung findings, where chest radiography and antibiotic therapy are appropriate [^6e8c4539] [^8f7f71fd]. For COPD exacerbations, evidence supports antibiotics when there is increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence, particularly in more severe disease or frequent exacerbators, so I should not extrapolate the acute bronchitis data to COPD flares [^f422752c] [^cc5aad70].

> I should confirm special populations and settings. In children, antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated acute bronchitis, and a large RCT in pediatric primary care showed no clinically meaningful benefit of amoxicillin for lower respiratory tract infection without pneumonia, aligning with adult data and stewardship principles [^0e8fae6f]. In smokers, I initially thought antibiotics might be more beneficial, but wait, let me verify; a systematic review suggests benefits are the same or less in smokers, so smoking status does not justify routine antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^a5b4b0b1]. In older adults, prescribing remains high, but age alone should not drive antibiotic use without the clinical features that warrant treatment in COPD or suspected bacterial infection [^7cc359f4].

> Next, I should review stewardship strategies that reduce unnecessary prescribing without harming satisfaction. Delayed prescriptions reduce antibiotic consumption with minimal impact on satisfaction when paired with education about the expected 2–3 week cough course, and describing the illness as a chest cold can improve acceptance of non-antibiotic care, so I should incorporate these communication tools routinely [^6996ef50] [^bfbc6844]. Hold on, I should verify whether biomarkers help; routine CRP or procalcitonin is not recommended for acute bronchitis, though selective CRP use in primary care can reduce prescriptions without worsening outcomes, so I should avoid blanket biomarker testing and use clinical judgment instead [^97a5285c].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against the evidence. For immunocompetent adults with acute cough, no fever, normal vital signs, and no focal lung findings, I should not prescribe antibiotics and should provide symptom control and safety-netting. If pertussis is suspected, I should test and treat with a macrolide. If pneumonia is suspected, I should obtain a chest radiograph and treat as pneumonia. If the patient has COPD and meets Anthonisen criteria or has severe disease, I should treat the exacerbation with antibiotics. If the patient insists on antibiotics, I should consider a delayed prescription with clear return precautions, documenting the rationale and counseling on harms [^f058b67c] [^3c8e1cef] [^2c7bcb0d] [^6996ef50].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure my bottom line is precise. For acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults, antibiotics do not improve meaningful outcomes and increase adverse effects, so they should be avoided. Antibiotics are reserved for suspected pertussis, suspected pneumonia, or COPD exacerbations with bacterial features, and in all cases the indication should be explicit and stewardship principles applied to minimize harm and resistance [^099f05fb] [^f058b67c] [^3c8e1cef] [^2c7bcb0d].

Routine antibiotics are **not recommended** for acute bronchitis because it is usually viral and self-limited [^f610ab40]; they offer only modest benefits (about 0.5 fewer days of cough) [^099f05fb] and increase adverse effects like GI upset and resistance [^099f05fb]. Antibiotics are reserved for suspected bacterial infection or high-risk patients (e.g. COPD exacerbation, immunocompromised) [^58e1fedd] [^f422752c]. Use delayed prescribing or shared decision-making to reduce unnecessary use [^6996ef50] [^8dcf8076].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

- **Viral predominance**: Acute bronchitis is most often viral (> 90%), with common pathogens including influenza, RSV, and rhinovirus [^f610ab40].
- **Bacterial involvement**: Bacteria are identified in < 10% of cases, typically as secondary infections or in patients with underlying lung disease [^a064477c].
- **Inflammatory response**: The cough reflects bronchial inflammation and hyperresponsiveness rather than bacterial invasion, explaining limited antibiotic benefit [^7349c97f].

---

## Clinical evidence on antibiotic efficacy

Multiple high-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show **minimal benefit** from antibiotics in acute bronchitis:

| **Outcome measure** | **Effect of antibiotics** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Duration of cough | ~0.5 days shorter | Modest, not clinically meaningful [^099f05fb] |
| Night cough | Slightly reduced | Modest, not clinically meaningful [^099f05fb] |
| Days feeling ill | ~0.6 days fewer | Modest, not clinically meaningful [^099f05fb] |
| Overall clinical improvement | No significant difference | Not clinically meaningful [^099f05fb] |
| Adverse effects | Significantly increased (RR 1.20) | Clinically meaningful [^099f05fb] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines align in **recommending against routine antibiotics** for acute bronchitis:

- **ACCP 2020**: Do not prescribe antibiotics routinely; consider only if bacterial infection is likely [^f058b67c] [^58e1fedd].
- **AAFP 2025**: Avoid antibiotics; use delayed prescribing or shared decision-making to reduce unnecessary use [^3c8e1cef] [^6996ef50].
- **ACP/CDC 2016**: Do not prescribe antibiotics unless pneumonia is suspected [^2c7bcb0d].

---

## Situations where antibiotics may be considered

Antibiotics are **reserved for specific scenarios**:

- **Suspected bacterial infection**: Persistent fever, purulent sputum, or clinical deterioration [^a095f2f1].
- **High-risk patients**: COPD exacerbations, immunocompromised, or significant comorbidities [^f422752c].
- **Pertussis**: Suspected or confirmed cases require macrolide therapy [^6e8c4539].

---

## Risks and harms associated with antibiotic use

Antibiotic use in acute bronchitis carries **meaningful risks**:

- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, rash, and rare severe reactions [^099f05fb].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Contributes to community resistance, a major public health concern [^250c0f9f].
- **Cost and resource utilization**: Unnecessary prescribing increases healthcare costs without benefit [^f610ab40].

---

## Alternative management strategies

Effective, **non-antibiotic care** is recommended:

- **Patient education**: Explain the viral nature and expected 2–3 week cough duration [^bfbc6844].
- **Symptom control**: Analgesics, antitussives, and beta-agonists for wheeze as indicated [^notfound].
- **Delayed prescribing**: Reduces antibiotic use without worsening outcomes or satisfaction [^6996ef50] [^8dcf8076].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Routine antibiotics for acute bronchitis are **not supported** by evidence or guidelines due to minimal benefit and meaningful harms. Clinicians should prioritize education, symptom control, and judicious use of antibiotics only when clearly indicated, employing delayed prescribing or shared decision-making to reduce unnecessary use [^3c8e1cef] [^6996ef50].

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^f0edbdc9]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antibiotics associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute bronchitis?

Bottom Line

Prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis was associated with reduced overall and nighttime cough and with an approximately half-day reduction in duration of cough, in days feeling ill, and in days with impaired activities. However, at follow-up, there were no significant differences in patients receiving antibiotics compared with those receiving placebo in overall clinical improvements or limitations in work or other activities. There was a significant increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and antibiotics: what studies are still needed? [^92664178]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) remains the subject of controversy despite considerable medical and socioeconomic implications. First, the contribution of bacterial infection to AECBs is difficult to assess in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are chronically colonized with respiratory pathogens. In addition, several studies suggest a major role of viral infections in AECBs. Secondly, it is unlikely that all COPD patients will benefit from antibiotics during AECBs. In particular, the benefit in mild COPD remains uncertain. Unfortunately, the number of studies complying with evidence-based medicine requirements is too small for definite recommendations in AECBs to be drawn up. Considering the impact of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, as well as the community, and the impact of antibiotic therapy on the development of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for the design of appropriate multicentric studies to define the usefulness of this type of treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

### Are antibiotics effective in the treatment of acute bronchitis? [^061b41cb]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In patients without underlying lung disease, antibiotics in acute bronchitis appear to decrease cough, but the clinical significance of this decrease is uncertain. Their use should be weighed against the cost and potential adverse effects for treatment of a self-limiting disease.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects more than 40 in 1000 adults per year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 420 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 306 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 245 studies and the further review of 61 full publications. Of the 61 full articles evaluated, three updated systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we categorised the efficacy for six intervention-comparison combinations, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, beta2 agonists (inhaled), and expectorants/mucolytics.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Seventeen trials with 3936 participants were included in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22.

The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated patients were more likely to be unimproved according to clinician's global assessment (six studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 25); have an abnormal lung exam (five studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6); have a reduction in days feeling ill (five studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and a reduction in days with limited activity (six studies with 767 participants MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04).

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^b24d77fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^4333af72]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, penicillins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [co-trimoxazole]), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^85e6f3bd]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis, with transient inflammation of the trachea and major bronchi, affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. A third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin [with or without clavulanic acid], cephalosporins, or macrolides), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), cephalosporins, expectorants, and analgesics.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics for acute bronchitis? [^21bbdb4d]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

People with acute bronchitis may show little evidence of bacterial infection. If effective, antibiotics could shorten the course of the disease. However, if they are not effective, the risk of antibiotic resistance may be increased. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, reference lists of articles, personal collections up to 1996 and Sci-search from 1989 to 1996.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Primary Results

The results of eight trials involving 750 patients from eight years of age to 65 and older and including smokers and nonsmokers were included. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures was assessed. In many cases, only outcomes that showed a statistically significant difference between groups were reported. Overall, patients taking antibiotics had slightly better outcomes than those taking placebo. They were less likely to report feeling unwell at a follow-up visit (odds ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.82), to show no improvement on physician assessment (odds ratio, 0.43; CI, 0.23 to 0.79) or to have abnormal lung findings (odds ratio, 0.33; CI, 0.13 to 0.86), and had a more rapid return to work or usual activities (weighted mean difference, 0.7 days earlier; CI, 0.2 to 1.3). Antibiotic-treated patients reported significantly more adverse effects (odds ratio, 1.64; CI, 1.05 to 2.57), such as nausea, vomiting, headache, skin rash or vaginitis.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in the treatment of acute bronchitis, with a correspondingly small risk of adverse effects. The benefits of antibiotics may be overestimated in this analysis because of the tendency of published reports to include complete data only on outcomes found to be statistically significant.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^4d635a9a]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bronchitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is limited evidence that the use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis may provide modest benefits in cough and activity level (0.5-day reduction in symptoms), but with a significant increase in antibiotic-related adverse effects.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^5c64d479]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

For the identification of antibiotics trials in COPD patients, we used a comprehensive literature search described elsewhere. In brief, information specialists (Bazian, London, UK,) searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, March 2006) for any randomised trials on antibiotics in COPD patients. Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all the identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The full text of any article that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers was ordered. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of retrieved articles and selected those meeting the inclusion criteria. Each reviewer's decisions were recorded in the Endnote file and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Study selection

We included randomised head-to-head trials comparing any antibiotics or an antibiotic with placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate exacerbations in COPD patients. Placebo-controlled trials allow for an estimation of the specific effects of the treatment and offer a proof of effectiveness.

As with any systematic review on this topic, a difficulty is that definitions of COPD have varied over time. In particular, spirometry criteria became widespread only after 1995 and we accepted a clinical diagnosis of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema. However, in order to include only trials whose patients were very likely to have COPD, we included studies only if patients with chronic bronchitis were at least 40 years of age and/or if at least 80% were smokers or ex-smokers. The presence of these characteristics (chronic bronchitis, age and smoking history) renders a diagnosis of COPD according to modern (spirometric) criteria extremely likely. We defined patients to have 'mild to moderate exacerbations' if they needed any outpatient treatment (level I exacerbation) according to the Operational Classification of Severity of the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Societies.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^58e1fedd]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bronchitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider prescribing antibiotics in patients with worsening acute bronchitis if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^6e8c4539]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^bc789982]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence on the effects of antibiotics in mild to moderate COPD exacerbations

The seven trials included a total of 990 outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations. Figure 2 shows the cumulative meta-analyses for the five trials reporting on treatment failure. In one trial, treatment failure was defined as event-based because of the need for further antibiotics and in four trials, a symptom-based definition of treatment failure was used. Cumulative ORs never reached statistical significance and the most recent (1995) cumulative OR was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52–1.28, P = 0.37). When we also included another trial, as explained above, the cumulative OR also remained non-significant (0.50, 95% CI 0.20–1.24, P = 0.14). In other words, cumulative evidence from placebo-controlled trials did not show any significant effects of antibiotics on treatment failure in COPD patients with mild to moderate exacerbations.

Figure 2
Evidence on the effects of antibiotics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Cumulative meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials, which evaluated the effects of antibiotics on treatment failure in patients with mild to moderate exacerbations.

The rationale for the first placebo-controlled trials was reported to be the uncertainty about the benefits of a 'short course' of 'intermittent' antibiotic therapy for exacerbations. The authors explicitly stated the short duration of antibiotic treatment because prophylactic long-term use of antibiotics to prevent exacerbations was quite common at that time. Over the following 40 years, authors of placebo-controlled trials argued that these trials are required because 'the role of the [antibiotic] therapy is not clear', or because 'it is still not sufficiently clarified whether acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis should be treated with antibiotics'. These statements reflect the ongoing debate about the usefulness of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations.

Methods

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in COPD patients suffering from an acute exacerbation defined as a worsening of a previous stable situation with symptoms such as increased dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum colour. We considered studies if > 90% of patients had a clinical (physician-based) diagnosis of COPD or, ideally, spirometrically confirmed COPD. We excluded studies of patients with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma or bronchiectasis.

We included trials evaluating any antibiotics that were administered orally or parenterally daily for a minimum period of at least three days. We chose three days because this is the minimum duration for which antibiotics are usually prescribed in clinical practice for COPD exacerbations.

The outcome measure of primary interest was treatment failure defined as (1) no resolution of symptoms and signs as reported by patients or physicians or as (2) need for further antibiotics. Outcome measures of secondary interest were duration of hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, health-related quality of life, symptoms, mortality, and any adverse events registered during the study period.

Search strategy

The search was carried out by information specialists (Bazian, London, UK) and included searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, March 2006). We entered all included studies into the Pub-med "related articles" function and the science citation index. In addition, we scrutinised the reference lists of included studies and review articles as well the conference proceedings of the international congresses of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society from 2000 to 2006 since these studies might not have been fully published yet. We also contacted representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for additional published or unpublished data (Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BoehringerIngelheim, Pfizer and MSD). Finally, we searched international data bases for trial registration to identify ongoing or recently completed trials.

Study selection

Two members of the review team independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of articles that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers. Final decisions on in- and exclusion were recorded in the Endnote file and agreement was assessed using chance-adjusted kappa statistics.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^9078601f]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: review of recent statements and position papers [^8b86eda5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasized the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for chronic bronchitis [^c6415abc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the frequency and severity of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis is controversial.

Objectives

To determine if prophylactic antibiotics reduce the frequency of exacerbations and/or days of disability in subjects with chronic bronchitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Clinical Trials and the bibliographies of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with chronic bronchitis and/or COPD were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

The eligibility of studies for inclusion was evaluated by three independent reviewers.

Main Results

Nine trials involving 1055 subjects were included in the analysis. All were performed before 1970. Concealment of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only 3 studies. The likelihood of having a exacerbation at any time during the course of the study was decreased with treatment (Relative Risk 0.91, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 0.84, 0.99). There was a small reduction in the number of exacerbations per patient per year with prophylactic antibiotics but this was not statistically significant (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) -0.15, 95%CI -0.34, 0.04). There was a modest but significant reduction of 22% in the number of days of disability per patient per month treated (WMD -0.95, 95%CI -1.89 to - 0.01). A parallel reduction in the days of disability for each exacerbation (WMD -2.08, 95% CI -4.08 to -0.07) was seen. There was a small increase in adverse effects with antibiotics.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotics in chronic bronchitis / COPD have a small but statistically significant effect in reducing the days of illness due to exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. They do not have a place in routine treatment because of concerns about the development of antibiotic resistance and the possibility of adverse effects. The available data are over 30 years old, so the pattern of antibiotic sensitivity may have changed and there is a wider range of antibiotics in use.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^a064477c]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

### Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis in smokers: a systematic review [^a5b4b0b1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Community physicians in the United States prescribe antibiotics to 80% to 90% of smokers with acute bronchitis. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy of antibiotics for smokers with acute bronchitis.

Design

A medline search was done using the keywords bronchitis, cough, and antibiotics to identify English language articles published from January 1966 to September 2001. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antibiotics in previously healthy smokers and nonsmokers with acute bronchitis were included.

Measurements and Main Results

For each study, we abstracted information on design, size, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics, and outcomes. Of 2,029 articles in the original search, 109 relevant articles were retrieved and reviewed. There have been no studies specifically addressing antibiotic use in smokers with acute bronchitis. Nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antibiotics have included 774 patients and over 276 smokers. Lack of subgroup reporting for smokers precluded meta-analysis. In 7 trials, smoking status did not predict or alter patients' response to antibiotics. In one trial, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resulted in less-frequent cough overall, but not among smokers. In another trial, erythromycin reduced symptom scores only among nonsmokers while antibiotic-treated smokers had a trend toward higher symptom scores.

Conclusion

Although no trials have specifically addressed antibiotic use in smokers with acute bronchitis, existing data suggest that any benefit of antibiotics is the same or less for smokers than for nonsmokers.

### Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis [^427321f2]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the top 10 conditions for which patients seek medical care. Physicians show considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary to its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics. These drugs have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to prescription of an antibiotic.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^aba37b80]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchitis is among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription worldwide. This diagnosis includes two distinct entities, acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying lung disease and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is predominantly a viral disease with good evidence that antibiotics are not of benefit in its management. Exacerbations of COPD, on the other hand, can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacterial infection currently estimated to contribute up to 50% of exacerbations. Furthermore, in contrast to acute bronchitis, these exacerbation episodes are not benign events, as they have consequences ranging from days lost from work, deterioration of health status, progression of airflow obstruction and even death. Therefore, appropriate management of COPD exacerbations is crucial.

Antibiotics are often used in the management of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 80% of COPD exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis, which can be regarded as mild to moderate exacerbations. The article published by Puhan et al this month in BMC Medicine makes the argument that there is a lack of evidence for antibiotic benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD and that additional placebo-controlled trials are required. Their argument is based on a meta-analytic approach where they identified five placebo-controlled randomized trials in the literature, which were confined to 'mild to moderate' exacerbations of COPD. With this approach, although all but one of the trials favor antibiotics, the combined odds ratio is not statistically significant.

Although their conclusions based on the analysis are not erroneous, their approach to this question highlights a number of issues that make it difficult to resolve this argument; these include the heterogeneity of exacerbations, patients and antibiotics in these trials. Another major issue is the acceptance of the results of these trials without critically examining the limitations of the end-points used in these studies. The 'devil is in the details' in these trials, and these details are often overlooked in a meta-analytic approach.

The current therapy for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections is often empiric, usually involving administration of a beta-lactam or macrolide. However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in frequently isolated respiratory tract pathogens has complicated the antimicrobial selection process.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^6e6a7a77]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our historical analysis showed that many head-to-head trials of antibiotics for mild to moderate COPD exacerbations have been conducted although evidence from randomised placebo-controlled trials never showed that antibiotics were effective at all. So, in this case, the evaluation of antibiotics did not follow the general principle that placebo-controlled trials must have shown that the treatment is better than the placebo or a sham procedure, before head-to-head trials are to be conducted.

Our study has some strengths and limitations. We used a comprehensive literature search to identify trials. The selection of a widely prescribed drug for a major disease makes our 'case report' meaningful, because we could base our historical analysis on a large number of trials. A limitation of systematic reviews in COPD is the evolution of definitions and classifications of COPD over the years. This raises uncertainty about the nature of the study populations included in trials published before 1995 or even before 2000. Many trials included patients with 'chronic bronchitis' who did not present evidence of chronic airflow obstruction or poor reversibility of airflow obstruction.

It should be emphasised that the results of this study apply to antibiotic treatment for mild to moderate COPD exacerbations. In patients with severe exacerbations, antibiotics show a strong effect not only on treatment failure but also on mortality. Our analysis of placebo-controlled trials differs to some extent to that of the Cochrane review because we did not include a study that was not a randomised but, in our opinion, a matched controlled study. However, we included the trial by Sachs et al missed by the Cochrane review and received the original data from the authors. However, the Cochrane review also showed that antibiotics have a significant effect on treatment failure in hospitalised patients but not in outpatients.

We have focused in our analysis on one major treatment for COPD patients. It remains unclear if head-to-head trials are conducted frequently in other areas without an evidence base from placebo-controlled trials. It is conceivable that this example of antibiotics is just the tip of the iceberg. A recent systematic review summarised placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of exercise for low back pain. Head-to-head trials were conducted over the same period of time as the placebo-controlled trials. The same applies to trials evaluating antidepressants for elderly people or antibiotics for acute otitis media in children. For these widely prescribed treatments for common conditions, it remains as yet uncertain whether the conduct of head-to-head trials was scientifically and ethically justified.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^250c0f9f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions — especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended) — a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients. Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing the disciplines of internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background and specific aims of and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it. These principles should be used in conjunction with effective patient educational campaigns and enhancements to the health care delivery system that facilitate nonantibiotic treatment of the conditions in question.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^fa2edb21]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Selection of clinical, patient-reported, and economic end points in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis [^e76743e4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) places tremendous burden on patients, providers, employers, and health care systems.

Objective

The purpose of this paper is to (1) review the clinical, patient-reported, and economic measures used to evaluate disease burden and treatment effectiveness in AECB in clinical trials and (2) propose a guide for selecting study end points in AECB that will help capture all the relevant disease outcomes.

Methods

Two literature searches of the PubMed database were conducted to identify studies of clinical trials in bronchitis and evaluate the clinical, patient-reported, and economic end points used in these studies.

Results

Previous studies have focused primarily on clinician-assessed outcomes, which do not capture the full impact of AECB on patients' lives. Reporting mechanisms for most end points have been inconsistent, limiting the ability to compare information or interpret differences. Previous studies have given limited attention to patient-reported outcomes and the economic implications of AECB. Patient-reported outcomes such as speed of symptom relief and work productivity are important parameters for assessing treatment effectiveness and provide practical information for treatment evaluation.

Conclusions

Additional research is needed to develop, examine, and validate patient-reported outcomes and the indirect costs of AECB. Measuring the relevant clinical, economic, and patient-reported outcomes in AECB patients using standardized methods may lead to a clearer understanding of the disease burden and the role, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment.

### Treatment of acute bronchitis and its impact on return emergency department visits [^05065e14]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are not recommended in healthy, uncomplicated adults for the treatment of acute bronchitis, yet are still often prescribed. No randomized studies have examined whether prescribing antibiotics in the emergency department (ED) impacts hospital return rates.

Objective

Our aim was to compare hospital return rates between those who were prescribed an antibiotic vs. those who were not prescribed an antibiotic for the treatment of acute bronchitis.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was completed evaluating patients aged 18–64 years who presented to a community teaching hospital ED with acute bronchitis between January 2017 and December 2019. The primary outcomes were 30-day ED return and hospital admissions from initial ED visit. The rates of ED return or readmitted were compared for patients prescribed an antibiotic for treatment of acute bronchitis vs. those patients who were not prescribed an antibiotic.

Results

Of the 752 patients included, 311 (41%) were prescribed antibiotics. Baseline demographics were similar between both groups. Of those prescribed an antibiotic, 26 of 311 (8.4%) returned to the hospital within 30 days compared with 33 of 441 patients (7.5%) who were not prescribed an antibiotic (odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.92).

Conclusions

There was no association found between antibiotic therapy for treatment of acute bronchitis and return to the hospital.

### Delayed antibiotics for respiratory infections [^8dcf8076]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Modest benefits of antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections have to be weighed against common adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. There has been interest in ways to reduce antibiotic prescribing. One strategy is to provide the prescription, but advise delay of more than 48 hours before use, in the hope symptoms resolve first. Advocates suggest this will preserve patient satisfaction. This review asks what effect delayed antibiotics have on clinical outcomes of respiratory infections, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction.

Objectives

To evaluate the prescribing strategy of delayed antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections compared to immediate or no antibiotics for clinical outcomes, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 2, 2007), EMBASE (1990 to Week 2, 2007) and Current Contents - ISI Web of Knowledge (1998 to January 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients of all ages defined as having an acute respiratory infection were included in which delayed antibiotics were compared to antibiotics used immediately or no antibiotics. Outcomes measured included clinical outcomes, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected and analysed by three review authors.

Main Results

Nine trials were eligible on the basis of design and relevant outcomes. For most clinical outcomes there was no difference between delayed, immediate and no antibiotics. Antibiotics prescribed immediately were more effective than delayed for fever, pain and malaise in some studies of patients with acute otitis media and sore throat but for other studies there was no difference. There was no difference for the common cold and bronchitis. Delaying antibiotic prescriptions reduced antibiotic use, and in three studies, reduced patient satisfaction compared to immediate antibiotics. In the other two studies comparing delayed and immediate antibiotics measuring satisfaction, there was no difference. Two studies also included a 'no antibiotics' arm for bronchitis and sore throat: there was no difference in symptom resolution nor patient satisfaction from antibiotic delay. In one study, but not the other, antibiotic use was significantly decreased with no, rather than delayed, antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

For most clinical outcomes there is no difference between the strategies. Immediate antibiotics was the strategy most likely to provide the best clinical outcomes in patients with sore throat and otitis media. Delaying or avoiding antibiotics, rather than providing them immediately, reduces antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections. Delay also reduced patient satisfaction in three trials, compared to immediate antibiotics with no difference in two other trials. Delaying antibiotics seems to have little advantage over avoiding them altogether where it is safe to do so.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^7349c97f]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis implies a self limiting infection of the large airways and is characterised by cough without pneumonia. It is a prevalent disease and one of the most common reasons for visits in primary care. Patients often return to their doctor or seek other medical help as symptoms may persist for two or three weeks, mainly cough, which may be bothersome for some patients and could last for up to four weeks or more.

Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsy samples have never shown bacterial invasion. It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response of the epithelium of the bronchi to infections. Microscopic examination shows a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These findings are consistent with proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^0b2d4186]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Most of these infections are self limiting, and several studies have suggested that the benefit of antimicrobial treatment is marginal. However, most patients with acute bronchitis receive antibiotics, even in countries with low rates of antibiotic prescribing. This over-prescription constitutes a global problem and is an important factor in increasing the levels of antibiotic resistance. Several approaches for controlling acute cough have included narcotic cough suppressants, expectorants, antihistamines, decongestants, herbal remedies, and β 2 agonists. Even though all these drugs are widely prescribed in patients with acute bronchitis, evidence is scant that their use may be helpful for adults with cough. A Cochrane review of the use of antitussives in patients with acute cough showed no clear benefit for duration of cough. Some studies did report the beneficial effects of expectorants, but these studies were small and had methodological flaws. Another Cochrane review of β 2 agonists showed little evidence for their efficacy in adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow obstruction. However, their potential benefit in patients without chronic airway disease is not well supported by the data available and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use. There is therefore an urgent need to identify novel treatment measures to deal with this common infectious disease, particularly in light of growing patient expectations and increasing antibiotic resistance. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely prescribed in patients with lower respiratory tract infections, mainly for alleviating fever and chest pain as well as other common complaints such as cough. Notwithstanding, the effectiveness of these drugs for reducing the duration and intensity of cough has not been analysed in randomised clinical trials. No sufficiently powered studies have been published comparing the role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with that of antibiotics. We therefore compared the efficacy of ibuprofen and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with placebo in a group of otherwise healthy adults with acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum.

### Outpatient prescribing pattern for acute bronchitis in primary healthcare settings in China [^f610ab40]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis, an inflammation of the lower respiratory tract manifested by acute cough, is among the commonest clinical condition responsible for primary healthcare consultations. It is estimated that every year, 5% of the general population report an episode of acute bronchitis, 90% of whom seek medical advice. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited condition caused by virus in at least 90% of cases, in which antibiotics have no role in treatment. However, studies show that most patients with acute bronchitis are treated with inappropriate or ineffective therapies. Antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed for acute bronchitis up to 70% of the time, accounting for 44% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the US. Unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions provide no clinical improvement, increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and healthcare costs. Symptoms of acute bronchitis, such as acute cough and sputum production, generally last for 2–3 weeks. Clinicians are challenged with providing evidence-based and effective symptom control therapies as the viral syndromes progress.

Reducing overprescribing of antibiotics for respiratory infections has been emphasized in China in the past decade to tackle antibiotic resistance –. Previous study showed that 93.5% of acute bronchitis visits in Chinese primary healthcare settings involved an antibiotic prescription, among which more than 50% were inappropriate. However, studies are limited on the rates of antibiotic use and antibiotic selection for acute bronchitis in primary healthcare settings in China, as well as the detailed symptom treatment strategies for acute bronchitis. Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate outpatient antibiotic utilization, predictors of antibiotic use, and overall prescribing patterns for acute bronchitis at primary healthcare in China.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis: disease-specific issues that influence the cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy [^05002013]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) is a common condition, with substantial associated costs and morbidity. Research efforts have focused on innovations that will reduce the morbidity associated with AECB. Health care payers increasingly expect that the results of evidence-based economic evaluations will guide practitioners in their choice of cost-effective interventions.

Objectives

To provide a framework on which to base effective and efficient antimicrobial therapy for AECB, we present a concise clinical review of AECB, followed by an assessment of the available data on the economic impact of this disease. We then address several AECB-specific issues that must be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial interventions.

Methods

Published literature on the clinical and economic impact of AECB was identified using MEDLINE, pre-MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, Current Contents/All Editions, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases. Other potential sources were identified by searching for references in retrieved articles, review articles, consensus statements, and articles written by selected authorities.

Results

In evaluating cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy it is critical to (1) use the disease-free interval as an outcome measure, (2) evaluate the sequence of multiple therapies, (3) address the impact of both current and future antibiotic resistance, and (4) measure all appropriate AECB-associated costs, both direct and indirect.

Conclusions

Incorporating these approaches in economic analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy can help health care organizations make evidence-based decisions regarding the cost-effective management of AECB.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^6ca9c7b5]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are targets for improving antibiotic stewardship for outpatient acute respiratory infections?

Findings

Among 14 987 outpatients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in this cohort study during influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated, primarily viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis; 29% of patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were prescribed antibiotics. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 38% with pharyngitis tested negative for group A streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis had symptoms for 3 days or less before the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy was not required.

Meaning

Eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, improving influenza diagnosis and treatment, and reinforcing prescription guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^6dd171af]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis — pharmacologic therapy: For adult patients with chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis, "there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of any pharmacologic treatments (antibiotics, bronchodilators, mucolytics) as a means of relieving cough per se until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement)".

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^6bb044d4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In recent years the idea that acute bronchitis is more an inflammatory than infectious process has begun to take shape. Thus, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have shown to be effective in reducing the duration and the intensity of cough in patients with bronchitis in observational studies and they are therefore recommended in the guidelines of clinical practice. However, their effectiveness has not been observed in clinical trials. To date, no study has been published comparing the role of anti-inflammatory drugs with antibiotics. We therefore designed this clinical trial with the aim of determining the effectiveness of ibuprofen (most frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory drug in Spain) compared with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (antibiotic most often prescribed by Spanish primary care physicians) and also compared with a placebo groups of healthy adult patients with acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration.

Objectives

The aim of the study is to evaluate the number of days of frequent cough (defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more) in the three treatment arms (oral anti-inflammatory, antibiotic or placebo) taken during 10 days. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy on the second visit, evaluate the speed of action in the resolution of the symptoms of acute bronchitis in the three treatment arms, assess the relationship between C-reactive protein concentrations and the resolution of the symptoms in each treatment arm and evaluate the secondary effects and adverse reactions in the three treatment arms of the study.

### Antibiotics for treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^0b0598dd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aside from antibiotic therapy, other treatments also have a crucial role in AECOPD treatment. Glucocorticoids can accelerate patient recovery, improve lung function and hypoxia, and reduce treatment failure rates; however, they might not be effective in critically ill patients. Beta-receptor agonists are the first choice for bronchial dilation, and can improve clinical symptoms and lung function; long-term usage could also reduce the frequency of acute exacerbation and overall mortality. Furthermore, beta-receptor agonists are often combined with inhaled corticosteroids, which yields an even better treatment effect. In addition, N-acetylcysteine can be used for the treatment of COPD or chronic bronchitis to prevent exacerbations, and tiotropium can significantly reduce the frequency of exacerbations but not hospitalizations.

In the early treatment of patients with AECOPD, empirical antibiotic selection is very important for patient recovery. This network meta-analysis gives us a more comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and tolerability of these drugs; it also allow us to perform indirect comparisons between drugs. Although publication bias did not significantly impact the outcome, it should be noted that different treatment strategies, such as differences in dosages and duration of use, could impact the overall results. Bacterial antibiotic resistance also varies with time and place. Thus, the above factors need to be carefully considered when using antibiotics in the clinical setting. A comparison between traditional and network meta-analysis was not conducted, because the summary results were not consistent. Moreover, traditional meta-analyses only provide direct evidence evaluating the treatment effect of each type of antibiotic compared with placebo, whereas numerous studies provide indirect comparisons of different type of antibiotics.

There are still several limitations of this study. First, our analysis was performed on a study level, not on an individual level. Second, there were few RCTs using a single medication, which may have reduced the reliability of the meta-analysis. Third, there were other factors that could have influenced the results, such as drug dosage and the duration of use. Therefore, more RCTs of antibiotic treatment for AECOPD are needed.

### Should patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis be treated with antibiotics? Advantages of the use of fluoroquinolones [^aef57653]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The pathological changes in chronic bronchitis (CB) produce airflow obstruction, reduce the effectiveness of the mucocilliary drainage system and lead to bacterial colonisation of bronchial secretion. The presence of bacteria induces an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes. There is a direct relationship between the degree of impairment of the mucocilliary drainage system, the density of bacteria in mucus and the number of leukocytes in the sputum. Purulent sputum is a good marker of a high bacterial load. Eventually, if the number of leukocytes is high, their normal activity could decrease the effectiveness of the drainage system, increase the bronchial obstruction and probably damage the lung parenchyma. Whenever the density of bacteria in the bronchial lumen is ≥ 10⁶ CFU/mL, there is a high probability that the degree of inflammatory response will lead to a vicious cycle which in turn tends to sustain the process. This situation can arise during the clinical course of any acute exacerbation of CB, independently of its aetiology, provided the episode is sufficiently severe and/or prolonged. Fluoroquinolones of the third and fourth generation are bactericidal against most microorganisms usually related to acute exacerbations of CB. Their diffusion to bronchial mucus is adequate. When used in short (5-day) treatment they reduce the bacterial load in a higher proportion than is achieved by beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics given orally. Although the clinical cure rate is similar to that obtained with other antibiotics, the time between exacerbations could be increased.

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^5292687d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat'.
Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin). We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^d0cb3d9e]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

One of the results of this study is that antibiotic treatment was not more effective than placebo in shortening the duration of cough. Systematic analyses of clinical trials also suggest that antibiotics may achieve a reduction, albeit marginal, in the duration of the symptoms. A review of the Cochrane Library showed that patients given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough than were those given placebo (risk ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.85), but these results came from only four clinical trials with 275 participants in total. Another randomised clinical trial, based on data from the genomics to combat resistance against antibiotics in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (GRACE) study, not included in the Cochrane Library review, has recently been published. It constitutes, by far, the largest study carried out, including 16 networks in 12 European countries with 2061 adults aged 18 or older with acute cough of less than one month's duration as the prominent symptom, and once pneumonia was excluded on the basis of clinical grounds. Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse, which was considered as the main outcome, lasted a median of six days in the group allocated to amoxicillin 3 g daily and seven days in the placebo group, with a non-significant difference (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.18). Similar to our study design, Stott and colleagues included only patients with acute bronchitis and purulent sputum and did not observe any statistically significant differences in the resolution of cough between the group treated with antibiotics and the group assigned to the control. Current guidelines, endorsed by several national societies, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, do not recommend the routine use of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise normal people. None the less, after their introduction in the 1940s, antibacterial agents were rapidly embraced for treatment of acute bronchitis. At present, more than 60% of patients receive antibiotics for acute bronchitis, and it is currently one of the five most commonly cited infections for excessive antibiotic use in outpatients. Many doctors may not give antibiotics on the first visit, but are more likely to prescribe these antibacterials on subsequent visits, mainly if discoloured sputum is present. In a prospective study of more than 3000 adults with acute cough due a lower respiratory tract infection in 13 European countries, Butler and colleagues observed that patients who presented discoloured sputum were prescribed antibiotics 3.2 times more often than those patients without discoloured sputum. In other studies this odds ratio of antibiotic prescribing in the presence of discoloured sputum ranged from 2.1 to 4.8. This aspect is even more important since more than half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent sputum. Peroxidase released by the leucocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Another explanation for the frequent prescription of antibiotics is the lack of distinction between acute and chronic bronchitis. This may explain why clinicians perceive antibiotics to be more beneficial to smokers.

### Is co-morbidity taken into account in the antibiotic management of elderly patients with acute bronchitis and COPD exacerbations? [^7cc359f4]. Family Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on acute lower respiratory tract infections recommend restrictive use of antibiotics, however, in patients with relevant co-morbid conditions treatment with antibiotics should be considered. Presently, it is unknown whether GPs adhere to these guidelines and target antibiotic treatment more often at patients with risk-elevating conditions.

Objectives

We assessed whether in elderly primary care patients with acute bronchitis or exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease (COPD), antibiotics are more often prescribed to patients with risk-elevating co-morbid conditions.

Methods

Using the Utrecht GP research database, we analysed 2643 episodes in patients of 65 years of age or older with a GP-diagnosed acute bronchitis or exacerbation of COPD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to determine independent determinants of antibiotic use.

Results

Antibiotic prescribing rates were high in both acute bronchitis (84%) and in exacerbations of COPD (53%). In acute bronchitis, only age was an independent determinant of antibiotic use [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003–1.048], whereas in exacerbations of COPD antibiotics were more often prescribed to male patients (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.5), patients with diabetes (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.4) and heart failure (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.7).

Conclusion

Dutch GPs prescribe antibiotics in the majority of elderly patients with acute bronchitis and in half of the episodes of exacerbations of COPD. Tailoring their antibiotic treatment according to the presence or absence of high-risk co-morbid conditions could help GPs in improving antibiotic use in patients with respiratory tract infections in primary care.

### Is treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics effective? [^68e7d9c3]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis occurs in patients without underlying chronic pulmonary disease and is characterized by acute onset of productive cough and sputum and no evidence of pneumonia or sinusitis. Many patients with acute bronchitis receive antibiotic treatment, but it is unclear if it is effective. Bent and colleagues conducted this meta-analysis to determine if antibiotic treatment was beneficial in patients with acute bronchitis. English-language, randomized, controlled trials were included if they used an antibiotic in the treatment group and a placebo in the control group. Patients were not included if they had a history of chronic pulmonary disease or currently had pneumonia. Treatment in the studies had to last for at least five days to be included in the analysis. Outcomes measured included number of days of sputum production and amount of coughing.

Eight trials were included in the analysis, and three antibiotics were studied: erythromycin, doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Overall, there was a small but statistically significant benefit in the patients who received antibiotics. This quantified to approximately one half day less of sputum production and coughing. However, four of the studies showed no significant benefit from the use of antibiotics. Although the authors found a benefit from antibiotic use in adults with acute bronchitis, they recommend considering the possible adverse effects and increase in antibiotic resistance before prescribing antibiotics. The benefit, although statistically significant, is small enough that it does not outweigh the risks.

### Antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection in children presenting in primary care in england (ARTIC PC): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^0e8fae6f]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We used the Cochrane systematic review as the basis for assessing the evidence. The authors of the Cochrane review searched for primary research of randomised controlled trials with no language restrictions in CENTRAL 2016, issue 11 (accessed Jan 13, 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to Jan week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to Jan 13, 2017), and LILACS (1982 to Jan 13, 2017); and searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform andon April 5, 2017. Search terms are in the appendix (p 13). The review of antibiotics for acute bronchitis documented that antibiotics have a modest effect on cough duration (seven studies, 2776 participants, mean difference −0.46 days [95% CI −0.87 to −0.04]). However, the trials in the Cochrane review included very few children and the differences in immunity and anatomy between adults and children prohibit simply applying evidence derived in adults to the management of children.

Added value of this study

This study confirms that antibiotics (amoxicillin) do not provide a clinically important benefit for symptom duration among children presenting with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections (antibiotic median 5 days vs placebo 6 days, hazard ratio 1.13 [95% CI 0.90 to 1.42]), nor in the key clinical subgroups that clinicians commonly prescribe for (those with chest signs, fever, physician rating of unwell, sputum or chest rattle, and shortness of breath).

Implications of all the available evidence

The data from our study and previous studies suggest that unless pneumonia is suspected, clinicians should provide so-called safety-netting advice (ie, explain what illness course to expect and when it would be necessary to reattend) but not prescribe antibiotics for most children presenting with chest infections.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute bronchitis, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to do not obtain testing for inflammatory markers, such as CRP and procalcitonin levels, routinely for diagnosing acute bronchitis or guiding antibiotic initiation. Recognize that CRP testing at the point-of-care in patients with acute respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis, may reduce antibiotic prescriptions in primary care without affecting recovery rates. Insufficient evidence regarding the impact of procalcitonin testing on antibiotic prescriptions in primary care.

### Operationalising outpatient antimicrobial stewardship to reduce system-wide antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^b14f7989]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Background

Inappropriate antibiotic use in the outpatient setting is associated with patient harm due to resistance and antibiotic-related adverse events. Acute uncomplicated bronchitis (AUB) treatment guidelines do not recommend antibiotics for most patients. From 2005 to 2012, antibiotics were prescribed for bronchitis in 85% of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary, emergency and urgent care encounters. The Joint Commission requires outpatient antimicrobial stewardship (AS) to optimise evidence-based practice, and reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and unnecessary costs.

With the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, limited production of novel antibiotics and potential adverse effects of antibiotics, national efforts within the VA healthcare facilities to create stewardship programmes addressing overuse and misuse of antibiotics have remained a priority over the last decade. Multiple barriers to stewardship include: data availability to inform interventions; access to technology and technology-based tools; capacity to produce and analyse stewardship-related data; organisational support including financial support, education of providers and patients; and relationships between stewardship personnel and providers.

Here we describe the implementation and results of a quality improvement stewardship intervention to reduce antibiotic prescribing for AUB and upper respiratory tract infections (URIs).

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^8f7f71fd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

### Azithromycin for acute lower respiratory tract infections [^6ed06888]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) range from acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Approximately five million people die from acute respiratory tract infections annually. Among these, pneumonia represents the most frequent cause of mortality, hospitalisation and medical consultation. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, structurally modified from erythromycin and noted for its activity against some gram-negative organisms associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae).

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (amoxyclav) in the treatment of LRTI, in terms of clinical failure, incidence of adverse events and microbial eradication.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October week 4, 2014) and EMBASE (January 1974 to November 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, comparing azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in participants with clinical evidence of an acute LRTI, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors independently assessed all potential studies identified from the searches for methodological quality. We extracted and analysed relevant data separately. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We initially pooled all types of acute LRTI in the meta-analyses. We investigated the heterogeneity of results using the forest plot and Chi² test. We also used the index of the I² statistic to measure inconsistent results among trials. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included 16 trials involving 2648 participants. We were able to analyse 15 of the trials with 2496 participants. The pooled analysis of all the trials showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical failure on about days 10 to 14 between the two groups (risk ratio (RR), random-effects 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.85). A subgroup analysis in trials with acute bronchitis participants showed significantly lower clinical failure in the azithromycin group compared to amoxycillin or amoxyclav (RR random-effects 0.63; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). A sensitivity analysis showed a non-significant reduction in clinical failure in azithromycin-treated participants (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.21) in three adequately concealed studies, compared to RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.49 in 12 studies with inadequate concealment. Twelve trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication and there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). The reduction of adverse events in the azithromycin group was RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00).

Authors' Conclusions

There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI. In patients with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, azithromycin tends to be more effective in terms of lower incidence of treatment failure and adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, most studies were of unclear methodological quality and had small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^0716bdb1]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis — evidence base and clinical statement: Only six studies were eligible, with five pharmacological and one nonpharmacological intervention, and the nonpharmacological study used positive end-expiratory pressure; although all authors reported significant improvement in cough measures, studies were very small, had design or outcome limitations, several did not present cough outcome data, most were short in duration (2 to 12 weeks for pharmacologic studies and 6 months for the nonpharmacologic study), and using GRADE the evidence level was very low; accordingly, for adult patients with chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of any pharmacologic treatments (antibiotics, bronchodilators, mucolytics) as a means of relieving cough per se.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^9c72b7ed]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis cough therapies in adult outpatients — evidence and search yield report that for PICO question 2 the searches identified "925 studies" in PubMed, "143 studies" in Scopus, "28 studies" in Cochrane systematic reviews, and "168 unique studies" in Cochrane Central, and "This totaled 631 studies retrieved"; "Seventy-three studies out of the 631 proceeded to full-text review, where only one study was determined to meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified by the panel", and "The PICO question 2 updated search retrieved no new studies". The single included RCT "was a multicenter, single-blinded randomized controlled trial in 416 adults" who were "randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens: ibuprofen 600 mg, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 500 mg/ 125 mg, or placebo three times a day for 10 days", with median days of frequent cough reported as "ibuprofen: 9 days (95% CI, 8–10), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid: 11 days (95% CI, 10–12), and placebo: 11 days (95% CI, 8–14)", and the authors concluded "no significant differences were observed in the number of days with cough".

### Head-to-head oral prophylactic antibiotic therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^ba61c176]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety.

Objectives

To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.

Main Results

We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.

### Changing the antibiotic prescribing of Australian general practice registrars' for acute respiratory tract infections: a non-randomized controlled trial [^a9dfd5d4]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a global health concern with over 1 million deaths estimated as attributable to bacterial resistance in 2019. Antibiotic overprescribing is a key contributor to antibiotic resistance and much of this prescribing occurs in primary care. In Australia, a large proportion of antibiotic overprescribing occurs for non-pneumonia acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), of which acute bronchitis is an important component.

Evidence-based guidelines consistently recommend against prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis as there is evidence of minimal, if any, clinical benefit. Despite this, Australian general practitioners (GPs) prescribed antibiotics in 81% of acute bronchitis cases in 2021. Prescribing rates for other ARTIs [upper RTI (antibiotics not recommended) and acute otitis media, acute sore throat, and acute sinusitis [antibiotics recommended in only a minority of cases]) are similarly in excess of Australian and international benchmarks. This evidence highlights a need to reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs in the primary care setting.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^7c25f916]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory infections in primary care, and in more than 90% of the cases antibiotics are prescribed, mainly when purulent expectoration is present. However, this process is usually viral in origin and the benefits of antibiotic treatment are marginal. On the other hand, in recent years bronchitis has been considered more as an inflammatory than an infectious process. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a schedule of an oral anti-inflammatory compared with an antibiotic regimen and another group assigned to receive a placebo.

Methods and design

A total of 420 patients from 15 to 70 years of age with no associated comorbidity, presenting respiratory tract infection of at least one week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptom, the presence of purulent expectoration and at least one other symptom of the respiratory tract (dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort or pain), with no alternative explanation such as pneumonia, will be included in a prospective, randomised and controlled, clinical trial with placebo. The patients will be randomised to receive one of three treatments: ibuprofen, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid or placebo for 10 days. The main outcome measure is the number of days with frequent cough defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more.

Discussion

This trial is designed to evaluate the number of days with frequent cough with anti-inflammatory treatment compared with antimicrobial treatment and placebo in previously healthy patients with a clinical picture of acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration. It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory treatment is more effective than antibiotic treatment to reduce cough, which is the most disturbing symptom for patients with this infection.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^cba8ff02]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) — key research priorities and guideline conclusions are as follows: priorities include determining the outcomes of chronic wet cough following an acute infection in various settings (community and hospital) through multicenter cohort studies; conducting multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on antibiotic efficacy in primary care using validated cough outcome measures, and "Ideally, an objective cough outcome (eg, cough counts) should also be included as an outcome"; determining the optimal length of antibiotics in different circumstances; defining the most appropriate time point for referral for further investigations when specific cough pointers are absent and wet cough persists after antibiotic treatment; and intervention studies to prevent recurrence of PBB, especially for those with very frequent recurrences. The document states that this update of the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines produced new recommendations from systematic reviews addressing two key clinical questions, recognizes PBB as a clinical diagnostic entity not mentioned in the 2006 guidelines, and notes these recommendations were endorsed by the CHEST Expert Cough Panel, with high-quality evidence for most recommendations but remaining gaps particularly in primary care. The guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), Asian Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR), and Irish Thoracic Society (ITS).

Fig. 1.
Number of ambulatory patients with a primary diagnosis of bronchitis, April 2017–August 2020. Complete lines, number of visits; dashed lines, number of antibiotic prescriptions.

The COVID-19 pandemic, while challenging for so many other aspects of antimicrobial stewardship, has led to an overall net reduction in ambulatory adults seeking care for bronchitis in our health system and to a dramatic reduction in antibiotic prescribing for that condition. Reducing unnecessary, outpatient antibiotic prescribing has long been a difficult challenge for many antimicrobial stewardship programs. Our challenge will be to educate patients and clinicians to maintain these improvements in outpatient, acute bronchitis management as the pandemic is brought under control and outpatient visits return to prepandemic levels.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^fe5b6f95]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^b2f31260]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Previous research

There is clear evidence that antibiotics should not be recommended in non-complicated acute bronchitis. However, their use on behalf of primary care physicians in Spain is greater than 80%. Similar percentages have been reported by primary care practitioners in United States and other countries. Systematic analyses of clinical trials suggest that antibiotics may achieve a reduction, albeit only marginal, in the duration of the symptoms. Specifically, a meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials showed that the symptoms reduced a few hours with the use of doxycycline, erythromycin or trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. The results were statistically significant but clinically trivial. The results of a randomized, double-blind study in which a course of azithromycin during 5 days in 112 patients was compared with vitamin C in 108 patients published after this meta-analysis did not show any difference between groups in the quality of life at 7 days (main outcome variable) or in the proportion of patients who had to return to work, school or normal activities at home at days 3 or 7. A review of the Cochrane Library including 9 randomized, controlled, clinical trials of antibiotic agents (including three clinical trials not included in the previous review) also showed a significant, albeit lower, reduction in the duration of cough, of only 0.6 hours. A non-significant reduction in the number of days of feeling badly and a non-significant increase in the number of adverse effects attributed to the antibiotic therapy (relative risk of adverse effects: 1.22; CI95%: 0.94 to 1.58) were also found. At this point, the study by Stott et al. is of note in which only patients with acute bronchitis with purulent expectoration were included and in which no statistically significant differences were observed in the resolution of cough between the group treated with antibiotics and those assigned to the control group. Thus, Spanish primary care physicians have the perception that the presence of purulent expectoration in the course of acute bronchitis is suggestive of bacterial superinfection, very probably due to the fact that purulent expectoration is a criterion of antibiotic therapy in patients with other lower respiratory tract infections such as acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Indeed, in a questionnaire given to more than 1,000 primary care physicians, more than 90% responded that they would treat a 30-year-old patient with associated comorbidity presenting a non-pneumonic respiratory infection with sputum purulence with antibiotics.

### The diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis [^2e7c2b82]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of chronic bronchitis (CB), bronchiectasis, emphysema, and reversible airway disease that combine uniquely in an individual patient. Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components — emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment.

### Atypical pathogens and respiratory tract infections [^3390ee5b]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The atypical respiratory pathogens Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are now recognised as a significant cause of acute respiratory-tract infections, implicated in community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, and less frequently, upper respiratory-tract infections. Chronic infection with C. pneumoniae is common among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may also play a role in the natural history of asthma, including exacerbations. The lack of a gold standard for diagnosis of these pathogens still handicaps the current understanding of their true prevalence and role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory infections. While molecular diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, offer improvements in sensitivity, specificity and rapidity over culture and serology, the need remains for a consistent and reproducible diagnostic technique, available to all microbiology laboratories. Current treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia recognise the importance of atypical respiratory pathogens in its aetiology, for which macrolides are considered suitable first-line agents. The value of atypical coverage in antibiotic therapy for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and exacerbations of asthma is less clear, while there is no evidence to suggest that atypical pathogens should be covered in antibiotic treatment of upper respiratory-tract infections.

### Antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections and acute bronchitis: a longitudinal analysis of general practitioner trainees [^6251301c]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have found significant reductions in registrars' prescribing of antibiotics for URTI and acute bronchitis over the period 2010–2019. Prescribing for acute bronchitis, though, remains high and should be the subject of further educational interventions and antimicrobial stewardship interventions.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^4f6ceadc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is a clinical term which implies a self-limiting infection of the large airways and is characterized by clinical manifestations of cough without pneumonia. This process affects approximately 5% of adults annually with a greater incidence in the winter. It accounts for 9.4% of the infections attended by family physicians. Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsies have never demonstrated bacterial invasion. In some cases atypical germs may be involved including Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia.

It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response to infections of the epithelium of the bronchi. Microscopic examination demonstrates a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These pathological findings are consistent with publications of proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography. During the first days of infection, the symptoms of upper respiratory infections cannot be clinically distinguished from the symptoms of acute bronchitis. However, in acute bronchitis cough lasts more than five days and during this prolonged period of symptoms, the results of functional respiratory tests are usually abnormal. Forty per cent of the patients present significant reductions in forced espiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) with values of less than 80% over the theoretical value, or bronchial hyper-reactivity with improvement during the following 5–6 weeks. Cough may persist from 10 to 20 days in acute bronchitis, but it may sometimes last up to 4 weeks or more. In a recent study on the efficacy of the acellular pertussis vaccine including 2,781 healthy adults, the mean duration of cough in acute bronchitis by all causes was 18 days, with a median of 24 days. Moreover, almost half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent expectoration. Peroxidase released by the leukocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Indeed, in healthy adults, the positive predictive value of purulent sputum for the presence of alveolar disease is low, being of approximately 10%.

Bronchitis has shown to reduce the quality of life of patients. One study on the quality of life of patients with infections of the upper respiratory tract, some of which were labelled acute bronchitis, showed a reduction in seven subscales of the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey, including vital and social function, although this decrease was transitory. Furthermore, up to twenty per cent of the patients return to their physician within the first month for the persistence of symptoms.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^281b8969]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — management of chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis in children: In children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough, there is high-quality evidence that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^50b0836d]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel suggestions — management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients state there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the efficacy of prescribed treatments for cough due to acute bronchitis. For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, if the acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and remarks note that differential diagnoses, such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Antibiotics for persistent cough or wheeze following acute bronchiolitis in children [^bbc85982]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a common acute respiratory condition with high prevalence worldwide. This clinically diagnosed syndrome is manifested by tachypnoea (rapid breathing), with crackles or wheeze in young children. In the acute phase of bronchiolitis (≤ 14 days), antibiotics are not routinely prescribed unless the illness is severe or a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Although bronchiolitis is usually self-limiting, some young children continue to have protracted symptoms (e.g. cough and wheezing) beyond the acute phase and often re-present to secondary care.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) for reducing or treating persistent respiratory symptoms following acute bronchiolitis within six months of acute illness.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the World Health Organization (WHO) trial portal, the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov, up to 26 August 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) given in the post-acute phase of bronchiolitis (> 14 days) for children younger than two years with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies against predefined criteria, and selected, extracted, and assessed data for inclusion. We contacted trial authors for further information.

Main Results

In this review update, we added one study with 219 children. A total of two RCTs with 249 children (n = 240 completed) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Both studies contributed to our primary and secondary outcomes, but we assessed the quality of evidence for our three primary outcomes as low, owing to the small numbers of studies and participants; and high attrition in one of the studies. Data show no significant differences between treatment groups for our primary outcomes: proportion of children (n = 249) who had persistent symptoms at follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.28; fixed-effect model); and number of children (n = 240) rehospitalised with respiratory illness within six months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21; random-effects model). We were unable to analyse exacerbation rate because studies used different methods to report this information. Data showed no significant differences between treatment groups for our secondary outcome: proportion of children (n = 240) with wheeze at six months (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.95; random-effects model). One study reported bacterial resistance, but only at 48 hours (thus with limited applicability for this review). Another study reported adverse events from which all children recovered and remained in the study.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to inform whether antibiotics should be used to treat or prevent persistent respiratory symptoms in the post-acute bronchiolitis phase. Future RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics for reducing persistent respiratory symptoms. This is particularly important in populations with high acute and post-acute bronchiolitis morbidity (e.g. indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA).

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^f422752c]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Anti-inflammatory therapy in stable COPD — phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and antibiotics: In patients with chronic bronchitis, severe to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbations, roflumilast improves lung function and reduces moderate and severe exacerbations, and ensifentrine improves lung function but an effect on exacerbations has not been evaluated in patients at increased exacerbation risk. Long-term azithromycin and erythromycin therapy reduces exacerbations over one year. Preferentially, but not only in former smokers with exacerbations despite appropriate therapy, azithromycin can be considered. Treatment with azithromycin is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance and hearing test impairments.

### Azithromycin for acute lower respiratory tract infections [^27644144]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The spectrum of acute lower respiratory tract infection ranges from acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Annually approximately five million people die of acute respiratory tract infections. Among these, pneumonia represents the most frequent cause of mortality, hospitalization and medical consultation. Azithromycin is a new macrolide antibiotic, structurally modified from erythromycin and is noted for its activity against some gram-negative organisms associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae).

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (amoxyclav) in the treatment of LRTI, in terms of clinical failure, incidence of adverse events and microbial eradication.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 3, 2004), and EMBASE (January 1988 to 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, which compared azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in patients with clinical evidence of acute LRTI: acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis were studied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The criteria for assessing study quality were generation of allocation sequence, concealment of treatment allocation, blinding, and completeness of the trial. All types of acute lower respiratory tract infections were initially pooled in the meta-analyses. Funnel plot was used to examine publication bias. The heterogeneity of results was investigated by the forest plot and Chi-square test. Index of I² was also used to measure inconsistency results among trials. Subgroup analysis was conducted for age, types of respiratory tract infection and types of antibiotic in control groups. Sensitivity analysis was conducted under the condition of trial size and concealment of treatment allocation.

Main Results

Fourteen trials with 2,521 enrolled patients used 2,416 patients in the analysis. A total of 1,350 patients received azithromycin and 1,066 received amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The pooled analysis of all trials showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical failure on about day 10 to 14 after therapy started between the two groups (relative risk (RR) (random effects) 0.96; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.57). Sensitivity analysis showed that a reduction of clinical failure in azithromycin-treated patients (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.12) in three adequately concealed studies, compared to RR 1.14 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.08) in eleven studies with inadequate concealment. Eleven trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication and there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07). The reduction of adverse events in azithromycin group was RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.00).

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in treating acute LRTI. Future trials with high methodological quality are needed.

### Antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection in children presenting in primary care in england (ARTIC PC): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^e7e56c6d]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Only one trial in the Cochrane review of antibiotics for acute bronchitis included children as young as 3 years of age presenting with uncomplicated acute chest infections. In that trial, there were only 100 children aged 12 years or younger, and the estimate of immediate antibiotics compared with no offer of antibiotics on symptom duration (HR 1.00) and symptom severity (mean reduction −0.3 on a scale of 0–6) was similar to the non-significant result of the whole trial cohort. These results are consistent with the results of the current study. A Cochrane review found inconclusive evidence for the effect of antibiotics in preventing RTIs, but a more recent trial of azithromycin used in early infections was effective in preventing severe illness among preschool children with recurrent infection(from 8% to 5%), although concern remains about the longer-term effects on antibiotic resistance from the use of long-acting macrolides. A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic versus placebo for pneumonia in young children in an LMIC setting found low failure rates in both placebo (5%) and antibiotic (3%) groups, and a 5-day course is equivalent to 10 days for community-acquired pneumonia.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^78f895c5]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — definition, evidence, and panel suggestions are as follows: Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria, and this study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo, while no eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner, and if the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Azithromycin for acute lower respiratory tract infections [^e6201b48]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) range from acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Approximately five million people die of acute respiratory tract infections annually. Among these, pneumonia represents the most frequent cause of mortality, hospitalization and medical consultation. Azithromycin is a new macrolide antibiotic, structurally modified from erythromycin and noted for its activity against some gram-negative organisms associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae).

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (amoxyclav) in the treatment of LRTI, in terms of clinical failure, incidence of adverse events and microbial eradication.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007 Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2007), and EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials, comparing azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in participants with clinical evidence of acute LRTI: acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis were studied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The criteria for assessing study quality were generation of allocation sequence, concealment of treatment allocation, blinding, and completeness of the trial. All types of acute LRTI were initially pooled in the meta-analyses. The heterogeneity of results was investigated by the forest plot and Chi-square test. Index of I² was also used to measure inconsistent results among trials. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

Fifteen trials were analysed. The pooled analysis of all trials showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical failure on about day 10 to 14 between the two groups (relative risk (RR), random-effects 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.85). Sensitivity analysis showed a reduction of clinical failure in azithromycin-treated participants (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.21) in three adequately concealed studies, compared to RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.49 in 12 studies with inadequate concealment. Twelve trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication and there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). The reduction of adverse events in the azithromycin group was RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00).

Authors' Conclusions

There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxicillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI. In patients with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, azithromycin tends to be more effective in terms of lower incidence of treatment failure and adverse events than amoxicillin or amoxyclav. Future trials of high methodological quality are needed.

Antibiotics — moxifloxacin and doxycycline: Pulse therapy with moxifloxacin (400 mg/day for 5 days every 8 weeks) in patients with chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations had no beneficial effect on the exacerbation rate overall, and long-term doxycycline did not reduce exacerbations although there may be responder subgroups.

Appropriate diagnosis and management by health providers

Gender-biased health systems, lack of adequate representation of women in the medical field and inadequate research on women's health can lead to unintended gender-bias in patient care and over prescription of antibiotics to women. For instance, 72% of the physicians working in countries across Africa are men. As a result, women may have fewer tools to negotiate risk reduction interventions. For example, a study based in Sweden and the USA revealed that being women was correlated with a higher likelihood of inappropriate prescribing for viral respiratory tract infections, viral bronchitis, viral pneumonia, influenza or pleurisy. In general, women's health remains severely underfunded, suffers from insufficient research addressing them and women remain under-represented in clinical trials.

There is also evidence that doctor–patient gender concordance plays a role in healthcare delivery and outcomes. A study in the Netherlands found that female general practitioners (GPs) prescribed less antibiotics, especially to female patients, while prescriptions by male GPs did not vary by patient gender, after controlling for comorbidities and patient age in both cases. This evidence underscores the importance of gender dynamics in healthcare, suggesting that increasing the representation of female healthcare providers may lead to improved healthcare delivery and outcomes, especially for women. It also highlights the need for further training and awareness among male providers to address potential biases in treatment.

The lack of diagnostic infrastructure, combined with insufficient research into women's health issues, contributes to gender differences in AMR. A study from several African countries underscores this disparity, revealing that gonorrhoea symptoms differ between men and women, with women frequently being misdiagnosed. This misdiagnosis, arising from inadequate screening/testing from doctors, as well as discomfort and shame from patients can result in the prescription of incorrect antibiotics, leading to increased treatment failure.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for acute bronchitis [^dfae1e8d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care physicians. It is traditionally treated with antibiotics (although the evidence for their effectiveness is weak, and modest at best) and other even less effective treatments. Chinese medicinal herbs have also been used as a treatment.

Objectives

This review aimed to summarise the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for treating uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4) which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 19 September 19, 2011), EMBASE (1988 to 19 September 2011) and CNKI and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1980 to 19 September, 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo, antibiotics or other Western medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

In this updated review, 74 studies involving 6877 participants were reported as RCTs by the study authors. None of them met the inclusion criteria for this review. Out of the 74 trials, we identified 39 as non-RCTs and 35 compared different Chinese herbal medicines in the intervention and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient quality data to recommend the routine use of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. Trial design limitations of the individual studies meant that we could not draw any conclusions about the benefits of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. In addition, the safety of Chinese herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence for these herbs, although adverse events were reported in some case reports.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f6b6b569]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric chronic wet/productive cough (≤ 14 years) initial therapy — For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (eg, coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), we recommend that children receive 2 weeks of antibiotics targeted to common respiratory bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) and local antibiotic sensitivities (Grade 1A).

Summary of evidence and interpretation — time frames and risks: Among studies, the time frame used for "nonresolution" following antibiotics varied, although most studies used a cutoff of 4 weeks; two studies described an increased risk of the presence of underlying lung disease such as bronchiectasis when the cough did not respond to 2 to 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, and one additional study determined that longer cough duration was associated with worse radiologic features (higher Bhalla score).
