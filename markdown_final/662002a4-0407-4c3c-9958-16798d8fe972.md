## Question

What causes a low anion gap

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what causes a low anion gap. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the calculation and excluding laboratory error. Then, I should consider physiologic contributors, especially hypoalbuminemia and polyclonal gammopathies. Next, I will examine unmeasured cations such as lithium, calcium, and magnesium, and I must not forget salicylate-related pseudohyperchloremia. After that, I should review how modern analyzers have shifted the reference range and how to correct the anion gap for albumin. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight pitfalls and special contexts like toxic alcohols and SGLT2 inhibitor–associated acidosis, ensuring each assertion is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the basics and verify the calculation, because a low or negative anion gap often reflects a mistake rather than a disease process. I should double-check the formula AG = Na⁺ − (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻), ensure units are consistent, and repeat the electrolytes if the value is unexpectedly low, as sporadic or systematic lab errors are common culprits here [^11362PDQ] [^112tEJd9].

> Wait, let me verify the laboratory methodology, because salicylate poisoning can cause pseudohyperchloremia on some chloride ion-selective electrodes, artifactually lowering the anion gap and masking a high anion gap acidosis. If salicylate toxicity is suspected, I should request a chloridometer-based chloride or contact the lab for alternative methods and not rely solely on the reported AG to exclude salicylism [^115SkVty] [^112V6Cur].

> Hold on, I should also consider the reference range shift. With modern analyzers, many healthy individuals have an AG around 6 mmol/L or less, so a "low" AG in the 4–6 mmol/L range may actually be normal for that lab, and I need to interpret results against the local reference interval rather than assuming a universal 8–12 mmol/L range [^113kRJoE].

> Next, I will examine physiologic contributors, and hypoalbuminemia is the most common cause of a low AG. Albumin contributes the bulk of unmeasured anions, so a fall in albumin lowers the baseline AG, and I should correct the AG for albumin using a pragmatic factor of about 2.5–3 mEq/L per 1 g/dL decrease from 4.0 g/dL, while remembering that correction factors vary with total CO2 and clinical context, so I must be cautious in overinterpreting exact numbers [^1172rQYh] [^112tEJd9].

> I need to check for paraproteinemas next. Polyclonal gammopathies can add positively charged proteins that reduce the AG, and in a classic series, when hypoalbuminemia and hyponatremia were excluded, a verified low AG carried a notable specificity for multiple myeloma, so I should consider serum protein electrophoresis if the low AG persists and no other explanation is found [^116pJ35D] [^116MrCML].

> Let me consider unmeasured cations, because their accumulation directly lowers the AG. Lithium toxicity is a classic cause and can produce a low or even negative AG, and I should correlate with clinical history and, when possible, use an albumin- and lactate-corrected AG to improve diagnostic performance for toxic lithium levels, recognizing that a very low AG in the right context has a strong negative likelihood ratio for toxicity [^115NL1wd] [^112tEJd9].

> But wait, what if calcium or magnesium are markedly elevated? Hypercalcemia and hypermagnesemia can each contribute to a reduced AG, so I should review the electrolyte panel for divalent cation excesses and consider medications or endocrine etiologies if present, keeping in mind that severe hypermagnesemia is less common but can be clinically significant when it occurs [^112mhVzE] [^112tEJd9].

> I should double-check for bromide or iodide intoxication as well, even though bromism is now rare. Historically, bromide could cause a low or negative AG, and although uncommon today, it remains a valid consideration in the right medication history context, reinforcing the need to reconcile the AG with the clinical picture and potential exposures [^112tEJd9] [^111yu5Fj].

> Next, I should review how to correct the AG for albumin in practice. A simple bedside approach is to add roughly 2.5–3 mEq/L for each 1 g/dL that albumin is below 4.0 g/dL, but I must remember that more sophisticated models incorporating total CO2 can perform better in ICU cohorts, and that overcorrection can mislead, so I should integrate the corrected AG with the overall acid–base assessment rather than using it in isolation [^1172rQYh] [^115eyV8N].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiologies of acidosis when the AG is low. I need to ensure I am not conflating a low AG with non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is a separate entity characterized by bicarbonate loss and chloride retention, and in that scenario the AG is typically normal rather than truly low, so I should verify the AG against the local reference and the albumin-corrected value before labeling the acid–base disorder [^113XiPyq] [^113uTM3c].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic approach: first, repeat electrolytes and confirm the AG. Second, review analyzer type and consider salicylate interference if chloride seems incongruent. Third, check albumin and apply a correction. Fourth, assess for paraproteinemia with SPEP if the low AG persists. Fifth, review medications and exposures for lithium, bromide, calcium, and magnesium. Sixth, interpret the final AG in the context of the clinical scenario and local reference range, escalating to toxicology or hematology consultation when indicated [^11362PDQ] [^113kRJoE] [^116pJ35D].

> I should confirm special contexts that can confuse interpretation. In salicylate poisoning, a very low or negative AG due to pseudohyperchloremia can coexist with a true high anion gap acidosis, so a normal AG does not exclude salicylism, and I must maintain a high index of suspicion when the clinical picture fits, requesting alternative chloride methods if needed [^115SkVty] [^112V6Cur].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate clearly that a low AG is uncommon but diagnostically meaningful. After excluding lab error and salicylate artifact, persistent low values should prompt evaluation for hypoalbuminemia, paraproteinemia, and unmeasured cations, with targeted testing guided by history, because identifying these entities can materially change management and prognosis [^116MrCML] [^112tEJd9].

---

A low anion gap is most often due to **hypoalbuminemia** (reduced unmeasured anions) or **laboratory error** (pseudohyperchloremia from salicylate interference) [^116pJ35D] [^115SkVty]. Other causes include **multiple myeloma** (paraproteins), **lithium or bromide toxicity** (unmeasured cations), and **hypercalcemia or hypermagnesemia** [^116MrCML] [^112tEJd9]. A low anion gap is uncommon and, when confirmed, should prompt verification of the calculation, correction for albumin, and evaluation for paraproteinemias or toxicologic causes [^116MrCML] [^11362PDQ] [^1172rQYh] [^112tEJd9].

---

## Physiological basis of the anion gap

The anion gap is the difference between measured cations (Na+) and measured anions (Cl−, HCO3−), reflecting unmeasured anions (primarily albumin) and cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) [^112mhVzE]. The normal range is **8–12 mEq/L**, largely determined by albumin; each 1 g/dL drop in albumin lowers the AG by ~2.5 mEq/L [^117AXzGs].

---

## Common causes of low anion gap

### Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia is the **most common cause** of a low anion gap; because albumin is the main unmeasured anion, low levels reduce the AG [^116pJ35D]. Each 1 g/dL decrease in albumin lowers the AG by ~2.5 mEq/L [^117AXzGs].

---

### Laboratory errors and analytical interferences

- **Pseudohyperchloremia**: Salicylates can artifactually elevate chloride on some analyzers, lowering the AG or making it negative [^115SkVty].
- **Bromide interference**: Bromide can be misread as chloride, causing a falsely low or negative AG [^115SkVty].

---

### Paraproteinemias

In paraproteinemias, **multiple myeloma** produces positively charged paraproteins that lower the AG [^112tEJd9].

---

### Increased unmeasured cations

- **Lithium toxicity**: Lithium (Li+) is an unmeasured cation that lowers the AG [^11362PDQ].
- **Hypercalcemia/hypermagnesemia**: Elevated Ca2+ or Mg2+ can reduce the AG [^11362PDQ].

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic implications

A low anion gap is **uncommon and often overlooked**; when present, it should prompt:

- **Verification**: Repeat electrolytes and confirm the calculation [^115qZBqk].
- **Albumin correction**: Adjust the AG for hypoalbuminemia [^115oS1GG].
- **Paraproteinemia evaluation**: Consider SPEP/UPEP for myeloma [^112tEJd9].
- **Toxicology**: Assess for salicylate, lithium, or bromide exposure [^115SkVty].

---

## Clinical approach to low anion gap

1. Verify calculation and repeat electrolytes [^11362PDQ]
2. Correct AG for albumin [^115oS1GG]
3. Evaluate for paraproteinemias (SPEP/UPEP) [^116MrCML]
4. Check for toxicologic causes (salicylates, lithium, bromide) [^115SkVty]
5. Consider hypercalcemia or hypermagnesemia [^11362PDQ]

---

A low anion gap is rare and most often reflects **hypoalbuminemia** or **laboratory error**; when confirmed, it should trigger a structured evaluation for paraproteinemias and toxicologic causes.

### The anion gap [^112mhVzE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1977). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Serum Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Anion Gap Calculator measures the difference between cations (Na⁺) and anions (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻) in blood to evaluate metabolic acidosis. It identifies normal, elevated, or low anion gaps, aiding in diagnosing acid-base disorders.

The Anion Gap calculator provides a way to assess metabolic acidosis by analyzing the concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in the blood. Here's how it works:

You start with three key inputs, measured in mmol/L:
- **Sodium**: Typically falls within a range of 120 to 160.
- **Chloride**: Ranges from 70 to 130.
- **Bicarbonate**: Generally between 10 and 40.

With these values, the anion gap is determined using the formula:
Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate)

This simple calculation yields an output, the anion gap, which is measured in mmol/L and usually falls within a physiological range, though theoretically it can extend from 0 to 10,000.

Interpreting the anion gap provides valuable clinical insights:

- A normal anion gap is typically between 8 and 12 mmol/L. This range suggests there are no significant unmeasured anions affecting the blood plasma.
- A high anion gap, generally above 12 mmol/L, may signal conditions such as ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or the ingestion of particular toxins like methanol or ethylene glycol.
- A low anion gap is less frequent and could be linked to hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia, or other more rare conditions.

By entering the values for sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the calculator, you can compute the anion gap and interpret the results to identify possible metabolic disturbances based on these guidelines.

### Association between delta anion gap / delta bicarbonate and outcome of surgical patients admitted to intensive care unit [^114Waxtf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The maintenance of the acid-base balance during the perioperative period is vital to maintain homeostasis of diverse physiological conditions which have direct implication on surgical outcome. Metabolic acidosis (MA) developed both intraoperatively and postoperatively has been associated with worse clinical outcomes with significantly increased mortality and morbidity. The rapid transition to an acidic milieu engenders disruptions in coagulation, oxygen delivery, vasopressor-receptor coupling, and intracellular signaling, thus culminating in the onset of organ dysfunction among surgical patients.

Surgical and critically ill patients are at higher risk to develop MA with increased anion gap (AG) or with normal AG (hyperchloremic). A common cause of high AG MA in the perioperative period is increased lactate due to tissue malperfusion. Conversely, in these populations, hyperchloremic acidosis arises as a prevalent consequence of chloride-rich solutions employed for volume replacement, a measure to avert tissue damage. Both forms are associated with increased 30-day mortality and organ dysfunction. Nevertheless, MA may be accompanied by other acid-base disorders. One way to assess such disorders is to calculate the delta anion gap ratio (delta-delta), which is ratio between AG increase above expected AG to the decrease in bicarbonate ion (Bic) below the baseline (delta-AG/delta-Bic = ΔAG/ΔHCO₃⁻). The relationship between the increase in AG and the change in bicarbonate is effective in identifying mixed disorders in metabolic acidosis, however, it should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory parameters to correctly diagnose underlining disorders in metabolic acidosis, further exploration is required to investigate the utility of delta-AG/delta-Bic in identifying acid-base disorders among surgical patients experiencing metabolic acidosis and its potential implications on prognostic outcomes.

This prospective multicentre study focuses on patients undergoing high-risk surgical interventions and aims to characterize MA using the delta-AG/delta-Bic classification to evaluate the possible presence of subgroups of patients with elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and mixed disorders. The study examines outcomes within the first 24 h after surgery and analyses how these findings correlate with 30-day mortality and other clinically significant outcomes.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### Addressing voltage decay in Li-rich cathodes by broadening the gap between metallic and anionic bands [^113k1TL9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In this work, we construct Li 2 ZrO 3 slabs into the lattice of Li 2 MnO 3 domain in a Li-rich Mn-based oxide that induces lattice strain due to the lattice differences between Li 2 ZrO 3 and Li 2 MnO 3, and modulates the chemical environment for redox-active oxygen and OAR chemistry. Mn 2 Li slabs undergo a relative slip of ~3°, with Mn–O bond being elongated. Experimental and calculated results indicate that the regulated structure modifies the chemical environment of lattice oxygen, and broadens the gap between metallic and anionic bands. This modulation simultaneously expands the region in which lattice oxygen contributes capacity by oxidation to oxygen holes, and relieves the surpassing of the anionic state above the metallic state and the charge transfer from anionic band to (M–O)* band. This inhibits the fracture of active lattice O–M bond, the reduction of M cations, and the formation of localized O 2 molecule, which fundamentally restrains oxygen release and cation migration. The improved cathode demonstrates a high discharge capacity (264 mAh g −1), a high average voltage (3.65 V), and a record low-voltage decay rate (0.45 mV per cycle). This study discloses the crucial role of energy band modulation in designing anionic redox-active cathode materials with high performances.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114yzvp4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute metabolic acidosis of non-renal origin is usually a result of either lactic or ketoacidosis, both of which are associated with a high anion gap. There is increasing recognition, however, of a group of acidotic patients who have a large anion gap that is not explained by either keto- or lactic acidosis nor, in most cases, is inappropriate fluid resuscitation or ingestion of exogenous agents the cause.

Methods

Plasma ultrafiltrate from patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, acidosis of unknown cause, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, or acidosis as a result of base loss were examined enzymatically for the presence of low molecular weight anions including citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The results obtained from the study groups were compared with those obtained from control plasma from normal volunteers.

Results

In five patients with lactic acidosis, a significant increase in isocitrate (0.71 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.55 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), malate (0.59 ± 0.27 mEq l -1), and d-lactate (0.40 ± 0.51 mEq l -1) was observed. In 13 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, significant increases in isocitrate (0.42 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.41 ± 0.16 mEq l -1), malate (0.23 ± 0.18 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.16 ± 0.07 mEq l -1) were seen. Neither citrate nor succinate levels were increased. Similar findings were also observed in a further five patients with high anion gap acidosis of unknown origin with increases in isocitrate (0.95 ± 0.88 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.65 ± 0.20 mEq l -1), succinate (0.34 ± 0.13 mEq l -1), malate (0.49 ± 0.19 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.18 ± 0.14 mEq l -1) being observed but not in citrate concentration. In five patients with a normal anion gap acidosis, no increases were observed except a modest rise in d-lactate (0.17 ± 0.14 mEq l -1).

Conclusion

The levels of certain low molecular weight anions usually associated with intermediary metabolism were found to be significantly elevated in the plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis. Our results suggest that these hitherto unmeasured anions may significantly contribute to the generation of the anion gap in patients with lactic acidosis and acidosis of unknown aetiology and may be underestimated in diabetic ketoacidosis. These anions are not significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^113HJS1L]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology leading to acidosis in CKD

Under normal conditions, the extracellular H + concentration is tightly regulated and varies little from the normal value of approximately 40 nanomol/L. Regulation of acid–base homeostasis involves three basic steps: chemical buffering by extracellular and intracellular buffers, alteration of alveolar ventilation, and changes in renal H + excretion. The kidneys regulate H + excretion by reabsorbing filtered HCO 3 − and generating new HCO 3 − in response to various stimuli. Secreted H + combine with urinary buffers such as HPO 4 2− and ammonia. In CKD the reduction in functioning nephrons causes defects in renal excretion of acid, mainly in the form of ammonium. A fraction of patients may have inappropriate bicarbonate wasting in the urine.

The acidosis in CKD usually remains relatively stable. In uncomplicated acidosis, the serum bicarbonate levels typically are > 12 mEq/L and blood pH is > 7.2. There are two general possibilities for this stabilization of serum bicarbonate levels. One is that after an initial period of acid retention, the excretion and production of acid equalize. The other possibility is that acidosis evokes extrarenal mechanisms that dispose of the endogenous acid not excreted in the urine. The major source of such buffering would be base derived from bone. Carefully conducted balance studies in CKD patients with acidosis found a positive acid balance of approximately 10–20 mEq per day and negative calcium balance that improved with correction of acidosis. However, the degree of acid retention has been debated, with the suggestion that these findings resulted from systematic measurement error. While the magnitude of acid retention may be less than reported, it seems likely that acid production does exceed excretion in the setting of chronic renal acidosis.

The acidosis in mild to moderate CKD is predominantly hyperchloremic, with an increased anion gap observed variably and generally only with advanced CKD. However, accounting for changes in serum albumin and other electrolytes in the anion gap calculation reveals a slightly more nuanced view. This maneuver reveals minor elevations in the anion gap, which are associated with decrements in serum bicarbonate, even in the CKD stage 2 eGFR range. Although small, these differences in anion gap are independently associated with mortality. Thus, there may be low-level accumulation of organic solutes even when the GFR is relatively preserved that partially accounts for changes in the serum bicarbonate level.

### Serum anion gap: its uses and limitations in clinical medicine [^112tEJd9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap, calculated from the electrolytes measured in the chemical laboratory, is defined as the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations subtracted from the serum sodium concentration. This entity is used in the detection and analysis of acid-base disorders, assessment of quality control in the chemical laboratory, and detection of such disorders as multiple myeloma, bromide intoxication, and lithium intoxication. The normal value can vary widely, reflecting both differences in the methods that are used to measure its constituents and substantial interindividual variability. Low values most commonly indicate laboratory error or hypoalbuminemia but can denote the presence of a paraproteinemia or intoxication with lithium, bromide, or iodide. Elevated values most commonly indicate metabolic acidosis but can reflect laboratory error, metabolic alkalosis, hyperphosphatemia, or paraproteinemia. Metabolic acidosis can be divided into high anion and normal anion gap varieties, which can be present alone or concurrently. A presumed 1:1 stoichiometry between change in the serum anion gap (ΔAG) and change in the serum bicarbonate concentration (ΔHCO₃⁻) has been used to uncover the concurrence of mixed metabolic acid-base disorders in patients with high anion gap acidosis. However, recent studies indicate variability in the ΔAG/ΔHCO₃⁻ in this disorder. This observation undercuts the ability to use this ratio alone to detect complex acid-base disorders, thus emphasizing the need to consider additional information to obtain the appropriate diagnosis. Despite these caveats, calculation of the serum anion gap remains an inexpensive and effective tool that aids detection of various acid-base disorders, hematologic malignancies, and intoxications.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113qwkTi]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

An inconsistent relationship has been reported between acid–base abnormalities, their treatment, and outcomes in critically ill patients. Some studies have suggested an independent association between low pH or standard base excess (SBE) and mortality, whereas others have not.

We have recently shown that hemodynamically stable rats with sepsis become hypotensive after infusion of dilute HCl. Similarly we have found decreased survival time in rats with elevated serum chloride levels that were exposed to lethal doses of lipopolysaccharide, as well as different cytokine responses to acidosis induced by lactate or HCl in cell cultures. We therefore propose that the etiologic anion of metabolic acidosis (lactate, chloride, or others) may be a more important determinant of outcome than the pH itself.

Although lactic acidosis has attracted considerable study in critically ill patients, metabolic acidosis can result from a variety of conditions. Although the existing literature does not suggest a strong relationship between the type of acidosis and outcome, traditional methods of classifying and analyzing acid–base abnormalities have significant limitations, especially in critically ill patients. In particular, studies have usually failed to identify the effects that causative anions (for example lactate, chloride, or all others) have on their resulting pH and SBE. Data may be reported as 'non-lactate metabolic acidosis' or 'anion gap metabolic acidosis' without identifying a predominant source. By using a physical–chemical approach to quantify unmeasured anions accurately, coupled with multivariable logistic regression, we believe that a more rigorous characterization of acid–base disorders and their clinical significance can be achieved. Our objective was to determine the effect of different etiologies of metabolic acidosis on hospital mortality and length of stay in critically ill patients suspected of having lactic acidosis. The hypothesis was that the various etiologies of metabolic acidosis have unique mortality and morbidity rates associated with them.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### Reliability of anion gap calculated from data obtained using a blood gas analyzer: is the probability of error predictable? [^112spBkq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anion gap (AG) is a useful index for assessing the clinical condition of critically ill patients especially in intoxication. Recently, AG can be obtained easily using a blood gas analyzer (BGA); however, its reliability requires validation.

Methods

We enrolled patients who simultaneously underwent blood gas analysis and blood test in the central hospital laboratory and patients who visited the emergency department of our hospital from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2007. The deviation of AG calculated using the BGA and that calculated by the central hospital laboratory were extracted. From the data obtained using the BGA, the independent risk factor causing a significant error in AG was statistically analyzed.

Results

A total of 2922 patients were enrolled, of which 339 were defined as the significant error group. Male sex, abnormal Hco(3)(-), abnormal lactate, abnormal K, abnormal Cl, and abnormal Na were the independent risk factors producing the significant error. The results indicate that regardless of whether the original electrolyte data of the patients are abnormal, when the electrolyte measurement results obtained using the BGA are abnormal, the calculated AG might show a significant error. In addition, the fact that lactate was determined as a risk factor indicates that AG might be more useful in patients who have intoxication than in those under an unstable state in terms of vital signs.

Conclusion

When risk factors are present, the medical condition of a patient should be reevaluated by comparing results without heavily relying on the AG obtained by a BGA.

### A life-threatening double gap metabolic acidosis [^114J8xrK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Double gap metabolic acidosis represents the high anion gap metabolic acidosis combined with raised serum osmolal gap due to retention of unmeasured osmole with accompanied metabolite. We describe a 62-year-old man diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia undergoing continuous sedation in the context of asynchronous mechanical ventilation. High anion gap metabolic acidosis coupled with high plasma osmolal gap was noted with resultant severe bradyarrhythmia. D-Lactic acidosis and high serum concentration of propylene glycol (PG) eventually established the diagnosis of lorazepam-induced PG intoxication. Discontinuation of lorazepam followed by emergent long-extended hemodialysis effectively resolved the metabolic derangement without further recurrence. Serum osmolal gap is a sensitive and convenient surrogate for both early bedside detection and monitoring the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, PG intoxication must be considered in the differential diagnosis of double gap metabolic acidosis. Early recognition with prompt hemodialysis intervention can avoid a life-threatening catastrophe.

### Zonisamide (Zonisade) [^1169N7mt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Metabolic Acidosis

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116L9iPg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations

The methodological quality of primary studies was generally poor. Most studies were rated at moderate or high risk of attrition bias and sampling bias as a result of failure to quantify missing outcome or prognostic data, especially in retrospective studies, where case notes with missing information are less likely to have been available. This may have affected our results where information was missing in a non-random manner. Similarly, risk of confounding was moderate to high in the majority of studies. Only one study explored the influence of age on AG levels, and stratification was not employed by any study; the risk of confounding affecting the review outcome is therefore high. Several studies did not report relevant effect measures, such as OR, AUC or mean difference or failed to provide confidence intervals, leading to exclusion from this review. Furthermore, the overall severity of illness in the study cohort was sometimes not quantified by means of an accepted disease severity score, such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score or Injury Severity Score (ISS) in trauma patients. No studies reported short-term mortality outcomes, which may have been more appropriate as naturally the prognosis in critical care patients is heavily influenced by clinical interventions undertaken during the inpatient stay. Shapiro and colleagues found that a single lactate level drawn on admission has good discriminatory power to predict 3-day mortality (AUC = 0.8) but poor discriminatory power to predict 28-day mortality (AUC = 0.67). Lastly, few studies stated the types of intravenous fluids used and no study included the quantity of intravenous fluid used as a variable in multivariate analysis.

### Correcting the anion gap for hypoalbuminaemia does not improve detection of hyperlactataemia [^116LALet]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

An elevated lactate level reflects impaired tissue oxygenation and is a predictor of mortality. Studies have shown that the anion gap is inadequate as a screen for hyperlactataemia, particularly in critically ill and trauma patients. A proposed explanation for the anion gap's poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting hyperlactataemia is that the serum albumin is frequently low. This study therefore, sought to compare the predictive values of the anion gap and the anion gap corrected for albumin (cAG) as an indicator of hyperlactataemia as defined by a lactate ≥ 2.5 mmol/l.

Methods

A retrospective review of 639 sets of laboratory values from a tertiary care hospital. Patients' laboratory results were included in the study if serum chemistries and lactate were drawn consecutively. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were obtained. A receiver operator characteristics curve (ROC) was drawn and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.

Results

An anion gap ≥ 12 provided a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 39%, 89%, 79%, and 58%, respectively, and a cAG ≥ 12 provided a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 75%, 59%, 66%, and 69%, respectively. The ROC curves between anion gap and cAG as a predictor of hyperlactataemia were almost identical. The AUC was 0.757 and 0.750, respectively.

Conclusions

The sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values of the anion gap and cAG were inadequate in predicting the presence of hyperlactataemia. The cAG provides no additional advantage over the anion gap in the detection of hyperlactataemia.

### Ileal neobladder: an important cause of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis [^112pmYb7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis for a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is probably less well known than the differential diagnosis for an anion gap metabolic acidosis. One etiology of a non-anion gap acidosis is the consequence of ileal neobladder urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Case Report

We present a case of a patient with an ileal neobladder with a severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by a urinary tract infection and ureteroenterostomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Part of the ileal neobladder surgery includes ureteroenterostomy and predisposes patients to several clinically significant metabolic derangements, including a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These patients have an increased chronic acid load, bicarbonate deficit, and hypokalemia, which should be appreciated when resuscitating these patients.

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Dissecting clinical features of COVID-19 in a cohort of 21, 312 acute care patients [^1154KUHa]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base dysregulation was another set of diagnoses enriched in severe TGs. Notably, anion gap, a measure of acid-base homeostasis, increased in severe TGs in association with low albumin. This relationship is significant as albumin plays a crucial role in maintaining acid-base balance due to its buffering capacity. The high anion gap may be explained by decline in renal function or higher levels of sepsis contributing to lactic acidosis in severe patients. Importantly, renal dysfunction can exacerbate both hypoalbuminemiaand acid-base dysregulation, potentially creating a detrimental cycle. The kidneys' role in acid-base homeostasis through bicarbonate reabsorption and acid excretion is compromised in patients with impaired renal function, further contributing to metabolic acidosis and increased anion gap. Physiologically, acid-base dysregulation can lead to abnormalities across multiple organs but notably within the cardiovascular system. Indeed, cardiac dysfunction increased across severe/critical TGs, with highest rates in the fatal TG4. Given more severe outcomes in patients with acid-base disorders, it is critical for physicians to promptly identify and correct acid-base dysregulation causes, while also addressing related factors such as hypoalbuminemia and renal dysfunction, toward improving COVID-19 outcomes.

There were several limitations to our study. First, our cohort was from a single health system and was disproportionately Hispanic and white. Second, all data were retrieved from EHRs, known to have missing data and lower quality data with respect to demographics, e.g. race and ethnicity. Also, our clinical dataset did not include viral load or SARS-CoV-2 variant information, though we were able to use epidemiological data to estimate the prevalence of strains over time.

In conclusion, our identified clinical signatures could help clinicians better predict disease trajectories in acute COVID-19 and anticipate elevation of care versus discharge. Importantly, we highlight an association between COVID-19 severity and neuropsychiatric complications as well as nutritional insufficiency as key risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, raising the urgency for prompt evaluation and treatment of these conditions toward improving patient outcomes in the ED, hospital and post discharge.

### The 'gap' in the 'plasma osmolar gap' [^117Ld7qW]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Ethylene glycol poisoning is a medical emergency that presents challenges for clinicians and clinical laboratories. If left untreated, it may cause morbidity and death, but effective therapy is available if diagnosed in time. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is not always straightforward and the commonly quoted 'plasma osmolar gap' is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude a small ingestion and has been reported to be normal in a number of serious exposures. The 'plasma osmolar gap' cannot distinguish among ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methanol or ethylene glycol. Thus, the measurement of serum ethylene glycol and, ideally, glycolic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is definitive. This also holds true for methanol and its metabolite formic acid. Ethylene glycol metabolites target the kidney and lead to reversible oliguric or anuric injury, which in turn slows the elimination of ethylene glycol. The therapeutic options include reversal of metabolic acidosis, inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase and early haemodialysis.

### Differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis: value of a systematic approach [^113qrZvM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH(4)(+) concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO(3)(-) excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent' pre-renal'acute kidney injury? con [^117AXzGs]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

However, in healthy volunteers, the fall in serum bicarbonate concentration after saline infusions is in the range of 1–2 mmol/l (refs.,) and this, on its own, does not explain development of acidosis on the basis of the Henderson-Hesselbach equation. Crystalloid infusions are also associated with a decrease in serum albumin concentration, even in healthy subjects. The negatively charged albumin molecule accounts for about 75% of the anion gapand acute dilutional hypoalbuminemia can effectively reduce the upper limit of the normal range for the anion gap. In critically ill patients, the anion gap has been shown to reduce by 2.5 mmol/l for every 10 g/l decrease in serum albumin concentration. However, once again, development of acidosis cannot be explained entirely as albumin concentrations fall even after the infusion of balanced crystalloids or 5% dextrose.,

Hence, the mechanism of acidosis after infusions of 0.9% saline may be better explained by the Stewart hypothesis. This describes a mathematical approach to acid–base balance based on the apparent strong ion difference (SID a, [Na +]+[K +] — [Cl −]) being the major determinant of H + ion concentration. A decrease in SID a is associated with metabolic acidosis and an increase with metabolic alkalosis. Hyperchloremia consequent on saline infusions decreases the SID a, and is the process that results in a metabolic acidosis. Canine experiments on resuscitation from septic shock have shown that 0.9% saline accounted for 42% of the acidosis observed, whereas lactate was responsible for only 10%.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Methanol and ethylene glycol acute poisonings-predictors of mortality [^1172mHj3]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Methanol and ethylene glycol cause significant mortality post-ingestion. Predicting prognosis based on the biomarkers osmolal gap, anion gap and pH is beneficial.

Objective

To evaluate the relationship between biomarkers, measured post-methanol and ethylene glycol exposure, and clinical outcomes.

Methods

A review of the literature identified cases where methanol or ethylene glycol had been ingested and clinical outcomes were recorded. Biomarkers were extracted including osmolal gap, anion gap and pH, with clinical outcomes categorised as recovered, recovered with adverse sequelae and death. Biomarkers were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test for two samples; sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

Results

In total, 119 cases of methanol and 88 of ethylene glycol poisoning were identified; 21 methanol and 19 ethylene glycol patients died. For methanol ingestion the mean values, for survival compared to death, were 48 (range: 6–138) and 90 (range: 49–159) mOsm/kg water for osmolal gap (p = 0.0052), 31 (range: 11–50) and 41 (range: 30–53) mmol/L for anion gap (p = 0.0065) and 7.21 (range: 6.60–7.50) and 6.70 (range: 6.34–7.22) for arterial pH (p < 0.0001). The area under the ROC curve was highest for arterial pH, 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89–0.99). For ethylene glycol, these were 49 (range: 0–189) and 79 (range: 25–184) mOsm/kg water for osmolal gap (p = 0.050), 28 (range: 6–48) and 38 (range: 20–66) mmol/L for anion gap (p = 0.0037) and 7.08 (range: 6.46–7.39) and 6.98 (range: 6.50–7.16) for pH (p = 0.072), for survival compared to death. The area under the ROC curve was highest for anion gap, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.60–0.87).

Conclusion

Post-methanol ingestion a large osmolal gap, anion gap and low pH (< 7.22) were associated with increased mortality; and pH has the highest predictive value. Post-ethylene glycol ingestion, both osmolal gap and anion gap were associated with increased mortality.

### Negative anion gap metabolic acidosis in salicylate overdose – a zebra! [^111FjRKB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Salicylate poisoning classically results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. We discuss a case of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis despite elevated serum salicylate concentration. This diagnostic dilemma stemmed from aberrant reading of salicylate ions by analyzer electrodes as chloride ions leading to falsely negative anion gap. On review, this phenomenon is found to be possible with a number of commonly used analyzers. In emergency department settings, high level of clinical suspicion for salicylate poisoning should be maintained, and metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap should not be used to rule out salicylate overdose. This can prevent significant avoidable morbidity and mortality.

### How long Do we have? A retrospective review of palliative extubation in the burn unit [^115immz1]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory values are useful in alerting physicians to a patient's clinical decline. Prior studies have associated earlier TTD after palliative extubation through findings of low pH and low serum bicarbonate. While our study found a relationship between acidosis and death within 1 h of extubation on univariate analysis, there was no relationship seen on multivariate analysis. Instead, we found that a relatively higher anion gap was associated with death within 1 h of palliative extubation. Several studies involving diverse patient populations implicate anion gap as a predictive risk factor for mortality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to find a relationship between anion gap and TTD following cessation of life support.

Table 4
Outcomes

Abbreviation: IQR, interquartile.

Many scoring systems exist to guide physicians on the severity of illness that patients present with. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score is an illness severity score used to evaluate organ dysfunction. Higher APACHE II scores have been shown to be correlated with death within 60 min of palliative extubation. One study found that extremes in another illness severity score, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, were associated with TTD within 24 h of extubation. Specific to burn surgery, the rBaux score is a useful guide to utilize in palliative care discussions with patients and families. However, the rBaux score may not capture the complexities of a patient's condition and has not been previously studied in the context of TTD following palliative extubation. Our institution utilizes the SOFA score to track illness severity in burn-injured and traumatically injured patients. The SOFA score was developed to objectively describe organ dysfunction. Many prior studies have correlated organ dysfunction with mortality in both burn and general ICU populations. Our study identifies that the SOFA score has an association with death within 1 h of palliative extubation. Interestingly, the rBaux score and its components (age, TBSA, and presence of inhalation injury) were not found to have a significant association with TTD.

### The fall of the serum anion gap… [^113kRJoE]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Using modern electrode technology, we evaluated the reference range for the anion gap in serum to determine whether the 8 to 16 mmol/L reference range in common use is still valid. After measurement of electrolytes in serum from 29 healthy volunteers, aqueous standards verified against National Bureau of Standards reference material, and serum from 120 blood donors, we drew the following conclusions. The reference range for the anion gap has shifted downward, primarily because of an upward shift in chloride values. Using the ASTRA analyzer, a majority of normal individuals can be expected to have serum anion gaps of 6 mmol/L or less unless chloride calibration is deliberately altered.

If the anion gap is to remain an effective tool in diagnosing acid-base disorders, clinicians need to be aware that the traditional reference range may not be appropriate with new instrumentation.

### The urine anion gap: a clinically useful index of ammonium excretion [^1134MScZ]. The American Journal of the Medical Sciences (1986). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Urine Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Urine Anion Gap (UAG) is a clinical calculator primarily used in the evaluation of patients with metabolic acidosis, specifically to differentiate between renal and extrarenal causes. It is calculated using the formula: UAG = (urine sodium + urine potassium) - urine chloride. A positive UAG suggests a renal cause of metabolic acidosis, such as renal tubular acidosis, while a negative UAG is indicative of an extrarenal cause, such as diarrhea. It is important to note that the UAG is not applicable in patients with mixed acid-base disorders or those with significant proteinuria or ketoacidosis, as these conditions can interfere with the accuracy of the calculation.

### Hypoalbuminaemia in critically ill children: incidence, prognosis, and influence on the anion gap [^113q513U]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Hypoalbuminaemia has significance in adult critical illness as an independent predictor of mortality. In addition, the anion gap is predominantly due to the negative charge of albumin, thus hypoalbuminaemia may lead to its underestimation. We examine this phenomenon in critically ill children, documenting the incidence, early evolution, and prognosis of hypoalbuminaemia (< 33 g/l), and quantify its influence on the anion gap.

Methods

Prospective descriptive study of 134 critically ill children in the paediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Paired arterial blood samples were taken at ICU admission and 24 hours later, from which blood gases, electrolytes, and albumin were measured. The anion gap (including potassium) was calculated and then corrected for albumin using Figge's formula.

Results

The incidence of admission hypoalbuminaemia was 57%, increasing to 76% at 24 hours. Neither admission hypoalbuminaemia, nor extreme hypoalbuminaemia (< 20 g/l) predicted mortality; however, there was an association with increased median ICU stay (4.9 v 3.6 days). After correction for albumin the incidence of a raised anion gap (> 18 mEq/l) increased from 28% to 44% in all samples (n = 263); this discrepancy was more pronounced in the 103 samples with metabolic acidosis (38% v 73%). Correction produced an average increase in the anion gap of 2.7 mEq/l (mean bias), with limits of agreement of ± 3.7 mEq/l.

Conclusion

Admission hypoalbuminaemia is common in critical illness, but is not an independent predictor of mortality. However, failure to correct the anion gap for albumin may underestimate the true anion gap, producing error in the interpretation of acid-base abnormalities. This may have treatment implications.

### Anion-gap metabolic acidemia: case-based analyses [^112agy4M]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. The serum anion gap is calculated as [Na⁺] − ([Cl⁻] + [HCO₃⁻]) = Unmeasured anions − Unmeasured cations. The normal gap is mostly due to negatively charged albumin: (Normal range: 8–12meq/l) as the unmeasured anions, since albumin is usually reported in grams per liter (not meq/l). For diagnostic purposes, calculating the serum anion gap allows determination of coexisting acid-base processes in a patient. Assuming a 1:1 fall in bicarbonate compared with rise in anion gap in a usual gap acidosis, one can compare the Δ anion Gap/ΔHCO₃⁻: Δ gap = observed anion gap − normal anion gap and the ΔHCO₃⁻ = normal HCO₃⁻ − observed HCO₃⁻. A ratio of 1 suggests a simple anion gap acidosis; if < 1 a superimposed non-gap acidosis is lowering HCO₃⁻ and if > 1 a superimposed metabolic alkalosis is raising HCO₃⁻. Comparing the anion gap and osmolar gap can narrow the differential diagnosis to include toxic alcohol ingestions with acidic metabolites such as ethylene glycol and methanol. Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists.

### Urine anion gap to predict urine ammonium and related outcomes in kidney disease [^1131xdys]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Low urine ammonium excretion is associated with ESRD in CKD. Few laboratories measure urine ammonium, limiting clinical application. We determined correlations between urine ammonium, the standard urine anion gap, and a modified urine anion gap that includes sulfate and phosphate and compared risks of ESRD or death between these ammonium estimates and directly measured ammonium.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We measured ammonium, sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, and sulfate from baseline 24-hour urine collections in 1044 African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension participants. We evaluated the cross-sectional correlations between urine ammonium, the standard urine anion gap (sodium + potassium - chloride), and a modified urine anion gap that includes urine phosphate and sulfate in the calculation. Multivariable-adjusted Cox models determined the associations of the standard urine anion gap and the modified urine anion gap with the composite end point of death or ESRD; these results were compared with results using urine ammonium as the predictor of interest.

Results

The standard urine anion gap had a weak and direct correlation with urine ammonium (r = 0.18), whereas the modified urine anion gap had a modest inverse relationship with urine ammonium (r = -0.58). Compared with the highest tertile of urine ammonium, those in the lowest urine ammonium tertile had higher risk of ESRD or death (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.87) after adjusting for demographics, GFR, proteinuria, and other confounders. In comparison, participants in the corresponding standard urine anion gap tertile did not have higher risk of ESRD or death (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.07), whereas the risk for those in the corresponding modified urine anion gap tertile (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.68) approximated that of directly measured urine ammonium.

Conclusions

Urine anion gap is a poor surrogate of urine ammonium in CKD unless phosphate and sulfate are included in the calculation. Because the modified urine anion gap merely estimates urine ammonium and requires five measurements, direct measurements of urine ammonium are preferable in CKD.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114qeCd4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The consequences of metabolic acidosis can be catastrophic and a considerable body of literature highlights the poor outlook in patients where lactic acid is the principal component of the acidaemia. This increase in blood lactate concentration reflects either increased lactate production, reduced lactate metabolism or, more commonly, a combination of the two. In patients with DKA, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and, to a lesser extent, acetoacetic acid play the major role in the generation of the anion gap. As outlined, however, in a third patient group, neither lactate nor 3-hydroxybutyrate is responsible for the elevated anion gap and the relevant anions responsible remain unknown. In the fourth patient group, acidosis is generated as a result of uncontrolled electrolyte loss either from the kidney (renal tubular acidosis) or the gut.

We have shown that the plasma concentrations of acids usually associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are significantly increased in patients with lactic acidosis as well as those with 'unexplained acidosis' with normal or near normal blood lactate concentrations. In DKA, although the concentrations of these acids are less strikingly elevated, they are still abnormal in the majority of patients when compared to controls. They are not, however, significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis secondary to excess base loss. The accumulation of such acids may contribute significantly to the production of the anion gap and account, in part, for the 'missing' anions in patients with certain forms of acidosis. Recent studies, in keeping with previous work, have demonstrated the predictive value of acid-base variables on outcome in the critically ill. Furthermore, the calculation of unmeasured anions appears to be a better discriminator of outcome than lactate or base deficit.

### Empagliflozin-associated postoperative mixed metabolic acidosis. case report and review of pathogenesis [^111Yn5eY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

SGLT2i block the SGLT2 co-transporter of sodium and glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidney, thereby reducing glucose reabsorption. This seemingly simple mechanism of action results in a new, somewhat unstable metabolic equilibrium with increased ketone bodies formation and their renal elimination. Precipitating factors such as surgery, acute illness, starvation or insulin deficiency can trigger highly complex metabolic and renal processes that can result in life-threatening metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1). Among the most important are increased ketogenesis, decreased renal ammoniogenesis and H + excretion, and decreased renal reabsorption of filtered ketones. As documented by our case, the term euglycemic ketoacidosis is somewhat misleading, as the major component of the acidosis may be hyperchloremic.

Increased ketogenesis

SGLT2i lowers blood glucose, leading to decreased insulin secretion and increased glucagon secretion. Similar to starvation, a low insulin-to-glucagon ratio stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes and ketone bodies formation and gluconeogenesis in the liver. However, concomitant stress related precipitants, some form of insulin deficiency or reduced caloric intake are required to promote ketogenesis. The two-hit hypothesis proposes that elevated stress-related hormones glucagon, cortisol and catecholamines stimulate ketogenesis in the setting of relative insulin deficiency due to low plasma glucose induced by SGLT2i.

Metabolic renal dysfunction

In the classic DKA, most of the acidosis can typically be explained by pure ketoacidosis with high anion gap. However, hyperchloremia may develop and even predominate in some patients later in the course of DKA, due to urinary loss of ketones and the treatment with normal saline. In contrast, patients with equally severe SGLT2i-associated acidosis had a markedly lower anion gap. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration varied substantially in several published cases. In our case, the anion gap was only 18 and the beta-hydroxybutyrate 3.2 mmol/l, despite pH of 6.85 and base excess − 29. Sampani reported a similar case with only a slightly elevated anion gap despite very low pH (Table 1). Compared with DKA, a concomitant metabolic renal dysfunction and slower development of ketosis modify the development of acidosis and enhance the hyperchloremic component. The main renal abnormalities associated with SGLT2i are impaired H + secretion in the proximal tubule, impaired ammoniogenesis and loss of ketoacid salts in the urine.

### Proximal renal tubular acidosis: a not so rare disorder of multiple etiologies [^117PGGDk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with a distal acidification defect (e.g. distal RTA) typically have a positive urine anion gap because of low NH 4 + excretion, whereas in diarrheal states associated with metabolic acidosis, the urine anion gap is negative, reflecting the fact that NH 4 + excretion is appropriately increased. Information regarding NH 4 + excretion from subjects with proximal RTA is limited. The excretion rates of NH 4 + may not be reduced when compared with those of control subjects. For instance, in a study by Brenes and Sanchez, the response to a 3-day acid loading test with NH 4 Cl was evaluated in 8 patients with isolated proximal RTA and in 10 healthy control subjects. In the basal state, all subjects with proximal RTA had rates of NH 4 + excretion similar to those of the control subjects, suggesting a normal pattern of ammonium renal handling. On the third day of acid loading, however, their NH 4 + excretion rates were significantly lower than those of controls, demonstrating impairment in maximal urinary NH 4 + excretion. Given this latter finding, it is likely that the urinary anion gap in proximal RTA may not be as negative as in normal people with metabolic acidosis. Although reduced, the amount of urinary ammonium may still be sufficient to result in a negative urine anion gap. Since these previous studies did not provide information on the urinary anion gap (UAG) in proximal RTA, additional information on this parameter is needed for the proper interpretation of UAG in proximal RTA. In distal RTA, the urine anion gap is consistently positive without exceptions.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^116hmVYv]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Although it seems reasonable to believe that the likely source for the generation of these observed anions is the mitochondria, we have no direct evidence for this and the results may indeed reflect compartmentalised oxidative and glycolytic energy production. Indeed, studies on mitochondria in isolated rat skeletal muscle have demonstrated that lactic acidosis has differential effects on actively phosphorylating and non-phosphorylating mitochondria, suggesting that the effect of acidaemia may depend on local physiological conditions. The rate of oxygen delivery to respiring tissue may also play a role in generating intermediates of Krebs acids, with several authors suggesting that hypoxia can cause an increase in intermediates of the citric acid cycle, although in the patients examined in this study none were significantly hypoxic at the time the sample was taken. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the acidaemia per se is responsible for the increased levels of Krebs intermediates within our patient population given the normal values found in the patients with normal anion gap acidosis and the lesser elevation seen in the patients with DKA. An alternative explanation may be the generation of intermediates from anaplerotic pathways of metabolism, which may reflect enhanced protein catabolism in these patients

Other authors have proposed alternative hypotheses to explain how the 'missing' ions in the elevated anion gap may be generated. These include the choice of fluid used for resuscitation, the effects of hypoproteinaemia or the presence of other metabolites, in addition to various 'physical chemical' approaches, including the calculation of the strong anion difference. This approach, which enjoys some popularity at the present time, represents an alternative way to express the principles of acidosis. The 'strong ion difference' model can be thought of as a restatement of the older concept of buffer base and thus, predictably, must approach the corrected anion gap, although some of its stronger proponents suggest that it can explain the generation of acidosis per se. We prefer to adhere to the concept that acidosis can best be regarded as an excess of protons over those normally found in physiological states, caused either from the loss of base or excessive net proton production.

### Extracorporeal treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^116TNXke]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The anion gap may overestimate (e.g. concomitant AKI or ketoacidosis) or underestimate (e.g. hypoalbuminemia or co-ingestions of lithium or barium) the glycolate concentration. In such circumstances, other acid–base parameters such as pH, HCO 3 −, and base excess can also be consulted with due consideration of the extent to which they are also influenced by other factors such as inadequate respiratory compensation or exogenous bicarbonate. It is important to note that the anion gap is only useful to predict glycolate concentrations if there is a high pre-test probability of EG exposure. Its value to predict the need for ECTR is poor if it is used indiscriminately; when there is little or no evidence of EG exposure, an elevated anion gap is not by itself an indication for ECTR as this may be caused by various factors.

An elevated glycolate concentration can falsely elevate the plasma lactate concentration on some analyzers, which has prompted some to suggest using the "lactate gap" as a surrogate of glycolate. However, this requires knowledge of the specific analyzer's cross-reactivity so it cannot be simply formalized into a recommendation.

Some authors suggest that hemodialysis may be obviated even in cases of severe academia or that fomepizole may lower glycolate concentrations faster than hemodialysis, although the EXTRIP panel strongly cautions against these viewpoints.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Acidosis is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and incident type 2 diabetes in indigenous Americans: a prospective cohort study [^114KWiT9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 3
Cox proportional hazards models examining association between corrected anion gap and type 2 diabetes.

FIGURE 2
Predicted cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes with 95% confidence intervals at 10th (open circles) and 90th (closed squares) percentiles of corrected anion gap when (A) accounting for age, sex, body fat%, and plasma 2‐h glucose, and (B) accounting for age, sex, body fat (%), and plasma 2‐h glucose and M‐low (log 10).

Bicarbonate and AG were not associated with incident type 2 diabetes in unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (Tables S1 and S2).

Because circulating albumin constitutes a large proportion of unmeasured anions, an increase or decrease in albumin can alter the anion gap. Additionally, past research has found an association between increased albumin and higher M, when accounting for age and sex. Given these past results, we performed an additional analysis examining the impact of albumin on M‐low and type 2 diabetes risk. The association between albumin and M‐low (log) was significant (r = 0.16, p = 0.0051) and remained significant in the partial r accounting for age and sex (adjusted r = 0.15, p = 0.01), with the association becoming null following the inclusion of % body fat (adjusted r = 0.05, p = 0.44). Cox proportional hazard models found an association between increased albumin and lower likelihood of type 2 diabetes in unadjusted models (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43–0.83, p = 0.0003), and adjusting for CAG (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44–0.77, p = 0.0017). On the other hand, CAG was not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk in the model adjusting for albumin (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.93–1.61, p = 0.16, see Table S3).

### Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: implications for obstetric anesthesia [^11575Zt1]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other physiologic changes in pregnancy may also contribute to the difficulties in recognizing DKA, even if capillary glucose values are elevated. For instance, an increase in tidal volume and resting minute ventilation are typical of normal pregnancy. This causes hypocarbia and a respiratory alkalosis, which is compensated for by a normal decrease in serum bicarbonate levels to 18 to 21 mM in uncomplicated pregnancies. Serum pH is typically between 7.4 and 7.46 during normal pregnancy, despite this compensatory metabolic acidosis. Blood pH is lowered in DKA as excessive ketone bodies consume bicarbonate buffer, but pH may initially not be lowered to the degree otherwise expected by the high anion gap, or to the degree that would be seen in nonpregnant individuals. As a result, pregnant patients in early DKA may present with only a low normal pH, despite a high anion gap, before rapidly developing a profound metabolic acidosis.

Clinical presentation of DKA in pregnant patients is similar to the clinical presentation in nonpregnant patients except that the complication of ketosis tends to develop more rapidly. Symptoms of DKA in pregnancy include nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and change in mental status. Given that more than 70% of pregnancies are complicated by nausea and vomiting, underlying DKA could potentially be missed if not suspected.

Key laboratory findings sufficient for diagnosis of DKA in pregnancy include evidence of both ketosis and an anion gap acidosis. An anion gap greater than 12 mEq/l and positive ketones are sufficient to confirm the diagnosis, regardless of blood sugar. A serum bicarbonate level less than 15 supports the diagnosis, as well as an arterial pH less than 7.3. However, obtaining an arterial sample can be challenging in an obstetrics unit and is not always necessary.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^11645sjW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis remains controversial in the medical community. Review of the literature overall does not support routine use of bicarbonate, particularly in anion gap metabolic acidosis. The processes underlying pH balance in human physiology are multifaceted, and an understanding of the mechanisms at play, as well as the methods of providing sodium bicarbonate supplementation, will serve an emergency physician well. There are few data demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with sodium bicarbonate use in patients with shock states, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac arrest (except in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity or hyperkalemia), as shown in Table 2. However, it may benefit patients with NAGMA and, despite physiologic rationale, there are minimal data from RCTs to justify this.

### Topiramate [^115YfctW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

### Falsely normal anion gap in severe salicylate poisoning caused by laboratory interference [^112V6Cur]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Severe salicylate poisoning is classically associated with an anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, high serum salicylate levels can cause false increase of laboratory chloride results on some analyzers. We present 2 cases of life-threatening salicylate poisoning with an apparently normal anion gap caused by an important laboratory interference. These cases highlight that the diagnosis of severe salicylism must be considered in all patients presenting with metabolic acidosis, even in the absence of an increased anion gap.

### Electron-lattice interactions strongly renormalize the charge-transfer energy in the spin-chain cuprate li2CuO2 [^1129dvwf]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Strongly correlated insulators are broadly divided into two classes: Mott-Hubbard insulators, where the insulating gap is driven by the Coulomb repulsion U on the transition-metal cation, and charge-transfer insulators, where the gap is driven by the charge-transfer energy Δ between the cation and the ligand anions. The relative magnitudes of U and Δ determine which class a material belongs to, and subsequently the nature of its low-energy excitations. These energy scales are typically understood through the local chemistry of the active ions. Here we show that the situation is more complex in the low-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Li2CuO2, where Δ has a large non-electronic component. Combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with detailed modelling, we determine how the elementary lattice, charge, spin and orbital excitations are entangled in this material. This results in a large lattice-driven renormalization of Δ, which significantly reshapes the fundamental electronic properties of Li2CuO2.

### Anion gap as a determinant of ionized fraction of divalent cations in hemodialysis patients [^116R151x]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Circulating levels of anions that bind to magnesium and calcium are often altered in patients with CKD. However, it is unknown how these alterations affect the ionized fraction of magnesium and calcium.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This cross-sectional study involved patients on maintenance hemodialysis and patients not on dialysis who visited the outpatient department of nephrology. We collected whole-blood samples to measure ionized magnesium and calcium concentrations. Adjusted anion gap was calculated as an integrative index of unmeasured anions.

Results

A total of 118 patients on hemodialysis and 112 patients not on dialysis were included. Although the prevalence of hypermagnesemia defined by total magnesium was much higher in patients on hemodialysis than in patients not on dialysis (69% versus 12%; P < 0.001), the prevalence of hypermagnesemia defined by ionized magnesium did not differ significantly (13% versus 18%; P = 0.28). Among patients on hemodialysis with high total magnesium, 83% had normal or low ionized magnesium. Consequently, the mean ionized fraction of magnesium in patients on hemodialysis was significantly lower than that in patients not on dialysis (51% versus 63%; P < 0.001). Similarly, the mean ionized fraction of calcium in patients on hemodialysis was lower than that in patients not on dialysis (55% versus 56%; P < 0.001). In patients on hemodialysis who had a higher adjusted anion gap than patients not on dialysis (mean [SD]: 14.1 [2.2] versus 5.1 [3.1]), the ionized fractions of magnesium and calcium were inversely associated with the adjusted anion gap. Furthermore, the anion gap significantly improved predictions of ionized magnesium and calcium in patients on hemodialysis.

Conclusions

Anions that accumulate in patients on hemodialysis contribute to the lower ionized fraction of magnesium and calcium. Equations that incorporate the anion gap provide better predictions of ionized magnesium and calcium in patients on hemodialysis.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jxU2G]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Other than intravenous fluid restriction, our subgroup analysis did not identify factors accounting for the high statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of AUC. A small effect of study setting and mean/median age on the pooled AUC was observed; however, the associated probabilities were > 0.01 where no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons and in both analyses one subgroup contained the two studies by Kaplan and Kellum. Therefore, we consider the observed differences most likely to have arisen due to chance or confounding. Notably, no significant effect of outcome measure or publication date was observed on the pooled AUC. This supports the appropriateness of including studies reporting a time-framed mortality and in-hospital mortality and studies published at different times over the past 15 years. As parameters denoting disease severity were not consistently reported across studies, we divided studies according to overall mortality in subgroup analysis. No difference in pooled AUC was seen between studies reporting mortality rates above and below 30%; however, overall mortality is a suboptimal indicator of severity of illness. Therefore, the contribution of disease severity to the observed statistical heterogeneity remains unclear.

Another important factor limiting the ability of the AG to predict clinical outcomes is its considerable baseline variability amongst healthy people. To address this, Kraut and Nagami suggested comparing the AG during an acute admission to the "personal AG" measured when the individual was in good health. Dynamic AG indices, describing not only the magnitude of acid–base disturbance but also trends over time, are better predictors of mortality, as shown by the large study by Lipnick and colleagues including 18,995 patients. For a subset of patients in this study (n = 664), the predictive ability of a single AG measurement was also reported and was shown to be poor (AUC 0.61). However, implementation of the systems required to support a "personal AG" would be challenging in low resource settings.

### Estimating unmeasured anions in critically ill patients: anion-gap, base-deficit, and strong-ion-gap [^115eyV8N]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

We used 100 routine blood samples from critically ill patients to establish whether correcting the anion-gap and base-deficit for decreased plasma albumin improves agreement with the strong-ion-gap for estimating unmeasured anions and whether the modifications increase the proportion of samples with levels of anion-gap or base-deficit above the reference ranges. We used Bland-Altman analyses to compare the methods of estimating unmeasured ions. Compared with the strong-ion-gap, modification reduced the limits of agreement for both the anion-gap and the base-deficit. The bias for the base-deficit was also reduced but the bias for the anion-gap was increased. The proportion of samples with an anion-gap > 22 meq.l(-1) increased from 4 to 29% (p < 0.001), and the proportion with a base-deficit > 5 meq.l(-1) increased from 8 to 42% (p < 0.001). Consequently, metabolic acidosis from unmeasured ions in critically ill patients maybe more frequent than often recognised.

### Severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis induced by topiramate: a case report [^115KX8zZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A non-anion gap acidosis can be induced by topiramate, causing symptomatic dyspnea and confusion.

Objectives

Discuss the pathophysiology of the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis caused by topiramate, the typical clinical presentation, and the recommended treatment.

Case Report

This case presents a young woman with a clinically significant non-anion gap metabolic acidosis believed to be caused by topiramate. She had been taking the medication for several months without prior adverse effects. Once she began having dyspnea as a respiratory response to the renal tubule acidosis, she had decreased oral intake of food and fluids, which induced a pre-renal acute renal failure that worsened her acidemia. In the Emergency Department, she received intravenous fluids and sodium bicarbonate, and later was intubated for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory fatigue. With the topiramate withdrawn, the patient had a full recovery of her renal function and metabolic acid-base status over the next 72 h. This case serves to increase awareness of this possible adverse effect and the recommended treatment as topiramate becomes more widely used.

Conclusions

Topiramate can induce a renal tubule acidosis resulting in a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Recognition of the underlying cause is crucial so that the drug can be withdrawn while supportive care is provided.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^112HcoT4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Beyond the urine anion gap: in support of the direct measurement of urinary ammonium [^113oiMJq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Ammonium is a major urinary buffer that is necessary for the normal excretion of the daily acid load. Its urinary rate of excretion (UNH 4) may be increased several fold in the presence of extrarenal metabolic acidosis. Therefore, measurement of UNH 4 can provide important clues about causes of metabolic acidosis. Because UNH 4 is not commonly measured in clinical laboratories, the urinary anion gap (UAG) was proposed as its surrogate about 4 decades ago, and it is still frequently used for that purpose. Several published studies strongly suggest that UAG is not a good index of UNH 4 and support the concept that direct measurement of UNH 4 is an important parameter to define in clinical nephrology. Low UNH 4 levels have recently been found to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic acidosis, loss of kidney function, and death in persons with chronic kidney disease, while surrogates like the UAG do not recapitulate this risk. In order to advance the field it is necessary for the medical community to become more familiar with UNH 4 levels in a variety of clinical settings. Herein, we review the literature, searching for available data on UNH 4 under normal and various pathological conditions, in an attempt to establish reference values to interpret UNH 4 results if and when UNH 4 measurements become available as a routine clinical test. In addition, we present original data in 2 large populations that provide further evidence that the UAG is not a good predictor of UNH 4. Measurement of urine NH 4 holds promise to aid clinicians in the care of patients, and we encourage further research to determine its best diagnostic usage.

### Extracorporeal treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^113hUwzi]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Plasma glycolate concentration

In patients presenting with EG poisoning, we recommend ECTR if the glycolate concentration is > 12 mmol/L (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)
In patients presenting with EG poisoning, we suggest ECTR if the glycolate concentration is > 8 mmol/L (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence)

Rationale: Glycolate is the EG metabolite in highest concentration in blood and correlates with AKI and death. There was only one death reported when the glycolate concentration was < 12 mmol/L; however, the mortality rate rises substantially once the glycolate concentration exceeds 12 mmol/L.

Anion gap when there is evidence of EG exposure

In patients presenting with EG poisoning, we recommend ECTR if the anion gap (calculated as Na⁺ + K⁺ − Cl⁻ − HCO₃⁻) is > 27 mmol/L (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)
In patients presenting with EG poisoning, we suggest ECTR if the anion gap is 23–27 mmol/L (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence)

Rationale: Glycolate assays are not available in most institutions. The anion gap is by far the best surrogate marker for glycolate and correlates linearly with glycolate and is associated with clinical outcomes. Based on previous reviews, the workgroup agreed that an anion gap of 24–28 mmol/L and > 28 mmol/L, respectively, would best correlate with the suggested and recommended indications for ECTR based on plasma glycolate concentrations. To support this, there were only 3 patients out of 84 with an anion gap ≤ 28 mmol/L or glycolate concentration ≤ 12 mmol/L on admission who died; in all these cases, the clinical and metabolic data were incomplete (Additional file 1: Table S10). Because the relationship between glycolate concentration and prognosis require confirmation, the workgroup chose slightly more conservative cutoffs, accepting that this may lead to unnecessary ECTRs.

### Approach to the patient with a negative anion gap [^11362PDQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

When anion gap calculation generates a very small or negative number, an explanation must be sought. Sporadic (nonreproducible) measurement errors and systematic (reproducible) laboratory errors must be considered. If an error is ruled out, 2 general possibilities exist. A true anion gap reduction can be generated by either reduced concentrations of unmeasured anions such as albumin or increased concentrations of unmeasured cations such as magnesium, calcium, or lithium. This teaching case describes a patient with aspirin (salicylate) poisoning whose anion gap was markedly reduced (-47 mEq/L). The discussion systematically reviews the possibilities and provides the explanation for this unusual laboratory result.

### Urine anion gap can differentiate respiratory alkalosis from metabolic acidosis in the absence of blood gas results [^116E1xMj]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low plasma bicarbonate concentration due to chronic respiratory alkalosis may be misdiagnosed as metabolic acidosis and mistreated with administration of alkali therapy, particularly when arterial blood gas is not available.

Methods

We measured urine anion gap [urine (Na + +K +)-(Cl -)], as a surrogate of renal ammonium excretion in 15 patients presenting with hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentration to distinguish chronic respiratory alkalosis (CRA) from metabolic acidosis (MA) when blood gas was unavailable.

Results

Hyperventilation and low serum bicarbonate concentrations were associated with urine pH above 5.5 and positive urine anion gap in all, suggesting CRA. The diagnosis was later confirmed by obtaining capillary blood gas, which showed a decrease in PCO 2 and high normal pH values.

Conclusion

The use of urine anion gap can help to differentiate between chronic respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, especially when arterial blood gas is not obtained.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114omyyE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

A rise in the AG in critically ill patients was long thought to be predominantly due to lactic acidosis, yet several studies reported poor sensitivity of the AG in detecting hyperlactataemia defined by a lactate threshold of 2.5 mmol/l. The AG was an excellent predictor of severe hyperlactataemia defined as lactate above 4 mmol/l or 5 mmol/l; however, Nichol and colleagues found that a higher lactate concentration even within a normal reference range of 2 mmol/l independently predicts mortality. The AG may thus miss patients at risk of mortality, as a considerable degree of hyperlactataemia is required to push the AG outside its normal reference range if the baseline AG is low. This is in keeping with the extreme difference in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors observed in the study reporting the highest predictive value of AG. Other studies reported smaller, albeit mostly statistically significant, differences in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors.

### Extracorporeal treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^111uHjH2]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Cessation

We recommend stopping ECTR when the AG (calculated as Na⁺ + K⁺ − Cl⁻ − HCO₃⁻) is < 18 mmol/L (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)
We suggest stopping ECTR when the EG is < 4 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence)
We suggest stopping ECTR when acid–base abnormalities are corrected (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence)

Rationale: Once ECTR is initiated, it is recommended that all acid–base parameters have normalized, in particular a confirmed and sustained normalization of the glycolate concentration and/or anion gap before stopping ECTR. Some clinical markers such as seizures may reverse quickly once ECTR is initiated and others, such as cranial nerve palsies and AKI in particular, may take weeks to resolve and should therefore not guide cessation. Once acid–base homeostasis is restored, then an acceptable and conservative endpoint for cessation is an EG concentration < 4 mmol/L. If ECTR must be terminated when the EG concentration is higher (e.g. multiple poisoned patients), continuation of ADH blockade is reasonable to prevent further EG metabolism. As noted above, some authors have suggested that an EG concentration < 10 mmol/L is an acceptable endpoint in asymptomatic patients, but supporting clinical data are not currently available and there are few downsides to continuing ECTR until lower cutoffs are reached. The clinical significance of rebound in EG concentration after ECTR is uncertain but can be addressed with a repeat ECTR session if clinically indicated. Although the EG concentration is linearly correlated with the osmol gap when elevated, the workgroup did not propose a specific osmol gap cutoff for cessation as there are too many imprecisions at low osmol gap values. The use of validated equations based on expected decay of EG in plasma can be used to predict dialysis time. These formulas assume high-efficiency hemodialysis, with good and constant blood flows, and no sampling errors. These formulas may be useful for planning purposes, especially in cases of multiple poisoned patients where ECTR triage is required, although the workgroup reiterates that all acid–base abnormalities should be reversed before stopping ECTR.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145sbzR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Much research has focussed on the prognostic value of serum lactate estimation in critically ill patients; however, in the context of work in low resource settings we have noted that facilities for lactate and blood gas analysis are frequently not available, prompting a search for alternative risk stratification tools. The anion gap (AG) is an easily calculated marker of metabolic acidosis based on analytes typically available from routine chemistry analysis. It may have potential as a risk stratification tool to identify sick patients at risk of deterioration, who would benefit from further management whilst pathophysiological processes are still reversible. The AG reflects the concentration of unmeasured anions as calculated by the formula Na⁺ − (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻). Inclusion of potassium in the formula is recommended where its concentration is abnormally high or low. In healthy subjects, the unmeasured anions or "gap" is mostly made up of albumin; however, hypoalbuminaemia, commonly observed in critically ill patients, can lower the AG and mask an acidosis. Feldman and colleagues therefore recommended that the AG should be corrected for albumin.

### Gaps-anionic and osmolal… [^111yu5Fj]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gaps is a bedside diagnostic game. It is played in two versions by nephrologists. It deserves wider application by the practicing physician. The more popular version, Anion Gaps, shows the presence of undetermined anions and alerts the physician to the possibilities of laboratory error, severe derangements in serum protein metabolism, or the ingestion of certain ionic compounds that directly or indirectly alter the concentration of routinely undetermined anions. A second version, Osmolal Gaps, shows the presence of unmeasured osmoles or of increased plasma solids and can be used in a variety of clinical situations to direct attention to laboratory error, hyperproteinemia, hyperlipidemia, or the presence of unmeasured osmoles in the serum.

### Unmeasured anions in critically ill patients: can they predict mortality? [^113FFUTW]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether base excess, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, and anion gap can predict lactate in adult critically ill patients, and also to determine whether acid-base variables can predict mortality in these patients.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Adult intensive care unit of tertiary hospital.

Patients

Three hundred adult critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit.

Interventions

Retrieval of admission biochemical data from computerized records, quantitative biophysical analysis of data with the Stewart-Figge methodology, and statistical analysis.

Measurements and Main Results

We measured plasma Na+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, HCO3-, phosphate, ionized Ca2+, albumin, lactate, and arterial pH and Paco2. All three variables (base excess, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, anion gap) were significantly correlated with lactate (r2 = .21, p < .0001; r2 = .30, p < .0001; and r2 = .31. p < .0001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves had moderate to high accuracy for the prediction of a lactate concentration > 5 mmol/L: AUROC curves, 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–0.94), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78–0.93), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77–0.92), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that hospital mortality rate correlated significantly with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, anion gap corrected (anion gap corrected by albumin), age, lactate, anion gap, chloride, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, strong ion gap, sodium, bicarbonate, strong ion difference effective, and base excess. However, except for APACHE II score, AUROC curves for mortality prediction were relatively small: 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72–0.84) for APACHE II, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.59–0.73) for lactate, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.57–0.71) for base excess caused by unmeasured anions, and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.56–0.70) for strong ion gap.

Conclusions

Base excess, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, and anion gap are good predictors of hyperlactatemia (> 5 mmol/L). Acid-base variables and, specifically, "unmeasured anions" (anion gap, anion gap corrected, base excess caused by unmeasured anions, strong ion gap), irrespective of the methods used to calculate them, are not accurate predictors of hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients.

### Anion and osmolal gaps in the diagnosis of methanol poisoning: clinical study in 28 patients [^116sTKRu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate anion and osmolal gaps as diagnostic tools in methanol poisoning.

Design and Setting

Clinical observational study.

Patients and Methods

In a recent methanol outbreak, the initial triage and treatment decisions in 28 patients were based mainly upon the values of the osmolal and anion gaps on admission. Methanol and formate levels were later compared to these gaps by linear regression analysis.

Results

The correlation between the osmolal gaps and serum methanol concentrations on admission was linear (y = 1.03x+12.71, R2 = 0.94). The anion gaps correlated well with the serum formate concentrations (y = 1.12x+13.82, R2 = 0.86). Both gaps were elevated in 24 of the 28 subjects upon admission. Three patients had an osmolal gap within the reference area (because of low serum methanol), but elevated anion gap because of formate accumulation. One patient with probable concomitant ethanol ingestion had a high osmolal gap and a normal anion gap.

Conclusion

Osmolal and anion gaps are useful in the diagnosis and triage of methanol-exposed subjects. Confounders are low serum methanol and concomitant ethanol ingestion.

### Lower serum bicarbonate and a higher anion gap are associated with lower cardiorespiratory fitness in young adults [^117GQgFD]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Lower levels of serum bicarbonate and a higher anion gap have been associated with insulin resistance and hypertension in the general population. Whether these associations extend to other cardiovascular disease risk factors is unknown. To clarify this, we examined the association of serum bicarbonate and anion gap with cardiorespiratory fitness in 2714 adults aged 20–49 years in the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The mean serum bicarbonate was 24.6 mEq/l and the mean anion gap was 10.26 mEq/l, with fitness determined by submaximal exercise testing. After multivariable adjustment, gender, length of fasting, soft drink consumption, systolic blood pressure, serum phosphate, and hemoglobin were independently associated with both the serum bicarbonate and the anion gap. Low fitness was most prevalent among those in the lowest quartile of serum bicarbonate or highest quartile of anion gap. After multivariable adjustment, a 1 s.d. higher serum bicarbonate or anion gap was associated with an odds ratio for low fitness of 0.80 (95% CI 0.70–0.91) and 1.30 (95% CI 1.15–1.48), respectively. The association of bicarbonate with fitness may be mediated by differences in lean body mass. Thus, lower levels of serum bicarbonate and higher levels of anion gap are associated with lower cardiorespiratory fitness in adults aged 20–49 years in the general population.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115q3JUp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

In metabolic acidosis, addition of fixed acids leads to a rise of the AG: while the proton within the acid combines with bicarbonate, the conjugate base contributes to the unmeasured anions. Metabolic acidosis is common in critically ill patients and is a strong predictor of prognosis. Maciel and Park observed that unmeasured anions accounted for the majority of metabolic acidosis in both intensive care unit (ICU) survivors and non-survivors, whereas lactate accounted for only a quarter of acidosis. AG may thus have potential as a risk stratification tool, especially if corrected for albumin.

The validity of the AG as a predictor of mortality has been studied and has been compared to other indices of acid–base balance, especially Stewart's strong ion gap. However, the strong ion gap is more cumbersome and expensive to measure than the AG and is thus less suitable as a risk stratification tool in low resource settings. In studies with contrasting findings, AG was noted to be a very strong predictor of mortality or of limited value with neither the AG nor the strong ion gap effective as predictors of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, it has been noted that studies conducted in countries where gelatin-based intravenous fluids are routinely used, such as the UK and Australia, failed to show an association between the strong ion gap and mortality whereas studies conducted in settings where such fluids are not routinely used, especially the USA were able to demonstrate an association. Gelatins are an exogenous source of unmeasured anions and an increase in AG after gelatin infusion has been demonstrated in animal experimental studies.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114zLWYZ]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a common presentation in acute medicine and in only a minority of cases can renal failure alone be considered the sole cause of the acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and 'classic' lactic acidosis (taken as a blood lactate in excess of 5 mmol l -1) account for most of the remaining cases. Amongst clinicians there is an increasing awareness that there is often an important discrepancy between the measured acidosis and the associated base deficit, suggesting that other anions must contribute to the generation of the anion gap. Further evidence to support the hypothesis of additional 'missing anions' is supplied by observations on patients receiving bicarbonate-buffered haemofiltration for treatment of lactic acidosis where it is possible to calculate the net rates of lactate removal and bicarbonate donation by the haemofilter. In patients whose blood pH is slowly falling (thereby excluding any possible confounding effect of other blood buffers), it is not uncommon for the rate of bicarbonate donation to exceed the rate of lactate removal by as much as twofold (PJ Hilton, unpublished observations). This implies that not only lactic acid, but other 'unknown' acids are being neutralised by the bicarbonate in the haemofiltration replacement fluid.

Preliminary experiments performed in this laboratory with high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry on plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis had suggested that anions principally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly elevated in patients with unexplained metabolic acidosis. We undertook an enzymatic study of anions of the Krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis whose standard base deficit was 8 mmol l -1 or greater. The samples were obtained from consecutive patients who fulfilled these requirements except those with a normal anion gap, which were collected subsequently. The results obtained from the patient samples were compared to control values obtained from healthy volunteers.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### Unified theory for light-induced halide segregation in mixed halide perovskites [^112J6PuM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Metal-halide perovskites have extraordinary optoelectronic performance in solar energy harvesting and light emission applications –. The flexibility of the perovskite ABX 3 structure — where A is an organic or inorganic cation, B is a metal cation like Pb or Sn, and X is a halide anion like I or Br — allows to stabilize a preferred phase and tune the band gap through compositional alloying on different lattice sites –. Notably, mixed halide perovskites have been successfully used in tandem solar cells, where the band gaps in the two light-absorbing layers should be optimally tuned. However, one of the biggest problems in mixed halide perovksites is their photoinstability, specifically light-induced halide segregation. Studies on mixed halide perovskites show that exposure to continuous illumination leads to the separation of the different halide ions, resulting in the formation of low- and high-band gap domains. The low-band gap domains act as photocarrier traps, as evidenced by redshifts in photoluminescence observations. The demixing is reversible because when kept in the dark for a sufficient amount of time, the perovskites return to their original mixed state. An important finding is the existence of a threshold intensity for halide segregation. The reversibility and the existence of an illumination threshold suggest a thermodynamic origin of the effect.

### Albumin-corrected anion gap predicts acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis: a retrospective cohort study [^1148shVn]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a prevalent severe gastrointestinal disorder characterized by high incidence, rapid progression, and multisystem complications.

Multiorgan dysfunction represents a primary determinant of early mortality in AP. Acute kidney injury (AKI), one of the most frequent and life-threatening complications, substantially elevates both short- and long-term mortality risks, with severe AP complicated by AKI leading to an increase in mortality risk. Early identification of patients at high risk for AKI is critical for implementing timely interventions, mitigating complication progression, and improving clinical outcomes.

The pathophysiology of AKI in AP involves multifactorial mechanisms. Systemic and local inflammatory cascades in AP drive the release of proinflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species, culminating in renal microcirculatory dysfunction, hypoperfusion, and glomerular filtration rate reduction. These processes disrupt renal homeostasis, leading to derangements in water-electrolyte balance and acid-base status. The anion gap (AG) is a clinically accessible biomarker for acid-base disorders. Studies have demonstrated utility in predicting short-term mortality in critically ill population. However, AG is confounded by serum albumin levels: hypoalbuminemia may attenuate AG values, leading to false-negative metabolic acidosis assessments. Hypoalbuminemia is extremely common in AP patients, and its incidence is as high as 60–80%, mainly due to increased vascular permeability, albumin extravasation, and inhibition of liver synthetic function caused by inflammation. Therefore, the albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) can more accurately reflect the true load of unmeasured anions (such as lactate and ketone bodies) in the body, especially for critically ill patients with severe inflammation and hypoproteinemia such as AP. Study has shown that elevated ACAG (> 20 mmol/L) at ICU admission correlates with increased all-cause mortality in critically ill AKI patients. Despite this, the association between ACAG and AKI risk in critically ill AP patients remains undefined. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the prognostic utility of ACAG in predicting AKI development in critically ill AP patients, addressing an unmet need in risk stratification for this high-mortality population.

### Unmeasured anions in metabolic acidosis: unravelling the mystery [^116uJP48]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

In the critically ill, metabolic acidosis is a common observation and, in clinical practice, the cause of this derangement is often multi-factorial. Various measures are often employed to try and characterise the aetiology of metabolic acidosis, the most popular of which is the anion gap. The purpose of the anion gap can be perceived as a means by which the physician is alerted to the presence of unmeasured anions in plasma that contribute to the observed acidosis. In many cases, the causative ion may be easily identified, such as lactate, but often the causative ion(s) remain unidentified, even after exclusion of the 'classic' causes. We describe here the various attempts in the literature that have been made to address this observation and highlight recent studies that reveal potential sources of such hitherto unmeasured anions.

### Identification and design principles of low hole effective mass p-type transparent conducting oxides [^115q7Lp6]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

The presence of an additional anion is actually the second mechanism at play in our low-effective-mass candidates (that is, ZrOS, HfOS and the oxypnictides) as illustrated by the bands characters presented in Fig. 4e–h. Here the valence band keeps a p character but more delocalized orbitals such as 3 p (for S 2−, P 3−) or 4 p (As 3−) replace the oxygen 2 p valence band. Although pure 3 p- or 4 p -based compounds have often too small band gaps, the mixing of oxygen and another p -orbital anion can lead to compounds with low effective masses and large band gaps. For instance, the band gaps of ZrS 2 is 1.7 eV (ref.), whereas ZrO 2 shows a larger band gap (from 5.2 to 5.7 eV (ref.)) but flat oxygen valence bands. ZrOS achieves an interesting trade-off offering a larger band gap than for the pure sulphide with a lower hole effective mass because of the sulphur character of the valence band. Our study did not lead to any oxypnictides offering such a good trade-off, but it is a still unexplored chemistry where future TCO work might be fruitful. Boron suboxide also fits in the anion-mixing category, as B 6 O can be seen as a mixture of cationic boron, anionic boron and anionic oxygen.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^117DDyR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

EPRONTIA can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by EPRONTIA. EPRONTIA induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of EPRONTIA.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116wqzhi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis does not support the use of a single AG measurement for risk stratification in critically ill patients. Quantitative synthesis was limited by significant statistical heterogeneity, which, following a series of subgroup analyses, could be partially explained by the quantity of intravenous fluids received by study patients. Studies differed substantially with regards to setting, presumed use of gelatin-based intravenous fluids as well as the age and mortality rate of their patient cohorts; however, in our analysis none of these factors fully accounted for the high degree of heterogeneity. Disease severity was not consistently characterised across studies and could therefore not be analysed in subgroup analysis. Overall, the high degree of unexplained heterogeneity, poor quality of primary studies and poor to moderate discriminatory power of the AG reported by the majority of studies suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of the AG in clinical practice. Owing to the small number of studies that calculated a corrected AG, we were unable to determine whether correction of the AG for albumin improves its predictive ability.

In subgroup analysis, a highly statistically significant difference was seen between studies accounting for intravenous fluids by means of fluid restriction or by measuring the AG before the initiation of hospital-based management and studies that did not account for quantity of intravenous fluids by any means. This indicates that intravenous fluids may have blurred the association between AG and mortality. Administration of normal saline lowers the AG because addition of NaCl to the plasma increases the baseline chloride concentration proportionately more than the baseline sodium concentration, owing to the differences in volume of distribution between the two ions. This effect may not be seen with more balanced fluids such as Hartman's solution but, given that normal saline is commonly used in clinical practice, a risk stratification tool that is considerably affected by saline infusion is impractical. However, the validity of this subgroup analysis is limited by its observational nature and relatively small number of studies contained in each subgroup. Therefore, other confounders may have accounted for these results. Furthermore, the study by Shane and colleagues also employed intravenous fluid restriction but found no predictive effect of the AG; however, only mean difference in AG between survivors and non-survivors but not AUC was reported. Further research would be required to determine more conclusively the extent to which the AG is affected by intravenous fluids.

### Approach to patients with acid-base disorders [^115qZBqk]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Disorders of acid-base balance are commonly encountered in clinical practice and can have a substantial impact on the prognosis of the patient. Moreover, identification of a particular acid-base disturbance can provide a clue to an underlying disorder. Proper evaluation and treatment of acid-base disorders requires a systematic and analytic approach including: (1) assess the accuracy of the acid-base values using the Henderson equation or Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, (2) obtain a complete history and physical examination, (3) calculate the serum anion gap, (4) identify the primary acid-base disturbance and determine whether a simple or mixed disturbance is present, (5) examine serum electrolytes and additional laboratory data, and (6) measure urine pH and urine electrolytes and calculate the urine anion and osmolal gaps. Strict adherence to these principles will enable the clinician to diagnose the acid-base disturbance in the majority of cases. To illustrate these principles, 5 cases of patients with acid-base disturbances are analyzed.

### Lactate gap as a tool in identifying ethylene glycol poisoning [^116vxs4Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Ethylene glycol toxicity is a known cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis, with the presence of an osmolar gap and the right clinical context suggesting to the diagnosis. Rapid recognition and early treatment is crucial. Unfortunately, ethylene glycol levels are not readily available and must be performed at a reference laboratory. We present a case where recognising the significance of the 'lactate gap' assisted in identifying ethylene glycol poisoning.

### Addressing voltage decay in Li-rich cathodes by broadening the gap between metallic and anionic bands [^116Tvfuj]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Oxygen release and irreversible cation migration are the main causes of voltage fade in Li-rich transition metal oxide cathode. But their correlation is not very clear and voltage decay is still a bottleneck. Herein, we modulate the oxygen anionic redox chemistry by constructing Li 2 ZrO 3 slabs into Li 2 MnO 3 domain in Li 1.21 Ni 0.28 Mn 0.51 O 2, which induces the lattice strain, tunes the chemical environment for redox-active oxygen and enlarges the gap between metallic and anionic bands. This modulation expands the region in which lattice oxygen contributes capacity by oxidation to oxygen holes and relieves the charge transfer from anionic band to antibonding metal-oxygen band under a deep delithiation. This restrains cation reduction, metal-oxygen bond fracture, and the formation of localized O 2 molecule, which fundamentally inhibits lattice oxygen escape and cation migration. The modulated cathode demonstrates a low voltage decay rate (0.45 millivolt per cycle) and a long cyclic stability.

### The urine anion gap: common misconceptions [^113dwLtd]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Two papers, one in 1986 and another one in 1988, reported a strong inverse correlation between urinary anion gap (UAG) and urine ammonia excretion (UNH 4) in patients with metabolic acidosis and postulated that UAG could be used as an indirect measure of UNH 4 This postulation has persisted until now and is widely accepted. In this review, we discuss factors regulating UAG and examine published evidence to uncover errors in the postulate and the design of the original studies. The essential fact is that, in the steady state, UAG reflects intake of Na, K, and Cl. Discrepancy between intake and urinary output of these electrolytes (i.e. UAG) indicates selective extrarenal loss of these electrolytes or nonsteady state. UNH 4 excretion, which depends, in the absence of renal dysfunction, mainly on the daily acid load, has no consistent relationship to UAG either theoretically or in reality. Any correlation between UAG and UNH 4, when observed, was a fortuitous correlation and cannot be extrapolated to other situations. Furthermore, the normal value of UAG has greatly increased over the past few decades, mainly due to increases in dietary intake of potassium and widespread use of sodium salts with anions other than chloride as food additives. The higher normal values of UAG must be taken into consideration in interpreting UAG.

### Unmeasured anions: the unknown unknowns [^115dBGfS]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence is emerging that elevated concentrations of the intermediates of the citric acid cycle may contribute to unmeasured anions in critical illness. Both the anion gap and the strong ion gap are used as scanning tools for recognition of these anions. The mechanisms underlying these elevations and their significance require further clarification.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^111CMi7g]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown that the concentration of anions normally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are elevated in appreciable quantities in patients with a metabolic acidosis. We propose that they may play a significant role in generating the anion gap. Further work in this laboratory is currently underway to explore the clinical implications of these findings.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the anion gap to identify toxic lithium concentrations: a single-center retrospective observational study [^115NL1wd]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lithium exhibits a narrow margin between therapeutic doses and toxic blood concentrations, which can pose a substantial risk of toxic effects. Reportedly, lithium toxicity may be associated with a reduced anion gap; however, the precise relationship remains unclear. This study examined several different anion gap calculation methods to detect toxic lithium concentrations without directly measuring blood lithium concentrations.

Methods

Our retrospective study analyzed blood samples collected for lithium concentration measurements. The anion gap was determined using three different methods, both with and without albumin and lactate concentration corrections. Samples were categorized into two groups based on lithium concentration (< 1.5 or ≥ 1.5mmol/L), and anion gap values were compared. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between each anion gap indicator and lithium concentration. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used for diagnostic analysis.

Results

Overall, 24 measurements were collected, with 41.7% of samples falling within the toxic range. The high-lithium concentration group exhibited significantly smaller anion gaps. Correlation and logistic regression analyses revealed a significant association between anion gap values and lithium concentrations. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were: conventional anion gap 0.77 (95% CI: 0.55–0.94); albumin-corrected anion gap 0.85 (95% CI: 0.66–1.00); and both albumin- and lactate-corrected anion gap 0.86 (95% CI: 0.66–1.00).

Discussion

The anion gap is calculated as the difference between measured cations and anions. Accumulation of lithium (a cation) may decrease measured cations and decrease the calculated anion gap. Abnormal albumin and lactate concentrations may also alter the anion gap and affect its usefulness as a diagnostic marker for elevated serum lithium concentrations. A negative likelihood ratio of 0.1 suggests that the anion gap might be valuable in excluding toxicity.

Conclusions

The corrected anion gap, accounting for albumin and lactate concentrations, may be beneficial in suggesting the possibility of toxic lithium concentrations.

### A simple estimate of the effect of the serum albumin level on the anion gap [^1172rQYh]. American Journal of Nephrology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

The serum anion gap (serum [Na⁺] − [Cl⁻] − [CO₂]) is still the first-line approach to metabolic acidosis. However, while it is generally acknowledged that hypoalbuminemia mandates a downward adjustment of the expected anion gap, a specific correction factor for the anion gap in the face of low serum albumin has never been demonstrated.

Methods

We reviewed initial laboratory data from 432 consecutive patients admitted or transferred to the medical intensive care unit at Nassau County Medical Center over a 6-month period and correlated the serum albumin with the anion gap and the serum [tCO(2)] using multivariate analysis. We looked at the anion gap as a function of delta (albumin), the difference between normal and actual serum albumin, defined as 4.0 - measured serum albumin g/dl. We also assessed [tCO(2)] as an independent variable.

Results

For patients with normal or high serum tCO(2), the ratio of change in anion gap (delta anion gap) to delta (albumin) was 1.46 and 1.45, respectively. For patients with serum tCO(2) < 22 mEq/l this ratio was 1.89. In the latter group, anion gap was best predicted taking both delta (albumin) and serum tCO(2) into account: anion gap = 36.2 − serum tCO₂ − 2.3 × delta (albumin) (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

For intensive care patients with normal or high serum tCO(2) (> 21 mEq/l) a simple bedside adjustment of the anion gap by subtracting 1.5 times the difference between measured serum albumin and the 'normal' level of 4.0 g/dl gives a close estimate of the actual anion gap. For intensive care patients with serum tCO(2) < 22 mEq/l, correction of the anion gap is well predicted by adding about twice the Delta (albumin) to the calculated gap.

To the Editor. — In a recent issue of The Journal, Goldstein et al commented on the usefulness of ascertaining if a low anion gap is present. The comment that only one case of multiple myeloma was found out of a total of 39, 360 retrospective electrolyte determinations would suggest that this quest would lack utility. If one, however, notes that out of the 19 patients who had verification of a low anion gap by repeated determinations, 16 could be explained by either hypoalbuminemia or hyponatremia, the astute mathematician realizes that one third of the remaining patients had multiple myeloma. Therefore, if hypoalbuminemia and hyponatremia are ruled out, the incidence of multiple myeloma in patients who have verified low anion gaps in this study is 33%.

There are few such noninvasive laboratory tests that have this degree of specific diagnostic value. It would be more interesting to know how many of the Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tvCVg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

AUC of observed AG was chosen for subgroup analysis; results are shown in Table 3. The quantity of intravenous fluids given to a patient had the strongest influence on the summary AUC. Studies excluding patients who received more than a specified volume of intravenous fluids reported a significantly higher summary AUC than studies not excluding patients for this reason (P = 0.0008), but heterogeneity remained high in both subgroups. For the subsequent analysis, studies restricting intravenous fluids and studies measuring the AG before initiation of hospital-based management were combined in a subgroup and compared to studies that did not account in any way for the effect of intravenous fluids on the AG. The former subgroup yielded a significantly higher summary AUC than the latter subgroup (P < 0.0001). Heterogeneity remained high in the former subgroup (I 2 = 98%), though results in the latter subgroup were homogenous (I 2 = 0%). The summary AUC of studies conducted in countries where gelatin-based resuscitation fluids are routinely used is not significantly different to that of studies conducted in countries where gelatins are not routinely used (P = 0.33). Studies in which intravenous fluids were restricted or in which the AG was measured before initiation of hospital-based treatment were not included in the latter comparison. The observed AG appears to be a slightly better predictor of mortality among younger patients (P = 0.011) and those admitted to trauma centre settings (P = 0.0235). Subgroup analysis showed no significant difference between studies reporting in-hospital mortality and those reporting a time-framed mortality (P = 0.65); similarly, no significant difference was found between studies in which overall mortality was below 30% and above 30% (P = 0.89) or between studies published before and after the year 2005 (P = 0.43); and heterogeneity remained high in all subgroups. Funnel plots did not show evidence of publication bias (Additional file 4: Figure S4 and Additional file 5: Figure S5).

Imbalances of the acid-base state and particularly metabolic acidosis are common problems in critically ill patients. To further investigate the underlying causes, analysis of the acid-base state and determination of plasma and urine electrolytes are crucial. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided in conditions with either high serum anion gap (SAG) or normal SAG according to the classic model of metabolic acid-base disorders. The SAG is the difference in the measured cations (Na⁺, K⁺) and anions (Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻) in serum.

High SAG is typical for the occurrence of unmeasured anions (for example ketones, lactate, metabolites of methanol and ethylene glycol, phosphate) where HCO₃⁻ is consumed via its action as a buffer. High SAG metabolic acidosis is seen in ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, intoxication and acute renal failure.

Metabolic acidosis with normal SAG - hyperchloremic acidosis - is characterized by the replacement of bicarbonate with chloride caused by extrarenal or renal bicarbonate disposal or a dysfunction in renal H⁺ secretion. Hyperchloremic acidosis is typically seen in bicarbonate wasting due to diarrhea, urine-gut diversions, intestinal or pancreatic fistulae, surgical drains or renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

The analysis of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) is necessary to further differentiate these conditions. The UOG represents the difference of the directly measured urine osmolality to an estimate of the urine osmolality derived from the urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen, and glucose concentrations.

A UOG - as an approximate measure of unmeasured urine ammonium salts - of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function is characteristic for altered urine acidification typical for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

### Decreased anion gap associated with hypoalbuminemia and polyclonal gammopathy… [^116pJ35D]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Anion gaps were determined in 82 patients with hypoalbuminemia; 24 of these patients had a polyclonal increase in γ-globulin levels. The 58 patients without the polyclonal increase in γ-globulin levels were subdivided according to the origin of their serum albumin loss as follows: group 1, renal; group 2, gastrointestinal; group 3, skin; and group 4, malignant neoplasms. All groups had a statistically significant reduction in their mean anion gaps when compared with normal control subjects. The greatest decrease was when hypoalbuminemia was accompanied by a polyclonal increase in γ-globulin levels. Hypoalbuminemia with or without a polyclonal gammopathy is a cause of a low anion gap. No statistically significant correlation was found between the anion gaps and individual serum albumin concentrations. Nanji AA, Campbell DJ, Pudek MR. Decreased Anion Gap Associated With Hypoalbuminemia and Polyclonal Gammopathy. JAMA. 1981; 246: 859–860.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gRRzd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lactate concentration is a robust predictor of mortality but in many low resource settings facilities for its analysis are not available. Anion gap (AG), calculated from clinical chemistry results, is a marker of metabolic acidosis and may be more easily obtained in such settings. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we investigated whether the AG predicts mortality in adult patients admitted to critical care settings.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library and regional electronic databases from inception until May 2016. Studies conducted in any clinical setting that related AG to in-hospital mortality, in-intensive care unit mortality, 31-day mortality or comparable outcome measures were eligible for inclusion. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Descriptive meta-analysis was performed and the I 2 test was used to quantify heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis was undertaken to identify potential sources of heterogeneity between studies.

Results

Nineteen studies reporting findings in 12,497 patients were included. Overall, quality of studies was poor and most studies were rated as being at moderate or high risk of attrition bias and confounding. There was substantial diversity between studies with regards to clinical setting, age and mortality rates of patient cohorts. High statistical heterogeneity was found in the meta-analyses of area under the ROC curve (I 2 = 99%) and mean difference (I 2 = 97%) for the observed AG. Three studies reported good discriminatory power of the AG to predict mortality and were responsible for a large proportion of statistical heterogeneity. The remaining 16 studies reported poor to moderate ability of the AG to predict mortality. Subgroup analysis suggested that intravenous fluids affect the ability of the AG to predict mortality.

Conclusion

Based on the limited quality of available evidence, a single AG measurement cannot be recommended for risk stratification in critically ill patients. The probable influence of intravenous fluids on AG levels renders the AG an impractical tool in clinical practice. Future research should focus on increasing the availability of lactate monitoring in low resource settings.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113D1LzF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The high degree of unexplained statistical heterogeneity, considerable diversity between patient cohorts and poor quality of primary studies, in particular the high risk of attrition bias and confounding, impact on the overall strength of evidence of this systematic review and meta-analysis. The majority of studies reported here do not support the use of the AG as a predictor of 31-day mortality, in-ICU mortality or in-hospital mortality. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the use of a single AG measurement for risk stratification in critically ill patients cannot be recommended. Further high quality research would be required to conclusively determine the validity of the AG as a predictor of mortality. However, the probable influence of intravenous fluids on AG levels and the substantial baseline variability between AG levels among healthy individuals may render the use of the AG problematic in clinical practice. In light of the growing body of evidence supporting the use of lactate concentration for monitoring of critically ill patients, it may be more worthwhile to focus efforts on increasing the capacity for lactate measurement in low resource settings.

### Diagnosis of metabolic acid-base disturbances in critically ill patients [^115CKJb4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

We compare two commonly used diagnostic approaches, one relying on plasma bicarbonate concentration and "anion gap", the other on "base excess", with a third method based on physicochemical principles, for their value in detecting complex metabolic acid-base disturbances. We analyzed arterial blood samples from 152 patients and nine normal subjects for pH, PCO(2), and concentrations of plasma electrolytes and proteins. Ninety-six percent of the patients had serum albumin concentration ≤ 3 SD below the mean of the control subjects. In about one-sixth of the patients, base excess and plasma bicarbonate were normal. In a great majority of these apparently normal samples, the third method detected simultaneous presence of acidifying and alkalinizing disturbances, many of them grave. The almost ubiquitous hypoalbuminemia confounded the interpretation of acid-base data when the customary approaches were applied. Base excess missed serious acid-base abnormalities in about one-sixth of the patients; this method fails when the plasma concentrations of the nonbicarbonate buffers (mainly albumin) are abnormal. Anion gap detected a hidden "gap acidosis" in only 31% of those samples with normal plasma bicarbonate in which such acidosis was diagnosed by the third method; when adjusted for hypoalbuminemia, it reliably detected the hidden abnormal anions. The proposed third method identifies and quantifies individual components of complex acid-base abnormalities and provides insights in their pathogenesis.

### The serum anion gap in the evaluation of acid-base disorders: what are its limitations and can its effectiveness be improved? [^111MVjpb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap has been utilized to identify errors in the measurement of electrolytes, to detect paraproteins, and, most relevant to the nephrologist, to evaluate patients with suspected acid-base disorders. In regard to the latter purpose, traditionally an increased anion gap is identified when it exceeds the upper limit of normal for a particular clinical laboratory measurement. However, because there is a wide range of normal values (often 8–10 mEq/L), an increase in anion concentration can be present in the absence of an increased anion gap. In addition, the type of retained anion can affect the magnitude of the increase in anion gap relative to change in serum [HCO3(-)] being greater with lactic acidosis compared with ketoacidosis. This review examines the methods of calculation of the serum anion gap in textbooks and published literature, the effect of perturbations other than changes in acid-base balance, and its effectiveness in identifying mild and more severe disturbances in acid-base balance. Limitations of the present methods of determining the normal anion gap and change in the anion gap are highlighted. The possibility of identifying the baseline value for individuals to optimize the use of the calculation in the detection of metabolic acidosis is suggested.

### Zonisamide [^115vKWcS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Kidney Stones subsection). Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na(+)] - ([HCO(3)(-)] + [Cl(-)]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Pseudohyperchloremia and negative anion gap-think salicylate! [^115SkVty]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudohyperchloremia results in a very low or negative anion gap. Historically, the most common cause of this artifact was bromide poisoning. Bromide salts have been removed from most medications and bromism has become very uncommon. More recently, the introduction of chloride ion selective sensing electrodes (Cl-ISE) has generated a new cause of pseudohyperchloremia-salicylate poisoning. We describe 5 such patients and quantitate the error generated by this measurement artifact.

Methods

The magnitude of artifactual hyperchloremia generated by high salicylate levels was quantified in 5 patients by measuring chloride concentration with several Cl-ISEs from different manufacturers and with Cl-ISEs of different "ages", and comparing these results to measurements with a chloridometer (coulometric titration), which is free of the salicylate artifact.

Results

Cl-ISEs from different manufacturers generated a wide range of artifactual chloride concentration elevation. Furthermore, the same Cl-ISE generated increasingly severe pseudohyperchloremia as it was repeatedly reused over time and "aged".

Conclusions

Salicylate interferes with measurement of the blood chloride concentration when a Cl-ISE is used. The severity of this artifact is related to the salicylate level, the specific Cl-ISE, and the "age" of the electrode. Toxic blood salicylate levels can generate marked pseudohyperchloremia, and consequently, an artifactual very small or negative anion gap. The large anion gap metabolic acidosis typical of salicylate poisoning is masked by this artifact. Salicylate has become the most common cause of pseudohyperchloremia, and physicians should immediately consider salicylate poisoning whenever the combination of hyperchloremia and a very small or negative anion gap is reported by the laboratory.

Among other possible causes, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by metformin-induced lactic acidosis, toluene poisoning, acetaminophen overdose, alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, propylene glycol poisoning, ethylene glycol poisoning, starvation ketosis, multiple myeloma, maple syrup urine disease, lactic acidosis, methanol poisoning, sepsis, uremia, rhabdomyolysis, cyanide poisoning, isopropyl alcohol poisoning and pyroglutamic acidosis. In addition, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as aspirin.

### Early anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen overdose [^112Dze4N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical significance of early high (> 15 mEq/L) anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen (APAP) overdose.

Methods

A retrospective review of a cohort of 74 patients presenting within 24 hours of APAP overdose was conducted.

Results

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was present in 41% of patients on admission and persisted for 1.5 ± 0.1 days. The anion gap was associated with an elevated lactate level (4.5 ± 1 mmol/L) (r(2) = 0.66, P < .05), which persisted for 1 day. The lactate level increased in proportion to the APAP concentration (r(2) = 0.75, P < .05). Patients with increased anion gap had a higher incidence of confusion (48% vs 3%; P < .001) and lethargy (39% vs 6%; p = 0.003). Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was found in the absence of shock or liver failure. All patients were treated with N-acetylcysteine and, despite the early high anion gap metabolic acidosis, none developed hepatic failure or hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis in patients with APAP overdose is self-limited and does not predict clinical or laboratory outcomes. Persistent or late metabolic acidosis in the absence of liver failure is not likely due to APAP and should prompt a search for other causes of metabolic acidosis. Finally, APAP overdose should be considered in patients presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status, as this is a treatable condition when detected early.
