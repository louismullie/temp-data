## Question

Occipital herpes treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating occipital herpes zoster. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the diagnosis and whether "occipital herpes" refers to herpes zoster in the occipital dermatome. Then, I should verify severity and complications, especially neurologic involvement. Next, I will decide on route and dose of antivirals, including when to use IV therapy. After that, I need to check pain management and whether corticosteroids help. Finally, I will consider monitoring, special populations, and prevention, and I will double-check any conflicting dosing or duration details as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and terminology, because "occipital herpes" is imprecise. Clinically, this almost always means herpes zoster reactivation in the C2–C3 dermatomes of the occipital scalp, often along the greater occipital nerve distribution, and it is a cranial nerve dermatome involvement that carries higher risk of complications than truncal zoster, so I should treat it as head/neck zoster rather than routine trunk disease [^0185c3b6] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify severity and complications before jumping to treatment choices. Occipital zoster can be complicated by meningitis or encephalitis even in immunocompetent hosts, and atypical presentations with painless rashes can delay diagnosis; I should actively screen for headache, fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, or altered mentation and maintain a low threshold to evaluate for CNS disease with CSF PCR for VZV if there are neurologic signs or persistent systemic symptoms [^691951a0] [^aaa78455] [^75a77b16].

> I need to ensure timing is right for antivirals. The cornerstone is to start within 72 hours of rash onset when possible, because benefits on acute pain and healing diminish after that window; however, if new lesions are still appearing or complications are suspected, treatment should still be initiated beyond 72 hours, especially in head/neck disease or high-risk patients [^9d1723b6] [^1ec410f1].

> Hold on, I should verify the route of therapy. For uncomplicated occipital zoster in immunocompetent patients, oral therapy is appropriate; for complicated disease, immunocompromise, dissemination, or CNS involvement, IV acyclovir is indicated, with escalation up to 15 mg/kg every 8 hours in severe cases and treatment for 10–14 days or longer based on clinical response [^0185c3b6] [^9d1723b6].

> Let me think about oral options and dosing. Standard oral regimens include acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for 7–10 days, valacyclovir 1 g three times daily for 7–10 days, or famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for 7–10 days; I initially thought famciclovir could be dosed once daily, but wait, that is incorrect for acute zoster — famciclovir requires TID dosing in this setting, so I should correct that and stick to 500 mg TID [^640f71ff] [^3b049968].

> I should confirm IV dosing and duration. For severe or complicated zoster, including CNS involvement, IV acyclovir 10–15 mg/kg every 8 hours is recommended, typically for 10–14 days, with step-down to oral therapy once clinical improvement is clear; in a recent immunocompetent case with VZV meningitis, 5 days of IV acyclovir followed by 5 days of oral valacyclovir 1 g TID resulted in full recovery, but I need to emphasize that total durations of 10–14 days are standard for CNS disease and that case-based shorter courses should be individualized [^0185c3b6] [^691951a0] [^13312c27].

> Next, I should review pain management. Early and adequate analgesia is essential; I should follow the WHO analgesic ladder and escalate to gabapentin or pregabalin and consider a tricyclic antidepressant such as nortriptyline or amitriptyline if pain is moderate to severe or if risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia are present, recognizing these neuropathic agents may not be FDA-approved for acute zoster pain but are guideline-supported for pain control in this context [^a13fbcd4] [^5ccd6c33].

> But wait, what about corticosteroids. I need to check the evidence carefully. Although some older reviews and case series suggest short-term steroids may reduce acute pain, high-quality evidence shows corticosteroids do not prevent postherpetic neuralgia, and routine use is not recommended; if considered, it should be as adjuncts to antivirals in select severe cases, not as monotherapy, and avoided in immunocompromised hosts [^1178db9b] [^613cc551] [^1ec410f1].

> I will now examine special populations and monitoring. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, IV acyclovir is preferred for extensive or complicated disease with step-down to oral therapy to complete 10–14 days; in older adults, the threshold for IV therapy and closer follow-up should be lower given higher complication rates; I should monitor for neurologic progression, secondary bacterial infection, and response to pain therapy and adjust the antiviral course if lesions heal slowly [^3b049968] [^9b1e7f93] [^0185c3b6].

> Let me reconsider prevention, because it shapes counseling. The recombinant shingles vaccine reduces incidence of zoster and postherpetic neuralgia by more than 90% and is preferred over live attenuated vaccine in eligible adults; I should recommend vaccination during convalescence once the acute episode has resolved, as it does not treat acute zoster but prevents recurrence and complications [^498cf026] [^notfound].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the plan: diagnose occipital zoster clinically and maintain vigilance for CNS disease; start antivirals within 72 hours when possible, using oral valacyclovir 1 g TID, famciclovir 500 mg TID, or acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for 7–10 days in uncomplicated cases, and escalate to IV acyclovir 10–15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 10–14 days if there is immunocompromise, dissemination, or neurologic involvement; manage pain proactively with a stepwise analgesic and neuropathic regimen; avoid routine corticosteroids; and arrange close follow-up with a low threshold for CSF testing if neurologic symptoms emerge [^9d1723b6] [^0185c3b6] [^640f71ff] [^1178db9b].

---

Occipital herpes zoster is treated with **early antiviral therapy** (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) within 72 hours of rash onset to reduce pain, hasten healing, and lower the risk of complications [^9d1723b6] [^1ec410f1]. For severe pain or neurologic involvement, **IV acyclovir** 10 mg/kg every 8 hours is indicated, with step-down to oral therapy once stable [^0185c3b6] [^3b049968]. Pain control follows the WHO ladder, adding gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain and considering tricyclic antidepressants if needed [^5ccd6c33] [^f27514b4]. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended and do not prevent postherpetic neuralgia [^1178db9b] [^613cc551]. Monitor for neurologic complications and refer to neurology or ophthalmology if indicated [^a5dea104] [^9293768e].

---

## Antiviral therapy

Antiviral therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for occipital herpes zoster. Early initiation within 72 hours of rash onset significantly reduces the severity and duration of acute pain, accelerates lesion healing, and decreases the risk of complications, including postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) [^9d1723b6] [^1ec410f1].

| **Antiviral agent** | **Dosage and administration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Acyclovir | 800 mg orally five times daily for 7–10 days | Immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease |
| Valacyclovir | 1,000 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days | Immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease |
| Famciclovir | 500 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days | Immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease |
| Acyclovir (IV) | 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days | Severe disease, immunocompromised patients, or neurologic involvement |

---

IV acyclovir is indicated for **severe disease**, immunocompromised patients, or neurologic involvement; after clinical improvement, transition to oral therapy to complete a 10–14 day total course [^0185c3b6] [^3b049968].

---

## Pain management

Pain management is essential in occipital herpes zoster, as acute pain can be severe and may persist as PHN. The **WHO analgesic ladder** guides therapy:

- **Step 1**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for mild pain.
- **Step 2**: Weak opioids (e.g. codeine) for moderate pain.
- **Step 3**: Strong opioids (e.g. morphine) for severe pain.

For neuropathic pain, **gabapentin or pregabalin** are first-line agents; tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline) are alternatives if gabapentinoids are contraindicated or ineffective [^5ccd6c33] [^f27514b4].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Corticosteroids may be considered in select cases of severe pain or neurologic involvement, but evidence for preventing PHN is limited and routine use is not recommended [^1178db9b] [^613cc551]. Topical agents such as lidocaine patches or capsaicin cream may provide additional pain relief, particularly in PHN [^f27514b4].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for complications, including PHN, neurologic involvement, and secondary bacterial infection. Patients should be educated about the signs of neurologic complications and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience severe headache, confusion, or focal neurologic deficits [^a5dea104].

---

## Prevention of complications

Vaccination with the recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) significantly reduces the incidence of herpes zoster and PHN. Vaccination is recommended for adults aged 50 years and older, including those with a history of herpes zoster [^498cf026] [^a577dce0].

---

Occipital herpes zoster is managed with **early antiviral therapy**, appropriate pain management, and close monitoring for complications. Early intervention is critical to reduce the severity of acute pain, accelerate healing, and prevent complications such as PHN.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common cutaneous entity with protean clinical presentations, management options, complication rates, and prevention strategies, all of which are rife with dogma. During an inpatient consultation for HZ, have you ever been approached by a frantic staff or family member, worried that a pregnant, elderly, or infant contact will be 'infected' if they get too close? Have your patients ever asked you about their risk of having HZ twice, or claimed that they have frequent 'recurrences'? In what timeline should antiviral therapy be employed? Is there evidence for prednisone or gabapentin in acute HZ treatment? Who should be vaccinated against HZ and what are the benefits and risks? In case-based form, these and other complex but common scenarios will be examined using clinical and viral mechanistic clues, along with updated treatment and prevention guidelines, to provide a modern HZ case management compendium, comprehensive of the diverse age and health populations now presenting with this condition.

### Other facial neuralgias [^a5dea104]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise In this article we review some lesser known cranial neuralgias that are distinct from trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or trigeminal neuropathies. Included are occipital neuralgia, superior laryngeal neuralgia, auriculotemporal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal and nervus intermedius neuralgia, and pain from acute herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia of the trigeminal and intermedius nerves. Problem Facial neuralgias are rare and many physicians do not see such cases in their lifetime, so patients with a suspected diagnosis within this group should be referred to a specialized center where multidisciplinary team diagnosis may be available. Potential solution Each facial neuralgia can be identified on the basis of clinical presentation, allowing for precision diagnosis and planning of treatment. Treatment remains conservative with oral or topical medication recommended for neuropathic pain to be tried before more invasive procedures are undertaken. However, evidence for efficacy of current treatments remains weak.

Treatment

The patient was then admitted to our hospital. Acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) and ampicillin (2 g every 6 hours) were administered intravenously. Ampicillin treatment was discontinued after blood and CSF cultures tested negative.

After hospitalisation, the exudate from a painless skin rash on the right occipital area worsened. A dermatologist evaluated the patient and diagnosed herpes zoster based on the nature, distribution and associated pain of the rash.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^bb0af722]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with herpes zoster (HZ) that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and costs of treatment. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to the management of patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the clinical experience of the authors support the use of acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for the use of these medications are provided. In addition, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus: a review for the internist [^9293768e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus occurs due to reactivation of the varicella zoster virus in the ophthalmic branch of the fifth cranial nerve. This disease primarily affects the elderly as well as the immunocompromised and can result in a wide range of ophthalmic morbidity. Systemic antiviral therapy is the mainstay of treatment; however, consultation with an ophthalmologist is typically indicated. Herein we present a review of this common entity including epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, treatment, follow-up, and an update on the current body of literature.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1ec410f1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment and nonspecific management of zoster and PHN — antivirals and corticosteroids: Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are approved by the FDA for zoster in immunocompetent patients, and trials indicate that when taken orally they reduce viral shedding and lesion formation, shorten time to rash healing, and decrease acute zoster pain and the risk for progression to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Many experts recommend that treatment should be considered for all eligible patients with zoster and specifically recommend treatment for persons aged ≥ 50 years who have moderate or severe pain, moderate or severe rash, or involvement of noncranial dermatomes. In clinical trials, treatment has been initiated within 72 hours of rash onset and the benefits of later treatment have not been studied; if treatment cannot be initiated within 72 hours, experts recommend that it should be initiated as soon as possible, particularly in the presence of new vesicle formation or of complications. Two clinical trials assessed corticosteroids with acyclovir; a 3-week tapering course diminished acute zoster pain and decreased time to cutaneous healing, cessation of analgesic therapy, and return of uninterrupted sleep and normal daily activities, but no evidence indicated that use of corticosteroids prevented development of PHN; combinations with valacyclovir or famciclovir have not been studied in clinical trials. No evidence indicates that topical antiviral therapy or corticosteroids without systemic antiviral therapy have a role in treatment of zoster.

### Trigeminal herpes zoster: early recognition and treatment are crucial [^206ba5b2]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) is not uncommon in older patients, particularly in cases of chronic autoimmune disorders and in patients taking immunosuppressant drugs. We present a case of a 57-year-old woman presenting with severe herpes zoster infection, involving the maxillary and ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve. Despite an initial delay in instigating crucial antiviral treatment, the patient achieved an excellent recovery, with only some mild scarring at 2 months postinfection. Trigeminal herpes zoster is a potentially devastating clinical occurrence, and is associated with severe long-term neurological sequelae, including encephalitis, vision loss and postherpetic neuralgia. Physicians must be aware of risk factors and treatment modalities.

### Varicella-zoster virus meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia, presenting with painless occipital herpes zoster mimicking atopic dermatitis [^13312c27]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lastly, hypoglycorrhachia contributed to diagnostic challenges. Despite viral meningitis being the cause, the patient's CSF glucose level was low (28 mg/dL), with a CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.18. Hypoglycorrhachia is typically defined as a CSF glucose level < 45 mg/dL or a CSF/serum glucose ratio of ≤ 0.5. While most commonly associated with bacterial meningitis, viral meningoencephalitis reports have documented hypoglycorrhachia in a subset of cases. While most commonly associated with bacterial meningitis, viral meningoencephalitis reports have documented hypoglycorrhachia in a subset of cases. For example, 20% of cases of VZV-related meningoencephalitis demonstrated low CSF glucose levels. In the current case, although lymphocyte predominance was observed — a hallmark of viral infections — the unusual glucose findings likely delayed the consideration of a viral aetiology. The CSF/serum glucose ratio in our case was lower (0.18). Even if CSF glucose levels are low, lymphocyte predominance is observed in viral infections. The patient initially received intravenous acyclovir for 5 days, which was effective. Considering the favourable response and the patient's preference for early discharge, the treatment was transitioned to oral valacyclovir 1000 mg three times per day for an additional 5 days, completing a total of 10 days of treatment. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, intravenous acyclovir 10–15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 10–14 days is recommended for the treatment of VZV encephalitis. However, evidence supporting this treatment approach is limited. A study of 123 patients with VZV meningitis found favourable outcomes across all treatment groups, including those receiving no antivirals, oral valacyclovir alone or a combination of short or long courses of intravenous acyclovir and valacyclovir. Although higher doses of oral valacyclovir (2000 mg every 6 hours) have been suggested due to the higher inhibitory concentration of VZV compared with HSV, switching to 1000 mg three times per day appears reasonable when the initial response to intravenous acyclovir is favourable.

### Altered EEG brain networks in patients with acute peripheral herpes zoster [^0e78b01a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The changes of brain electrical activity might function in network patterns in HZ. Previous fMRI studies have reported that recuperating from HZ accompanyies default model network (DMN) connectivity alterations. In the present study, it was noted that the frontal lobe anti-correlated with occipital lobe in alpha band of component 3. Parts of these regions were assignment within the range of DMN regions. This result suggested that the changes of networks in HZ patients involved DMN. In fact, the altered DMN has been found in multiple pain. This change might be related with pain intensity.

Study limitations include a relatively small sample. We did not address longitudinal effects of HZ on EEG, such as the associations between pain intensity and EEG networks. In addition, all patients were treated with acyclovir medication, which may have had an impact on brain networks. In future research, we will continuously collect cases and overcome these limitations for a more comprehensive understanding of HZ from brain electrical activity aspects.

### Herpes zoster [^7c16a2ae]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) or 'shingles' is a painful vesicular rash resulting from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that also causes chickenpox. The incidence of HZ infection (HZI) increases with age and the degree of immunosuppresssion. Post herpetic neuralgia, the most common complication of HZ, occurs after the zoster rash has resolved. Conventional therapies include antivirals, corticosteroids and analgesics, both oral and topical. Here we report a case of HZ in an 80-year-old woman involving maxillary nerve and the article also reviews various treatment modalities available for the management of HZI.

### Management of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^a2560f8f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with herpes zoster experience severe pain and potential lasting complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic disease/damage, and, rarely, skin complications (eg, infection of rash area). Treatment for acute zoster aims to accelerate healing, control pain, and, when possible, reduce the risk of complications. Early intervention with antivirals can accelerate rash healing, reduce rash severity, and reduce the risk of some complications. The addition of corticosteroids to antiviral medication may further alleviate short-term zoster pain, but is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse effects, especially among older adults. If a patient does develop postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine patch 5%, and capsaicin may all be considered as palliative treatments. For individuals with treatment-refractory postherpetic neuralgia, nonpharmacologic approaches may be considered and a pain-management specialist should be consulted. There is a need for more effective agents to treat herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.

Clinical features of zoster — Acute zoster often begins with a prodrome in which headache, photophobia, and malaise might occur with fever being less common, and abnormal skin sensations and pain can precede the rash by days to weeks. The rash is typically unilateral, does not cross the mid-line, and erupts in one or two adjacent dermatomes, initially erythematous and maculopapular then progressing to coalescing clusters of clear vesicles that evolve through pustular, ulcer, and crust stages. The rash usually lasts 7–10 days, with complete healing within 2–4 weeks, though small numbers of lesions can occur outside the primary or adjacent dermatome, and streptococcal or staphylococcal superinfections might complicate the rash.

### Treatment of herpes zoster… [^883618b2]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best treatment for patients with an outbreak of herpes zoster. Evidence-Based Answer Resolution of acute pain related to herpes zoster is accelerated with any of the following: oral acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for seven days; valacyclovir 1, 000 mg three times daily for seven days; or famciclovir 750 mg once daily, 500 mg twice daily, or 250 mg three times daily for seven days. A single RCT 2 compared valacyclovir with acyclovir. This study found that the mean times to complete resolution of pain were 44 days for valacyclovir and 51 days for acyclovir when treated within 48 hours. 2 When treatment was initiated between 48 and 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, the mean times to complete resolution of pain were 36 days for valacyclovir and 48 days for acyclovir.

Another RCT 3 compared two dosage regimens of famciclovir with placebo in 419 adults treated within 72 hours of symptom onset. Famciclovir slightly accelerated the rate of lesion healing compared with placebo. Recommendations from Others A consensus guideline from the International Herpes Management Forum 6 recommends antiviral therapy with valacyclovir or famciclovir for immunocompetent adults older than 50 years; treatment should be initiated within 72 hours of rash onset. Systemic oral steroids are recommended to reduce acute symptoms. It also is recommended that tricyclic antidepressants be considered to reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia in older patients. Topical antiviral agents are not recommended.

Introduction

Herpes zoster is a worldwide health concern, with an incidence rate of 3 to 5 cases per 1000 person-years in the United States. Over the past several decades, the incidence has been rising, although the underlying causes of this increase remain unidentified. The etiological agent responsible for herpes zoster is the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).VZV, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is classified under the Herpesviridae family and is formally designated as Human Herpesvirus Type 3 (HHV-3).VZV has only one serotype in nature, and humans are its sole reservoir. The virus can manifest as two distinct clinical conditions: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Primary infection with VZV results in varicella, after which the virus becomes latent in the cerebral and dorsal root ganglia. Upon a decline in cell-mediated immunity, VZV can reactivate within T lymphocytes residing in the ganglia, resulting in extensive viral replication and the manifestation of herpes zoster. Two to three days prior to the onset of the rash, patients typically exhibit prodromal symptoms, including fatigue, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations such as itching, burning, and prickling. During the active phase, herpes zoster manifests at the affected dermatome with the appearance of a rash accompanied by pain. This condition frequently results in a deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Approximately 20% of patients continue to experience pain during the chronic phase after the rash has resolved, a condition known as postherpetic neuralgia. In contrast to primary infection, herpes zoster can cause prolonged discomfort and chronic pain.

Summary

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a known cause of meningoencephalitis, typically in immunocompromised inpatients. We report a case of meningitis caused by VZV in an immunocompetent man in his 20s. Diagnosis was delayed due to the atypical presentation of painless occipital zoster mimicking atopic dermatitis, and the presence of hypoglycorrhachia in his cerebrospinal fluid. The clinical diagnosis of VZV meningitis poses significant diagnostic challenges, and nucleic acid tests for VZV detection are recommended for patients with severe cases who require empiric acyclovir treatment.

Patient's perspective

The symptoms of meningitis itself were not particularly painful. I had a high fever, but more than that, I had a bad back pain, which was a chronic complaint, and it was hard to fall asleep. There were no particular problems with the discharge.

Learning points

In young, healthy patients, herpes zoster rarely progresses to meningitis; however, herpes zoster virus is frequently the cause of aseptic meningitis.
Atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for herpes zoster and can be confused with atopic dermatitis rashes primarily when analgesics are used.
The clinical diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) meningitis is challenging, and in cases of aseptic meningitis requiring acyclovir treatment, it is highly recommended that a PCR nucleic acid amplification test for VZV be performed.
There is no established evidence for the treatment of VZV meningitis, particularly in immunocompetent individuals.

Question 3: What is a potential long-term treatment for this condition?
A. Acyclovir prophylaxis
B. Innervated skin flap
C. Intralesional corticosteroid injection
D. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
E. Local wound care

Answers:
A. Acyclovir prophylaxis – Incorrect. Acyclovir is helpful in the treatment and prevention of herpes outbreaks; however, post–herpes zoster TTS is the result of nerve injury not the infection itself.
B. Innervated skin flap – Correct. In addition to barrier protection and anticonvulsant medications, surgical management with an innervated skin flap offers the greatest chance of resolution. There are several case reports of regional skin flaps with their own blood and nerve supply showing promising results in the setting of TTS. This patient underwent surgical reconstruction of the defect using a rotational fasciocutaneous flap and a split-thickness autograft with subsequent wound vac placement to close the posterolateral scalp donor site (Figs 3 and 4). He has also required close monitoring and optimization of both gabapentin and carbamazepine and regular barrier protection. Of note, the most essential intervention for TTS is behavior modification.
C. Intralesional corticosteroid injection – Incorrect. The efficacy of intralesional corticosteroid in the treatment of trigeminal trophic syndrome has not been well studied.
D. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors – Incorrect. Abnormal psychological behaviors are common in patients with trigeminal trophic syndrome (eg, digital picking/mutilation); however, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors will not treat the neurologic symptoms or underlying pathology.
E. Local wound care – Incorrect. Wound care is not sufficient for the management of trigeminal trophic syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach should be used, involving optimization of neuropathic pain and possible surgical reconstruction, depending on the degree of self-inflicted trauma.

### Herpes zoster [^498cf026]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Primary care providers and hospitalists frequently encounter older or immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster accompanied by debilitating pain. Atypical presentations and zosteriform herpes simplex may present diagnostic challenges to clinicians. This article summarizes the background, evidence, and guidelines for the diagnosis, complications, treatment, and prevention of herpes zoster. Diagnosis of challenging cases relies on polymerase chain reaction as the preferred test. Treatment focuses on optimal use of antiviral therapy and analgesics. Prevention emphasizes utilization of a new recombinant zoster vaccine, which reduces the incidence of herpes zoster by more than 90% and is preferred to the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine.

### Persistent dilemmas in zoster eye disease [^b5e18a81]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is a common, vision and potentially life-threatening disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the distribution of the first division of cranial nerve V. Although the rate of herpes zoster increases with age, over half of the people with zoster in general, including HZO, are under age 60. In addition, over 90% of people with zoster are immunocompetent, even though the disease is more common and severe in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of zoster is increasing worldwide for unknown reasons. The epidemiology has not yet been impacted by the zoster vaccine (ZV). The lack of a strong recommendation by physicians for this vaccine is a major barrier to its use. An unresolved dilemma regards the optimum timing for this vaccine. In the USA, the current recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is for eligible people age 60 and older, despite its greater efficacy in reducing the incidence of disease and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for age 50–59. Although there is a consensus regarding use of acute high-dose oral antiviral treatment to reduce ocular complications, there is limited evidence for prolonged treatment. The rationale for a proposed randomised controlled trial (RCT) of suppressive antiviral treatment to reduce chronic eye disease and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) includes evidence that zoster is followed by chronic active VZV infection and similarities between HZO and herpes simplex virus (HSV) eye infection, where this treatment is effective and is the standard of care.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^0a471881]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The recognizable appearance and the dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster lesions usually enable a clinical diagnosis to be made easily. Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occur mainly in older patients. The role of the varicella vaccine in preventing herpes zoster is uncertain, but is being studied. There is evidence to support using antiviral therapy and possibly low-dose tricyclic antidepressants to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. There is good evidence that treating herpes zoster with antiviral medication is beneficial, particularly in patients older than 50 years with severe outbreaks. The use of steroids has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. In patients who develop postherpetic neuralgia, there is good evidence to support treatment with gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants. More evidence for treatment with capsaicin cream, lidocaine patch, and opioids is needed. Intrathecal methylprednisolone is an option for patients with persistent pain.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^4390da94]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) therapy in children with HIV — oral and IV acyclovir dosing and indications: Acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (800 mg maximum dose) administered 4 times per day for 7 days to 10 days is the oral treatment of choice for HZ in children with HIV, and initial IV administration of acyclovir is recommended for children with HIV with severe immunosuppression, extensive multidermatomal HZ, disseminated infection, visceral involvement, or otherwise complicated HZ and may also be considered for trigeminal nerve or scaral dermatomal involvement; IV acyclovir should be continued until cutaneous lesions and visceral disease are clearly resolving, after which oral administration can be considered to complete the course of therapy (10 days to 14 days in this situation), and doses of IV acyclovir for treating HZ are the same as those for treating varicella; additionally, in children with HIV, initial treatment of varicella with oral acyclovir should only be considered for patients considered mildly to moderately immune suppressed and who have mild varicella disease.

### Evaluation and management of herpes zoster ophthalmicus [^48168da1]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus occurs when the varicella-zoster virus is reactivated in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus represents up to one fourth of all cases of herpes zoster. Most patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus present with a periorbital vesicular rash distributed according to the affected dermatome. A minority of patients may also develop conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and ocular cranial-nerve palsies. Permanent sequelae of ophthalmic zoster infection may include chronic ocular inflammation, loss of vision, and debilitating pain. Antiviral medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famcidovir remain the mainstay of therapy and are most effective in preventing ocular involvement when begun within 72 hours after the onset of the rash. Timely diagnosis and management of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. with referral to an ophthalmologist when ophthalmic involvement is present, are critical in limiting visual morbidity.

### Herpes zoster on the face in the elderly [^af41bce5]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster is a localised disease caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that enters the cutaneous nerve endings during an earlier episode of chicken pox, travels to the dorsal root ganglia, and remains in latent form. The condition is characterised by occurrence of multiple, painful, unilateral vesicles and ulceration, and shows a typical single dermatome innervated by single dorsal root or cranial sensory ganglion. Involvement of three or more dermatomes is known as disseminated zoster and seen in immunocompromised individuals. Complications of herpes zoster include ocular sequelae, bacterial superinfection of the lesions, meningoencephalitis and postherpetic neuralgia. The incidence of herpes zoster increases with age and immunosuppression, therefore prompt management is necessary to avoid morbidity and mortality in these individuals. We present two case reports of herpes zoster, one involving the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve while the other involves all branches of the trigeminal nerve.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia now and in the future [^57e3d7af]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

### Peripheral stimulation for treatment of trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia and trigeminal posttraumatic neuropathic pain: a pilot study [^055c7b03]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) after facial trauma or herpes zoster infection is often refractory to treatment. Peripheral nerve stimulation has been used to treat occipital neuralgia; however, efficacy in controlling facial TNP or postherpetic neuralgia is unknown. A retrospective case series of patients who underwent subcutaneous placement of stimulating electrodes for treatment of V(1) or V(2) TNP secondary to herpetic infection or facial trauma is presented.

Methods

Ten patients received implanted subcutaneous pulse generators and quadripolar electrodes for peripheral stimulation of the trigeminal nerve supraorbital or infraorbital branches. Long-term treatment results were determined by retrospective review of medical records (1998–2003) and by independent observers interviewing patients using a standard questionnaire. Surgical complication rate, preoperative symptom duration, degree of pain relief, preoperative and postoperative work status, postoperative changes in medication usage, and overall degree of therapy satisfaction were assessed. Mean follow-up was 26.6 ± 4.7 months.

Results

Peripheral nerve stimulation provided at least 50% pain relief in 70% of patients with TNP or postherpetic neuralgia. Medication use declined in 70% of patients, and 80% indicated that they were mostly or completely satisfied with treatment overall. There were no treatment failures (< 50% pain relief and a lack of decrease in medication use) in the posttraumatic group, and two failures (50%) occurred in the postherpetic group. The complication rate requiring reoperation was 30%.

Conclusion

Peripheral nerve stimulation of the supraorbital or infraorbital branches of the trigeminal nerve is an effective method for relief of TNP after facial trauma or herpetic infection. A prospective trial using this novel approach to treat these disorders is thus warranted.

### Oral antivirals revisited in the treatment of herpes zoster: what do they accomplish? [^5db8907d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral antiviral agents currently represent the most important therapeutic keystone in the treatment of herpes zoster. Three oral antiviral agents are available for the treatment of herpes zoster: acyclovir, its derivative valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Meta-analysis of published data has shown that oral acyclovir significantly reduces various herpes zoster-related symptoms as well as the duration, intensity and prevalence of zoster-associated pain (ZAP). However, this drug does not influence postherpetic neuralgia. The newer agents famciclovir and valacyclovir exhibit a better oral bioavailability than acyclovir. These agents have demonstrated similar efficacy to acyclovir with ZAP and they require less frequent administration. When initiated within 72 hours, oral antiviral therapy of herpes zoster is beneficial in selected, elderly immunocompetent patients, reducing the duration and intensity of ZAP and providing more rapid skin lesion healing. Oral antivirals are also of benefit in immunocompromised patients with uncomplicated herpes zoster. However, signs of cutaneous and visceral dissemination should be monitored; if signs occur, intravenous antiviral therapy is indicated.

### Herpes zoster guideline of the German dermatology society (DDG) [^1139dfea]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), remains dormant in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia and can be reactivated as a consequence of declining VZV-specific cellular immunity leading to herpes zoster (shingles). Patients older than 50 years of age affected by herpes zoster may suffer a significant decrease of quality of life. These patients and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risks for severe complications, involving the eye, the peripheral and the central nervous system (prolonged pain, postherpetic neuralgia). Such complications occur with and without cutaneous symptoms. The German Dermatology Society (DDG) has released guidelines in order to guarantee updated management to anyone affected by herpes zoster. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. The gold standard of laboratory diagnosis comprises PCR and direct identification of VZV in cell cultures. Detection of IgM- and IgA-anti VZV antibodies may be helpful in immunocompromised patients. Therapy has become very effective in the last years. Systemic antiviral therapy is able to shorten the healing process of acute herpes zoster, to prevent or to alleviate pain and other acute and chronic complications, particularly, when given within 48 h to a maximum of 72 h after onset of the rash. Systemic antiviral therapy is urgently indicated in patients beyond the age of 50 years and in patients at any age with herpes zoster in the head and neck area, especially in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Further urgent indications are severe herpes zoster on the trunk and on the extremities, herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients and in patients with severe atopic dermatitis and severe ekzema. Only relative indications for antiviral therapy exist in patients younger than 50 years with zoster on the trunk and on the extremities. In Germany acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir and brivudin are approved for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster. These compounds are all well tolerated by the patients and do not differ with regard to efficacy and safety. Brivudin has a markedly higher anti-VZV potency than oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir and thus offers a simpler dosing regimen. It must be given only once daily during 7 days in comparison to three and five times dosing per day of valacyclovir, famciclovir and acyclovir, respectively. Brivudin is an antiviral agent with no nephrotoxic properties, which is an advantage when compared to acyclovir. The most important aim of therapy of herpes zoster is to achieve painlessness. Appropriately dosed analgesics in combination with a neuroactive agent (i.e. amitriptylin) are very helpful when given together with antiviral therapy. The additive therapy with corticosteroids may shorten the degree and duration of acute zoster pain, but has no essential effect on the development of postherpetic neuralgia, which is a very difficult condition to treat. Thus early presentation to a pain therapist is recommended in specific cases.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^a577dce0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Zoster vaccine recommendations and rationale — In the United States, the vaccine is licensed for use among persons aged ≥ 60 years, and routine vaccination of this population is recommended based on disease burden, treatment limitations, and clinical trial efficacy. Zoster causes substantial morbidity with approximately 1,000,000 new cases occurring annually, and antiviral treatment must be initiated within 72 hours of rash onset for maximum benefit, yet treatments for PHN often do not completely alleviate pain and might be poorly tolerated by older patients. Available evidence suggests the cost-effectiveness of zoster vaccine is within the range of some other public health interventions. In a large, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the vaccine reduced BOI attributed to zoster by 61.1%, reduced the incidence of PHN by 66.5%, and reduced the overall incidence of zoster by 51.3%, with greater efficacy in persons aged 60–69 years, substantial efficacy in persons aged ≥ 70 years, and prevention of PHN in older age groups.

### Postherpetic neuralgia [^092d24e8]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people under 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60–65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in more than 30% of those people aged over 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions, during an acute attack of herpes zoster, aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, topical anaesthesia (lidocaine), topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), topical counterirritants (capsaicin), tricyclic antidepressants.

### Varicella-zoster virus meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia, presenting with painless occipital herpes zoster mimicking atopic dermatitis [^c6ceaec4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient's fever resolved and his symptoms improved. After 5 days of intravenous acyclovir treatment, the patient was discharged with 5 days of oral valacyclovir 1000 mg three times per day.

10 days later, the patient visited our clinic for follow-up. His right occipital rash persisted, but was crusted (figure 1). The patient was designated as fully recovered and was fully discharged from our service.

The CSF PCR test results for HSV were negative. The residual volume of refrigerated CSF was used to perform VZV PCR, which detected VZV DNA at 11×10⁶ copies/mL, confirming the diagnosis of viral meningitis caused by VZV. Serum VZV antibodies were positive for both IgM and IgG, confirming the reactivation of VZV infection.

Herpes simplex encephalitis classically involves the periventricular white matter in infants and the mesial temporal lobes, inferior frontal lobes, and insula in older children and adults. However, the increasing use of polymerase chain reaction to detect viral DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid has allowed the expansion of the spectrum of radiologic findings possibly associated with herpes simplex encephalitis. This study presents a rare case of a previously healthy infant with herpes simplex encephalitis with occipital involvement and permanent visual impairment. Possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.

### Valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients [^dbd9aed2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus affects the eye and vision, and is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus in the distribution of the first division of the trigeminal nerve. An aggressive management of acute herpes zoster ophthalmicus with systemic antiviral medication is generally recommended as the standard first-line treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus infections. Both acyclovir and its prodrug valacyclovir are medications that are approved for the systemic treatment of herpes zoster. Although it is known that valacyclovir has an improved bioavailability and steadier plasma concentration, it is currently unclear as to whether this leads to better treatment results and less ocular complications.

Objectives

To assess the effects of valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S; January 1990 to June 2016), BIOSIS Previews (January 1969 to June 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 13 June 2016.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which systemic valacyclovir was compared to systemic acyclovir medication for treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, evaluated the risk of bias in included trials, and extracted and analysed data. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, as only one study was included. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the selected outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

One study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In this multicentre, randomised double-masked study carried out in France, 110 immunocompetent people with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, diagnosed within 72 hours of skin eruption, were treated, with 56 participants allocated to the valacyclovir group and 54 to the acyclovir group. The study was poorly reported and we judged it to be unclear risk of bias for most domains. Persistent ocular lesions after 6 months were observed in 2/56 people in the valacyclovir group compared with 1/54 people in the acyclovir group (risk ratio (RR) 1.93 (95% CI 0.18 to 20.65); very low certainty evidence. Dendritic ulcer appeared in 3/56 patients treated with valacyclovir, while 1/54 suffered in the acyclovir group (RR 2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 26.96); very low certainty evidence), uveitis in 7/56 people in the valacyclovir group compared with 9/54 in the acyclovir group (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.57); very low certainty evidence). Similarly, there was uncertainty as to the comparative effects of these two treatments on post-herpetic pain, and side effects (vomiting, eyelid or facial edema, disseminated zoster). Due to concerns about imprecision (small number of events and large confidence intervals) and study limitations, the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach was rated as low to very low for the use of valacyclovir compared to acyclovir.

Authors' Conclusions

This review included data from only one study, which had methodological limitations. As such, our results indicated uncertainty of the relative benefits and harms of valacyclovir over acyclovir in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, despite its widespread use for this condition. Further well-designed and adequately powered trials are needed. These trials should include outcomes important to patients, including compliance.

### Varicella-zoster virus meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia, presenting with painless occipital herpes zoster mimicking atopic dermatitis [^54c7b2e9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a young man in his 20s who presented with fever and back pain as his chief complaints. He had developed chills 4 days prior to visiting our clinic. The next day, he experienced a headache and a fever of 38.7℃, prompting a visit to a local clinic, where he was prescribed antipyretic analgesics. Despite this treatment, his fever persisted, and he began experiencing vomiting. A nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed, with negative results. He was then prescribed cefditoren pivoxil, but his symptoms did not improve.

The patient's atopic dermatitis and pre-existing back pain worsened, making it difficult for him to sleep while lying down. His mother reported a significant worsening of his atopic dermatitis, with a severe occipital rash — the worst she had ever seen. He was subsequently referred to our clinic for further evaluation.

The patient's medical history included atopic dermatitis and lumbar disk hernia. He had been on a daily regimen of 600 mg pregabalin and 60 mg duloxetine for back pain, as well as topical steroids for his dermatitis. There was no reported contact with individuals or animals displaying similar symptoms, nor had he engaged in sexual activity in the preceding weeks. He had no family history of tuberculosis. The patient had received a varicella vaccine during childhood and had no history of varicella or shingles.

On arrival, his vital signs were:

Blood pressure: 117/83 mm Hg.
Heart rate: 88 beats per min.
Respiratory rate: < 20 breaths per min.
Body temperature: 37.5℃.
SpO ₂: 97% on ambient air.

Although his general appearance was sickly, he had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15, and his cognition was clear.

Physical examination

The patient had a painless rash on the right side of the occipital region (figure 1). Atopic dermatitis was also present on his back and lower legs. He exhibited no nuchal rigidity or jolt accentuation of the neck. Spontaneous back pain consistent with lumbar herniation was noted, but there was no spinal tapping pain. He was oriented to date, location and memory, and no unusual neurological abnormalities were observed.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^1178db9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, serious, painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties, and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008, and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers (June 2022). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages, with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified potential articles, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and the certainty of the evidence. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors. We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified five trials with a total of 787 participants that met our inclusion criteria. No new studies were identified for this update. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection in preventing postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.99; 2 trials, 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)). The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because they did not provide separate information on the number of participants with PHN at six months. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no observed differences in serious (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.29; 5 trials, 755 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)), or non-serious adverse events (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.87; 5 trials, 755 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision)) between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, two were at unclear risk of bias, and the other was at low risk of bias. The review was first published in 2008; no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010, 2013, and 2023.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current available evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection on preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Corticosteroids given orally or intramuscularly may result in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events in people with acute herpes zoster. Some researchers have recommended using corticosteroids to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of the disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life, as well as updated measures of pain.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^613cc551]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common serious complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Strategy

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2010), LILACS (January 1982 to February 2010), the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2010) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2010). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data and assessed quality of each trial independently. Disagreement was resolved by discussion with other co-authors.

Main Results

Five trials were included with 787 participants in total. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group studies. No new trials were identified in the 2010 update. In the updated version we conducted a meta-analysis of two trials, and the results showed that oral corticosteroids did not prevent postherpetic neuralgia six months after the herpes onset (RR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99). The three other included trials also had similar results although their data could not be included in the meta-analysis. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroids and placebo groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration do not appear to be great. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease; if further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.

### Altered EEG brain networks in patients with acute peripheral herpes zoster [^92374bee]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study confirmed that the altered brain networks exist in resting-state EEG data of patients with acute HZ. The changes of EEG brain networks in HZ patients are characterized by decreased global efficiency and local efficiency in beta band. Moreover, the spontaneous oscillation of some brain regions involving pain management and the connectivity of default mode network changed in HZ patients. Our study provided better understanding the mechanisms of HZ from electrophysiological view, and led to converging evidence for treatment of HZ with neural regulation in future.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) management — herpes zoster (HZ) and varicella in children with HIV: Acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (800 mg maximum dose) administered 4 times per day for 7 days to 10 days is the oral treatment of choice for HZ in children with HIV, but initial IV administration of acyclovir is recommended for severe immunosuppression, extensive multidermatomal HZ, disseminated infection, visceral involvement, or otherwise complicated HZ and may also be considered for trigeminal nerve or sacral dermatomal involvement; IV acyclovir should be continued until cutaneous lesions and visceral disease are clearly resolving, after which oral administration can be considered to complete the course of therapy (10 days to 14 days in this situation), and doses of IV acyclovir for treating HZ are the same as those for treating varicella; for varicella specifically, initial treatment with oral acyclovir should only be considered for patients considered mildly to moderately immune suppressed and who have mild varicella disease.

### Postherpetic neuralgia [^00cc3800]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there is some variability (depending on the definition of postherpetic neuralgia), about 10% of those with zoster will have persisting pain 1 month after the rash. The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people aged < 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60 to 65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in > 30% of those people aged > 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions aimed at preventing herpes zoster and subsequent postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions during an acute attack of herpes zoster aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 41 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, capsaicin, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, herpes zoster vaccine, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, lidocaine, topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), and tricyclic antidepressants.

### Postherpetic neuralgia: what do we know and where are we heading? [^2690af9c]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) remains a difficult pain problem for patients and physicians alike. This review describes the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PHN and discusses proposed mechanisms of pain generation and the various treatments currently available. Evidence is scant for the value of surgical and procedural interventions in general, although there are numerous small studies supporting the use of specific interventions such as nerve blocks, neurosurgical procedures and neuroaugmentation. Medical interventions, particularly the use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants remain the best-documented therapies for treating pain associated with PHN. There is good evidence that amitriptyline and gabapentin reduce pain with PHN. Topical local anesthetics, such a lidocaine, may also be helpful. The decision to use a particular agent or intervention may depend on whether there is spontaneous pain, burning or lancinating pain or numbness. Interventions with low risk, such as TENS are appropriate. Although prevention of postherpetic neuralgia appears to be an appropriate strategy, there is little evidence to support the position that medical or interventional approaches (nerve blocks) will prevent PHN after a patient develops acute herpes zoster (HZ). Although antivirals are appropriate for acute HZ, and the use of neural blockade and sympathetic blockade may be helpful in reducing pain in selected patients with HZ, there is little evidence that these interventions will reduce the likelihood of developing PHN.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^3b049968]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) — preferred therapy for acute localized dermatomal disease is valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII) or famciclovir 500 mg three times a day (AII) for 7–10 days, with consideration of longer duration if lesions are slow to resolve. For extensive cutaneous lesion or visceral involvement, preferred therapy is acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours until clinical improvement is evident (AII), with a switch to PO therapy (valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir) after clinical improvement to complete a 10- to 14-day course (BIII). In patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus who have stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis, topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation may be necessary, and the role of ART has not been established in these cases.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^9b1e7f93]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster — initial antiviral therapy in people with HIV should be instituted as soon as possible for all people with HIV with herpes zoster diagnosed within 1 week of rash onset, and recommended oral options for acute localized dermatomal disease are valacyclovir (AII), famciclovir (AII), or acyclovir (BII) for 7 to 10 days with longer durations considered if lesions resolve slowly; if cutaneous lesions are extensive or if visceral involvement is suspected, IV acyclovir should be initiated and continued until clinical improvement is evident (AIII), with a switch to oral antiviral therapy to complete a 10- to 14-day treatment course reasonable when new lesions have ceased and visceral signs and symptoms are improving (BIII); adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is not recommended because no data support its benefit in this population (AIII).

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^b876ed7d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Trigeminal ganglion electrical stimulation for trigeminal nerve postherpetic neuralgia: a retrospective study [^e4b8f0fa]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The objective of treating trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (TPHN) is to effectively control pain as early as possible, alleviate associated sleep and emotional disorders, and thus improve quality of life. PNS is a minimally invasive treatment for treating refractory trigeminal neuralgia. The technique involves placing a stimulating electrode (typically a spinal cord stimulation electrode) at the oval foramen to directly stimulate the trigeminal ganglion and nerve. In a recent case report by Lin et al, a novel treatment approach was proposed for elderly individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia resulting from herpes zoster. The implementation of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) resulted in significant pain relief and overall improvement among patients with postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia (TPHN). This electrical stimulation technique has been successfully used in the treatment of HZ-related trigeminal neuralgia. However, clinical studies of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the trigeminal nerve region were currently limited, with only a few small-sample clinical studies and case reports available. These studies demonstrated the potential use of PNS for treating trigeminal neuralgia caused by postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), particularly in patients with involvement of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. However, there were few reports regarding the involvement of the second and third branches. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of electrical stimulation at the trigeminal nerve's semilunar junction in treating postherpetic neuralgia involving the 2nd and 3rd trigeminal nerve branches; with the goal of offering an alternative and potentially effective treatment approach for this painful condition.

Figure 4
Number needed to treat with common pain therapies to obtain 50% pain relief in one patient. Data highlight the limited relief from pain obtained in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). For some treatments, approximately four patients with PHN need to be treated to achieve 50% pain relief in one patient.

As patients with PHN may find it difficult to tolerate pain therapies, drug doses are often titrated. This may result in several weeks of suboptimal treatment, during which it is unclear if (or when) the drugs will become effective. Therapeutic compliance is also difficult to achieve. Almost 50% of patients with PHN do not discuss their symptoms regularly with physicians. One in 10 is troubled substantially by the side-effects of PHN treatments.

Treatment dissatisfaction is high in patients with PHN. In one study, only 14% of patients aged > 65 years were satisfied with pain medication for PHN. In the survey by Weinke et al. patient-reported satisfaction with HZ treatments was significantly lower in patients with PHN versus those with HZ (6.8 versus 8.3; scale from 0, 'not satisfied' to 10, 'very satisfied').

### Antiviral treatment for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^8bb2890a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful and refractory complication of herpes zoster. Treatments are either partially or totally ineffective for many people with PHN. Antiviral agents, used at the time of the rash, have been proposed as an intervention to prevent the development of PHN. This is the first update since the first publication of the review in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antiviral agents in preventing PHN.

Search Methods

On 26 April 2013, we updated the searches in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System. We checked the references of published studies to identify additional trials, and contacted authors to obtain additional data. We searched other databases in The Cochrane Library for information for the Discussion and two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antiviral treatment given within 72 hours after the onset of herpes zoster for preventing PHN. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, evaluated the risk of bias in included trials, and extracted and analysed data.

Main Results

Six RCTs with a total of 1211 participants were eligible; five trials evaluated oral aciclovir, and one, with 419 participants, evaluated oral famciclovir. We were able to conduct meta-analyses as there were sufficient similarities in the included studies, such as the reporting of the presence of PHN, duration of rash before treatment initiation and treatment regimen. For our primary outcome, based on three trials (609 participants) we found no significant difference between the aciclovir and control groups in the incidence of PHN four months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.11), nor was there a significant difference at six months (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27, two trials, 476 participants). In four of the trials (692 participants), there was some evidence for a reduction in the incidence of pain four weeks after the onset of rash. In the trial of famciclovir versus placebo, neither 500 mg nor 750 mg doses of famciclovir reduced the incidence of herpetic neuralgia significantly. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headache for aciclovir, and headache and nausea for famciclovir. For neither treatment was the incidence of adverse events significantly different from placebo. None of the studies were at high risk of bias, although the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain for all but one study. We found no new RCTs when we updated the searches in April 2013.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high quality evidence that oral aciclovir does not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other antiviral treatments; therefore, further well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate famciclovir or other new antiviral agents in preventing PHN. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.

### Safety and efficacy of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency combined with steroid and ozone injection-treated cervical 3–8 herpes zoster neuralgia using a posterior and upper quarter of the cervical foramina puncture approach [^a66d465e]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster neuralgia has a considerable impact on people's quality of life, especially after the development of postherpetic neuralgia. There are many clinical reports on the treatment of herpes zoster neuralgia, but there have been no special reports on the treatment of herpes zoster involving the neck. Our research focuses on a posterior and upper quarter of the cervical foramina puncture approach for herpes zoster involving the cervical 3–8 (C3-8) nerve region and to consider the safety and efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency combined with steroid injection and ozone injection in this puncture path under CT guidance.

Materials and Methods

A total of 104 patients with herpes zoster neuralgia involved in the cervical 3–8 nerve region use a posterior and upper quarter of the cervical foramina puncture approach received pulsed radiofrequency combined with steroid and ozone injection to the dorsal root ganglion. The total number of injection procedures, complications, NRS collection (preprocedure, postprocedure at once, two, four and 12 weeks) and drug dose decreases were documented.

Results

During a total of 257 procedures, 254 procedures successfully completed PRF (3 cases failed to reach the C8 aim points), and the rate of puncture failure was 1.17%. Drug injection was successfully performed in 252 procedures (the injection success rate was 99.21%); the NRSs (preprocedure, postprocedure at once, two, four and twelve weeks) were 5.75 ± 0.682, 2.6 ± 1.023, 2.21 ± 0.925, 1.89 ± 1.162, and 1.43 ± 1.369, and the difference among them was statistically significant. Drug dosages decreased before and after operation and showed statistically significant differences.

Conclusion

Pulsed radiofrequency combined with steroid and ozone injection for herpes zoster neuralgia involving the C3-8 nerves under CT guidance through a posterior superior quarter approach showed safety and efficacy and had a high success rate, and the NRS decreased significantly.

### Antiviral treatment in schizophrenia: a randomized pilot PET study on the effects of valaciclovir on neuroinflammation [^0203ca8f]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Following valaciclovir treatment we found reduction in TSPO binding for all brain regions included, which could suggest a global presence of actively replicating herpes viruses, an unknown effect of valaciclovir on TSPO binding or natural variation in neuroinflammation. We found an effect in all tested brain regions, without any clinical effects, which could be an argument for natural variation. TSPO binding was increased in the post-treatment scan, when compared to the pre-treatment scan, in the placebo group. Although this was not statistically significant, it suggests that TSPO binding varies over time. The parietal and occipital cortex that showed a reduced BP ND after valaciclovir treatment, have been found to be involved in focal extended herpes simplex encephalitis (Fernandes et al.). Additionally, in a postmortem study focusing on brains of individuals who died from non-neurological causes, HSV genomic sequences were detected in the medulla, olfactory bulbus, pons, gyrus rectus, amygdala and hippocampus (Baringer & Pisani). The involvement of other brain regions than the hippocampus is therefore in line with findings in herpes simplex encephalitis and the presence of herpes viruses in the brain without clinical features. Earlier studies in Alzheimer's disease found that mild HSV-1 infections could be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease, and importantly suggest that a mild, asymptomatic form of herpes infection across the brain exists, affecting cognitive functioning (Marcocci et al.). Schizophrenia patients have been found to have a higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (Cai & Huang).

Drug injection was successfully performed in 252 procedures (the injection success rate was 99.21%); the NRSs (preprocedure, postprocedure at once, two, four and twelve weeks) were 5.75 ± 0.682, 2.6 ± 1.023, 2.21 ± 0.925, 1.89 ± 1.162, and 1.43 ± 1.369, and the difference among them was statistically significant. Drug dosages decreased before and after operation and showed statistically significant differences.

Conclusion

Pulsed radiofrequency combined with steroid and ozone injection for herpes zoster neuralgia involving the C3-8 nerves under CT guidance through a posterior superior quarter approach showed safety and efficacy and had a high success rate, and the NRS decreased significantly.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^441577f5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster — antiviral management in patients with HIV states that antiviral therapy should be initiated as soon as possible for all patients with HIV with herpes zoster diagnosed within 1 week of rash onset (or any time prior to full crusting of lesions). For acute localized dermatomal disease, oral valacyclovir (AII), famciclovir (AII), or acyclovir (BII) (doses as above) are used for 7 to 10 days, with longer duration considered when lesions resolve slowly, and valacyclovir or famciclovir are preferred. If cutaneous lesions are extensive or if visceral involvement is suspected, IV acyclovir should be initiated and continued until clinical improvement is evident (AII); a switch to oral therapy to complete a 10- to 14-day course is reasonable when new lesions have ceased and signs and symptoms of visceral VZV infection are improving (BIII). Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for herpes zoster in people with HIV is not recommended because there is no data supporting its benefit (AIII).

### Hemorrhagic herpes zoster with contralateral multidermatomal distribution associated with rivaroxaban: an unusual presentation [^96358fda]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 90-year-old man presented with painful purpuric and bullous lesions of the left occipital, parietal, and temporal scalp (Fig 1), as well as non-hemorrhagic painful vesicles of the left neck (Fig 2) and mixed hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic vesicles of the right knee (Fig 3), all of 5 days duration.

Fig 1
Purpuric herpes zoster lesions were visible on the left occipital, parietal, and temporal scalp along the C2 and V3 dermatomes.

Fig 2
Herpes zoster lesions were visible in the C3 dermatome on the left lower aspect of the neck.

Fig 3
Purpuric and typical vesicular herpes zoster lesions were visible in the L3 dermatome on the medial aspect of the right knee.

Recent history was significant for excision with clear margins of an atypical fibroxanthoma of the vertex of the scalp 6 months prior to the onset of the eruption, followed by adjunctive radiation, which was completed 2 months prior to the onset of the eruption. Radiation of a total dose of 60 Gy was completed on July 9, with zoster developing on September 7.

Medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, which developed after the atypical fibroxanthoma excision, necessitating the initiation of rivaroxaban for anticoagulation. The patient denied any recent history of fever, chills, abdominal pain, neurologic deficits, recent weight loss, and cough. His only medications were rivaroxaban and bimatoprost ophthalmic drops. Complete blood counts, hepatic profile, and electrolytes were within normal limits.

With the classic features of dermatomal pain and vesicles of recent onset, a clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster was made. Due to the atypical nature of the eruption, with the purpuric and nodular appearance of the scalp lesions and the presence of the lesions in multiple distant dermatomes, confirmatory biopsies of the scalp, neck, and knee lesions were performed.

He commenced valacyclovir 1 g 3 times per day for 7 days, gabapentin, and prednisone 40 mg daily on September 10, beginning a 12-day taper on September 14, which was completed on the September 26. The gabapentin was discontinued after one dose of 300 mg due to sedation, but the patient remained on valacyclovir and prednisone. The anticoagulant was not held during treatment. Seven days after clinic visit he was pain-free and most of the bullae had crusted over. The patient was totally healed by September 22, 17 days from onset of eruption and 12 days from initial clinic visit.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^7fb7808b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common, serious painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008 and previously updated in 2010.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (16 April 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to April 2012), and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2012). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo but not with other treatments. We did not include quasi-RCTs (trials in which a systematic method of randomisation such as alternation or hospital number was used).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors.

Main Results

Five trials were included with 787 participants in total. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of two trials (114 participants) and the results gave moderate quality evidence that oral corticosteroids did not prevent postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99). One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, the other was at low risk of bias overall. The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because the outcomes were reported at less than one month or not in sufficient detail to add to the meta-analysis. These three trials were generally at low risk of bias. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. There was also no significant difference between the treatment groups and placebo groups in other secondary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses. The review was first published in 2008 and no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010 and 2012.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f7614ea9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster pain burden, predictors of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and quality-of-life impact: Approximately half of patients with zoster or PHN describe their pain as "horrible" or "excruciating", ranging in duration from a few minutes to constant on a daily or almost daily basis. The pain can disrupt sleep, mood, work, and activities of daily living, adversely impacting the quality of life and leading to social withdrawal and depression, and anecdotes of suicide among patients suffering from PHN have been reported. Among persons experiencing zoster, predictors of PHN include the occurrence and severity of pain both before and after onset of the rash, the extent of the rash, trigeminal or ophthalmic distribution, and the occurrence of viremia. Table 1 highlights physical, psychological, social, and functional impacts, including "Interferes with activities of daily living (e.g., dressing, bathing, eating, travel, cooking, and shopping)".

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f1446488]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged ≥ 60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity.

1 BACKGROUND

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles. 1

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. 2, 3 The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal; however, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster‐associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. 4, 5

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ‐related burden of illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. 10 Current interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti‐epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. 8 This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning. 11

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine has reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN, 12 a large percentage (∼90% in the US) of the at‐risk population does not receive the vaccine. 13 About half of people, 60 years of age or older who have had the shingles vaccine, fail to respond (eg, primary failure meaning they failed to seroconvert after vaccination) and may go on to develop HZ. 12, 14 In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to decline over time (eg, secondary vaccine failure). 15, 16

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^8325338b]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To be effective, antiviral agents must be administered within 72 h of acute-symptom onset, which may be difficult because of delays in patients seeking medical advice and delays in reaching diagnosis (for example, due to presentation of unusual symptoms). Often, viral activity and neuronal damage have been ongoing for several days before appropriate treatment is given. Even with prompt treatment, antiviral treatment does not prevent all cases of PHN. A recent Cochrane Review demonstrated that oral acyclovir does not significantly reduce PHN incidence. The Cochrane review highlighted that there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine if other antiviral agents prevent PHN and if these treatments have a beneficial impact on QoL. Twenty studies of antiviral treatment for acute HZ were identified, but 14 were excluded from the Cochrane review, mainly because of limitations with the study design.

A recent Canadian study of patients with HZ rash or pain showed that pain resolution is associated with recovery of QoL to a pre-morbid state (personal communication). Data showed that the median duration of pain was equal to the median duration of QoL impairment. Once established, the pain associated with HZ or PHN is difficult to treat. PHN remains largely refractory to pharmacological treatments and prevention strategies. Data show that > 50% of patients require more than one prescription drug for PHN. Despite treatment, symptomatic relief is obtained in only 50% of patients. Patients with PHN experience significantly less pain relief than those with HZ, despite receiving more pain medications (mean, 2.2 versus 1.6). Studies have assessed the 'number needed to treat' for existing PHN therapies (how many patients need to be treated n order to achieve at least 50% pain relief in one patient compared with the controls). Data highlight the limited pain relief obtained in PHN patients. For some standard treatments, approximately four patients with PHN need to be treated in order to achieve pain relief in one patient (Figure 4).

### Herpes zoster antivirals and pain management [^fc4449d1]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Topic

Evaluation of evidence-based strategies for managing herpes zoster (HZ) and the pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Clinical Relevance

Approximately 20% of the world's population suffers from herpes zoster at least once in a lifetime, with 10% to 20% having ophthalmic involvement. Treatment of the acute disease with oral antivirals may reduce the incidence and severity of complications but does not reliably prevent PHN or postherpetic itch (PHI). The acute pain abates as the acute phase resolves; the long-term pain of PHN or PHI may be severe and difficult to manage. Although many therapeutic agents have efficacy in the management of these complications, relief is frequently partial for months to the remainder of the lifetime.

Methods

Literature review was performed using the resources of the Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Ophthalmic library as well as the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health PubMed service searching by pertinent topics, authors, and journals.

Results

If started within 72 hours of the onset of the acute HZ rash, the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir significantly shorten the periods of acute pain, virus shedding, rash, acute and late-onset anterior segment complications, and, in the case of valacyclovir and famciclovir, the incidence and severity of PHN. However, these medications do not prevent PHN, which remains a common and debilitating complication of HZ in older patients, requiring assiduous pain management. Tricyclic antidepressants, antiseizure drugs, opioids, and topical analgesics all offer some pain relief, and may be combined.

Conclusion

Options are available to manage HZ and reduce the pain of PHN. However, prevention, now possible with the HZ vaccine, is preferable to treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^8cff8938]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) disease — primary varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster therapy indicates that for uncomplicated primary varicella, initiate as soon as possible after symptom onset and continue for 5–7 days with valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII) or famciclovir 500 mg PO three times a day (AII); for severe or complicated cases, use acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days (AIII), with the option to switch to oral valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir after defervescence if no evidence of visceral involvement (BIII). Alternative therapy for uncomplicated chickenpox is acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII) for 5–7 days. For herpes zoster (shingles) acute localized dermatomal disease, treat for 7–10 days and consider longer duration if lesions are slow to resolve, with acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII). In managing ocular disease, consultation with an ophthalmologist experienced in VZV retinitis is strongly recommended; duration of therapy for VZV retinitis is not well defined and should be determined based on clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses and ophthalmologic responses; optimization of ART is recommended for severe and difficult-to-treat VZV infections (e.g., retinitis, encephalitis) (AIII).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^0d21bb26]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Zoster — treatment in children with and exposed to HIV includes the following regimens and considerations: For children with uncomplicated zoster and no or moderate immune suppression, acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight/dose (maximum 800 mg/dose) by mouth four times a day for 7–10 days. For children with severe immunosuppression (CDC Immunologic Category 3), trigeminal or sacral nerve involvement, extensive multidermatomal, or disseminated zoster, acyclovir 10 mg/kg body weight/dose or 500 mg/m² IV every 8 hours until cutaneous lesions and visceral disease are clearly resolving, then can switch to oral acyclovir to complete a 10–14-day course. For children with progressive outer retinal necrosis, acyclovir (10 mg/kg or 500 mg/m² every 8 hours) or ganciclovir 5 mg/kg body weight/dose IV every 12 hours, plus foscarnet 90 mg/kg body weight/dose IV every 12 hours, plus. In adults and adolescents with zoster, famciclovir is approved at 500 mg/dose by mouth three times a day for 7 days; a sprinkle formulation of famciclovir is available for children who are unable to swallow the available pill formulation, and a schedule for weight-adjusted dosing is available to inform dosing of small children. Involvement of an ophthalmologist with experience in managing HZ ophthalmicus and its complications in children is strongly recommended when ocular involvement is evident, and optimal management of progressive outer retinal necrosis has not been defined.

The girl was treated with intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg three times a day. During the first day of antiviral therapy her clinical conditions rapidly improved and the following day she was well oriented, smiling and quiet, not remembering the events of the days before. Her headache disappeared completely after two days. After 2 weeks of treatment, she was dismissed with oral acyclovir to be continued for 2 weeks more.

EEG was performed again after 3 and 12 days from the onset of encephalitis, showing progressive improvement of cortical activity, but a persistent slow focal activity in the right temporal region was registered. Magnetic resonance was performed after 2 days from the diagnosis of encephalitis and one month after the discharge and was unremarkable in both cases. Lumbar puncture was performed again after 14 days of therapy: protein concentration and glucose level were in normal range, a mild leukocytosis was still present (40 white cells/µL, with 93% of lymphocytes). PCR for VZV at that time was negative.

### Risk of stroke following herpes zoster: a self-controlled case-series study [^52b802f4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The key study finding was that acute zoster is associated with an increased risk of stroke in the first 6 months following zoster. Risk of incident stroke following zoster was higher for individuals with herpes zoster ophthalmicus or other zoster in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Results also indicated that the use of oral antiviral therapy to treat acute zoster was associated with a less marked increase in incident strokes following zoster exposure. These findings from a large population-based data source provide important insights into the temporality and magnitude of stroke risk increase following zoster.

Two previous cohort studies from Taiwan reported a 30% increased risk of stroke in the year following zoster with a > 4-fold increased risk following herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Neither study adequately addressed key confounders, for example, BMI and atrial fibrillation. In addition, these studies did not assess the timing of increased risk following acute zoster. A recent Danish registry cohort study identified increased stroke risks in the first year following zoster, particularly within 2 weeks of diagnosis. However, that study had important limitations, including using antiviral treatment as a proxy for zoster diagnoses and inadequate control for confounding. Hence, the study assessed the effect of treated zoster on stroke; also, the exposed group would include off-label prescribing for herpes simplex virus whereas the unexposed group would include untreated individuals with zoster. A UK cohort study reported increased risks of TIA and of stroke in adults of all ages and in those aged 18–40 years, respectively, during up to 24 years of follow-up following zoster. This study used a cohort design, and the results could be prone to residual confounding due to between-person differences. Additionally, the research question focused on long-term rather than acute effects of zoster on stroke. Our study has shown a significantly increased risk of stroke following zoster, in particular for zoster in the trigeminal nerve distribution. Use of the SCCS method is a unique approach; its major advantage for this study question is that fixed confounders are implicitly controlled for, as analyses are within-person. Our findings have demonstrated that the first 3 months postzoster is the key period of increased risk, with resolution over the subsequent 3 months.

Recommended treatment

Regarding treatment, 81% of responses stated that rapid administration of antibiotics is necessary. The correct choice of empirical antibiotic treatment, consisting of a third-generation cephalosporin with ampicillin (alternatives: amoxicillin, penicillin G) with or without vancomycin, was provided in 38%, and of those, almost 90% with correct dosing. Another 29% provided an incomplete choice of antibiotic treatment and 33% declined to comment on any choice of antibiotics. In 33% of the sessions, antiviral treatment was considered with approximately half of them providing correct dosing. Dexamethasone administration was recommended in 24% of all responses.

Varicella-zoster virus diseases — clinical manifestations in adults with HIV: Varicella rash evolves rapidly during the initial 8 to 12 hours after onset, with new vesicle formation continuing for 2 to 4 days. Herpes zoster presents as a painful dermatomal eruption; the most common sites are thoracic dermatomes (40% to 50% of cases), followed by cranial nerve (20% to 25%), cervical (15% to 20%), lumbar (15%), and sacral (5%) dermatomes. In zoster, new vesicle formation typically continues for 3 to 5 days and crusts typically persist for 2 to 3 weeks. About 20% to 30% of people with HIV have one or more subsequent episodes of herpes zoster; the probability of a recurrence within 1 year is approximately 10%. Approximately 10% to 15% of people with HIV report post-herpetic neuralgia as a complication following herpes zoster.

Introduction

Herpes zoster is a painful rash caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in spinal and cranial nerve ganglia. This reactivation occurs when immunity to VZV declines because of aging or immunosuppression. 1, 2, 3 Typical clinical symptoms are pain and burning, followed by a rash, which usually crops vesicles on an erythematous base. The rash turns into clusters of blisters, which fill with fluid and then crust over. New lesion formation usually stops within 3–7 days. However, one of the most common and debilitating sequelae of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined as pain persisting more than 3 months after onset of symptom. 4 Herpes zoster is estimated to occur at lifetime risk levels of approximately 30% in the general population and more than 50% in those of more than 85 years of age. 5, 6 In Japan, herpes zoster is one of the 20 most common dermatological disorders among 85 categories. 7 The incidences of herpes zoster and PHN in Japanese adults increase with age, and the rates are 10.9 and 2.1 per 1000 person‐years in those aged 50 years or older, respectively. 8

The mainstay antiviral therapy for VZV infections over the past several decades is synthetic nucleoside compounds, such as aciclovir (ACV) and penciclovir, and their corresponding prodrugs valaciclovir and famciclovir. 2, 9 These compounds require phosphorylation by a herpes virus‐specified thymidine kinase (TK) and then by host cellular kinases to form biologically active nucleotide triphosphates, which selectively inhibit viral DNA polymerase and terminate the growing viral DNA chain. 10 A mutation in the TK gene is the main cause of resistance to these anti‐herpes nucleoside analogs. 11, 12 Although ACV‐resistant VZV is considered much less common than ACV‐resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV), 13, 14 treating immunosuppressed patients, mainly those who have received prolonged ACV therapy, is an emerging concern. 15 Therefore, there remains a clear medical need to develop novel antiviral agents with an alternative mechanism of action. Much attention has been paid to inhibitors of helicase–primase as a target of antiviral agents. 16, 17, 18 The herpes virus helicase–primase, one of the essential proteins for virus replication, is a heterotrimeric protein complex that possesses multiple enzymatic activities, including DNA helicase, ssDNA‐dependent ATPase and primase, all of which are essential for viral DNA replication and growth. 19, 20

### Famciclovir for ophthalmic zoster: a randomised aciclovir controlled study [^6c26a132]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the efficacy and safety of famciclovir with aciclovir for the treatment of ophthalmic zoster.

Methods

Randomised, double masked, aciclovir controlled, parallel group in 87 centres worldwide including 454 patients with ophthalmic zoster of trigeminal nerve (V(1)) comprised the intent to treat population. Oral famciclovir 500 mg three times daily or oral aciclovir 800 mg five times daily for 7 days. Assessments included day 0 (screening), days 3 and 7 (during treatment), days 10, 14, 21, 28 and monthly thereafter, up to 6 months (follow up). Proportion of patients who experienced ocular manifestations, severe manifestations and non-severe manifestations; loss of visual acuity was the main outcome measure.

Results

The percentage of patients who experienced one or more ocular manifestations was similar for famciclovir (142/245, 58.0%) and aciclovir (114/196, 58.2%) recipients, with no significant difference between groups (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.68, 1.45). The percentage of patients who experienced severe and non-severe manifestations was similar between groups, with no significant difference. The prevalence of individual ocular manifestations was comparable between groups. There was no significant difference between groups for visual acuity loss.

Conclusion

Famciclovir 500 mg three times daily was well tolerated and demonstrated efficacy similar to aciclovir 800 mg five times daily.
