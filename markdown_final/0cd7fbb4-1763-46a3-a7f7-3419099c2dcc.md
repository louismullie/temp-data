## Question

How should a urinary tract infection be treated in hospitalized patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a urinary tract infection should be treated in hospitalized patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about differentiating true infection from asymptomatic bacteriuria and getting the right specimens before antibiotics. Then, I should classify infection type and severity because that drives empiric therapy. Next, I will select empiric antibiotics tailored to severity, local epidemiology, and patient risks, followed by source control. After that, I need to determine duration, plan stewardship and de-escalation at 48–72 hours, address special populations, and close with prevention strategies and a concise synthesis of the clinical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm true infection versus asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treating bacteriuria without symptoms causes harm and drives resistance, and pyuria alone is not an indication for antibiotics in catheterized or noncatheterized inpatients, which I should double-check against IDSA guidance to avoid premature treatment decisions [^1112yxbn] [^116RiYrc]. I need to ensure urine is collected before antibiotics and, in catheterized patients, from a freshly replaced catheter if the device has been in place longer than two weeks, because that reduces contamination and improves diagnostic yield [^116gHYk5] [^1141TKM5]. For CAUTI, I should confirm compatible symptoms without another source plus growth of at least 10³ CFU/mL; for CA-ASB, the threshold is at least 10⁵ CFU/mL in the absence of symptoms, and I must resist treating pyuria accompanying CA-ASB, which is common and misleading [^117CdBiz] [^115owYCb] [^115m8mLR]. Hold on, I should also consider that reporting colony counts below 10⁵ CFU/mL in hospitalized patients can promote overtreatment of non–clinically significant bacteriuria, so I will interpret low-count positives cautiously and correlate strictly with symptoms [^116A5Pq6]. Finally, dipsticks add little in acutely hospitalized adults and can mislead when ASB prevalence is high, so clinical assessment plus culture from proper specimens remains foundational [^116cdMGw].

> Next, I should classify infection type and severity, because this directs both spectrum and route of therapy. Let me think about the hierarchy: most hospitalized UTIs are complicated by definition; acute pyelonephritis is suggested by systemic features; CAUTI applies when an indwelling device is present or recently removed; and urosepsis requires urgent recognition using Sepsis-3 with SOFA increase of at least 2 or a positive qSOFA screen, which I should verify against the current IDSA cUTI guidance to align empiric choices and timing [^1137mL9p]. I will now examine severity explicitly, since the IDSA 2025 recommendations anchor empiric therapy to whether the patient is septic and the anticipated pathogens, with early broad coverage for sepsis and narrower choices for nonseptic cUTI or pyelonephritis, followed by rapid de-escalation once cultures return [^1136ebsk] [^1137mL9p].

> For nonsevere complicated UTI or pyelonephritis without sepsis, I should confirm that third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins or piperacillin-tazobactam are appropriate empiric options, reserving carbapenems for ESBL risk or documented resistance, which matches IDSA 2025 guidance favoring a four-step severity- and risk-based assessment before using last-line agents [^1136ebsk]. Let me verify oral step-down options once stable: TMP-SMX or amoxicillin-clavulanate can be reasonable if local susceptibility supports use, and second-generation oral cephalosporins may be used in select settings, recognizing these oral agents are less well studied for empiric cUTI but are acceptable for step-down with documented susceptibility [^1136ebsk]. Wait, I initially thought to avoid fluoroquinolones entirely, but hold on, I should correct that: fluoroquinolones may be considered if there is β-lactam anaphylaxis and local resistance is low, yet many European and stewardship recommendations discourage empiric use unless resistance is below 10% and specific criteria are met, so I need to check local antibiograms and patient exposures carefully [^1127QRf6] [^114umbrL]. I should confirm the patient-specific risk factors as well, including prior culture history, allergies, renal function, and drug interactions, and avoid empiric agents known to be inactive against previously isolated resistant uropathogens [^111xwYMR] [^1158sxbc].

> For patients with severe pyelonephritis or systemic features but not frank sepsis, I need to ensure early parenteral therapy with either a third-generation cephalosporin alone or combinations such as amoxicillin plus an aminoglycoside or a second-generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside, recognizing that local epidemiology and prior colonization guide whether to escalate to cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam for antipseudomonal coverage [^115RNX8k] [^117CU9Hp]. I should double-check that adding a single aminoglycoside dose up front can improve early bactericidal activity when resistance risk is elevated, while I monitor renal function closely to prevent toxicity, especially in older adults or those with baseline kidney disease [^115RNX8k].

> For urosepsis, I need to act within the first hour and administer high-dose parenteral broad-spectrum therapy, because delays worsen outcomes; piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime are reasonable initial anchors, with meropenem if ESBL risk is high, and I should add vancomycin if there is MRSA risk while planning to de-escalate rapidly with culture data [^117J5i6v] [^115EMcVZ]. Let me confirm that these steps align with EAU recommendations emphasizing immediate coverage followed by adaptation to culture results as soon as available to minimize unnecessary exposure while preserving efficacy [^115EMcVZ].

> I need to check source control, especially with catheters and obstruction, because antibiotics alone may not resolve infection. If an indwelling catheter has been in place longer than two weeks at symptom onset, I should replace it before obtaining the diagnostic urine sample and then remove it as soon as clinically feasible, maintaining a closed drainage system with the bag below bladder level to reduce reflux and contamination, and document daily necessity reviews [^116rxmtC] [^116gHYk5] [^117SVS32] [^116NSLdc]. Hold on, I should verify related practices: meatal cleansing protocols have not shown clear benefit, so I should prioritize aseptic insertion and maintaining a closed system rather than low-value routine cleansing [^112xjsr8] [^116hQAt1].

> Now, I will determine treatment duration, and I should avoid defaulting to prolonged courses when a shorter course will suffice. For nonseverely ill CAUTI, a five-day levofloxacin course can be considered when susceptible; for most patients with prompt symptom resolution, seven days is adequate, and for delayed response or persistent bacteremia, durations of 10–14 days are reasonable per IDSA 2010 guidance [^111SqEwW] [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV]. Let me reconsider pyelonephritis: seven days is sufficient when using a fluoroquinolone in nonsevere cases, whereas severe pyelonephritis or complications often require 10–14 days, with adjustments based on clinical response and source control, which aligns with contemporary practice patterns [^1136ebsk]. I should double-check special data in men: a randomized trial in afebrile men showed seven days of TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin was noninferior to 14 days for symptom resolution, supporting shorter courses when clinically appropriate [^1171F9GK].

> At 48–72 hours, I need to perform mandatory stewardship checkpoints. I should review culture and susceptibility results to de-escalate to the narrowest active agent, stop antibiotics entirely if criteria for ASB are met and no symptoms persist, and switch to oral therapy when the patient is hemodynamically stable and afebrile for 24–48 hours, because timely IV-to-PO conversion shortens length of stay without compromising outcomes [^116AgzG9] [^116RiYrc]. I will now examine biomarkers: procalcitonin-guided algorithms can safely reduce antibiotic exposure and help identify candidates for early discontinuation in sepsis or systemic UTI syndromes, though they should complement, not replace, clinical judgment [^112Axdyr] [^112VzpBs]. But wait, what if the team is still relying on legacy habits around fluoroquinolones? The FDA boxed warnings and subsequent stewardship efforts have reduced inpatient fluoroquinolone use substantially without adverse system-level outcomes, further reinforcing culture-driven narrowing away from FQs when alternatives exist [^117QuuGa].

> I should address special populations explicitly. In the critically ill with health care–associated UTI, broad versus narrow initial ED antibiotics did not independently change failure rates once illness severity was accounted for, underscoring that timely adequate coverage and source control matter more than maximal breadth, which I should verify against the observational data limitations while still prioritizing guideline-concordant empiric choices [^117DzMZP]. In older adults and those in long-term care, ASB is prevalent and diagnostic uncertainty is common; I must not treat altered mental status alone without localized urinary symptoms, and I need to apply strict diagnostic criteria to avoid harm from overuse, as inappropriate UTI treatment in LTCFs is frequent and risky [^116bp6GG] [^113kGXtE]. For infants under 60 days, treatment failure rates are low and not associated with longer IV durations, supporting careful consideration of IV duration and timely transition when stable; at pediatric discharge, narrowest effective oral regimens are often underused, highlighting a stewardship opportunity [^115q7x87] [^115fZRu5].

> Prevention is essential to reduce future CAUTIs and downstream antibiotic use. I should confirm implementation of aseptic insertion with sterile equipment, maintain closed drainage with the bag below bladder level, and use nurse-based or electronic reminders and stop-orders to limit unnecessary catheter days and prompt removal, backed by education and feedback on indications and adherence [^116hQAt1] [^117SVS32] [^11732Ydm] [^112Tdxtr] [^114yGBJH]. Hold on, I should verify governance elements too: require explicit physician orders and clear indications for catheter insertion, and align local prevention bundles with the multi-society SHEA/IDSA/APIC 2022 update for acute-care hospitals, adapting to local feasibility [^115xnbib] [^115G9G6d] [^1169qNxC].

> Let me synthesize the practical bedside algorithm to ensure nothing critical is missed. First, confirm symptoms and obtain a pre-antibiotic urinalysis and culture from a freshly replaced catheter or clean-catch; avoid interpreting pyuria alone as infection and do not treat ASB, particularly in high-ASB-prevalence settings like older inpatients and LTCFs [^116gHYk5] [^1112yxbn] [^116bp6GG]. Second, classify as cUTI, pyelonephritis, CAUTI, or urosepsis and assess severity using Sepsis-3 to guide empiric therapy escalation [^1137mL9p]. Third, start empiric therapy based on severity and risk: ceftriaxone for many stable inpatients, cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam if antipseudomonal coverage is needed, and immediate broad-spectrum therapy within one hour for sepsis, with vancomycin if MRSA risk and carbapenems reserved for ESBL risk, then de-escalate with cultures [^1136ebsk] [^117J5i6v]. Fourth, implement source control by replacing or removing catheters and ensuring unobstructed urinary drainage within the first day of care [^116rxmtC] [^116NSLdc]. Fifth, tailor duration to clinical response: five days for select nonsevere CAUTI with levofloxacin, seven days for prompt response, and 10–14 days for delayed response or severe pyelonephritis, with earlier IV-to-PO switch once stable [^111SqEwW] [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV] [^116AgzG9].

> I should also acknowledge diagnostic nuance that complicates binary UTI versus ASB frameworks. The proposed continuum of UTI categorizes presentations such as lower urinary tract symptoms without clear infection and bacteriuria of unclear significance, reminding me to pause before anchoring on UTI when alternative diagnoses may better explain symptoms, especially in hospitalized cohorts with high ASB prevalence [^116TBNh8]. Hmm, wait a minute, before assuming "equivocal symptoms plus low-count bacteriuria equals infection", I should re-examine the clinical picture, repeat a properly collected specimen if needed, and avoid defaulting to antibiotics unless the syndrome is convincing and supported by cultures [^116A5Pq6] [^116cdMGw].

> Finally, I should ensure alignment with local resistance data and changing stewardship norms. Fluoroquinolones should generally be avoided empirically unless strict criteria are met, especially if prior fluoroquinolone exposure occurred within six months or local resistance exceeds 10%, and their use has markedly declined following FDA boxed warnings without adverse system-wide signals, reinforcing a culture- and guideline-based approach to narrowing and duration minimization [^114umbrL] [^1127QRf6] [^117QuuGa]. With these checks, I can confidently apply a severity-driven, culture-confirmed, source-controlled, and duration-optimized pathway that reduces unnecessary exposure, resistance pressure, and length of stay while maintaining clinical safety [^1136ebsk] [^116AgzG9].

Inpatient UTI treatment requires **prompt empiric IV antibiotics** [^1136ebsk] tailored to local resistance [^115tHio8] and patient risk, with **early de-escalation** to narrow-spectrum agents once cultures are available [^115EMcVZ] [^115RNX8k]. For severe or septic cases, initiate broad-spectrum coverage (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, or cefepime plus aminoglycoside) **within the first hour** [^117J5i6v]. For stable patients without sepsis, use a third-generation cephalosporin or piperacillin-tazobactam [^115RNX8k]; avoid fluoroquinolones unless resistance is < 10% and no recent exposure [^1127QRf6]. Treat for 7–14 days based on response [^116EXLaV], **switch to oral therapy when stable** [^116AgzG9], and remove or replace catheters as indicated [^116rxmtC]. Monitor for clinical improvement, adverse effects, and complications [^1136ebsk], and apply stewardship [^111xwYMR] to minimize resistance and C. difficile risk [^113wmtYX].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, flank pain, fever, chills, or altered mental status, especially in elderly or catheterized patients [^113kGXtE].

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain urinalysis and urine culture before antibiotics [^1141TKM5]; in catheterized patients, collect from a freshly replaced catheter [^116gHYk5] or midstream voided specimen if the catheter is removed [^112qTX31].

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain in febrile, septic, or immunocompromised patients to detect bacteremia.

- **Imaging**: Use renal ultrasound or CT if obstruction, abscess, or structural abnormality is suspected.

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns** [^115tHio8], patient-specific factors [^111xwYMR], and severity of illness [^1137mL9p].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Severe illness or sepsis | - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Carbapenem (e.g. meropenem) <br/> - Cefepime plus aminoglycoside |
| Stable, non-septic patients | Third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) or piperacillin-tazobactam [^115RNX8k] [^1136ebsk] |
| Fluoroquinolone use | Avoid empiric fluoroquinolones unless resistance < 10% and no recent exposure [^1127QRf6] [^114umbrL] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

- **Uncomplicated pyelonephritis**: 7–10 days.

- **Complicated UTI or delayed response**: 10–14 days [^116EXLaV].

- **Catheter-associated UTI**: 7 days if prompt response; 10–14 days if delayed [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV].

- **Short-course therapy**: Consider 5-day levofloxacin in non-severely ill CA-UTI [^111SqEwW].

---

## Transition from intravenous to oral therapy

Transition to oral therapy is appropriate once the patient is **clinically stable**, defined as at least 24 hours afebrile, hemodynamic stability, and improving symptoms. Select oral agents based on susceptibilities — typically fluoroquinolones, TMP-SMX, or beta-lactams. An **early switch** shortens hospital stay and reduces costs [^116AgzG9].

---

## Management of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)

Management centers on catheter intervention and targeted antibiotics. Remove or replace **catheters** in place for more than two weeks at CA-UTI onset [^116rxmtC]. Base empiric therapy on local resistance and patient factors, and avoid fluoroquinolones [^114umbrL] when there has been recent use or resistance is high [^1127QRf6]. Treat for 7 days with a prompt response, or 10–14 days if the response is delayed [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include daily assessment of fever, symptoms, and hemodynamic status [^1136ebsk]. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, **repeat cultures**. Monitor for antibiotic adverse reactions, Clostridioides difficile infection, and emerging resistance [^113wmtYX].

---

## Special considerations

In immunocompromised patients, use **broader empiric coverage** with close monitoring [^1136ebsk]. In pregnancy, **avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides** and favor beta-lactams. In pediatric patients, tailor therapy to age, weight, and organism susceptibilities.

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Catheter management**: Limit use, maintain closed systems, and use aseptic technique [^117SVS32] [^116hQAt1] [^115G9G6d].

- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: Use narrow-spectrum agents and shortest effective duration [^1136ebsk] [^111xwYMR] [^113wmtYX].

- **Infection control**: Hand hygiene and standard precautions [^115G9G6d].

---

Inpatient UTI management centers on **timely empiric therapy** aligned with local resistance, rapid de-escalation, and appropriate duration, with catheter management and prevention strategies to reduce recurrence and resistance.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, specifically in relation to empiric antibiotics for community-acquired pyelonephritis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend administering a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone for the initial management of patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis. This should be based on a four-step assessment, rather than using carbapenems and newer agents such as novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides.

Recognize that other agents, such as TMP/SMX, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- or second-generation cephalosporins, are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of complicated UTI.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: A retrospective cohort study [^116bp6GG]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance poses one of the most urgent and widespread threats to public health and is driven by antibiotic use. Antibiotic use is highly prevalent in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). It is frequently justified among older residents due to their higher risk of infection, which is heightened by factors such as immunosuppression, malnutrition, dehydration, presence of multiple comorbidities, and functional impairment. Several other issues, such as diagnostic uncertainty, atypical and/or subtle presentations of common infections, and the frequency of colonization with antibiotic-resistant pathogens, also contribute to antibiotic use in this population. Approximately 10% of residents are on at least one antibiotic at any given time, and between 50% and 75% of residents receive an antibiotic over the course of a year. Up to 75% of antibiotic treatment in LTCFs may be inappropriate, putting already vulnerable residents at risk for unintended consequences, including selection for colonization or infection with resistant organisms and Clostridioides difficile, antibiotic allergies, and other adverse drug effects and drug toxicities.

The most common driver of antibiotic use and the reason for inappropriate antibiotic use in LTCFs is urinary tract infection (UTI). A study, which included one-day point prevalence surveys from nine nursing homes in four states, demonstrated that one in three antibiotics given to residents is for UTI, and at least half of these antibiotics are inappropriate with regards to drug choice, dose, or duration given. Other studies have shown similar issues in antibiotic management for UTIs in LTCFs.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: Meta-analysis [^113R4mk2]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter reduces the risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published before November 2012 identified through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library; conference abstracts for 2006–12 were also reviewed.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Studies were included if they examined antibiotic prophylaxis administered to prevent symptomatic urinary tract infection after removal of a short-term (≤ 14 days) urinary catheter.

- **Results**: Seven controlled studies had symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal as an endpoint; six were randomized controlled trials (five published and one in abstract form) and one was a non-randomized controlled intervention study. Five of these seven studies were in surgical patients. Studies were heterogeneous in the type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis and the period of observation. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with benefit to the patient, with an absolute reduction in risk of urinary tract infection of 5.8% between intervention and control groups. The risk ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.72). The number needed to treat to prevent one urinary tract infection was 17 (12 to 30).

- **Conclusions**: Patients admitted to hospital who undergo short-term urinary catheterization might benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis when the catheter is removed, as they experience fewer subsequent urinary tract infections.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^115tHio8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance limits antibiotic options for outpatient treatment of UTIs and renders antibiotic treatment less effective. As repeated UTIs are a major cause of antibiotic resistance, a better understanding of uropathogens responsible for recurrence is needed. Importantly, given that antibiotic therapy for UTI is empiric and uropathogens increasingly demonstrate nonsusceptibility, continuously updated data on susceptibility patterns are critical to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing as well as to inform interventions to prevent UTI recurrence. As the degree of resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for UTI evolves over time and may vary by region, it is also important to continuously monitor the local prevalence of uropathogens and their susceptibility to guide appropriate antibiotic use.

### Proposing the "continuum of UTI" for a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections [^116TBNh8]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Patients with suspected UTIs are typically categorized into three clinical phenotypes based on guidelines: no UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), or UTI. However, not all patients fit neatly into these groups. The objective was to characterize clinical presentations of patients undergoing urine tests using the "continuum of UTI" approach.

This retrospective cohort study analyzed a random sample of adult noncatheterized inpatient and emergency department encounters with paired urinalysis and urine cultures from five hospitals in three states between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Trained abstractors collected clinical (e.g. symptoms) and demographic data. A focus group discussion with multidisciplinary experts defined the continuum of UTI, a 5-level classification scheme that includes two new categories: lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms and bacteriuria of unclear significance. The newly defined continuum of UTI categories was compared to the traditional UTI classification scheme.

Of 220,531 encounters, 3,392 randomly selected encounters were reviewed. Based on the classification scheme, 32.1% (n = 704) had ASB, and 53% (n = 1,614) did not have a UTI. When applying the continuum of UTI categories, 68% (n = 478) of patients with ASB were reclassified as bacteriuria of unclear significance, and 29% (n = 467) of patients with "no UTI" were reclassified to lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms.

The data suggest the need to reframe our conceptual model of UTI vs. ASB to reflect this broader understanding of urinary presentations.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^113kGXtE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

### Critically ill health care-associated urinary tract infection: Broad vs. narrow antibiotics in the emergency department have similar outcomes [^117DzMZP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common infection requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission in emergency department (ED) patients. Optimal empiric management for health care-associated (HCA) UTI is unclear, particularly in the critically ill.

- **Objective**: To compare clinical failure of broad vs. narrow antibiotic selection in the ED for patients presenting with HCA UTI admitted to the ICU.

- **Methods**: Observational cohort of patients started on empiric antibiotic for UTI with at least one HCA risk factor (reUTI, chronic urinary catheter or dialysis, urologic procedures, previous antibiotic exposure, hospitalization, or group facility residence). Broad antibiotics covered Pseudomonas spp. and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Clinical failure was a composite of multiorgan dysfunction (MODS) by day 2 and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), readmission, reinfection, development of multidrug-resistant organisms, and Clostridium difficile infection. Associations were reported with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: There were 272 patients included; 196 (72.1%) received broad and 76 (27.9%) received narrow therapy. There was no association between antibiotic selection and clinical failure (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.5–2.25, p = 0.89) or between antibiotic selection and the number of HCA risk factors (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.73–1.31, p = 0.87).

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants < 60 days of age [^115q7x87]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in infants younger than 60 days, and the optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy upon UTI diagnosis in this cohort is unknown. We determined whether there was an association between IV antibiotic therapy duration (long [> 3 days] vs. short [≤ 3 days]) and treatment failure via a retrospective review of infants with confirmed UTIs receiving IV antibiotics at a tertiary referral center.

A total of 403 infants were included; 39% were treated with ampicillin and cefotaxime, and 34% with ampicillin and gentamycin or tobramycin. The median IV antibiotic duration was 5 (interquartile range: 3–10) days, and 5% of patients experienced treatment failure. The treatment failure rate was similar in both short- and long-course IV antibiotic groups (P > .05), and there was no significant association between treatment duration and failure.

We conclude that treatment failure for infants hospitalized with UTI is uncommon and not associated with IV antibiotic duration.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1169qNxC]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Low credibility.

This document was developed following the process outlined in the Handbook for SHEA-Sponsored Guidelines and Expert Guidance Documents. No guideline or expert guidance document can anticipate all clinical situations, and this document is not meant to be a substitute for individual clinical judgment by qualified professionals. This document focuses on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in acute-care hospitals. The strategies highlighted may or may not be applicable for other healthcare settings, such as ambulatory settings or long-term or postacute-care facilities. Furthermore, there may be differences in healthcare environments within the hospital (e.g. acute-care wards vs. intensive care units vs. perioperative spaces) that may affect the feasibility of specific recommendations, which should be considered by stakeholders implementing these strategies.

This document is based on a synthesis of evidence, theoretical rationale, practices, practical considerations, writing group consensus, and consideration of potential harm, where applicable. A summary of the recommendations is provided in Table 1.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analyzed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^112Axdyr]. BMC Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use and hospitalizations. In the United States, almost 10 million outpatients are diagnosed with UTIs each year, and UTIs account for 16% of all infectious disease-related hospitalizations and 6% of all infectious disease-related deaths. Despite various prevention strategies, recurrent UTIs are very common.

Any reduction of antibiotic exposure is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side effects. Guidelines for antibiotic treatment duration of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis largely reflect expert opinion, as only a few intervention studies compared different durations. Most studies in this regard were performed to establish short-term therapy in uncomplicated simple UTIs. The minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy is being challenged by the emerging antibiotic resistance of uropathogens and the ecological effects of antibiotics, especially in the elderly, in whom UTIs are often overdiagnosed and therefore overtreated. The use of biomarkers might improve the management of patients with UTIs.

The biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) was established for antibiotic stewardship in respiratory tract infections and sepsis. As an indicator for systemic infections, it showed high prognostic value to predict bacteremia in patients with urosepsis. In the PRORATA trial, which documented a safe reduction of antibiotic usage through a PCT-guided strategy in patients with sepsis, UTIs were the source of infection in 7% of patients.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^117EvPBG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Overtesting for UTIs is leading to overtreatment in asymptomatic patients. The presence of urinary symptoms occurring with a positive culture, in the absence of vaginal symptoms, are key features of appropriate UTI diagnosis. However, our data showed that of the patients in the ER who were diagnosed with a UTI, only 28% had symptoms consistent with UTI. This aligns well with previous studies examining rates of cystitis symptoms in those diagnosed with a UTI in the ER. In addition to being more likely to be tested for a UTI, patients treated in the ER were also more likely to receive antibiotics for a UTI than patients who sought care in an outpatient setting (ER: 95%, 189/209 vs. Office: 55%, 390/740).

While it might be hypothesized that ER patients would have a more severe presentation or be more frail, our data showed that ER patients tended to be younger overall with similar clinical features, including similar rates of urinary symptoms, vaginal symptoms, and culture positivity. Together, these findings may indicate that over-testing of patients in the ER for UTI is driving much of the inappropriate treatment of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and culture-negative subjects with nonspecific symptoms.

Urinary testing should be reserved for patients with symptoms consistent with a UTI. It is important to note that more than half of urine cultures for both patients evaluated in the ER and outpatient-based clinics were negative. In most of the encounters in which culture-negative patients were treated with antimicrobials for UTI, the rationale to provide antibiotics was either poorly justified or not documented, leading to questions about the appropriateness of such practices.

### Appropriate antibiotic use for patients with urinary tract infections reduces length of hospital stay [^116AgzG9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

To define appropriate antibiotic use for patients with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), we developed in a previous study a key set of four valid, guideline-based quality indicators (QIs). In the study, we evaluated the association between appropriate antibiotic use for patients with a complicated UTI, as defined by these QIs, and length of hospital stay (LOS).

- **Methods**: A retrospective, observational multicenter study included 1,252 patients with a complicated UTI, hospitalized at internal medicine and urology departments of 19 university and non-university Dutch hospitals. Data from the patients' medical charts were used to calculate QI performance scores. Multilevel mixed-model analyses were performed to relate LOS to QI performance (appropriate use or not). We controlled for the potential confounders sex, age, (urological) comorbidity, febrile UTI, and intensive care unit admission < 24 hours.

- **Results**: Prescribing therapy in accordance with local hospital guidelines was associated with a shorter LOS (7.3 days vs 8.7 days; p = 0.02), as was early intravenous-oral switching (4.8 days vs 9.1 days; P < .001). There was an inverse relationship between the proportion of appropriate use in a patient (QI sum score/number of applicable QIs) and LOS (9.3 days for lower tertile vs 7.2 days for upper tertile; overall P < .05).

- **Conclusions**: Appropriate antibiotic use in patients with a complicated UTI seems to reduce length of hospital stay and therefore favors patient outcome and healthcare costs.

### Improving antibiotic prescribing for children with urinary tract infection in emergency and urgent care settings [^1161TjC9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Children with urinary tract infection (UTI) are often diagnosed in emergency and urgent care settings and increasingly are unnecessarily treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This study evaluated the effect of a quality improvement intervention on empiric antibiotic prescribing for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in children.

- **Methods**: A local clinical pathway for uncomplicated UTI, introduced in June 2010, recommended empiric treatment with cephalexin, a narrow-spectrum (first-generation) cephalosporin antibiotic. A retrospective quasi-experimental study of pediatric patients older than 1 month presenting to emergency and urgent care settings from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, with uncomplicated UTI was conducted. Hospitalized patients and those with chronic conditions or urogenital abnormalities were excluded. Control charts and interrupted time-series analysis were used to analyze the primary outcome of narrow-spectrum antibiotic prescribing rates and the balancing measures of 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, and subsequent inpatient admissions for UTI.

- **Results**: A total of 2134 patients were included. There was an immediate and sustained significant increase in cephalexin prescribing before (19.2%) versus after (79.6%) pathway implementation and a corresponding decline in oral third-generation cephalosporin (cefixime) prescribing from 50.3% to 4.0%. There was no significant increase in 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, or inpatient admissions for UTI.

- **Conclusions**: A clinical pathway produced a significant improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices without increasing adverse outcomes.

### Antibiotic use in hospital urinary tract infections after FDA regulation [^117QuuGa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The FDA issued a "black box" warning regarding the risks of fluoroquinolones in 2008, with updates in 2011, 2013, and 2016.

- **Objective**: To examine antimicrobial use in hospital-treated UTIs from 2000 to 2020.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study with interrupted time series analysis.

- **Participants**: Patient encounters with a diagnosis of UTI from January 2000 to March 2020, excluding diagnoses of renal abscess, chronic cystitis, and infection of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or prostate.

- **Main measures**: Monthly use of fluoroquinolone and non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics were assessed. Fluoroquinolone resistance was assessed in available cultures. Interrupted time series analysis examined level and trend changes of antimicrobial use with each FDA label change.

- **Key results**: A total of 9,950,790 patient encounters were included. From July 2008 to March 2020, fluoroquinolone use declined from 61.7% to 11.7%, with similar negative trends observed in inpatients and outpatients, age ≥ 60 and < 60 years, males and females, patients with and without pyelonephritis, and across physician specialties. Ceftriaxone use increased from 26.4% of encounters in July 2008 to 63.6% of encounters in March 2020. Among encounters with available culture data, fluoroquinolone resistance declined by 28.9% from 2009 to 2020. On interrupted time series analysis, the July 2008 FDA warning was associated with a trend change (-0.32%, p < 0.001) and level change (-5.02%, p < 0.001) in monthly fluoroquinolone use.

- **Conclusions**: During this era of "black box" warnings, there was a decline in fluoroquinolone use.

### CDC grand rounds: Getting smart about antibiotics [^113wmtYX]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Inappropriate antibiotic use is not limited to the outpatient setting. A recent evaluation of prescribing for inpatients in two specific scenarios — urinary tract infections in patients without indwelling catheters and treatment with intravenous vancomycin — identified that antibiotic use could have been improved in 37% of cases. The frequency of antibiotic prescribing among inpatients varies considerably among hospitals. A recent study of 19 hospitals that had completed data validation and submitted antibiotic use data from one or more patient care settings found threefold differences in usage rates among 26 medical/surgical wards.

Visits for acute respiratory tract infections lead to more inappropriate antibiotic prescribing than visits for any other group of diagnoses. For example, antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated bronchitis is not recommended. Despite decades-long, widespread efforts to curb antibiotic prescribing, in 2010, 71% of all outpatient visits for this condition resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Similarly, overprescribing for pharyngitis is common. Only 5%–10% of pharyngitis cases among adults are caused by group A Streptococcus, for which antibiotic treatment is recommended; yet, antibiotics are prescribed for approximately 60% of ambulatory care visits for adult pharyngitis. Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for children with acute respiratory tract infections has been decreasing since the mid-to-late 1990s, but the rate of decline has slowed and might have reached a plateau. Several factors have been hypothesized to have contributed to this.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: A randomized controlled trial [^112VzpBs]. BMC Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use. The minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy for UTIs is unknown, but any reduction is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an algorithm based on procalcitonin (PCT) and quantitative pyuria reduces antibiotic exposure.

From April 2012 to March 2014, we conducted a factorial design randomized controlled open-label trial. Immunocompetent adults with community-acquired non-catheter-related UTI were enrolled in the emergency department of a tertiary-care 600-bed hospital in northwestern Switzerland. Clinical presentation was used to guide the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy according to guidelines (control group) or with a PCT-pyuria-based algorithm (PCT-pyuria group).

The primary endpoint was overall antibiotic exposure within 90 days. Secondary endpoints included duration of the initial antibiotic therapy, persistent infection 7 days after the end of therapy and 30 days after enrollment, recurrence, and rehospitalizations within 90 days.

Overall, 394 patients were screened; 228 met predefined exclusion criteria, 30 declined to participate, and 11 were not eligible. Of these, 125 (76% women) were enrolled in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and 96 patients with microbiologically confirmed UTI constituted the per-protocol group. Among the participants, 84 of 125 (67%) patients had a febrile UTI, 28 (22%) had bacteremia, 5 (4%) died, and 3 (2%) were lost to follow-up.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments, discouraging the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. The US Food and Drug Administration has released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade due to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have had high rates of guideline-discordant treatment, with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to assess the concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women. It also sought to identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

- **Study design**: A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, aged 18 to 75 years, were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities, ensuring alignment with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in hospitalized older people [^1131y89g]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

To compare the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection (UTI) in hospitalized older people with clinical criteria and therapeutic guidelines, a retrospective case series of emergency hospital admissions was collected over an 18-month period at an acute general hospital in northwest England.

Participants included 265 patients aged 75 and older with a diagnosis of UTI at hospital discharge. Data relating to age, sex, presenting complaint, admission and discharge destinations, background comorbidities and medications, investigations performed, treatment given, length of stay, and complications were obtained using chart review.

The results indicated that of the 265 patients (mean age 85.4), overdiagnosis of UTI was common, with 43.4% of patients not meeting criteria. Only 32.1% of patients overall had any urinary tract symptoms (48.7% in the UTI group). Of the non-UTI group, 12 (10.4%) had urinary tract symptoms with a negative urine culture, 43 (37.4%) had asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), and 60 (52.2%) had neither urinary tract symptoms nor bacteriuria. Treatment given varied greatly. The mortality rate was 6.0%, and the average length of stay was 29.9 days (median 17.0, range 1–192). Complications were frequent, including Clostridium difficile diarrhea (8%), falls (4%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (3%), and fracture (2%).

More-reliable criteria are needed to aid the diagnosis of UTI in hospitalized older people. Better adherence to clinical management guidelines may improve outcomes.

### Impact of laboratory-reported urine culture colony counts on the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection for hospitalized patients [^116A5Pq6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Reducing health care-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs) is a National Patient Safety Goal. The purpose of this investigation was to establish a colony count threshold to predict clinically significant UTIs that develop in hospitalized patients. A total of 185 cases were reviewed sequentially by two physicians.

The information extracted included subjective complaints, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, clinical signs and symptoms, WBC count, urinalysis, and urine culture results. The first reviewer recorded whether the patient was diagnosed and treated for a UTI by the clinician, while the second reviewer determined if the patient met National Healthcare Safety Network guidelines for nosocomial UTIs.

Compared with patients with colony counts less than 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), patients with colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or more were 73.86 times more likely to have a clinically significant UTI (odds ratio, 73.86; 95% confidence interval, 24.23 ∼ 225.15; P < .0001; c-statistic, 0.859). Reporting positive results only for patients with 100,000 CFU/mL or more would have reduced the number of positive cultures by 38%.

These data suggest that reporting colony counts less than 100,000 CFU/mL encourages treatment of non-clinically significant UTIs in hospitalized patients, causing inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices.

Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalized patients [^115QNZYr]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with antibiotics is a common factor in inappropriate antibiotic use, but risk factors and outcomes associated with the treatment of ASB in hospitalized patients are not well defined. This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with the treatment of ASB among hospitalized patients and the possible association between treatment and clinical outcomes.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, through February 1, 2018, at 46 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. A total of 2733 hospitalized medical patients with ASB, defined as a positive urine culture without any documented signs or symptoms attributable to a urinary tract infection, were included in the analysis.

- **Exposures**: One or more antibiotic doses for the treatment of ASB.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Estimators of antibiotic treatment of ASB. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day emergency department visit, discharge to post-acute care settings, Clostridioides difficile infection (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) at 30 days, and duration of hospitalization after urine testing.

Of 2733 patients with ASB, 2138 were women (78.2%), with a median age of 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 66–86 years). A total of 2259 patients (82.7%) were treated with antibiotics for a median of 7 days (IQR, 4–9 days). Factors associated with ASB treatment included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18) and dementia.

Use the Sepsis-3 definition, which defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Identify patients by an increase in the SOFA score of ≥ 2 points, indicating an in-hospital mortality risk greater than 10%, or presumptively identify using screening tools such as qSOFA or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

### A comparison of inpatient versus outpatient resistance patterns of pediatric urinary tract infection [^1164Tin1]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Prior single-center studies have shown that antibiotic resistance patterns differ between outpatients and inpatients. We compared antibiotic resistance patterns for urinary tract infections between outpatients and inpatients on a national level.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined outpatient and inpatient urinary isolates from children younger than 18 years using The Surveillance Network (Eurofins Scientific, Luxembourg), a database of antibiotic susceptibility results, as well as patient demographic data from 195 American hospitals. We determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of the six most common uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus. Differences in uropathogen prevalence and resistance patterns for outpatient and inpatient isolates were compared using chi-square analysis.

- **Results**: We identified 25,418 outpatient (86% female) and 5,560 inpatient (63% female) urinary isolates. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen overall, but its prevalence varied by gender and visit setting: 79% of uropathogens overall for outpatient isolates, including 83% of females and 50% of males, compared to 54% for overall inpatient isolates, including 64% of females and 37% of males (p < 0.001). Uropathogen resistance to many antibiotics was lower in the outpatient setting compared to the inpatient setting, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 24% vs. 30% and cephalothin at 16% vs. 22% for E. coli (each p < 0.001), as well as cephalothin at 7% vs. 14% for Klebsiella (p = 0.03).

### Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112Vuejg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections encountered and treated in outpatients. A set of guidelines published in 1999 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line therapy.

- **Methods**: We undertook a study of cross-sectional data describing the use of ambulatory medical services in the United States by women aged 18 years or older who had uncomplicated UTI. Data from 1996 to 2001 were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to: (1) examine the prescribing practices for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI and (2) determine whether these practices were influenced by the recommendation in the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The major outcome measurement was to evaluate whether antibacterial selection was influenced by the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Data were analyzed by year, treatment in private offices vs. hospital clinics, race, geographical location, the specialty of the prescribing health care provider, and the payment method of the patient.

- **Results**: We identified 2,339 cases of uncomplicated UTI. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin were the most commonly prescribed drugs. Despite the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not change significantly (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–1.30; p = 0.53), whereas the use of ciprofloxacin increased significantly (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval not provided; P-value not given completely in the excerpt).

### Importance of urinary tract infection to antibiotic use among hospitalized patients [^116CrwHV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria receive extended courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic use was analyzed in patients admitted to the hospital with a urinary tract infection. Strategies to optimize antibiotic use for such patients are discussed, including implementing a process whereby a urine culture is automatically performed if a urinalysis result suggests infection.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^116cdMGw]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Urinary dipsticks are often used to guide the need for urine cultures and empirical antibiotics in patients with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are a leading cause of antibiotic treatment. Guidelines by Public Health England as well as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence do not recommend dipsticks for diagnosing UTI, except in females below 65 years of age with mild to moderate symptoms. This is consistent with previous studies that found dipsticks moderately effective for ruling out UTI using clean midstream urine samples in premenopausal women outside a hospital setting, whereas their diagnostic accuracy among inpatients remains uncertain.

Nonetheless, the clinical use of dipsticks has expanded to rule in UTI in other patient groups, including elderly and hospitalised individuals with suspected UTI, severe infection, or an unclear clinical presentation. Importantly, urine is rarely obtained as clean midstream samples in these patient populations, and the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is high, ranging from 15% to 50%. This may lead to incorrect antibiotic treatment with associated risks of side effects and toxicity, Clostridioides difficile enterocolitis, and antibiotic resistance. Equally important is the potential delay in time to correct diagnosis attributable to a fixation on an erroneous assumption of UTI, especially in elderly frail patients.

This study aimed to examine the added diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks to a symptom-driven approach at admission and associated management among acute inpatients at all stages.

### Antibiotic utilization and symptom improvement in a retrospective cohort of women with urinary tract infection symptoms [^111s6SGX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in women. We hypothesized that over half of those treated empirically would receive inappropriate antibiotics, those treated expectantly would have lower symptom improvement without antibiotics, and that overall progression to sequelae would be uncommon.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study of women with UTI symptoms, we quantified the proportion who received inappropriate antibiotics in those treated empirically. This was defined as those with a negative urine culture or antibiotics that were changed according to culture sensitivities. We also identified factors associated with symptom improvement during expectant management. Secondarily, we sought to determine the proportion of UTI sequelae in both groups. During the study time frame, a modified UTI Symptom Assessment (UTISA) questionnaire was administered at baseline and again, with a global rating for change instrument, when urine culture results were relayed.

- **Results**: Analyses included 152 women, with a mean age of 66.5 (SD 15.0) years. In the study, 30 (20%) received empiric antibiotics, and 122 (80%) underwent expectant management. At baseline, the empiric group reported greater mean scores for dysuria (p < 0.01), urgency (p < 0.01), frequency (p < 0.01), and incomplete emptying (p < 0.01). Positive culture results were reported for 16 (53%) in the empiric group and 72 (59%) in the expectant group. Inappropriate antibiotics were prescribed to 18 (60%) of the empiric group. A negative urine culture was associated with improvement in symptoms in the expectant management group.

Regarding screening and diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-UTI in patients with:

- **Indwelling device**: An indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterization.

- **Symptoms or signs**: Presence of symptoms or signs compatible with a urinary tract infection (UTI), with no other identified focus of infection.

- **Bacterial growth**: Growth of ≥ 10³ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen, or in a midstream voided urine specimen from a patient whose urethral, suprapubic, or condom catheter has been removed within the previous 48 hours.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^113AAffU]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Our data continue to support evidence that urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms, demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over-testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment, such as antibiotic resistance, reinfections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to, and understanding of, UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: A randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

The objective of the study was to determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial was conducted involving afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTIs at two US Veterans Affairs medical centers. The enrollment took place from April 2014 through December 2019, with the final follow-up on January 28, 2020. Out of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days and were randomized to receive either continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The prespecified primary outcome was the resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after the completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population, consisting of participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses, was used for the primary analysis. A secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included the recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping the study medication.

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years), the results showed…

### A decision algorithm to promote outpatient antimicrobial stewardship for uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^111RMPhH]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a major cause of treatment failure and leads to increased use of broad-spectrum agents, exacerbating resistance. This cycle is epitomized by uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI), which affect one in two women during their lifetime and are associated with increasing antibiotic resistance and high prescription rates for broad-spectrum, second-line agents. To address this issue, we developed machine learning models to predict antibiotic susceptibility using electronic health record data and created a decision algorithm to recommend the narrowest possible antibiotic to which a specimen is susceptible.

When applied to a test cohort of 3,629 patients presenting between 2014 and 2016, the algorithm achieved a 67% reduction in the use of second-line antibiotics relative to clinicians. It also reduced inappropriate antibiotic therapy — defined as the selection of a treatment to which a specimen is resistant — by 18% compared to clinicians. For specimens where clinicians selected a second-line drug but the algorithm recommended a first-line drug, 92% (1,066 of 1,157) of decisions were susceptible to the first-line drug. Conversely, when clinicians chose an inappropriate first-line drug, the algorithm selected an appropriate first-line drug 47% (183 of 392) of the time.

Our machine learning decision algorithm enhances antibiotic stewardship for a common infectious syndrome by maximizing reductions in broad-spectrum antibiotic use while maintaining optimal treatment outcomes. Further work is necessary to improve generalizability by training models in more diverse settings.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^116DjuoS]. Neurourology and urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

- **Materials & methods**: All consecutive patients bearing an isolated diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis within a single healthcare system during July 2019 were identified by the ICD‐10 diagnostic code (Appendix SA). The healthcare system utilized was a large tertiary medical center in a major metropolitan city with high patient volumes. July 2019 was selected to avoid any alterations in treatment delivery resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Patients demonstrating clinical signs or hemodynamic features of bacteremia, positive blood cultures, medical comorbidities associated with complicated UTI, such as indwelling catheter, recent urologic surgery, pregnancy, immunodeficiency, or transplant, or those admitted for inpatient care were excluded. This resulted in a cohort of 909 patients.

- **Data collection**: Manual chart review was utilized to extract demographic data (e.g. age, gender), clinical data (e.g. symptoms), and microbial data (e.g. features of microscopic urinalysis, urine microbiological testing) from patients who met inclusion criteria. We also catalogued antibiotic treatments used, alternative diagnoses explored, and urine culture and susceptibility results. Symptoms were designated as "acute" if arising 28 days before presentation. The presence of "UTI symptoms", specified by the American Urological Association and expert consensus, was defined as either dysuria or hematuria with at least one additional urinary symptom, including urinary urgency, urinary frequency, worsening incontinence, or suprapubic pressure.

### Optimal antibiotics at hospital discharge for children with urinary tract infection [^115fZRu5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship at hospital discharge is an area of need. We assessed the rate of optimal antibiotic prescriptions at hospital discharge based on urine culture and susceptibility data for children diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI).

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study of patients ≤ 18 years of age who were admitted to a general pediatrics service at a freestanding children's hospital during 2017 with a diagnosis of UTI and received an antibiotic prescription at discharge. For the primary analysis, optimal antibiotic at hospital discharge was determined by evaluating if the cultured urinary pathogen was susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic and if the antibiotic was the narrowest-spectrum option available. Secondary objectives included assessment of antibiotic dosing accuracy and description of antibiotic treatment duration.

- **Results**: A total of 78 cases were included. Sixty-eight (83%) cases were caused by cefazolin-susceptible Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Thirty-one (40%) cases had a discharge antibiotic prescription that was determined to be optimal. Of the 47 (60%) cases that were suboptimal, 44 (94%) were considered to be excessively broad-spectrum. In 3 (6%) cases, the causative organism was non-susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic. Ten (13%) discharge antibiotic prescriptions had inaccurate dosing and/or frequency.

- **Conclusions**: Missed opportunities for narrow-spectrum antibiotic selection at hospital discharge for pediatric UTIs frequently occurred. In particular, higher-generation cephalosporins and commonβ-lactamase-producing organisms were identified.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and globally. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to UTI management may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments. Prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTIs may be inappropriate, contributing to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomatology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture-proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women, to 16% in older women in the community, and as high as 50% for older women in long-term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to clinical guidelines.

### The epidemiology of urinary tract infection [^113KDEcE]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired in the community and in hospitals. In individuals without anatomical or functional abnormalities, UTIs are generally self-limiting but have a propensity to recur. Uropathogens possess specialized characteristics, such as the production of adhesins, siderophores, and toxins that enable them to colonize and invade the urinary tract. These pathogens are transmitted between individuals both through person-to-person contact and possibly via food or water.

Although generally self-limiting, the treatment of UTIs with antibiotics leads to a more rapid resolution of symptoms and is more likely to clear bacteriuria. However, it also selects for resistant uropathogens and commensal bacteria, adversely affecting the gut and vaginal microbiota. As uropathogens are increasingly becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, it may be time to explore alternative strategies for managing UTI.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: Meta-analysis [^113zMkff]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter reduces the risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published before November 2012 were identified through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library; conference abstracts for 2006–2012 were also reviewed.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Studies were included if they examined antibiotic prophylaxis administered to prevent symptomatic urinary tract infection after removal of a short-term (≤ 14 days) urinary catheter.

- **Results**: Seven controlled studies had symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal as an endpoint; six were randomized controlled trials (five published; one in abstract form) and one was a non-randomized controlled intervention study. Five of these seven studies were in surgical patients. Studies were heterogeneous in the type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis and the period of observation. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with benefit to the patient, with an absolute reduction in risk of urinary tract infection of 5.8% between intervention and control groups. The risk ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.72). The number needed to treat to prevent one urinary tract infection was 17 (12 to 30).

- **Conclusions**: Patients admitted to hospital who undergo short-term urinary catheterization might benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis when the catheter is removed, as they experience fewer subsequent urinary tract infections. Potential disadvantages of more widespread prophylaxis use were not detailed.
